      <P>This information is not available in my Department, and I have ascertained by inquiry from the British Government that, in order to give a complete answer to the question, it would be necessary, as regards the majority of the classes of pensions paid by that Government, to examine every payment made to every pensioner during the four years in question, as no separate record is kept of payments made to pensioners resident in the Saorstát.  I regret, therefore, that I cannot furnish or obtain for the Deputy the information sought.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will state the reasons for refusing to pay unemployment insurance benefit to John Coffey, Roseberry, Droichead <Col N="1181" /> Nua, Co. Kildare, Serial No. 1846, who lodged a claim on the 12th March, 1928, and only received the sum of 7s. 4d. on the 20th April, although he has a considerable number of stamps to his credit; whether Mr. Coffey, with about 50 other men who were sinking holes for electric standards on the Shannon Scheme, in the neighbourhood of Ballyfin, Leix, refused to take on piece-work sinking those holes, but did not strike work; whether they told the manager in charge that they could not earn a week's wages (38s. 3d., at 8½d. per hour, of 54 hours) at the prices offered; whether five men, with a similar number of stamps on their cards, who were working with Mr. Coffey, received the full benefit due to them; and whether he will expedite full payment to Mr. Coffey.</P>

      <P>Unemployment benefit was allowed on the claim of John Coffey, of Roseberry, Droichead Nua. Part of this benefit has already been paid, and the balance will be paid to-morrow.  There was some delay in paying benefit on the claim owing to the necessity for investigating the circumstances in which the claimant's last employment had terminated, and also to the circumstances that, his benefit year having expired on the 20th March, it was necessary for him to make a fresh claim in order to commence another benefit year before payment of benefit could be resumed.</P>

      <P>The full amount of the Vote for the financial year is £2,425,555 representing a decrease on last year's Vote of £54.370.  Net revenue is estimated at £1,755,560, showing a nominal deficit of £669,995 to be provided by the Exchequer.  This compares with a deficit of £730,935 in the Estimates of receipts and expenditure of the past financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be understood, however, that the Post Office Estimates, Appropriation Accounts and the figures appearing in the Finance Accounts of the Saorstát do not represent and are not intended to represent the true financial results of the Post Office operations for the year, although it is possible they will be quoted as if they do by the uninformed.  They are simply cash statements, and consequently ignore many items that would be taken into account by a commercial concern. The expenditure of other Government <Col N="1186" /> Departments on our behalf, such as the Office of Public Works and the Stationery Office is excluded, and credit is not taken for the numerous services rendered without payment by the Post Office for other Government Departments.  A detailed list of such services is given in Appendix E of the Estimates.  The correct result of the financial transactions of the Post Office can only be judged from the Commercial Accounts which are published annually after audit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  An examination of the Commercial Accounts from the time of the change of Government should be of interest to Deputies and to the public generally if a true realisation of the financial position of the Post Office is desired. Such an examination will show that a deficit of £1,108,260 in the financial year 1922-23 has been reduced from year to year as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The years 1922-25 were in certain respects abnormal.  Owing to the disturbed conditions existing in the country Post Office business suffered somewhat, and it is probable that the revenue received was considerably less than it would have been had the country been free from internal trouble during that time.  Within that period also was carried out an elaborate scheme of retrenchment, reorganisation and curtailment of services, which resulted in a very considerable saving in expenditure. But economies without material reduction in public services are no longer possible, and for normal savings carried out by a constant watch over expenditure and organisation within the Department it would be well to examine the accounts from April, 1925. It will be observed that a saving of £142,974 will, it is expected, be effected at the end of the present financial year. Portion of this saving is due to a drop in the cost of living figures, with corresponding results on the total of <Col N="1187" /> salaries and wages, but a considerable proportion is due to the efforts made within the Department to secure that the utmost economy is obtained commensurate with an efficient service to the public.</P>
    <P>The Post Office is concerned in the provision of three main services&mdash; postal, telegraph and telephone.  The postal, which is the parent service, is the most important of the three. It has not been affected by the speedier service of the telegraph, and the telephone service may be regarded rather as an auxiliary than a competitor.  The postal service allows of frequent, constant and cheap communication between all members of the community, and its utility does not appear to be lessened by the competition of the quicker but more expensive methods of communication.  At present the postal service yields about 75 per cent. of the total revenue earned.  The earlier heavy loss is being constantly reduced, and the revenue is increasing, slowly, perhaps, but steadily.  The loss on postal services in 1922-23 was £656,200.  In 1924-25 it was £290,000, and it is estimated at the end of the present year to be reduced to £102,500. An analysis of the financial results of the operations of the various services performed by the Post Office may be of interest.  The figures must be taken with a certain amount of reserve and as being only fairly reliable approximations. Our services are so interwoven and entwined that it would be impossible to arrive at an apportionment which might be regarded as absolutely reliable.  The results are for the year 1926-27:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement is rather lengthy and I am afraid that I have been inclined to take it rather too quickly.  It will be seen that letter mail matter yields a profit while the other services are conducted at a loss.  This is not unusual and corresponds roughly to the postal situation in Great Britain. It will be observed that the cheaper lines of postal business are conducted at a loss, and may be regarded as being subsidised by the letter service.  They, however, serve a useful purpose to the community and may justifiably be regarded as auxiliary and ancillary to the main service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenditure of the telegraph service has been reduced, but revenue is steadily falling.  The loss for the present year is estimated at £167,500 as against £406,000 in the year 1922-23 and £178,500 for the year 1924-25.  The telegraphs which are gradually yielding to the telephones may be regarded as being in a transitional and declining stage.  It may be taken, however, that although a declining service it is not a dying service, and will remain essential to the comfort and welfare of certain members of the community.  Owing to the necessity for maintaining our lines in good working order and the impossibility of reducing staff in exact proportion to the declining revenue our unit loss on telegraphs may possibly be greater as traffic decreases.  On the other hand, a traffic increase, while decreasing the unit loss, might possibly increase the gross loss.  It may be of interest to note that the telegraph has never been a paying branch of the Post Office service.  In Great Britain at the time when the sixpenny rate was introduced in 1885 the telegraph service was being run at a loss, and the increased traffic of twenty million telegrams per annum did not suffice to balance the increased deficit due to the lower rate. It must be borne in mind that operating expenses have increased at a greater proportion than charges.  As an instance, in 1885 the average pay of a telegraphist was round 6d. per hour. It is now about 1/6.  Modern inventions <Col N="1189" /> for facilitating transmission and reception have to an extent counterbalanced the increase.  Conditions in the Saorstát do not, however, lend themselves to the fullest exploitation of the most modern methods.  Telephone competition has extracted from the telegraphs the most remunerative portion of the work, which is short-distance telegrams.  The long-distance and more difficult, but less-paying messages, continue to fall to the telegraph end.</P>
    <P>The average revenue per telegram is 1/3½, but the cost to the Department is 2/5, so that the Exchequer has to contribute the sum of 1/1½ towards each telegram sent.  The increased minimum fee of 1/6 a telegram introduced by the Minister for Finance in his recent Budget will have the effect of cutting a substantial amount of the loss on the service, but there will still remain a very considerable deficit.  This cannot be recovered as a result of internal economies, but it is felt that in view of the changing circumstances the whole position requires to be specially watched and reviewed and arrangements are being made to have this done. It should be mentioned that in the statistical statements furnished in this estimate no cognisance is taken of the effect of the imposition of the additional charge of 6d. to the minimum rate for telegrams.  This change is estimated to effect a saving of about £66,000.  This saving will be reflected in the deficit shown on the telegraphs and in the deficit shown on the general accounts.  It will reduce the total estimated deficit on the general accounts for the present year to £263,000</P>
    <P>On the telephone service the amount of loss is smaller than on the other services.  It is estimated at £42,000. This loss is greater than that existing some years ago when the reduction in telephone charges was introduced.  The reduced charges did not bring about the new business which was anticipated at the time, but there has been a gradual increase.  There has been extensive development so as to provide facilities which were absent and to extend existing ones.  This heavy initial expenditure which is borne on Telephone Capital Account, has the effect of increasing, temporarily at <Col N="1190" /> least, our losses as interest charges have to be borne before the full effect of the development is felt financially.</P>
    <P>The finances of telephone extension are somewhat complicated and difficult to understand.  Ordinarily in an expanding business, proportionately to expansion, expenses on the unit basis have a tendency to decrease as expansion takes place.  This rule does not apply to the telephone services.  Overhead expenses do not, of course, increase in the same proportion as the number of telephones.  The cost of apparatus tends to fall.  The savings effected on these are offset to a large extent, if not altogether, by the increased expense in cost of the plant necessary to provide ready means of communication between the increased number of users of the telephone.  Exchange plant and staff increase out of proportion to the number of added subscribers. This applies to all countries where there has been telephone development.  In effect the advantage which the user of the telephone gets from development and extension is not cheaper rates, but an increased service, i.e., a greater number of persons with whom he can talk.</P>
    <P>Charges of inefficiency and complaints of delay in effecting calls are sometimes made.  In this connection it should be remembered that the telephone system when handed over in 1922 was in many respects obsolete. Before the acquisition of the telephone system by the British Government the National Telephone Company, in anticipation of the change, naturally spent as little as possible on renewal or modernisation of plant and equipment. The necessary improvements in order to make the service efficient were not carried out, particularly in Ireland, before the outbreak of the Great War. Consequently on taking over it was in a very defective condition.  Attention has been steadily given to providing the required improvements.  Exchange equipment in many exchanges has been modernised, and the provision of up-to-date equipment for all exchanges is part of the policy of our Department. Considerable improvement has undoubtedly been effected already, as the following figures will show:&mdash;</P>

    <P>These figures are the result of service observations at Dublin Central Exchange.  Ineffective calls are often due to the fault of the subscribers. Many subscribers do not make arrangements for the provision of sufficient lines to avoid overloading with resultant ineffective calls owing to &ldquo;number engaged.&rdquo; Modern equipment and automatic exchanges will gradually lessen the number of ineffective calls.  An automatic exchange has been installed at Ship Street, with provision for 1,440 subscribers.  Merrion automatic exchange, with provision for 1,800, is now functioning.  The Stowger automatic equipment was used and has proved satisfactory.  A questionnaire was issued to all subscribers shortly after the introduction and, in general, satisfaction has been expressed, and many useful and practical suggestions emanated from subscribers.  In Dublin our policy in regard to exchange development is to instal automatics where new exchanges are required in place of manual exchanges which are becoming obsolete and worn out in regard to equipment.  We do not intend to discard modern manual exchanges which have still an effective life.</P>
    <P>In regard to our development policy in the areas outside of the larger cities, we have now extended the telephone to almost every town of any consequence in the Saorstát.  It is to be regretted, however, that the number <Col N="1192" /> of subscribers has not increased in proportion to the expansion.  This may be attributed to various causes, the principal being as follows: (a) Depressed economic conditions; (b) Absence of the &ldquo;telephone habit&rdquo; and (c)  The scattered population consequent on a thinly populated agricultural country.  Now that we are coming to the end of our extension policy on a large scale it is our intention to devote more attention to an effort to encourage the formation of the &ldquo;telephone habit.&rdquo; Granted improved economic conditions, it is hoped that a campaign of intensive canvassing will cause a much increased use of the telephone. Merchants and others in the smaller towns will recognise that it is a case of not &ldquo;Can I afford a telephone?&rdquo; but &ldquo;Can I afford to do without a telephone?&rdquo; It is an extraordinary commentary on our business habits to find that great financial institutions such as the Joint Stock Bank scarcely avail themselves of the telephone service at all.  The attempt to develop the party line system in the rural areas has not proved a great success.  So far only seven party lines have been established.</P>

    <P>These figures are from a publication issued by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and bring forcibly before our minds our backwardness in telephone development.  A circuit arrangement has been evolved which gives Monaghan, Clones and Belturbet direct access to Dublin, and those towns are no longer dependent on offices in the Six Counties for a telephone outlet.  Twenty-six new telephone <Col N="1193" /> exchanges were opened during the year.  Since the beginning of the present financial year fourteen exchanges have been opened and the early opening of seven more is anticipated. Provision has been made in the 1928-29 Estimates for the opening of eighteen exchanges.  It is anticipated that 125 call offices will have been provided before the end of the current financial year.  The total number of call offices in the Saorstát will then be round 1,100.  The number of subscribers' stations it is anticipated will have increased by approximately 1,460 during the past year.</P>
    <P>During the past year complete underground schemes were carried out in Waterford, Kilkenny, Galway, Greystones and Castleknock, and the old, heavily-loaded open wire routes recovered. Provision is made in these Estimates for complete underground schemes in Wexford and Carlow, where the old routes are becoming inadequate. Arrangements are now being made to extend the number of kiosks in Dublin and suburbs.  Regarding general post office business I now give figures showing the amount of business handled by the Post Office during the year:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> It will be seen that a reduction in the letter charges to the British rates would result in more than doubling the present loss in the working of the Post Office.  This does not take account of possible increase in amount of posted matter.</P>
    <P>The cash-on-delivery service is now on a permanent basis.  The extent to which it is availed of is still small, but there is a gradual increase.  The advantages of the system seem to be appreciated principally in Dublin.  As its inherent advantages become recognised a considerable expansion is hoped for.</P>
    <P>The extended use of motor transport for the conveyance of mails is being developed, both as regards contract services and Departmental vehicles driven by postmen.</P>
    <P>Since last year the number of motorcar contracts has been increased by three, and the total of services now is ninety.  The number of Departmental motor mail vans in use is 57, against 43 at the corresponding period last year.</P>
    <P>Seven additional Departmental motor vans will be introduced during the next few weeks.  These services are proving most satisfactory and economical.</P>
    <P>Postal relations with foreign countries continue to develop in order to ensure the expeditious despatch and delivery of mails.  In all cases in which the amount of correspondence available justifies that course direct despatches are made up.  Such despatches are now exchanged between the Saorstát and, in addition to most European countries, the United States, Canada, Newfoundland and Argentine Republic, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, India, the Federated Malay States, the Straits Settlements, China and Hong Kong.</P>
    <P>Parcel mails are still being forwarded by direct steamship in every case in which steamship facilities are available.</P>
    <P>The fullest possible use continues to be made of the Cobh route, and during the last year forty-two thousand sacks of Saorstát mails passed through that port&mdash;an increase of over one thousand sacks on the traffic for the year 1926.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> In addition to the money order conventions already in force with the Governments of the United States, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, Australia, India and South Africa, steps are being taken to set up similar agreements with Italy, Belgium and France.</P>
    <P>The main telegraph routes are in good working order, and the only serious dislocations of the services were those occasioned by snowstorms in the County Mayo in December last.</P>
    <P>During the year 1927 the contracts placed by the Stores Branch were allocated as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>£322,716 on Saorstát manufactured articles.</P>
    <P>£72,695 on British manufactured articles.</P>
    <P>£46,722 on articles produced in other countries.</P>
    <P>The value of uniform clothing and supplies on repayment to other Government Departments during 1927 was £183,899, which is approximately £50,000 greater than the value of stores supplied in the previous year.</P>

    <P>The canvas required for the manufacture of mail bags was, with the exception of 15,000 yards, obtained in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>The staff employed in January, 1928, numbered 12,585 as compared with 12,622 last year.  Apart from part-time postmen and sub-postmasters the major portion of the staff consists of Civil Service certificated officers.  The employment of such a large number of part-time auxiliary postmen is rendered necessary by the peculiar conditions of the country so as to afford delivery in rural areas at a reasonably early hour by an arrangement of short post routes radiating from the various delivery offices.  Longer routes warranting the employment of full-time postmen would extend deliveries well into the afternoon to the detriment of the services rendered rural residents, and in many cases postmen who collect correspondence for post would miss connection with the outgoing mail by reason of their late return from delivery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> One unfortunate effect of the use of so many part-time postmen, on the popular mind, is to create the idea that the Post Office delivery staff have an exceedingly soft time, getting a full day's pay for a few hours' work. Persons with this idea should know that a large proportion of our outdoor staff is part-time and only paid by the hour.</P>
    <P>Discipline in the service is well maintained. Within the comparatively short period in which I have had responsibility for the administration of the Post Office it has not been possible for me to obtain a complete knowledge of staff efficiency and courtesy, but from my observations and the information available I am satisfied that the general standard is high.  The courtesy of our staff recently brought forth a highly flattering testimonial from a leading American journalist.  This is a reputation which it is expected to maintain.</P>
    <P>Encouragement is given to existing officials to acquire a good knowledge of the Irish language and many officials are attending classes held under the auspices of either the Gaelic League or the Education Department.  Last year an examination for Learnerships was held and as a result 15 candidates from the Gaeltacht&mdash;all Irish speakers&mdash;and 61 candidates from outside the Gaeltacht were successful.  Many of the latter candidates have a good knowledge of Irish and only one failed to get at least 50 per cent. in Irish at the examination.</P>
    <P>Officers stationed within the Gaeltacht who are competent to do their work in Irish are being required to do so as far as possible and an extension of this principle is aimed at.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the Post Office is amongst Government Departments the nearest approach there is to a commercial institution, and the one which should therefore be administered as far as possible on a self-supporting basis.  It renders necessary services to the public, in regard to which it is generally speaking in a monopolistic position.  In return it receives payment at fixed rates.  It may be contended that the Post Office should be regarded purely as a business organisation and that it should be expected to pay its way.  In this connection, <Col N="1198" /> however, in the Saorstát there is a good deal of loose thinking and uninformed talking.  There is no doubt the Post Office could be placed on a paying basis&mdash;but at a cost.  Owing to the fact that the Irish services formed an integral portion of the British system in the past, it so happened that we secured the full services and advantages which were granted to that country.  The British system, which is a paying service, it must be remembered, catered for a thickly populated area, principally commercial and industrial. There was truly an outer fringe of thinly populated country, mostly agricultural in nature.  It was considered expedient to apply the same services to all portions of the countries, even though a sectional analysis would show that the service to the rural areas was subsidised by the services in the urban districts.  It might be argued, in fact, that the entire service stood together as one conglomerate whole and that any effort to differentiate between services rendered would so affect the whole structure as to be not only impolitic but uneconomic.  During this period the Irish branch of the service was regarded much as that given to one of the large agricultural areas of England, and taken as a separate unit would have been financially insolvent.  The establishment of separate control in the Free State meant in effect the cutting off of portion of the uneconomic fringe of the British service, with in addition the increased cost of central and overhead administration expenses which it is impossible to avoid in dealing with a smaller economic unit.  It should, therefore, be clear that those who expect us to compete on level terms with the British administration are asking for the impossible.</P>
    <P>It became clear to those in control after the change of administration that if the Post Office service in the Free State was to be administered in anything approaching an economic fashion, it would be necessary to make reorganisations and re-adjustments so as to bring the service into line with the economic resources of the country. Therefore, during the past recent years the internal working of the Department has been reorganised and overmen <Col N="1199" /> hauled as a result of which substantial economies have been effected.  The major economies which were effected in the early days of our administration were reasonably obvious and did not involve the same extensive examination of departmental expenditure which was essential to securing the progressive improvement in our financial position which has taken place.  While every effort is still used to economise, it is evident that without further impairment of essential services substantial savings cannot be made, and that the minor economies which may be brought about by the most careful scrutinising of all spending, cannot have any appreciable effect in reducing the present deficit.</P>
    <P>It must further be borne in mind that while the Post Office is regarded as a commercial organisation it suffers from certain disabilities inherent in Parliamentary control, which add to the expense of administration and subtract from its efficiency.</P>
    <P>Owing to the fact of Parliamentary control the records of the Post Office have to be kept in such a manner that even the most trivial happening within the service is recorded in minutest detail, so that questions by Deputies on any phase or aspect of the administration may be answered at short notice. Information must be available as to the appointment of say a part-time postman in the remotest portion of the country, and the time of highly-paid and expert officials is taken up in preparation of information which would never be required in a business organisation of an ordinary commercial character, where there would be a proper devolution of responsibility and where servants would be judged on results to a large extent.</P>
    <P>It is also manifestly impossible to prune down services to an absolute economic minimum.  Many branches of the services rendered are not on a remunerative basis, but the cutting down and lopping off of the unremunerative limbs and branches might leave the tree as a whole in a starved and impoverished condition.</P>
    <P>Recognising that it is not possible to clear our losses by internal economies, if we are expected to establish the service <Col N="1200" /> on a paying basis it is plain that we must adopt either of the following expedients or a combination of the two:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Adjusting the sectional services on a revenue basis, that is, restricting public services and facilities until they are remunerative.</P>
    <P>(b)  Increasing present charges to a paying level.</P>
    <P>As to the first, there have been restrictions of public facilities.  These aimed at cutting out or reducing the most unremunerative services, and, on the whole, the policy of retrenchment on non-paying services must be regarded in the circumstances as sound. But a too rigid retrenchment might prove unsound both politically and economically.  The value of the communication services of the Post Office must be judged by other considerations in addition to those of profit and loss on the immediate service.  They link the cities with the country, and while the thickly populated areas yield greater revenue, it must be recognised that in an agricultural country such as the Free State the urban residents are largely dependent for their livelihood from the produce of farming occupations, and that any restrictions in rural services would eventually react on the towns.  The urban dwellers would be the slowest to recommend restrictions on that account.  It may, therefore, be accepted that any further restriction of services with a view to eliminating the present loss would definitely impair the whole communication machinery of the Post Office.</P>
    <P>As to the alternative of increasing the present rates where they are non-paying, I have pointed out that the postal is our main service.  It gives the largest revenue and will continue to be the service of greatest general utility for many years at least.  If postage rates are to be made remunerative they must have relation to the operative and administrative costs, and on this basis many of our present postage rates are non-paying.  But rates must also have relation to the revenue yielding possibilities and they must be made attractive for revenue purposes.  An increase in certain charges might in present stringent economic conditions result in such a decrease in revenue as to make <Col N="1201" /> our last condition worse than our first. This argument does not, of course, apply to a service such as telegraphs which is so unremunerative that even should an increase of rates have the effect of completely wiping it out there would be a gain rather than a loss, owing to a saving in administration and operating expenses.</P>
    <P>It would appear therefore that the hope of an improvement in our financial position lies in the expectation of increased revenue which must result from an improvement in the general economic conditions in the country. We have been passing through a period of unparalleled depression.  There are indications that economic conditions are improving.  An improvement in conditions is always reflected in increased postal revenue.</P>
    <P>As a general summing up of the financial position of the Post Office, it is noted that the loss borne by the Exchequer after taking over from the British exceeded £1,000,000.  Portion of this deficit was perhaps abnormal, but substantially it was very high.  This loss has been steadily reduced.  Part of the reduction was perhaps automatic and depended on such things as the cost of living, but it may be accepted that the major reductions were brought about by retrenchment within the service and slightly improved revenue. Indications are that the improvement will be maintained.  The loss is being therefore gradually and substantially reduced.  It might be immediately cleared by passing the amount of the loss on to the Post Office users.  This is a course which I feel sure would not find favour with the Dáil or the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary appeared to think that it was necessary that he should get through the delivery of his statement in the shortest possible time.  I suggest that if the circumstances which necessitated haste on this occasion should also exist this time next year, the Parliamentary Secretary might consider posting the statement to Deputies on the morning on which the Estimate was going to be taken.  If that course had been adopted on this occasion we would have saved the time which the <Col N="1202" /> Parliamentary Secretary took up, I think we would know a lot more about the business of the Post Office than we now know.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was at great pains to stress that the Post Office Department is the nearest approach to a commercial department in the whole machinery of administration; but he appeared to think that, although it is in a sense a commercial department carrying out definite functions in relation to the public and receiving definite payment in return, it should not be criticised as such.  He derided the idea of criticising it as a business concern that produces a deficit of three or four hundred thousand pounds at the end of twelve months' trading should be criticised.  It is, perhaps, not unfair to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that at one time in his political career he himself maintained that the Post Office, as a business concern, should be organised and conducted as any other business concern would be organised and conducted. I do not think the case he has made out for treating it as anything else except as a business concern has been convincing.  The only real argument he put forward was that, because of the necessity of supplying Deputies with answers to questions, it was necessary to maintain an extra official in his Department in order, as he pointed out, to keep a record of every officer employed in the farthest parts of the country.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary has any intimate experience of business enterprises, but if he has, I think he will find it very difficult to get any business concern in this country that does not keep just as accurate a record of its employees as the Post Office.  Certainly, I never heard of a business concern that did not keep such a record, and that would not be able to tell you at a moment's notice whom it had on its employment list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary maintains that, to reorganise the Post Office and to put it upon a paying basis, would involve the taking of either two courses: (1) either a restriction of the services given, or (2) an increase in <Col N="1203" /> the charges made.  I put it to him that the Post Office could be put upon a paying basis without doing either one or the other if it was reorganised on other lines.  I suggest to him that that reorganisation is not taking place because a considerable amount of unemployment would result in consequence of it, as well as unpopularity to the Party of which he is now a member. I am not making that statement on my own authority.  I find that his predecessor in the office of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who had much more experience in the working of that Department than the present Parliamentary Secretary has yet had, stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Were the country strong economically and in a position to give general employment to its manhood it would not be out of question to introduce a very radical change in the distribution of rural correspondence by the introduction, for instance, of the motor cycle method. One motor cycle would take the place of half a dozen men.  A change of that kind would result in wholesale dismissals and additions to the ranks of the unemployed.  I want to make it clear, however, that as this loss in the Post Office has been pointed to that at any time the House desires the Post Office is in a position, without very serious hardship to the country, to balance the Post Office Accounts and to cause the heavy deficit practically, if not entirely, to disappear.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Walsh, who was then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, made that statement in 1925.  It is not, of course, the wish of this Party that the number of the unemployed should be increased, or that such a scheme of reorganisation involving that hardship should be undertaken now when there is no possibility of the men disemployed as a result of it being absorbed into other occupations.  We have got to recognise that the loss on the Post Office is due to the fact that it is not being run as a business concern.  It is being maintained to a certain extent as a means of providing relief from unemployment. Men are being maintained there not because they are really needed in the service, but because the Government <Col N="1204" /> could not take upon itself the onus of disemploying them.  No Government could.  No Government could, at any rate, until it had first of all reorganised the industries of the country, and provided the means by which the men disemployed in the postal service could be employed elsewhere.  But if we have to accept the position that the Post Office is not a paying concern and cannot be under present circumstances, then let us do so frankly and not talk about it as a semi-commercial institution when, in fact, it is a semi-charitable institution.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, it is felt that the Post Office should be run as a business concern, regardless of consequences, that the deficit in connection with it should be wiped out as soon as possible, and that it should be put on a paying basis, then I think that question should be approached as the owner of an ordinary commercial enterprise here would approach it.  If the Parliamentary Secretary were the owner of the Post Office, if it were his private property, if he were dependent upon it for his livelihood by producing a revenue at the end of the year, I think he would be able to do it.  He would be able to do it, as any ordinary business man would be able to do it, by getting his accounts examined carefully, by looking at his expenditure and seeing whether it could be reduced, and by examining his revenue to find out where it could be increased.</P>
    <P>Let us, for example, take the question of revenue.  We find that of all the different activities of the Post Office only one is a paying proposition &mdash;that is, the collection and delivery of letters.  The Parliamentary Secretary informed us that that particular service produced a revenue of £299,000 last year.  In view of the general tenor of his statement and the figures which he has given us&mdash;those, at any rate, that we were able to catch&mdash;it is out of the question, I think, to hope for any reduction in the letter rate.  Judging by the figures published in the finance accounts, a reduction of even one halfpenny in the ordinary twopenny postal charge would involve a loss of practically £300,000.  It would wipe out the revenue produced last year and leave that service running at a loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>What I really meant to say was that that was the net result on that particular service at the end of the year.  The net result of that particular activity in the Post Office left £299,000 in hand at the end of the year, but every other service in the Post Office was run at a loss.  Let us examine some of the other services.  As regards printed papers, there was a loss of £124,000.  The figures given us by the Parliamentary Secretary indicate an excess of printed papers delivered over those posted&mdash;that is, that the printed papers which come from abroad are equal to almost one-half of the number posted here.  In other words, a substantial part of the loss upon printed papers comes from the distribution in this country of circulars mainly from the great British commercial firms.  I do not know whether the International Conventions to which the State is committed necessitate the delivery of these letters at rates fixed in foreign countries, or whether it is not possible for the Post Office here to increase the rate for delivery on printed papers from abroad.  I would not suggest, and I do not think it would be advisable, that the rate for the delivery of printed papers posted here should be increased, but we would have no objection whatever to an additional charge being applied to printed papers coming from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find that on the delivery of newspapers a loss of £70,000 has been incurred. Again, we find that there is a big increase in the number delivered to the number posted&mdash;which indicates that a substantial number of these papers also come from abroad. Whether they come from abroad or not, the fact is that the State is losing the sum of £70,000 a year upon the delivery of newspapers.  That is a matter that, I suggest, we should consider. After all, it is identical, in effect, to a subsidy to a commercial concern.  I think that the officials of the Post Office might take into account the advisability <Col N="1206" /> of increasing the charge in that connection.  If by doing so they produce the result of wiping out this loss of £70,000 a year, it would be worth doing.  The distribution of newspapers through the post is not an essential feature in the life of the community.</P>
    <P>In the case of post cards, there was a loss of £7,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his statement did not, as far as I could catch what he said, indicate how this loss had arisen on a service which, I think, two or three years ago produced a gain of about £3,000.  It is now being run at a loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Since then there was a change made in the rates charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I think it was anticipated at the time that increased business would be done, and in consequence that there would be no loss as a result of the change made in the rates.  If, however, the increased business has not taken place it would explain the loss.  However, it is a small matter, and not an item on which we would suggest that an increased charge should be made.  The loss in that connection can be counterbalanced by the gain on the letter post.  The same thing applies in the case of parcels as newspapers. A large number of these parcels come from abroad.  Some time ago the Post Office imposed a delivery charge on parcels for the purpose of restricting the trade in parcels from abroad, but apparently that has not had the effect it was hoped it would have, as the business is going on as much as ever.  The Parliamentary Secretary said, I think, that there is this year an increase in the number delivered over the number posted as compared with last year.  That would indicate that the number of parcels coming from England has been increased. Most traders in this country deplore very much the tendency to shop through the post with English firms, and buying goods through advertisements in the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; and papers of that kind.  If that is to be done at all it should be done in a manner which would not involve a State subsidy.  If the trade in parcels from abroad is to go on at a cost to the State <Col N="1207" /> of £90,000, that is a matter which the Post Office authorities should take into consideration.  If the reduction of the loss would involve an increase in the delivery charge it should be done.  I know that is not a very popular suggestion, but we cannot afford the loss in this service, and to facilitate business being transacted which results in a loss to the shopkeepers of this country.</P>
      <P>There is also a loss in registered parcels, money orders and postal orders.  The loss in money orders is small amounting to only £1,000.  The poundage was respectively £16,000 and £21,000.  An increased business in this would wipe out the loss altogether. The same thing applies to registered parcels as to ordinary parcels.  The telegraph service is run at a loss of £167,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary informed us that it is a dying service, and that year after year the use which is being made of the telegraph system is declining.  The minimum charge for telegrams has been increased to 1/6, and we presume that that additional charge will have the effect, even if it was not the intention, of killing the service altogether, or going largely towards doing so.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary is justified in estimating that it is going to bring in the revenue which he forecasts by merely halving the revenue from that service last year and saying it will result in increased revenue from the increased charge.  I think it is likely the telegraph service will go into disuse except for Press purposes as a result of the additional charge.  In connection with the loss in the telegraph service, I would like to point out that a considerable portion of it is due to the sending of Press telegrams at reduced rates.  It was, I think, estimated last year that the loss in the sending of Press telegrams would amount to £18,000.  That is a fairly considerable portion of the total of £167,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had decided that the loss in the telegraph service is to be met by an increased charge to the ordinary user I do not see why he should not also decide to increase the charge in the case of Press telegrams. Again, this is in the nature of a subsidy <Col N="1208" /> to commercial concerns.  The loss of £18,000 is a serious item for Deputies to take into account.  Whether or not we can afford to lose annually £18,000 in order to provide facilities for certain commercial firms in Ireland is a matter on which strong views will be held.  The loss on the telephone service is £42,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary has given no explanation as to how the loss has arisen.  I think I am correct in saying that before the recent reduction in rates the telephone service was a paying service, that in the year prior to the reduction there was a gain of £17,000, and that each year since instead of the loss being reduced it has been increased, growing from £3,000 in 1926 to £42,000 last year.  I do not know if that is correct, but these are the figures I have been able to get.  The telephone service was a paying service till 1924 or 1925.  The service has been extended and there must be some reason for this growing loss upon it.  It was a paying service at a time when Ministers were fond of maintaining that the state of prosperity of the country was much less than it has now become, while last year the loss amounted to the considerable sum of £42,000.</P>
    <P>No doubt the disuse of the telegraph system will result in an increased use of the telephone, although not, I think, to the extent to which the Parliamentary Secretary has anticipated.  As an individual who has occasion to make use frequently of both the telegraph and telephone systems I do not agree altogether that disuse of the telegraph will result in an increased use of the telephone, which the Parliamentary Secretary stated will follow.  If, for example, I wanted to send ten messages throughout the country in a hurry it would be much more convenient for me to send them by telegram than by telephone, because there is usually a considerable delay in putting through trunk call.  It would take five or six hours to get through ten messages by telephone, but if they were despatched by telegraph at once they would reach their destination in three or four hours. I think the Parliamentary Secretary might take into consideration the considerable delay in putting through trunk calls.  No doubt the delay is due <Col N="1209" /> to overcrowding of the wires.  It might be possible to relieve that, and it is necessary if the telephone service is to be brought up to the standard.  The cost of sending a telegram even at the increased price of 1/6 will be much less than the cost of an ordinary three minutes trunk call to distant parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has referred to the general courtesy of the staff, and I must agree with him to a very large extent; but at the same time I would like to know if he ever had the experience of ringing on the 'phone for about ten minutes without getting a reply, asking the operator if she had wakened up, and then finding out whether she had the courtesy he has referred to?  I frequently notice that between the hours of 8 and 11 at night it is very difficult to get replies from the Exchange.  That does not apply throughout the day, when the staffs are at full strength, but between the night hours I have mentioned it is difficult to get immediate response on the Exchange.  That was particularly noticeable during the period of the General Elections, possibly because the wires were being overworked.  Personally I believe I got an extra ten years added on to my age as a result of my experience on the 'phone during that period.  If, however, we go through the various activities of the Department which either do or might produce revenue we find that an increase can be effected.  I do not know in this matter how far the international conventions that exist would restrict the activities of the Parliamentary Secretary, but we believe that in the delivery of parcels and circulars from abroad, and in the delivery of newspapers, an increased charge would be justified so as to wipe out the annual existing loss. The Parliamentary Secretary as proprietor, so to speak, of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, having, we presume, gone through the items which might produce revenue, might turn to the expenditure side of his account and see where economies were possible.  He would look at his staff, for example, if he were proprietor of his Department, anxious to make it a paying concern, and he would produce a different Estimate <Col N="1210" /> to that which he has produced this year.</P>
    <P>I notice that there are increases of considerable magnitude in a number of branches of the Department.  This year the number of officials in the Stores Branch has gone up by 14; the female staff has increased by 50 and the headquarters staff by 53.  Perhaps it would interest the Parliamentary Secretary to know the gradual changes of staff which have taken place in his Department since 1923.  There have been fluctuations&mdash;increases in some sections and decreases in others.  The figures indicate that while there has been a steady and considerable increase in all the headquarters staff, there has been a similarly steady and considerable decrease in the number of postmen and others who actually serve the requirements of the people.  In the headquarters office a staff of 313 rose each year as follows: 313, 320, 337, 352, 353 and reached 406 last year.  In the Secretary's and Solicitor's office a staff of 112 in 1923 went up as follows: 112, 119, 136, 140, 139, 131.  In the Accountant's office the staff increased as follows: 200, 200, 200, 211, 213, 273. In the Stores Department the staff numbered 114 in 1923 and it went up as follows: 114, 136, 149, 145, 150, 164. In the Engineering Branch the increase was as follows: 489, 516, 554, 569, 569, 570.  There was a steady increase in all the headquarters offices, but there was a decrease in the number of officials employed in provincial and metropolitan offices&mdash;a decrease in the actual number of postmen engaged in delivering letters.  Although there are less postmen working, it takes an increased and more expensive staff to deal with them.  There are some 14 officials in the Department drawing remuneration exceeding £1,000, and a number of officials in and around and just under the £1,000 mark.</P>
    <P>If the Post Office is to be put on a paying basis and maintained as a commercial institution, if the annual deficit is to be wiped out, and the money saved to the taxpayers, or released so that it can be devoted to more useful work, it will be necessary to carry out that drastic re-organisation at the top. It will not be necessary altogether, as Mr. Walsh said two or three years ago, <Col N="1211" /> to disemploy men at the bottom, but there certainly can be considerable economy effected at the top.  That combined with the various suggestions I have made for increasing the revenue, if they were put into operation, would we think result in a considerable reduction in the deficit next year.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I should like to mention.  The Post Office more than any other Government Department has adopted and put rigorously into operation the policy of giving work only to ex-members of the National Army.  I have had many cases brought to my notice, not merely of competent men being refused work because they were not ex-members of the National Army, but of men actually in employment being dismissed in order to make room for ex-Army men.  The Government has adopted that policy and apparently has decided to maintain it.  They should seriously consider whether or not that is wise.  The bitterness that results in many parts of the country from this preference is considerable and will do its part in preventing the speedy development of prosperity here, because prosperity can only come when all these causes of bitterness have been eradicated.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to state whether or not it is going to be the policy of the Department to keep up that preferential treatment next year, or whether employment in this service, which is paid for by all the people in the State regardless of political opinion, is to be open to every person regardless of his political opinion.  We have had Ministers talking here during the last two days about &ldquo;Our Army&rdquo; and &ldquo;Our this and that.&rdquo; It is well to bear in mind that it is the people of this State, including the half-million people who voted for the Deputies on this side of the House, who are paying for these services, and they are entitled to the same consideration as the people who supported any other Party.  Certainly, where the giving of State work is concerned, no political consideration should be taken into account.  I should like to have a definite statement as to whether or not that policy is to be continued. Certainly, if the Government decides to continue this policy it will <Col N="1212" /> be waste of time for the President or anyone else, in Cork or elsewhere, to be appealing for a united effort amongst all Parties for the general good of the country.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to go into details in the discussion of this Estimate.  Deputy Lemass has covered the ground exhaustively.  But there is one point arising out of the main criticism of Deputy Lemass that I should like to refer to.  It is not the first time that the argument has been used here that the Post Office should be run as a commercial concern.  In fact, the argument has been used about Government offices generally.  It is a rather fashionable argument to say that these things should be approached from a purely business point of view. I think the Parliamentary Secretary himself held the view one time that the Post Office should be a purely business concern, but I dare say it is his association with the actual working of the Post Office that has induced him to alter his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing we should ask ourselves in connection with this argument is: Are we running the Post Office as a profit-making institution, or do we regard it as a public service&mdash;a utility service?  There can be no doubt as to what is the answer to that question.  If Deputy Lemass, as a business-man, were to approach the Post Office with the one idea in his mind that it was a business concern, to be run on business lines, with the object of returning a profit to the person who was running it, he would look around to see in what direction he could run the business at a profit.  The net result, the certain result, of an examination of that kind would be that services which are not profitable would be cut off.  Deputy Lemass as a business-man would not deliver letters in Connemara very possibly, if his idea were to make the Post Office a purely business concern, because it is not profitable to deliver letters there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>A business-man in the position that the Deputy is referring to would not run the Post Office at all.  I am presuming that the Post Office has to be maintained, and that these services <Col N="1213" /> have to be given at the cheapest possible cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different point of view altogether from Deputy Lemass's main argument, as I understood it, in any case.  If the idea is that the present service must be maintained and still run as a business proposition, that only means that there might be some possible reorganisation. I agree with Deputy Lemass, if that is his point of view, but certainly that was not the point as I understood it, nor the point that is urged frequently by people outside this House, and sometimes by people inside this House, and which comes to this, quite plainly, that the cost of the delivery of letters in rural areas is much more than what is actually paid for the service by the persons who post these letters, and that will be seen right through the whole concern.  If we were looking at it from the point of view of what would pay there may possibly be no delivery of letters outside towns of 500 or 600 inhabitants. Letters would be sent to a central post office and people living round these areas would be expected to call for their letters.  It certainly would not pay from the point of view of making a profit, to deliver letters in the rural areas, and it is the rural areas that would suffer.  I am afraid that Deputy Lemass, when making these suggestions, or Deputy Flinn speaking some time ago of an accountant and superman who would reorganise the Government Departments on a purely business basis, was forgetting the point of view of the rural dweller, who is also a taxpayer, and is entitled to the benefits of the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to stress that point of view, because it has been emphasised on various occasions when this Estimate was before the House.  We must keep in mind that the main object of the Post Office is not to show a profit on the year's working, but to render service as cheaply as possible and at the lowest amount of expenditure.  It is this principle that underlies many of our public services.  We, on these benches, have often demanded the nationalisation of public services like the railway, because we believe that the fact that they are purely or largely <Col N="1214" /> profit-making concerns prevents them rendering to the public the service that ought to be rendered to the public if they had an object other than profit-making. I just intervened in the debate to stress that point.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary has come round to the point of view expressed by the Labour Party on various occasions when this Estimate was under consideration. I note, too, that he feels that a reduction of from twopence to three halfpence for letters is no longer possible, although he held different views some time ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNEDY</NameTxt>
      <P>For instance, if you want to get a telephone call from Mullingar to, say, Oldcastle, which is very near, you have to get linked up from Dublin.  It often takes an hour to link up.  Take a village like Castlepollard, only eight miles from Oldcastle. Again, it often takes an hour, and the same applies to places such as Navan, Drogheda and Dundalk.  It would be a great benefit to the public if there were direct services on such routes as that. I believe it obtains in districts in the west and south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to bear out what Deputy Lemass said about telephone calls after eight o'clock.  Not in election times only, but in ordinary times, to get a call after 8 o'clock you will often ring <Col N="1215" /> for half an hour and get no response. I remember one particular instance, where people were ringing up for an hour before getting any response. Another matter is where you have a number of outlying post offices around a town like Mullingar and you want a telephone call, you find a constant buzzing interruption.  In the middle of a conversation you find a telegram being sent, so that your conversation is entirely interrupted.  That, I think, could be easily prevented.</P>
    <P>There are a number of districts, with fairly large villages in the centre, that have constantly applied to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for telephones. Since the telephone is superseding the telegram, I think it is up to the Minister to facilitate those districts, because the charge for telegrams and their delivery will be altogether uneconomic from this forward, especially when you add the porterage to the 1s. 6d.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. GEORGE WOLFE Mr. GEORGE WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GEORGE WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is very much to be regretted that the telephone service, which is such a convenience to the country generally and affords such a method of opening up the country, is not a paying concern. A couple of years ago it was just beginning to show signs of paying, as Deputy Lemass mentioned.  I know quite a number of people living at long distances from call stations who would be very glad to instal the telephone if it were not so very expensive.  The amount that has to be paid is excessive, and prevents them from having lines extended to them.  If some method could be devised by which they would not be called upon to pay the whole amount at once, and if it could be spread over a period of years, a good many people in outlying districts far away from call offices would have the telephone installed in their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary alluded also to the fact that the party system was not being used very much.  I want to sing the praises of the party system, because I have had it now in my own house for about seventeen years.  I find it of the utmost convenience.  There are fourteen others joined with me in this system.  It has two lines, and I do not think any of us would give it up <Col N="1216" /> even if we had to pay more for it than we are paying.  We have to pay much more now of course than we had originally, but even so I think the convenience is so great that not one of us would give it up.  Of course I know there is an idea that everybody is listening to what one is saying, but I think that anyone who has one of these telephones will soon find that it is not done.  They will very soon get tired of listening, the point being that the conversation is as a rule by no means interesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but a long time ago my interest ceased.  But I recognise that it is of the utmost convenience, and if that was only realised I think people would use it much more than they do.  It is an inestimable benefit, and I say that from very long experience of it.  If people had an idea what it could be had for, and if every post office was in a position to give a comparative statement of what the telephone would cost, it would be much more used.  The idea at present is that the cost is prohibitive and expensive, whereas that is not the fact.  Of course it costs something, but nothing like what an extension of an entire line would cost.  Some time ago the Parliamentary Secretary promised that a motor service would be put on between Naas and Tullow, taking in Ballymore Eustace and other towns which are very badly served at present.  In a great many places they do not get their letters until one or two o'clock in the day.  Naturally, that is a great inconvenience to them.  They have borne with that fairly uncomplainingly, but their patience is coming to an end.  The people there would be very grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would intimate when this van is going to be put on.  I hope the Minister will do something about the telephone service, so as to try, if it is possible, to lessen the cost.  I am sure there would be a tremendous increase in the service if the initial cost could be lessened.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words to the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the extension of the telephone service to the rural districts, where, owing to the present cost of telegrams, it will be a great benefit to those who were in the habit of using the telegraph service, as they could ring up the various rural areas.  I know that a good deal has been done in this respect, but I want to see a great deal more done in the future. With regard to the suggestion that people have been deprived of employment owing to politics, I think it is only right to say that I have taken up the cases of several persons in the area I represent, because I knew that they were efficient men, and in days gone by had done good work for the cause that a great many people here fought for.  Owing, however, to the attitude that these people took up during the Civil War period they were deprived of their employment in the Post Office, but I am glad to be able to say&mdash;and pay a tribute to the Minister for it&mdash; that their cases have been reconsidered and they have been reinstated.  One of these persons has risen in the service since his reinstatement and, at the present time, occupies a very important position.  I hope that that policy will be continued.  It is only fair that I should tell what has been done.  I can instance several cases in which that has been done.  With regard to the interruption of telephone calls, everybody knows that atmospheric conditions, stormy weather and that kind of thing, are the principal causes of the trouble.  While I do not say that listening-in does not go on occasionally, I do not think it is the cause of the complaints, because anyone who has a wireless set is well aware that there are many occasions when nothing can be heard, while at other times the reception is very clear.  In my opinion, that is the cause of a good deal of the trouble.  I intend later to have something to say on the Broadcasting Vote.</P>

      <P>Most of the points on this Vote that could be debated, so far as I am concerned, have been dealt with by Deputy Lemass.  Deputy Murphy expressed a desire to hear from Deputy Lemass if our plea for no victimisation applied equally to British ex-servicemen.  Every member of this Party has declared on every possible occasion with regard to State employment of any kind, that we do not recognise any right to distinguish between one man and another on account of previous political affiliations.  We make no distinction and we want the present Government to do away with preferential treatment for employment in any Department of the Government service. Recently I gave a note to a young lad who has been idle for a long time to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs where some work was being done.  He came back stating that he was told that as he was not an ex-serviceman he had not a dog's chance. That is the situation which confronts us, and we can sympathise very well with British ex-servicemen when they have to meet the same situation.  There are one or two points that I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to take a note of.  I do not know if he hopes to get portion of the revenue for the telegraphs by what happened to me yesterday. I received two telegrams addressed to Rathfarnham, but as Rathfarnham Post Office was closed I was charged 6d. extra because they were delivered from Dundrum.  If that state of affairs is going to go on all over the country I can see not only 6d. extra being put on for every telegram that is sent but for every one that is received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also to call attention to the manner in which the Telephone Department sometimes does its work.  Recently in a Dublin district an individual bought a house in which there was a telephone.  Immediately that he moved in he filled in a form applying for the use of this telephone, forwarding his deposit.  He used the telephone for fourteen days after he had gone into the house, but on coming home one day he saw that the telephone had been removed. He asked about it and was told that it was removed by order, and that he would have it back immediately. The telephone was again installed <Col N="1219" /> almost immediately; then the question arose as to who was to pay for the mistake, and he was told it would be all right.  Subsequently he was billed to the amount of £3 10s., which he had to pay.  If genuine efforts are being made to bring about economies, to bring about a situation where unnecessary expense would not be indulged in such an instance as this should not occur.  Should the Parliamentary Secretary want further details of that case he can have them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass gave figures with regard to the increase in employment in certain departments of the service. I notice that in provincial offices there is a considerable reduction of employees, and I presume that with the reduction of these employees there is also a reduction in services.  I have nothing further to say, except to join with Deputy Lemass in his plea that in the Postal Department, apart from the hopes we have that it will cut down its losses and increase the services, where employment is concerned the idea should not be preference for a man because he had service in the National Army, but that employment should be given to the best man who can do the best work in the particular job.</P>

      <P>Personally I cannot express much dissatisfaction with the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am concerned only with one or two matters in the Estimate, and with one or two matters with which the Secretary dealt in his statement. However, I cannot help remarking, by way of preface, that whilst I can congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary, I am reminded, as I suppose most Deputies who have at any time attended a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, of a song in one of them:&mdash;</P>

      <P>A complaint has been frequently made to me by very deserving and worthy citizens that they are debarred from employment in the Post Office service by reason of the fact that they have not been members of the National Army.  I have every respect for the National Army; I have every respect for ex-National Army men, but at the same time I think we have arrived at a period in the history of the State when we can afford to disregard the handicaps of this kind in the case of men seeking employment.  I believe that every unemployed man seeking work to-day is a man on whom the State can at all times rely in any emergency, and it is not at all right or proper that we should have this handicap placed on applicants for work in any State service, particularly in the Post Office.  I do hope that that handicap will be removed, and that, whether an applicant for work be an ex-British Army man, an ex-National Army man, or a man who has not belonged to any army at all, there shall be equal opportunities for all for employment in State services.  To my mind these preferences should be abolished. I think we have now arrived at a stage in our existence and history when we can afford to do so.  In that connection I would remark that the particular need of the individual applying for work should be the first consideration, not alone for the State but also for private employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about the call for economy in the postal service.  I do not know how many Deputies and how many of the general public are aware of the real economies that are being practised, and practised with success, in the post and telegraph services.  The introduction of the Creed machine was a great step forward in economy, whilst not inflicting any hardships on any individuals employed in the service.  That is one of the things, in my view at any rate, which should be taken into account at all times in considering how best to economise in the public services&mdash;that we should have particular regard to the point raised by Deputy O'Connell, that in the case of utility services&mdash;and I consider the postal service is a utility service&mdash;we <Col N="1221" /> should have particular regard to the accommodation of the general public.</P>
    <P>There are in Cork County, near the City, many districts in which there is only one delivery per day, and many agriculturists and others have suffered much pecuniary loss on account of the curtailment of the service.  Under the British regime there was a better postal service to some of these districts, and even under that regime much economy could have been effected if the rank and file of the Post Office had been consulted. It has too frequently been the case&mdash;and I very much fear that the same system is operating now&mdash;that trusting too much to certain officials has resulted in loss to the State.  If you want to effect economies in the postal, telegraph and telephone services the people to consult are largely the rank and file.  If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would get into consultation with the various superintendents on the postal and telegraph side and discuss with them the best means of obtaining economy I think we would have far better results.  The old vicious system that obtained under the former regime still continues to a very large extent.  I could supply information to the Minister as to where expenses could be cut in some directions, but I would be very slow to do so, fearing that a postal or telegraph official would suffer.  But it is a fact, and a fact that cannot be denied, that there are many people in the postal service who could, if they get sufficient encouragement&mdash;and when I say sufficient encouragement I mean that they would not be discouraged from giving information and that they would not suffer&mdash;give information which would tend very considerably to reduce expenses, whilst not reducing the efficiency of the service.</P>
    <P>I am having particular regard to country districts and the way they have been served under the old régime and under the present one.  Farmers, cattle dealers, and others who require from time to time to use this utility service have found it most expensive.  I would like to remind the House that, after all, these people are worth considering and that we should get down to this, namely, that this is not a service in the way <Col N="1222" /> that the ordinary merchant would look at it.  It is a public utility service and as such should be considered and, while it may represent a loss in pounds, shillings and pence, it is not a loss in the purely economic sense because you are giving in return a utility service which is, after all, one of the services which this or any other Government should provide for its citizens.  I have not much to say in regard to the whole Vote except to mention that I will support it.  I must say, in conclusion, that I did not think that the Parliamentary Secretary would have made such a good job of his new position.  He has certainly done very well.  I must congratulate him and I hope that the Farmers' Party will emulate his example and will merge themselves once and for all in Cumann na nGaedheal and then we will know where we are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not think that I have been in communication with him upon the subject but I have been with his predecessor.  Small as it may appear, it is a matter that affects my own constituency in particular.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has any particular system whereby certain classes of post offices are deemed first, second or third class, but I know that for a considerable time past there has been a demand from the postal officials in Waterford, which is, I think, the fourth largest city in the Saorstát, that they should be regarded as belonging to the first class.  I understand that up to this their request has not been granted.  I cannot follow the reasons why.  I understand that places like Blackrock are regarded in the first category and the officials, of course, get the benefit of that.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has not already taken the matter into consideration I would be very grateful if he would look into the whole question because, undoubtedly, there is a distinct grievance and there is a large amount of work to be done in a city of the size and importance of Waterford, which, I think, should be regarded as much a first-class post office as, say, an office like Blackrock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> In general, I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has made it clear as to the distinct policy of the Government in regard to the working of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I do not know whether that Department is supposed to be a moneymaking one, or whether it is merely supposed to be run for the benefit of the community, even at a loss.  It is a very important question, and upon the answer to it should depend to a large extent the cost of administration of that Department, and the methods whereby it is run.  It has not always been held in all countries that the Post Office should be regarded merely as a money-making or revenue-producing business concern, but rather that it should be run for the benefit of the community at large.  I would like, while on that point, to hear the Parliamentary Secretary state what effect he thinks the extra cost of telegrams will produce, so far as revenue is concerned, and also so far as the working expenses of his own Department are concerned. I doubt very much whether that extra cost will pay for itself, and whether the number of telegrams will not be seriously reduced to the extent, perhaps, that there might even be a loss of revenue.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I think the principle is distinctly unsound, because at the bottom of it there lies the idea that it is a step in the direction of, shall I call it, restraint of trade.  The whole object of the Government should, in my view, be to facilitate communication, transport included, by every possible means between all sections of the community, but to place an extra burden upon people who desire to utilise the Post Office by sending telegrams is, I think, a wrong principle at bottom, and I doubt whether other means could not have been discovered for producing at least as much, if not greater, revenue by not placing such a burden upon these people.  I am anxious, in particular, to know if the Parliamentary Secretary has any definite basis whereby he determines what shall be a first-class and what shall be a second-class post office and if so, on what grounds can he justify placing the chief post office in the City of <Col N="1224" /> Waterford in the category of second-class.</P>

      <P>To me every single Estimate in this House represents merely a problem to be solved.  I would infinitely rather, and I think it would be infinitely better permanently for this State if it were possible, to come to this annual account-keeping and regard every single Estimate as a problem to be solved and not as a controversy to be resolved.  It is in that spirit, broadly, that I prefer to tackle this particular Estimate.  I am faced by the fact that in the year 1924-25 there was a loss of £535,000, in the year 1925-6 a loss of £568,000, and in the year 1926-27 a loss of £548,000.  There is nothing party or controversial in that.  We are faced by two points of view in relation to that, because we are faced by a point of view, represented by Deputy O'Connell and Co., who apparently regard themselves as bound to defend any expenditure, at any price, which provides them with the popular argument that they are giving employment.</P>

      <P>In relation to every social service, no matter how uncontroversial it seems to be, I suggest that this House shall take up its actual cost, shall capitalise that actual cost and ask themselves what they are doing without, which they might have, if they did not have to incur that particular cost for that particular service.  I am taking the most unpopular possible line in picking social services, because the case which can be made in the matter of social services is overwhelmingly greater than that upon enforcement and other services.  £548,000 capitalised will completely solve the housing problem in Ireland.  That is worth considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we get for this loss of £548,000, which is equal to what we lose in the continuance of the social, moral, political and economic conditions <Col N="1225" /> which are created by the existing state of housing in this country, as distinct from the conditions which could be brought into being if this £548,000 were used in the solving of the housing question?  It may be true, and it probably is true, that under this Department some letters are being delivered for 2d. which cost 15/-.  That is quite possible.  I will give you an analogous case which, I think, will bring it home to you.  Many years ago there was analysed the whole of the electrical supply distribution costs of the City of Glasgow.  It was then delivering something like 100,000,000 units of electricity. It was selling them at somewhere about 4d. per unit, but the figure does not matter very much at the moment.  The actual cost of producing to the consumer units which were sold at 4d., varied from about 1½d. to £5 10s. You may have analogous conditions in relation to Posts and Telegraphs.  You may have conditions in this country in which the cost of delivering letters, telegrams and so on is completely extortionate from the point of view of what is paid for it.  I am not asking the House to say bluntly and clearly that uneconomic things of that kind shall be wiped out.  What I am saying is that this House should know and should fully investigate in the most rigorous detail, the cost of the distributive services which they are giving. They should face the question whether some of those services are not being given at a cost to the State out of all proportion to the benefit it has received for them.</P>
    <P>If, for instance, by curtailing services of one kind or another&mdash;and I take this merely for the moment as an example&mdash;if by curtailing the postal service in Connemara, we could solve the real economic conditions there, if we could, by taking from the people who have neither food nor clothes, who have no prospect of continuing to maintain in their own presence the children they bring into the world, if we were to take from the people who have not got the barest luxuries or the barest necessities of human existence, a convenient postal service at the price of giving them the means of having some of these essential human services, <Col N="1226" /> do you not think it would be very much better?  I suggest that if we do go through all our Departments and find out whether or not some of our services are too costly&mdash;due to the fact that we are trying to make them universal and that we are trying to produce exactly equal conditions in one way for people whose conditions are hopelessly unequal in other ways&mdash;we may find, not only out of this particular Vote, but out of the £23,000,000 total expenditure in this country, a fund which will solve much more serious problems and much heavier financial obligations than even the very great basic obligation which is upon the members of every Party in this House, without any regard whatever to distinction, and we will find, at the earliest possible moment, by saving from whatever source we can or the production from whatever source we can, the means of radically altering the housing conditions of the vast majority of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell pours a certain amount of elongated scorn on a superman. I am told that I am calling for supermen when I suggest that a considerable Government Department might be investigated by an individual or a firm.  Well, I can produce the supermen.  That is the answer.  They are not supermen.  They are perfectly ordinary human beings to whom the commercial community are paying considerable sums of money willingly, because they think they get value for it, for doing, in relation to their own business, and doing it successfully, precisely what men of the calibre of Deputy O'Connell think could only be done by supermen.  Here is a quotation from a very eminent Deputy:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have had some conversation with a man who has some knowledge of Government Departments, and he also has experience in business for a considerable number of years.  He was a successful business man, and he said to me: &lsquo;Give me a Government Department with a staff of fifty; let me re-organise that Government Department; let me cut out red tape and old-fashioned systems; and I will guarantee that I will run that Department as efficiently and <Col N="1227" /> economically with a staff of ten as it was run in the past with a staff of fifty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy who said that goes on: &ldquo;I believe myself it is along those lines that economy can be effected.&rdquo; Now, the superman who said that is Deputy Heffernan.</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony congratulated, I do not know whom exactly, whether it was the Farmers' Party or the House or Deputy Heffernan, upon his selection for this particular post. Personally, I think, that is an example of a thing which is only a joke, if it is taken seriously.  In this particular case it is a peculiarly bad joke, because in putting Deputy Heffernan in charge of that particular Department, the particular Government which is in charge threw away the whole case of pretending to desire economic administration in relation to that Department.  I am not inventing this accusation.  It is their own accusation against themselves. There is no man in this House, however ignorant of the organisation of business, who will say that it does not matter twopence-halfpenny who is in charge of that Department; that an efficient man at the top and an utterly inefficient man at the top will produce precisely the same results.  Here is a quotation: &ldquo;This is a poor country; yes; bankrupt, no, certainly no sign of bankruptcy.  It would be bankrupt if all the people of the country were the same as the Deputy who has just spoken, bankrupt in intelligence, bankrupt in initiative, bankrupt in everything of use to the country.&rdquo; That is a description by the head of this Government who tells us that we cannot reduce expenditure; that we cannot make more efficient the Departments of the State.  Bankrupt in intelligence, bankrupt in initiative, bankrupt in <Col N="1228" /> everything of use to the country! That is a description by the head of this State of the man who has been put in charge of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Is it very wonderful?  Do you need any other explanation of the £548,000 lost in this Department?  Dear at the price! Now, can we afford to lose £548,000 to retain the services of a man bankrupt in intelligence, bankrupt in initiative, bankrupt in everything of use to the country?  Can we afford to retain in the chief executive office of this country the man who as an indication of his appreciation will put in charge of what ought to be a great and highly-organised administrative institution in this country, the man whom he so described?  This £548,000 which I have taken is the figure for 1926-27. It is now £300,000.  Well, £300,000 multiplied by twenty is £6,000,000 of money.  What sort of chance are you giving yourselves in relation to your administration when you have the deliberate effrontery to put in charge of a great administrative service a man of that mental calibre described by themselves? I do not know anything about his mental calibre.</P>

      <P>I have no evidence of it, but if you were shareholders in a company and you came to a business meeting and you were told you had lost money or that you had made money and if the managing director was to get up and say that as an indication of appreciation to himself or something connected with him and apart from the particular function of that particular company, he had put in charge of the administration of that company a man bankrupt in everything of use to the country, what would be thought of it? The President said that this was not a bankrupt country, but he said that it certainly would be if all the people were the same as the man whom he has now chosen to put in charge of this Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really suggest that the House should face this fact.  What sort of recklessness is this that is going on?  If we are allowed deliberately to choose deliberately and proclaim to the House that we have chosen as an indication of appreciation <Col N="1229" /> of something else for the service of that administrative Department of the State, a man whom we have so described, is it not a miracle that we are not even in a worse position than we are?  I am simply taking this £548,000 or £300,000 as typical.  There is no more dust in the sunbeam than in the rest of the room.  We now have a plain indication of the sense of responsibility which the Government have in choosing its administrators. If we are to assume that all the Departments of the State are worked on the same principle and are staffed for the same purpose and receive the same consideration&mdash;I am using &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; in its technical sense &mdash;is it any wonder that we are spending £23,000,000 on getting the sort of skeleton social service, skeleton political service, skeleton commercial and economic services which we are getting?  You are face to face with the problem which you have got to solve and that is to see that this thing does not recur.</P>
    <P>I do sincerely believe that if there were made by some outside competent professional authority an examination of these and other like departments in this State we would get a knowledge of what is really required to run it.  Now I am going to say something which I want you to take very particular note of.  You will not have solved the problem then, but you will have separated the goats from the sheep; you will have separated the producers from the non-producers; you will have separated the intellectual bankrupts from the people who are capable of producing a balance sheet of services which are a credit to the State; but you will still have upon your hands the mass of people who, in every department of this State, aye, and in every department of business in this country, are sheltering from the rough blasts of the facts of life.</P>
    <P>Is there any man here who will suggest that if we had means of demobilising our Army and our Navy&mdash;I believe we have a Navy&mdash;and our surplus staffs in Government offices into industrial employment, we would not do it?  We are up against the fact in every department of our business that we have not places in which to put our men.  Your Army and your Civic Guards&mdash;what are they but insurance <Col N="1230" /> against the consequences of the cause of discontent?  And the cause of discontent is the fact that we have not places into which to demobilise those people.  I say quite frankly that there is no difficulty whatever in finding out who is working and who is not working. I see no difficulty whatever in radically reducing all services to the simplest form, cutting away all excrescences, getting down to bedrock in personnel, in service and in class.  Unless and until this House is prepared, without distinction of Party, without division of any kind, to regard it simply as a problem, to come together and to find a means of providing somewhere into which to demobilise those people who are hidden in Government offices and in a whole lot of sheltered occupations and maintained at the expense of the working people of this country&mdash;unless and until we can combine to find a means of encouraging production in this country &mdash;no temporary solution by cutting a bit off the Estimates here and there will serve us in any way, because every man you cut off the Estimate you must exterminate, you must migrate or you must keep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Agreement made the 25th day of April, 1928, between the Government of Saorstát Eireann and the Government of Great Britain amending the Agreement made on the 14th day of April, 1926, between the said Governments in respect of double income tax shall be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new agreement, as I explained <Col N="1231" /> already in the Dáil, is necessary because of the substitution of sur-tax for super-tax.  It does not in any way alter the principles or the procedure on which relief from double taxation was given.  The agreement of 1926 fixed the principle of relief from double taxation so far as income tax is concerned on the basis that had been recommended by the Financial Committee of the League of Nations.  Briefly, the principle on which relief is and has been given since 1926 is that residents in Saorstát Éireann are exempt from British tax, that residents in Great Britain are exempt from Saorstátax, and that people who are doubly resident are relieved to the extent of the lower of the two taxes.  Before 1926 relief from double taxation was given on another basis.  A person resident in Saorstát Eireann, part of whose income arose in Great Britain, was subject to Saorstát income tax on all his income, and was subject to Saorstát tax and to British tax on the part of his income which arose in Great Britain.  On that part of the income which was doubly taxed he was entitled to relief from the two Governments&mdash;relief from the Saorstát to the extent of half of the lower of the two taxes, and relief from the British Government to the same extent.  That meant that the claiming of repayment and the securing of relief was a very complicated and difficult business, and led to a great deal of annoyance and delay.</P>
    <P>The new arrangement is very much simpler.  As I have said, it is not quite simple in the case of people doubly resident, but there is no way of making things entirely simple for them.  So far as the ordinary resident here is concerned, if he has been charged British tax he can reclaim payment on the whole on satisfying the British authorities that he is resident here.  From the Exchequer point of view, the arrangement entered into in 1926 proved to be a good arrangement and gave us additional income-tax.  It would be very difficult to fix a figure on it, but actually it was more beneficial to the Exchequer than the old system.  So long as we continue the principle of giving relief from double taxation, I <Col N="1232" /> think the present arrangement is as good as can possibly be devised.  I see no way in our circumstances of avoiding the giving of relief because the number of people, many of them in fairly modest circumstances, who have incomes that would be doubly taxed is very great.  If there was no system of relief from double taxation many of the people from whom we get very large sums of income-tax would entirely keep out of this country and great sums would be lost.  There are many people who have residences in the two countries, people with very large incomes. At present we get half the income-tax they pay.  If there was no system of relief and they had to pay a double tax they would take steps to see that they were not liable to our tax at all.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of charities. There are great numbers of charities that are now, because they are resident here, exempt from British tax under the existing arrangement and because they are charities in the Saorstát, are exempt from our taxation.  If there were no system of relief from double taxation they would be liable to British tax and they would find it impossible in any reasonable time to change their investments and escape the double taxation. There are not many countries which have the same need for a scheme of relief from double taxation as this country has.</P>
    <P>The history of the country is the cause of that, and the very close interlocking that exists.  As I have already said, the League of Nations in 1923 appointed a committee of economists who prepared a scheme of relief from double income tax and from other forms of direct taxation.  We, with Great Britain, then adopted so far as income tax is concerned the scheme that is there recommended.  As I have said, it is the most workable scheme that could be got.  It is the simplest and most convenient scheme that there could be for taxpayers, and one which, so far as our Exchequer is concerned, is more satisfactory than the scheme which was in existence before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say at the outset that I heartily welcome the proposal which has now materialised and has been made by the Minister in <Col N="1233" /> regard to double taxation.  He has been approached upon this matter for a good many years from various quarters.  I think he has now arrived at a fairly satisfactory solution, but as far as I can gather it is only satisfactory between Great Britain and the Free State.  I understood the Minister to say that this was under discussion during the proceedings in connection with the League of Nations.  I would like him to tell the House if, during these discussions, the question of relief from double taxation as between the component parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations was also discussed, because I think that is a question that demands immediate attention. As between Great Britain and ourselves, there now seems to be a fairly satisfactory solution, but the matter is quite different where the other Dominions are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take a case that I am particularly intimate with.  I knew a person living in this country who derived most of his income from Australia.  He was taxed for income tax as well as other taxes in Australia, and was also taxed for income tax in the Saorstát, so much so that he actually had to leave this country.  He is now living abroad practically on the amount that he would have had to pay in income tax here.  I know that the matter is one of considerable difficulty.  I am not minimising the difficulty in any way, but still the problem is there, and certainly it is one that calls for attention and immediate action.  There are many people in this country who derive their income from other portions of the British Commonwealth of Nations. They are, therefore, in a worse position to-day than if they derived their income from Great Britain itself.  I do not know whether this matter came up during the discussions at the League of Nations, but I think it is one that should have been discussed.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether any steps have been taken in connection with it, or whether any consideration has been given to the question. The question is one of very great importance owing, as the Minister himself said, to the circumstances in which we are placed here, and due to the fact <Col N="1234" /> that so many of our people derive their income from elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House assents to this Resolution, I think we ought to have some further information from the Minister in regard to the amendments covered by the new agreement. I would like for instance if the Minister would explain to me personally and also to the House the exact effect and meaning of Section 2 in the new agreement which it is proposed to substitute for Section 2 in the old agreement. I do not know if it would make my difficulty clearer to the House if I were to attempt to read one of the paragraphs in the new agreement, which states the manner in which the appropriate rate of tax is to be paid.  Paragraph c of sub-section (1) of Section 2 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c)  the appropriate rate of British income tax for any year shall in the case of a person whose income is chargeable to British income tax at the standard rate only be a rate ascertained by dividing the amount of tax payable by him for that year in respect of his total income (before deduction of any relief granted in respect of life assurance premiums or any relief granted under the provisions of Section 27 of the Finance Act, 1920, as amended by this Article) by the amount of his total income, and shall in the case of a person part of whose total income is chargeable to British income tax at a rate or rates in excess of the standard rate be the sum of the following rates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the rate which would have been the appropriate rate in the case of that person if his income had been chargeable at the standard rate only, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the rate ascertained by dividing the amount of the British sur-tax payable by that person for that year by the amount of his total income for that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess frankly that I do not understand what that paragraph is intended to convey, but surely it could have been worded in a plainer and more lucid fashion so that we would know what is proposed.  No doubt the Minister will be able to construe the <Col N="1235" /> new sub-section.  At all events, I think it is a sub-section that we should have some idea of before we pass it.  In regard to the general question, undoubtedly the question of double income tax is one that does cause a considerable amount of inconvenience to residents in the Free State, particularly to those who happen to have investments in England.  We should like, if possible, to have that inconvenience mitigated. At the same time we would like to have some further proof, than the opinion of the Minister, that the new arrangement is to the advantage of the Saorstát.  The Minister stated that it was difficult to give a figure.  If it is, upon what grounds does he come to the conclusion that the agreement is beneficial to us?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is one aspect of the problem which the Minister did not touch upon and which is a very serious one for this country: that is the position of joint stock companies doing a large part of their business here but which are registered in England&mdash;companies, for instance, such as Messrs. Guinness, the National Bank and practically all the principal shipping companies.  They pay no income tax in the Saorstát, not even under Schedule A.  It seems to me that the advantage of this new agreement would want to be very considerable indeed in order to counterbalance the disadvantage which we are under in respect of these companies.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like the House to consider.  It is whether it would not be advisable for the Minister to endeavour to remove from the scope of this agreement people who are living on pensions or superannuation allowances that are being paid by the people of the Saorstát and who are residing in England.  I think that a person drawing a pension from the Irish people could very well afford to pay income tax to the Irish people particularly in a case such as the very flagrant one which occurred some time ago where a gentleman who is drawing a pension of, I think, £3,400 a year from the people of this country wrote a book vilifying this country and vilifying his countrymen.  Though he was <Col N="1236" /> not very complimentary to the people who represent Republican principles in Ireland, I do not think it can be said that he was any more complimentary to the people who oppose us in that regard.  It seems to me that it is a scandal that we should have to pay very considerable sums of money in pensions, judicial pensions and others, to people who do not live in this country and who do not spend one penny piece here.  I think that, in equity at any rate, a very good case could be made for excluding these people from the operations of an agreement of the kind that we are now considering.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware, as a result of the confusion that existed prior to the introduction of the Bill, that a considerable number of comparatively poor people in the country who had Guinness shares are under the impression that they have been done out of the dividends due to them for the three years prior to the introduction of the measure?  I am informed that when they make representations they cannot get any satisfactory explanation from the authorities.  Many of them have spoken to Deputies here asking if we could get any information for them.  They state that they got the refund from the British side, but failed to get any refund from this side.</P>

      <P>With reference to what Deputy Goulding has said, I am afraid that the pre-1926 arrangement was not completely satisfactory.  As a matter of fact, it did not entirely cover the cases of some persons of whom the Deputy speaks.  That is to say, they were not given as much relief I think as they should have been given if the arrangement had been more carefully thought out.  They have some grounds for grievance, but I do not know that anything can be done about it.  The present arrangement makes their position satisfactory, except as regards the three years under which the first arrangement worked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty was that it was not legally due, and if it had been it would have been paid.  The Deputy might say that it was equitably due, but it was not legally due, and that was the difficulty.  With reference to what Deputy Redmond said, of course the League of Nations discussed the matter simply in general and recommended relief from double taxation as a general thing among the countries.  There was no reference to a particular country.  As to making an arrangement with Canada and countries like that, we have not taken that up.  It is doubtful whether those countries would agree to the only arrangement that would be practicable &mdash;that is, the present one, for they would derive no advantages under it, and we would derive such advantages as were to be obtained.  It is a matter which, while important to a certain small number of people, is not important to the Exchequer.  That is one of the reasons it has not been gone into.  I acknowledge it is a matter that, when we have time, we should completely explore, but until we had come to this agreement with the British and found it possible to adopt this system recommended by the League of Nations nothing could be done.  Except the two codes were similar the relief would not work at all.</P>
      <P>The only thing that would work amongst the countries that have dissimilar codes of income tax is the simple exemption on resident basis, but no attempt at relief by giving back half the income tax would work.  This system would work with Canada, United States, or any country, provided we found it possible to enter into an agreement with them.  As a matter of fact, very few people living in these countries derive their incomes from the Free State.  So far as they are concerned, it would not be worth their while doing anything about it, but it would be worth our while, for we may have people here drawing income tax from them.  The position might be that we would be anxious to enter into an agreement, but they would feel there was no inducement to do so.  The matter is one that might be explored.</P>

      <P>Some might agree, as a matter of principle, but it would be of no practical importance to those countries.  Deputy MacEntee asked for an explanation of sub-section (c).  I do not know whether I could make it much clearer to him.  The matter depends not on the standard rate of income tax or on the standard rate of super-tax.  Leaving out the question of sur-tax or super-tax altogether for the moment, if a person has an income of £500, and after deducting the various reliefs he gets to which he is entitled, he pays £5 in income tax, that is 100 shillings.  You divide by five his appropriate rate of tax, that tax is one-fifth of a shilling in the £, and he is given relief on his whole income to that extent. Relief is based on the appropriate tax, and not on the standard rate of tax. The section only deals with double residents and not with the ordinary citizens who live in one country, or another, but the people who are residents in two countries.  They are given relief by being returned half their appropriate rate of tax.  The appropriate rate is ascertained by dividing the total income tax paid by the amount of income, and then you will find that a man is not paying three or four shillings in the £ but 1/6 in the £ or some other rate, and then he is given relief to that extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>For instance, he is entitled to his earned income allowance and to various things.  You get the appropriate tax that way and give relief to half the extent.  Sur-tax is separate.  It is not payable until the next year, and you compute the two appropriate rates separately and add them together to get the sum to which he is entitled.  It is provided in sub- <Col N="1239" /> sections (e) and (f) that he gets these two reliefs in the two bites.  With reference to the point about Messrs. Guinness, under the old arrangement we would have got one-half the income tax payable by the firm.  It is a British firm registered in England.  The British would be entitled to charge income tax and we would be entitled to do so.  We would have to give relief on half the tax, and the British would have to give relief on half, that is, we would have to get one half of the income tax on the whole of Guinness's profits. The present position is that we get all the income tax on the dividends received by people resident here.  The person who lives here pays no British tax.  He is refunded by the British Government the amount of the tax deducted at source when the Company paid in tax to the British revenue authorities.  Some of the biggest shareholders, however, are doubly resident, and we get one half of their income tax. I have not gone into the firm of Guinness alone, but my opinion is that we are better off taking Guinness's alone than under the old arrangement, and that would apply to other companies of the same sort.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say it operates better in every case.  The Revenue authorities are satisfied that on the whole we do better under this arrangement.  The only thing that might make the arrangement unsatisfactory to us would be if people who are doubly resident ceased in large numbers to be doubly resident; we might then have to reconsider the whole agreement.  Matters being as they are, the arrangement works out satisfactorily.  What the Deputy said about pensioners living out of the country is all right taken by itself.  It takes two parties to make an agreement, and we can only make an agreement to cover everybody.  We adopted the general principle of taxing residents and exempting non-residents, and we could not have certain classes exempted from these general provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> If we wanted to do that it would simply mean that we would have to scrap that arrangement and probably fall back on the old system.  I mentioned the other night that to some extent the thing works both ways with us. Take the case of the Great Northern Railway Company.  It is treated here as a Saorstát Company, and we get all the tax, but we have to give relief to shareholders who are not residents. Previously the Company's profits had to be segregated.  There had to be an estimate arrived at.  It was a very difficult thing and, perhaps, the figures may not have been very conclusive; but an agreement had to be arrived at as to how much of the profits of the Company were earned in Northern Ireland and how much in the Free State.  The part that was earned in Northern Ireland was, of course, doubly taxed, the Company being a company resident here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it would not.  As long as this arrangement lasts we can tax our residents here in any way we like.  So far as the people who are doubly resident are concerned, they would probably cease to be doubly resident immediately that came into operation. In any case, the agreement can be set aside at any time.  It is only just as long as the legislation of both Parliaments confirming it remains in effect that the agreement stands.</P>

I mean I knew as to how the appropriate tax was to be calculated, but it seems to me that that is not what is done here.  There are in several places possible ambiguities in that sub-section which I think ought to be cleared up by better drafting.  The amount, for instance, &ldquo;ascertained by dividing the amount of tax payable&rdquo;&mdash;it does not say payable to whom and it ought to I think&mdash;&ldquo;by him for that year in respect of his total income.&rdquo; One would consider that the amount &ldquo;ascertained by dividing the amount of tax payable&rdquo; would be both British <Col N="1242" /> and Irish income tax.  It could be construed like that, because there is no specific reference to British income tax payable, which, I take it, is what is meant there.</P>

      <P>I am not complaining of the latitude given me.  The only point I really wanted to raise was a point which had already been raised by the Minister for Finance himself. I merely wanted to emphasise a point which he had, I think, very fairly put. He emphasised the fact that he was looking at this from the Exchequer point of view.  He was good enough and fair enough to say that two or three times.  From an Exchequer point of view&mdash;from the point of view of the unfortunate man who merely has to get in the finance&mdash;this double income tax relief scheme is working quite satisfactorily. I think that is the point which he put.  When the Minister for Finance is reduced to the condition of an animal that eats its young, which is practically the condition in which he is to-day, his view of what is good from the Exchequer point of view, and what is good from the very much wider point of view of the country, may be different. That is what I want to emphasise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadly speaking, I think everyone who has to pay income-tax, I mean everyone who knows he has to pay income-tax, is glad of the scheme for the relief of double taxation.  I am <Col N="1244" /> speaking with some experience, and as far as the ordinary person is concerned it is working quite well.  If you make an application for a refund you get it without any difficulty.  I think the Minister for Finance is entitled to have that stated, but the point which he has in his mind that he gets more than he loses by this transaction is one which, I think, not now, perhaps, but looking forward, he ought to consider.  If that proposition is true, I mean of the national as well as the Exchequer point of view, it must be a matter of complete indifference to the State who earns the money in the State.  Take now the case which I think was somewhat misunderstood&mdash;I am only taking it because it is a case of common knowledge&mdash;the case of the creameries that were supposed to be handed over holus bolus to Lovell and Christmas.  It is not a matter of indifference to the country in that particular case whether the ownership of property in Ireland is exported.  Take the case of some of the chocolate factories built up here, working very satisfactorily, and now transferred to foreign ownership.  That is not a matter of indifference to the country.  That is the point I want to emphasise.  According to the Minister so long as what he gets from the people who invest across on the other side in maintaining labour there and what he gets from people who come over here and buy up the ownership of productive means in Ireland balance in his favour, from the Exchequer point of view, that is all right.  But from another point of view it may be entirely different.</P>
    <P>I shall give the Minister an example. I do not want to mention the name of any particular representative now, but I shall give the name to the Minister if necessary.  One of his own foreign trade representatives was over here in Ireland and he came to Dublin.  He came for the purpose of getting samples of goods to bring them to the Continent for the development of trade.  By the time he got down to us in Cork I think he had an Irish wolf-dog. The explanation was that he could not get samples of manufactures which he was able or likely to introduce into foreign countries, because he would be bringing them over <Col N="1245" /> there to compete with then existing owners.  I am emphasising the point which the Minister himself previously put in a debate in this House, that foreign ownership of industry here means as a rule&mdash;at any rate branch ownership, that is ownership of branch manufacturing concerns here&mdash;that the export trade is practically impossible. We had that case of a trade representative of the Irish Free State anxious to get samples and coming away without them.  Suppose, for instance, he had taken some of Barrington's soaps or some other of the Lever commodities and brought them over to Germany he would have been in competition there with Lever's.  There is that distinct difference between a firm here with its own ownership.</P>
    <P>The point I am putting to the Minister is: I want him to consider this whole question of income tax or double income tax not from the mere Exchequer point of view, of getting money, which is perfectly legitimate, and which he himself is bound to take into consideration, but is not, and ought not to be the dominant view. Though he may get a greater revenue by this means, it may mean that there is going on an actual transference of the ownership of production here. People do not realise, I think, the significance of that.  We make up sometimes rather hypothetical balance sheets of trade in which we have what is known as trade balance.  But one thing not being taken into account, the significant thing and vitamin thing of the whole thing, is that one of the invisible exports is ownership of the Irish means of production.  If you analyse that out you will find that if an Irish firm is transferred to foreign ownership it creates a credit abroad for this country, and in so doing it does precisely the same thing as the export of goods, and two things that produce precisely the same effect are economically the same thing.  The transference of ownership in Ireland of Irish means of production is one of the significant and one of the most important and one of the most dangerous forms of invisible exports to which we are exposed.  When from the Exchequer point of view the Minister says he is getting the whole benefit in this <Col N="1246" /> matter, I want him to consider very carefully that there is a national point of view, which is somewhat different. We are not suggesting for a moment opposition to this, nor are we suggesting, at any time, in relation to technical financial expedients, critical opposition. In every case there are difficult problems to be solved, and you have to add up all the dangers against the advantages. Very often it may even be that the Minister who is actually contriving these things may not find it desirable to express to the House the whole of the reasons for or against a particular measure.  For instance, if we were to adopt an expedient of a particular kind and advertise widely that it was to our advantage against Czecho-Slovakia, you could imagine Czecho-Slovakia might wake up and say, &ldquo;There is more in this than we thought there was.&rdquo; I say that generally in relation to financial matters. We have another in relation to the increase of the Corporation Profits Tax. There are difficulties there.  I am not going to discuss the Corporation Profits Tax except in regard to administration. There are objections which could be pressed critically, but I am taking it that in relation to this case, and in relation to the Corporation Profits Tax, the measures taken by the Minister have tended to balance the evil against the good.  The only point I am putting now is that in every financial matter that comes before us we should recognise that there is a distinctly different point of view in relation to taxation, in relation to the getting and the spending of revenue, than the point of view which the Minister for Finance himself is bound to take as the principal point of view.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Flinn, I recognise that a point might be reached where the transfer of our industries to foreign control would be very serious.  It is a problem that we can always deal with.  When we reach the position, which I think we must reach fairly soon, of devising some way of getting the equivalent of the death duties in respect of the property of foreign companies here, we know that shareholders of these companies would still have to pay their death duties in <Col N="1247" /> England if they are in the English company.</P>
      <P>It might well be that that itself would, to some extent, operate to hinder the process of transferring ownership of industries to outside companies. I do not know whether it would be wise very soon to do much in that direction, because I feel that at present the important thing is to get industries started.  In quite a number of cases foreign firms have come in and have actually started new industries. That is entirely healthy in our circumstances, in my opinion.  Perhaps this is a little wide of what we were discussing. But the coming of foreign firms to take control of existing Irish industries is not in the same category; it is not so healthy.  At the same time I do not feel myself that we have reached the stage where we would not do more harm than good by taking action which would really put serious obstacles in the way of people who had the sort of skill and the resources&mdash;not merely the financial resources, but the technical resources&mdash;that would enable them to start industries here.  I admit that the point of view that Deputy Flinn has put has to be kept in mind. There may be a difference of opinion as to how soon or in what circumstances action should be taken.  I agree with him to this extent, that while industries may go on very well here, so far as the home market is concerned, under foreign control, they are unlikely to grow in the way, say, that Jacob's or Guinness's grew, or in the way that, in many countries, important industries grew.  That is, so far as industries under foreign control are concerned.  We are never likely to have the advantage of having an international market.  It is a very big question, and I think it is a little wide of this debate.</P>

      <P>I wish in the first place to complain that within eight miles of Cork city the post is only delivered two or three times weekly.  That is causing great inconvenience to the rural community.  Deputy Anthony congratulated the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister.  I wish to congratulate the farmers of Ireland on being in a position at last to carry out what was their war-cry during the past twelve months at two elections, namely, the abolition of the bonus.  We heard that cry from every platform, and I congratulate the Farmers' Party, through their leader, on being in a position to do so now.  He can do that, and at the same time solve the great problem which has agitated the mind of every Deputy, namely, how to turn the dead losses on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs into a profit.  In this Department the amount paid by way of bonus came to £606,510 and the loss during the twelve months amounted to about £548,000, so that this Budget could be balanced, having a credit balance of £58,000.  I think it is up to the Parliamentary Secretary to do this.  I congratulate the farmers in two ways: on getting relief from this sum of £606,510, or in definitely seeing exposed here the humbug preached on the Farmers' Party platforms during the last two elections.</P>

      <P>I am not going to make a speech.  I always like to get other people to make speeches for me.  I want, first of all, to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his conversion.  This is what he said in 1926:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to say that while I appreciate the efforts that have been made to economise in the Post Office <Col N="1249" /> service, and while I am glad to see that the Post Office is being run at a smaller loss than in past years, I think we should recognise that the Post Office is a business concern. ....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate him on his conversion, and his open confession this evening, that he believes the Post Office should not and cannot be run as a business concern, that it is a utility service and should be run as a utility service.  I could not make the case myself so well as the Parliamentary Secretary made it in 1926, so I will continue to read his speech:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am sorry the Minister has not seen his way to make some reduction in postal charges.  The Minister has shown that his revenue has decreased from year to year.  I am inclined to think that possibly the best way to increase revenue is to make a decrease in the postal charges.  I think it is generally found that people respond quickly to any decrease in postal charges, and if the price of a stamp for ordinary letters were reduced to 1½d., I believe that the response might actually bring in a greater revenue than the Minister gets on the twopenny stamps.  The present price certainly hampers and retards business.  People are slow to write letters when it would cost twopence for a stamp.  The same thing applies to charges for the delivery of telegrams in the rural districts.  That is nothing new.  We have made strong complaints already about it, and it is a pretty serious grievance that we who live in outlying districts have to pay such enormous charges.  I live just beyond the three-mile limit&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That was not the three-mile limit we were discussing last night&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and I have to pay one and sixpence for my telegrams on delivery. That means, for instance, that if I am going home, and if I telegraph to someone to meet me at the station, it costs 2/6, including delivery charge.  It would be almost as cheap for me to hire a car at the station as to telegraph for somone to come to meet me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be 6d. higher this time.  That <Col N="1250" /> is the only alteration that the Minister has made.  It would be much cheaper for the Parliamentary Secretary to hire a car this time than it was then.  He would be in a much better position in 1926 than he is now.  I do not propose to comment on that.  It is eloquent and is a confession by the Parliamentary Secretary that nothing can be done, and that those things that he believed in in 1926, he does not believe in now. It is a conversion I suppose.  Conventionality and consistency are bugbears to little minds, but I can very easily see that he has been converted, and I congratulate him on his conversion. There is only one other matter that I would ask for information on, and that is with regard to the preparation of the Telephone Directory.  In the country it is very difficult to find in the directory districts that one is looking for. There seems to be a craze for alphabetical order.  I once heard of a gentleman who put his children to bed in alphabetical order.  He would not put Bridget to bed before he put Annie. The Parliamentary Secretary seems to have a craze in that direction and it is not at all convenient for people in country districts.  If you circumscribe an area you can easily find people you want, but if you have to travel down Cork, Dublin, Bundoran, Tralee and all these places you certainly will not find it so easy.  I have no suggestions to make, and I repeat my congratulations to the Parliamentary Secretary on his conversion.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to think that I have had the misfortune of losing the greater portion of this debate, but I have had the privilege of hearing some few remarks which came from Deputy Flinn.  I have heard him complain&mdash;how it was relevant to the subject I do not know exactly&mdash;of the strength of the Army.  I wonder whether he was speaking of the British Army or of the Army of the Irish Republic. I think he escaped from both, and that he has, or should have, no grievance against either Army.  I have heard him complain of the Civic Guards.  So far as I know they have never given any trouble to Deputy Flinn.  I have heard him complain, in the third instance, of the postal service. <Col N="1251" /> I understand that we are at present discussing the postal service, and I would like to ask Deputy Flinn, and every member of the House too, speaking from post-Treaty times, if the postal service has ever been better run than at present.  When was there a time when there were less complaints against the postal service than there are to-day?  I agree that at all times&mdash; and I hope the time will never come when we will change&mdash;there ought to be a grievance against the postal service on every possible opportunity that arises.</P>
      <P>Another thing I gathered from Deputy Flinn was this: Regarding the Free State he asked who was working and who was not working.  I speak only for my own constituency, but when the Free State came into operation there was working in it an Englishman who was doing enormous good for my constituency.  Throughout the whole Free State he was spending money, and, despite all the calumnies you will hear of in this House, he was not, with his foreign capital, paying anything like cost price.  He was doing everything that he could, and he employed more men in the Free State than any other Englishman, or than any citizen of the Free State did.  He has gone to-day from us, and Deputy Flinn asks who is working to-day and who is not working.  I wish this man would come back to us, and I wish he would bring back his foreign capital. I wish he would remain in the Free State, and, so far as his foreign capital is concerned, he would be the most welcome Englishman in the Free State and the most welcome Englishman in West Cork that you could possibly conceive. I am sorry that he is not here to hear my encomiums of him, because both he and his father were the best employers of labour that we had in West Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a grumble every year for a number of years past with regard to the inefficiency of the postal service in my neighbourhood. <Col N="1252" /> I am glad to say that the cause of complaint has been removed and that the service is now entirely efficient.  But while I say that with regard to the postal service, my heart is broken and my temper is severely tried by the telephone service.  Reasons are given and excuses are offered for its deficiencies, and one of the excuses that is offered at the present time is that it is due to the introduction of the automatic service.  The automatic service is a great success, but it now forms an excuse for the inattention and the inaccuracy of the people in the Central Exchange when areas that are not yet placed under the automatic system wish to get into communication with you. Over and over again it happens that when one asks for a particular number one is either told that the number is engaged or that there is no response, when you hear a few minutes afterwards that the person you were calling up was actually sitting in the room with the telephone all the time.  Again, I do not think there is a day upon which I am not brought to the telephone four or five times with false calls. They can offer you no excuse except to say that it is due to the automatic system, when the automatic system has practically nothing whatever to do with it.  There is a lady who telephones fairly frequently to my house, and on three days of the present week in succession she was put on to the number that is next to mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My number is 61475.  I think it is quite possible that that number is much too severe on the memory of the ordinary operator.  We know what short memories people have with regard to many things, and it is quite possible that the operators are unable to carry that number in their heads for a length of time.  The number next mine is 61476, and that is being rung up constantly.  The gentleman there has a much better temper than I have, and he does not abuse the lady when he is called up.  Occasionally when I go to the telephone I am abused because a person has been wrongly put on to me, although I have gone to the trouble of answering it.  I do not want to make too much of this.  I can say this, that as far as the service is concerned <Col N="1253" /> one receives the greatest amount of politeness and the greatest amount of courtesy.  That was not always so.  I remember on one occasion when I complained to a male operator at 10 o'clock at night and he asked me when I would be ready to receive him to fight him.  I advised him to wait until the liquor that had got into him had cooled down, when perhaps his fighting spirit would be reduced in like proportion.  As far as civility is concerned, the people in the Central Exchange are extremely civil, and this defect must be due to the fact that their memories are not able to carry a big number, or to the fact that the persons who are calling are not good at pronouncing figures.  Finally I want to say that if the Parliamentary Secretary could cause a reduction in the expenses of his service at anything like the same rate of speed as that at which he read his statement to-day we would soon have a splendid reduction.</P>

There are a considerable number of things which I think would be worth inquiring into, but in view of the fact that I was not able to take down the figures, I do not know that I can add anything very useful to the discussion.  There was, for instance, a question as to what arrangements had been made in regard to the carriage of mails.  I find from the Appropriation Accounts for 1926-27 that the cost of the carriage of mails had remained practically stationary in the years 1925-26 and 1926-27, but that the cost of carrying the foreign mails had been reduced.  If we are faced with this fact, that we have falling transport costs and that the total amount spent in carrying the mails remains constant, I should like to know exactly what the increase in the number of letters carried is, so that I might be able to satisfy myself that the amount spent under this head is justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a significant figure.  When the Deputy enjoyed the liberty that I suppose belongs to a private member, he was one of the <Col N="1255" /> strongest critics of the Government in regard to its inefficiency, and naturally one would expect that next year there would be an improvement in postal services, and that the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for those services would have made up his mind that they would be improved, would have satisfied himself that they could be improved, and consequently that the loss to be met by the Exchequer would be something less than £362,000, the actual estimated loss for 1927-28.  Looking, however, at the estimates of receipts and expenditure supplied to the House, I find that actually next year the Parliamentary Secretary, the strong advocate of efficiency and economy when enjoying the liberty of a private member &mdash;contaminated, I suppose, by the bad company in which he found himself recently&mdash;is of opinion that, so far from the loss on running the postal services next year being only £362,000, it is going to be something like £673,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Deputy must be quoting Deputy Flinn's figures.  The estimated loss, as read out, for the year 1928-29 is £329,000. You may subtract from that the revenue which would accrue because of the additional sixpence on telegraphic charges of £66,000.  If you take that from £329,000 you get the actual estimated loss for the year 1928-9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that I have not the knowledge of arithmetic which the Parliamentary Secretary has, but I have managed to add up the receipts which it is estimated will be secured from the postal, telegraph and telephone services, according to the White Paper presented to the Dáil, and the total receipts amount to £1,751,860. The estimated expenditure in respect of these services is £2,425,000.  I may be wrong, but subtracting £1,751,000 odd from £2,425,000, I get £673,000 as the estimated loss on these particular services.  As I say, I may be wrong, but possibly the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to correct me and show how the loss is going to be much less than the amount which I have calculated. Even if he does, we have this point to consider, namely, that either <Col N="1256" /> the revenue from the Post Office has been deliberately under-estimated or the expenditure upon the Post Office has been deliberately over-estimated.  I think when we are considering the Estimates and when a Minister, or Parliamentary Secretary, comes to the House and presents Estimates they should not be presented in that fashion, and that the estimates in respect of any service should be the closest possible that could be made in respect of it.</P>
      <P>If the service is one which produces non-tax revenue the income from that service should be estimated as closely as possible, because, unless we are able to form a very exact and definite idea as to what our income and expenditure will be, we are going to deal loosely with money matters and we may find ourselves in the unfortunate position of the Minister for Finance of having, as Deputy Flinn stated a few days ago, to scavenge in every corner of the State, to turn out everybody's pockets, to find money which, after all, we may not require.  In connection with the efficiency of the Post Office, for which the Parliamentary Secretary took a great deal of credit, he quoted certain statistics.  I do not know how they were arrived at, but I can corroborate the statement of Deputy Sir James Craig that in some respects the telephone service is not at all as satisfactory as it should be.  I know one exchange to which my private residence is connected and I can vouch for the fact that I have been told that no reply could be got from that particular connection when there were at least five people in my own house.  Similarly, people in that house were told that they could get no reply from my office when that office was occupied.  I do not know whether that condition applies to the telephone service generally.  So far as the commercial end is concerned it is satisfactory, but in relation to that particular branch exchange to which I refer the position is very unsatisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other matter to which I would refer.  It has been stated here that, the Post Office being a utility service, it is not really <Col N="1257" /> necessary to consider whether we make a loss or a profit upon it.  I do not see any reason why, if being a utility service, it could not be run at a profit if proper regard were had to efficiency in its management.  The telegraph companies of America, in some areas at any rate, have practically the same problem with which we have to deal in regard to sparsely populated districts, yet the telegraph services are very profitable in America, though run by private companies. I do not see any reason why the State, provided it made up its mind that efficiency was going to be the only consideration that counted for promotion rather than favouritism or party affiliation, could not run a great public utility service, such as the postal and telegraph service, as efficiently as a private company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in many respects adopt that attitude also.  In connection with the Shannon scheme they have practically decided that the whole electrical industry of this country will be run by what is virtually&mdash;however under the Act theoretically it may appear not to be&mdash;a State service.  The plea put forward for running the electrical industry in that way was that this great utility service could be run more satisfactorily by the State than by a private concern.  Provided certain principles are accepted and adhered to, I believe that that is true, and I do not see any reason why, if that is true of the electrical industry, it ought not to be true of the Post Office which, after all, will serve a considerably greater number of customers, and which has the advantage of the fact that a great deal of the original capital put into the telegraph and telephone services has already been repaid.  It seems to me that it is not possible under the present system for the Post Office to operate satisfactorily.  We have those in charge of a Government service coming here, presenting statements of receipts and estimated expenditure, and asking us to vote money to make up a deficiency, but they never present us with a surplus.  The commercial accounts of these services are not available, at least, the commercial accounts of the Saorstát postal services have not been available since 1926, and then we <Col N="1258" /> are presented with a batch of accounts dealing with the years 1923-4-5-6.</P>
    <P>If these services were run as a commercial concern the Department would be in a position to present their accounts every twelve months.  They would be in a position to know at the expiration of one month or two months how the preceding twelve months had panned out for them as a commercial concern.  I would suggest that in future the commercial accounts of the Post Office should be published at the end of every twelve months or as near thereto as may be possible, and not to allow matters like this to drag for three or four years before they are presented to the Dáil and given to the public.</P>

      <P>There are two matters I want to bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I raised one of these matters before in November and he promised to give it consideration. That is the question of the cost of delivery of rural telegrams, or telegrams sent to country districts situated a long distance from the Post Office. I know several districts in Leix in which a delivery charge of from 2/- to 3/6 is made.  Taking that in conjunction with the present revised minimum cost of 1/6, it makes the cost of a telegram in these districts from 3/6 to 5/-. I think a cost of 3/6 to 5/- is prohibitive, and something should be done to level up the rate so as to give people who are not fortunate enough to live near a post office some consideration. Another matter regarding which there has been considerable complaint in country districts is the delivery of letters.  There are only two or three deliveries per week.  All members of the House will find the same grievance <Col N="1259" /> in their constituencies in regard to that matter, and I think that something should be done to devise a system which would give a better delivery in country districts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Suggestions have been made since I came into the House a short time ago that the Parliamentary Secretary has failed in the office he has taken up, that he has failed in his duty, and that he has not balanced the postal budget.  The postal budget has never been balanced.  The Estimates of previous years will show that we were losing, at one time, £1,500,000 on the Post Office in the Saorstát, and that with the system of economy that has been adopted we have been steadily reducing that deficit.  We have been bringing the loss down until we have now reached the lowest figure that has ever been reached during the last six years.  Almost all these economies have been effected at the expense of the rural population.  Complaints have been made about the postal facilities in some of the towns, especially in County Cork, that they had not two or three deliveries in the day.  Whenever we made the claim that every citizen of the State deserved equal service from the State and that he is entitled because of his citizenship to get equal service, we never had the support of representatives of the cities.  It has been the other way about.  There are three ways by which we could have a further saving and by which, perhaps, we could balance the postal budget.  One method is to raise the postal rate.  Another is to curtail the services with an additional curtailment of staff, but none of the Deputies who have charged the Parliamentary Secretary with not having balanced the postal budget had the courage of indicating in what direction we could do it.</P>

I do not think Deputy Gorey should refer to it as a low personal attack.  I think he should withdraw that and thus put himself on a higher plane.</P>

      <P>I certainly withdraw the words that you consider improper, sir.  I do say, though, that it would be more honest if the Deputy would give us some indication of the direction in which the postal budget should be balanced.  When we were dealing with the Budget statement of <Col N="1261" /> the Minister for Finance, I expressed satisfaction at the increase of the telegraph charges, provided it was going to replace the charges for delivery of telegrams in rural areas.  I have always held the view, and I hold it now, that there should be no extra charge for delivery in any part of the country.  I say every citizen in the State deserves equal service from the State and because citizens live in rural areas they should not be penalised.</P>
      <P>It may be said, and it has been said here, that it was always so and that it is even so in England, but that does not prove that the system is right and it does not prove that it is equitable. People in the country have to put up with many drawbacks.  They have to live out in rural areas where there are no amusements, and where services are not to be had and these State services that they are paying for as much as any other citizen in this State are denied them, and they are denied them because they live in rural areas far away from the centres of population.</P>
      <P>Do you want the whole people to live in communities so that there should be no rural population?  Many people are living in rural districts because of necessity.  Creameries situated outside in certain rural areas have to pay as much as 2/6 for the delivery of telegrams and I know creameries that have to pay as much as 3/- for the delivery of a telegram.  That is absolutely unfair.  It would be just as just that postal charges should be increased in the case of letters for dwellers in the rural areas.  A 2d. stamp will take a letter to a dweller in an urban area.  If a dweller in a rural area had to pay threepence for stamping a similar letter it would not be equitable and it is just the same in the case of the telegrams. The argument is as sound in one case as it is in the other.  We, in the rural areas have been up against that all our lives.  It was a heritage given to us, but, as I said, that does not prove that it is right, and I hope that this increase in the charges for sending telegrams to people will wipe out the injustice inflicted on certain citizens of the State in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see in what direction there <Col N="1262" /> is going to be any further curtailment. I was quite prepared for the suggestion that if there is to be any curtailment that curtailment is to be made at the expense of the rural population.  There are to-day many districts in rural areas with three deliveries per week and some even with only two deliveries in the week.  It was Deputy Flinn, I think, who suggested that it would be better to do without some of those services which cause the State a half a million of an annual loss, and give them something back in return.  Who is going to get the something back in return?  If the rural population is going to do without postal services, if they are to have no increase in their postal services, or even if there is to be a curtailment of the services they have, are these people to get the full benefit of the half-million pounds, or is the half-million to be distributed to all the citizens of the State?  Let us have some clear thinking on that matter.  I have heard some Deputies here from time to time complain that some of their constituents living in urban areas have not had three deliveries of letters daily.  Well, there are only two or three deliveries in some rural districts.  Yet, in some of those districts as much as 3/- and in cases that I know 5/- extra has had to be paid for the delivery of a telegram.  I do not know what the policy of the Opposition is on this matter.  It would be well if the Opposition would declare themselves.  Do they stand for equal services for all the citizens of the State? I do, anyhow, and I have always stood for it.  I hope that in the next Budget equal services will be provided for every citizen of the State in the matter of postal and telegraph services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join with Deputies Gorey and Corry in appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary to review the charges for the forwarding and delivery of telegrams.  I think this is the second or third occasion in which Deputy Gorey has made this appeal to the House.  Now, he is making an appeal to a past colleague of his own and to a member of the Farmers' Party, and I hope that that appeal will not fall on deaf ears.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us this evening that the average <Col N="1263" /> charge for sending a telegram was 1/3½, whereas the average cost of a telegram was 2/5.  The Minister for Finance in his Budget statement announced an increase in the charge, that is the minimum charge, for a telegram from 1/- to 1/6.  The Minister for Finance, in making his Budget statement and dealing with this matter, lead the House to understand, or gave it as his own personal opinion, that 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. of the telegrams sent by people in this country were sent by betting men, bookies, or that they were sent by fathers and mothers to their children who were getting married congratulating them, or that they were sent condoling with the relations of people who died.  I do not take that view.  I agree with Deputy Gorey that a big section of the people of this country in the rural areas live far away from places where there is a possibility in the near future, at any rate, of having a telephone system installed. There is an idea in the minds of the official advisers of the Post Office that by imposing higher charges, or by making it more difficult to send telegrams, you will make the people of this country make greater use of the telephone system at their disposal.  In the statement that the Parliamentary Secretary made here this evening, he did not give anything in the shape of figures which would lead any Deputy to believe that he was in any way energetic in pushing the telephone system throughout the country.  At any rate, telephones will only be erected in places where there is a possibility of getting a certain revenue, that is in villages and towns.  These villages and towns are in many cases far away from people who will, and must, always make use of the telegraphic service.  I think it is unfair to the sender of telegrams&mdash;and it is the sender who gets the benefit&mdash; it is unfair to him to make a charge of 1/6 and expect at the same time that the receiver may have to pay double that charge on that telegram.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will put into practice what he preached when appealing from the centre benches here supporting Deputy Gorey in appeals made to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="1264" /> in the past.  I feel now in joining Deputy Gorey in this matter, and in making an appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to make a charge which will cover the cost of forwarding and delivering the telegram, that I am not appealing in vain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an item, conveyance of mail by air, to which I want to call attention.  Under this sub-head for £30, I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to inform us if there is in contemplation any scheme for the development of the air services between the Saorstát and any other country.  I note that in this morning's paper there is a report of a question asked in the British House of Commons concerning the possibility of the development of a system by which seaborne mails would be taken by aeroplane from Ireland to England, or to the Continent, in order to avoid the delay in the transit of these mails.  I do not know if the member in the English House of Commons who asked that question had any information which we did not happen to have, and if so, I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would inform us what is the position.  The recent successful Atlantic flight has undoubtedly aroused interest in air service in this country, and there is no doubt that if the air-mail services are to be developed they will come as a result of postal subvention, just as the mail packet services came in the past.  It will be very largely the responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that these arrangements will be made and that these services will be started.  I am sure he has had the matter under consideration, and I will be glad if he will tell us what steps he proposes to take in this connection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of air mails is shown in E 4, and the amount of £30 under that item is only for the charges which we might be called upon to pay in regard to mails which might be sent from this country directed to go by the air mail routes outside of this country.  There are three such routes; one is the London Continental Air Route; the second is the Cairo to Baghdad route, and the <Col N="1265" /> third is the New York-San Francisco Air Route.  Any poster of letters in this country has a right to send his letters so that they can be forwarded by air mail and stamped accordingly. The demand for this service is very limited, and the Vote here is a token vote.  With regard to the bigger general question which the Deputy raised, the question of the air service is not exclusively a matter for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. As a matter of fact, if it were I think there would be very little chance of any air route being established.  The demand for an air postal service between this country and the Continent is practically negligible, and if the establishment of any air route is to depend on local demands, I think it very unlikely that it will be established. There are many other Departments concerned in the establishment of an air route emanating from the Saorstát, and I am sure that the Deputy's suggestion will receive consideration. Probably it has been receiving consideration in the several Departments concerned.  So far as my Department is concerned, if we can help we will be prepared to do so, but we see no great sign that there is any demand for an air service in this country at the moment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general question, I take it that in making my final statement I will not have to deal with any details.  As regards the general criticism made on this Estimate, particularly from the Benches opposite, I must say that I have a feeling that they showed almost a complete lack of knowledge of the postal service and a complete lack of study even of the Estimate which was placed before all Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the statement I made, I thought it desirable to make a rather elaborate statement, because I believe that the people of the country, and particularly Deputies, should have an understanding <Col N="1266" /> and a realisation of the whole postal service and the effects of any changes which might be suggested or might be made.  As regards the figures quoted in my statement, most of these are explained in publications that are available for Deputies if they desire to see them.  As far as the actual figures quoted by me are concerned, they are simply an extension of figures quoted in recent years, and any Deputy who went to the trouble of reading the statements made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in previous years would have a very general knowledge of the conditions of the service.</P>
      <P>Listening to the statements and criticisms made by Deputies on the opposite Benches, I had hopes, in view of the policy expounded, particularly by Fianna Fáil Deputies, with regard to economy, that I might get some helpful suggestions and that at least accurate figures would be quoted.  With the exception of Deputy Lemass, I found very little to justify that hope. The figures quoted by Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Flinn had no relation to any figures which I have in the papers before me.  The figures they quoted bear no relation either to figures quoted by me in my statements. When I heard Deputy MacEntee's statement I thought for the moment that he was actually unaware that there was such a thing in existence as a commercial account in the Post Office. Towards the end of his speech I found he was aware of that.  He quoted the estimates of expenditure, and as against these the estimated revenue, and he suggested that the difference between the Estimate and the revenue was an actual loss to the Post Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will allow me to finish.  The Deputy took it that the difference between the estimated expenditure and the estimated revenue meant an actual loss to the Post Office, and he did not seem to realise that there was such a thing in existence in the service as a commercial account.  He must not have <Col N="1267" /> been here or he must not have listened to the opening paragraph in my statement, in which I explained that there was no real relationship and no definite information as to the total loss to the Post Office to be derived from the estimated figures of expenditure and of revenue.  Not only that, but the Deputy need not have gone to the commercial accounts at all; he could have satisfied himself from the Estimates, if he had looked up page 252, where he would have found figures showing that, in our accounting, certain services rendered by us are taken into account and certain services rendered for us by other Departments are taken into account and, before any realisation of the finances of the Post Office could be arrived at, these figures should be considered. If that is the type of criticism we are to face, I can hardly describe it as criticism at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flinn, when quoting the ostensible figures showing the loss on the Post Office in accordance with our commercial figures, quoted some figures which are not officially in existence at all.  One cannot deal with that form of criticism.  A great deal of capital has been made out of my past references to the postal services by Deputies here who have gone to the trouble of reading past statements of mine on the Estimates.  At least there is one thing that Deputies will have to give the members of the Farmers' Party credit for in regard to our criticism of finances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass's criticism was at least an attempt to face the facts and to deal with certain figures.  He confined himself principally to general figures which, in reducing expenditure, would be of very little help.  He confined himself to the figures relating to the cost of the Headquarters Staff since the establishment of the Post Office here and he compared the increase in the cost of the Headquarters staff with the other services in the Post Office.  The explanation of that is that at the taking over of the Post Office Service there was no real Headquarters staff in existence.  There was a certain skeleton formation here and we had to build our Headquarters staff up and the process of building it up is now about completed.  We have now almost completed our Headquarters staff.  Up to quite recently the members of the headquarters staff were temporary, and if the Deputy will look at the Estimates he will find in almost every sub-head that he quoted from that, although the number of the staff has increased, the amount estimated for the payment of temporary staffs has decreased to a great extent, and in some cases it more than balances the actual increase.  In regard to headquarters, we have made up an established staff to a large extent, and as far as we can, we are getting rid of the temporary unestablished staff.  That is a desirable course to adopt, and it will hardly be criticised very severely.</P>
      <P>Regarding the loss to the Post Office, we are dealing with that matter, and it is hardly necessary for me to repeat that we have steadily, from the taking over in 1922, reduced the loss.  The loss in 1922 was £1,000,000, and it has steadily gone down until it is now estimated for the coming year that the loss will be only £266,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very genuine achievement <Col N="1269" /> on the part of the Post Office service, and one that I think the officials ought to be proud of.  The statement has been made that the losses on the Post Office service cannot be wiped out until the service is run as a commercial concern.  It is a matter for the Dáil to decide whether or not the service is to be run as a business institution.  If that is decided on, then the commercial community and the people generally will have to face up to certain implications that must follow from that.  One would be that certain services which are still unremunerative must be lopped off.  It is generally recognised, I think, that it is not desirable either economically or politically to still further reduce our services.  I believe that, if I were to come to the Dáil with the suggestion that rural and urban deliveries should be still further reduced, the Dáil would not give its sanction to that.  On the other hand, I do not hold out the hope that the Post Office is never at any time going to be a paying institution.  I believe that eventually it will become a paying proposition, and that we are advancing along that road at present.  The pace in that direction must of necessity be a bit slow.  Investigations have been made with the view to effecting economies, but as we get nearer and nearer to the problem we find that under present conditions it is no easy matter to effect economies.  While I have hopes that there will be a gradual reduction in the losses on the Post Office service, I still think it will take a considerable number of years before we will be in the position that our revenue and expenditure accounts will balance.  That will depend, of course, to a very large extent upon the economic condition of the country.  With improved economic conditions, there will undoubtedly be an increased demand for the postal service in its various branches.  That would lead to increased revenue and to a reduction in the operating costs.  Economies are gradually being made in the service, but I am afraid that a certain number of years must pass before the losses on the Post Office service will be entirely wiped out and before it becomes what I might call a solvent institution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> Deputy Lemass referred to certain of the postal services upon which we are losing money.  He referred to the rates for printed papers and to parcels delivered in the country.  In regard to the printed paper rates, they form part of the International Convention under which we are obliged to act.  While the Saorstát Post Office is a member of the International Convention, it is bound to abide by the regulations of the Convention.  One of the regulations is that the rates on printed paper shall not be increased.  With regard to parcel delivery charges, the Deputy is aware that an additional charge of 6d. was imposed on parcel deliveries.  That additional charge had the temporary effect of reducing the number of parcels coming in here from outside sources.  It was only a temporary effect, however, and the actual number of parcels now coming in is about equal to the number coming in at the time the additional delivery charge was put on.  It is, of course, a matter for argument as to whether this delivery charge might not be further increased.  If such a course were followed, certain implications would ensue from that. Commercial people and others in the country are interested in the matter, and I submit it is not a charge which could be increased off-hand or without taking cognisance of the effects it would have on the general trade of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass quoted some figures with regard to losses on the telephone service.  His figures were not quite correct. In the year 1924 the loss on the telephone service was £3,348.  I think the Deputy stated that in that year the service was a paying one.  That is not so.  The telephone charges were decreased in 1925, and in that year the loss on the service amounted to £33,976.  In the subsequent years, the loss slightly increased until, in 1928, the estimated loss was £59,000.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in my opening statement the development of the telephone service is likely to lead to an increase in the loss temporarily.  When exchanges are put up throughout the country under the scheme of extending the telephone service, you are not likely to get a sufficient number of subscribers <Col N="1271" /> at the start to make a particular extension a paying proposition.  The interest in the capital expenditure involved in making new extensions has to be met year after year.  When extensions are made in thinly populated areas throughout the country you are bound to meet with slight losses at the start, but as the advantages of these extensions become recognised and appreciated throughout the country, it is hoped that the losses on the service will be decreased and that eventually it will be possible to balance expenditure with income.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the figures from 1922 on.  The original loss was £42,000.  That loss subsequently decreased to £3,000, but when the old telephone charges were decreased in 1925 and the new charges substituted, the losses on the service again increased.  With regard to Press telegrams, the loss on them is principally due to the excess of incoming Press material.  The question of the handling of that and of the losses sustained in connection with that branch of the service is receiving departmental consideration, but we have not yet arrived at any decision as to whether it will be possible to make such readjustments as will remunerate us in part for the losses we are suffering owing to the excessive amount of Press material coming in here from outside sources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The loss on Press telegrams is about £19,000 a year.  A good deal of the loss is due to the fact that there is a surplus of incoming Press telegrams from outside places.  It has to be considered whether anything <Col N="1272" /> in the nature of an increased charge for Press telegrams in this country might not have the effect of stimulating supplies of news from outside sources rather than from sources within the country.</P>

      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary taken into consideration the fact that the telegraph service has been relieved very considerably by the various newspaper offices in Ireland&mdash;I refer particularly to the offices in Cork and Dublin&mdash;through the setting up of the Creed machines?  I also put it to the Minister, is it not a common practice, in business at any rate, to give a certain remission to large consumers, which the Press of necessity are so far as their relations to Press telegraphy are concerned, and has the Parliamentary Secretary taken that into consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that there is a specially low rate for the Press, and he may if he likes regard that as a concession to a large consumer.  Telegraphy has been quickened and improved by the Creed and other machines.  With regard to the delay in trunk calls, it is impossible to deal with details of that kind.  If the Deputy or any other person has a complaint to make regarding delay or inefficiency that complaint should be made to the supervisor, or to headquarters, and then we can deal with the actual official concerned.  But, and I call Deputy Sir James Craig's attention to it, we cannot deal in a general way with complaints.  We must get specific cases and we can deal with them.  The delay in making calls is not always the fault of the telephonist or of our service. It is very often due to the caller, perhaps because of indistinct pronunciation or giving a wrong number, or carelessness.  With regard to the telephone service, there has been an all round improvement in the matter of speed since the taking over of the service by the Free State Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass made a point with regard to ex-National Army candidates getting employment in the Post Office. The policy so far as ex-Army men is concerned is the general policy of the Government, which is to give preference <Col N="1273" /> to ex-Army candidates.  It is not for me to argue why that preference is given.  It is given for obvious reasons, but I understand relaxations are being made in that respect.  Speaking from memory, I believe in regard to recent employment in our service that we were instructed to give first preference in employment to ex-National Army candidates with families, second preference to candidates who were not ex-Service men but who had families, and then following that to the men who had been in the National Army but who have not families.  That is my recollection of the existing regulation regarding temporary or other employment in the service.  We are constantly inundated with applications for jobs and we had to turn away all classes of men, ex-Army and others, because of our inability to give them employment.  A man who is turned away may go to a Deputy and say, &ldquo;I am turned away because I am not an ex-National Army man,&rdquo; but the fact is that we have to turn away people every day because we cannot give them employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy and others raised the question of telephone extensions to rural districts.  I outlined, in my opening statement, our general policy with regard to the extension of the telephone service in rural districts. Since taking over the postal service we have pursued the policy of extension all over the Free State.  It will be found on examination that our trunk routes extend to every town in the Free State, and we are gradually extending our rural facilities, but, naturally, our extensions must be governed by financial considerations.  We can, if we like, establish extensions, but at a loss.  We cannot establish exchanges and call offices unless we are satisfied there is a reasonable prospect they will be a paying proposition.  As to the high cost of exchanges mentioned by Deputy G. Wolfe in certain places, the cost to the users of telephones is governed by the cost of the establishment of the exchange and the necessary wire connections.  Sometimes it happens when we have a limited number of exchange users where the exchange is established they have to bear the whole cost.  The original cost is capitalised, and the annual charge has <Col N="1274" /> to be borne by the local users of that capital cost, plus the cost of operating the local exchange.</P>
    <P>The charge in these cases, I am afraid, must remain high.  I think, as I said in that connection in my opening statement, that the use of the telephone in a rural district must to a large extent depend on the use which is being made of it in the towns, and that the outlying villages are not likely to make use of the telephone unless for the purpose of getting into communication with the principal business people in the towns.  The telephone habit has not yet caught on as it ought to in this country, so that the number of users is still comparatively small.  Our policy for the future, having covered the greater part of the country with our trunk lines and lines of exchange, will be to canvass all the towns and rural areas in order to get a greater number of users, and so make it cheaper and be an inducement to those who are anxious to become users.  Deputy Wolfe made reference to the Ballymore-Eustace postal route.  Arrangements are being made to establish a motor mail route on the Ballymore-Eustace line in substitution for the present train service.  I expect it to be in working order probably within a month.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe made some complaint because of a charge on a telegram owing to an office being closed.  It is a fact that when the delivery office is closed, and the delivery has to be made from a different office, the person receiving the telegram has to bear the charge from the office from which the delivery is made.</P>

That is a matter of detail which I cannot deal with without having the actual details and the Post Office information as well as the Deputy's.  If there are matters like that which the Deputy wishes to deal with, he can do so by putting down a question or writing a letter and I will give him an answer.</P>

      <P>If the standard of efficiency is not better than the Deputy's knowledge of figures, it is not very high.  Deputy Redmond referred to the status of the Waterford staff and mentioned that the staff is graded as Class II. instead of Class I.  As a matter of fact, they are graded as Class III.  Dublin is the only Class I. office.  There are a certain number of offices, like Blackrock, Bray, etc., which are graded as Class II., but Waterford happens to be graded as Class III.  This grade goes back to the old British times.  This matter has received consideration, and is again receiving consideration, and I believe that a definite announcement will be made within the next few months as to the future grading of the Waterford staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry referred to rural deliveries, to the advisability of economy and the necessity for saving money on the Post Office service.  I will give him credit for making one concrete suggestion. He said that the bonus of the Post Office servants amounts to £606,000.  I believe that is correct.  He also stated that, it having been the policy of the Farmers' Party that the bonus should be wiped out.  I should take steps to wipe it out.  It has not been the policy of the Farmers' Party that the bonus should be wiped out.  I <Col N="1276" /> did not, as a member of that Party, at any time sign such a pledge.  The Deputy might have gone to a little further trouble with regard to his figures.  He did go to the trouble of getting the correct figure as to the amount of the bonus, but he said that if the bonus was wiped out it would, in fact, balance the actual loss on the Post Office.  He gave the loss on the Post Office as £548,000. The actual loss, as I said in my opening statement, is now estimated at something like £266,000.  If you are to deal with Deputies who have not gone to the trouble of finding out the difference between £266,000 and £548,000, there is no means of arguing with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">

      <P>The Deputy did not say that that was the policy of his Party.  He did not say if his Party are standing behind that policy.  If they are, they ought to say it.  So far as any tangible contribution to actual saving on the Post Office from the other side is concerned, the only contribution, in addition to Deputy Corry's suggestion of wiping out the bonus, came from Deputy Lemass, and that was that we ought to consider the salaries of our officials which exceed £1,000.  As regards salaries which exceed £1,000, the Deputy will find on examination that there is only one official who has a substantive salary exceeding £1,000, and that is the Secretary. We have had it emphasised from the Benches opposite that the Post Office ought to be run as a business and commercial institution.  I put it to Deputy Lemass that if a business institution, controlling and handling the amount of work that the Post Office controls, dealing with an expenditure of approximately two and half millions per year, existed in the country, would he think it too much to pay the head of two, three, four or five departments controlling that institution £1,000 year?</P>

      <P>Deputy Hogan (Clare) referred to the Telephone Directory and the advisability of not having it in its present alphabetical form, but in circumscribed areas.  As a matter of fact, the Directory did exist at one time in that form, but there was a general expression of feeling in favour of the present system.  There are some who suggest a reversion to the old system, but it is hard to know what people want&mdash;some want the old system and some the new.  It is a matter which might be considered later on. Deputy Hogan also raised the question of rural porterage charges.  A good deal of reference was made to my past Dáil history in that regard and the statements I made.  It is a matter which I have given a great amount of consideration to since I became Parliamentary Secretary, and I do hold the opinion that rural porterage charges are somewhat too high.  That, in fact, the man who receives a telegram, as things now exist, has to pay the full cost of the delivery&mdash;the payment covers the full cost, whereas the sender does not pay the full cost of delivery. There is still a loss.  Possibly that loss might be distributed.  I am considering the matter, and hope to put before the Minister for Finance some suggestions which, if accepted, might have the effect of some reduction in the cost of porterage in rural areas.  All these suggestions must be governed by financial conditions, <Col N="1278" /> as any alteration or change of that kind must mean loss of revenue to the Post Office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flinn thought fit to indulge in some caustic remarks with regard to the postal service and with regard to me as Secretary in charge of postal service.  When I hear Deputy Flinn starting to speak in this House I always think of Goldsmith's &ldquo;Deserted Village&rdquo; and the school-teacher with all the children surrounding him, and looking up at him with admiration, and of the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And still they gazed and still the wonder grew</P>
      <P>How one small head could carry all he knew.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I can imagine the Fianna Fáil Party looking with wonder and with expressions of admiration upon Deputy Flinn and his wonderful exposition of economies, and wondering how one small head could carry all he knew. Having listened to the mountain groaning in labour and hoping it would produce something, the only concrete suggestion that emanated from the Deputy's speech was that we should put into this Department a superman, just as the Deputy would put a superman into all the other departments. Knowing from Deputy Flinn's method of delivery and from his whole action in the Dáil, the very egotistical ideas that possessed him I suggest his notion is that he himself should be the superman that would be put in to take charge of the Post Office.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee by implication is trying to make capital out of certain recent changes that took place.  For the information of Deputies on the other side of the House, I wish to say that the principal reason that actuated the Farmers' Party and which has actuated me as leader of the Farmer's Party in taking <Col N="1279" /> the action we did was the fear that if we did not take that action we might have men like Deputy Flinn put in charge of the Departments of the country.  I think I have now covered the many points raised by Deputies.  In my general statement I covered, as far as possible, the present policy of the Post Office.  I want to apologise for having been unduly long and perhaps having read that statement rather hurriedly, but the statement will be on the records of the Dáil and doubtless Deputies can amuse themselves and enlighten themselves on the subject by reading it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one question I would like to have cleared up; that is the discrepancy between the Estimates, as issued in the Book, and the Estimates of receipts and expenditure presented by the Executive Council.  In the course of his speech the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fact that I, apparently, had omitted from my calculation the allowance made for services rendered to other departments.  He referred to page 252 of the Estimates.  On that page I find that the total amount which was really spent upon this Department, or which it was proposed to spend on it, was £2.625,320.  The estimated value of the services rendered by the Post Office Department to other Departments is £250,000.  Subtracting that amount I find that, allowing for the services rendered to other departments, the net cost is £2,375,000.  The actual figure furnished in the White Paper is £2,425,000, and the difference between them is £50,000.  I pointed out in my speech that last year this Department had made a net loss of £360,000, but on the figures furnished by the Executive Council, apparently under the advice and guidance of the Parliamentary Secretary, it was anticipated that next year there would be a loss of £673,000. There is a correction of £50,000 to be made, but that still leaves an estimated loss of £623,000.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to reconcile that loss with the actual loss of £360,000 for last year.  Is it because he anticipates that in the current year the Department will be run with much greater <Col N="1280" /> efficiency, or lesser efficiency, than last year to the extent of £260,000?</P>

      <P>It is extremely difficult to deal with amateur economists who have not gone to the trouble of looking up the figures.  The Deputy in effect is comparing two things not comparable.  He is comparing the difference between estimated expenditure and receipts, plus certain adjustments, shown in this book with the commercial accounts.  If he will examine the commercial accounts he will see that there are many other things taken into account, such as depreciation, interest, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The full amount of the Vote for the Broadcasting Service for the current financial year is £27,355&mdash;a reduction of £1,700 on the amount voted last year.  Expenditure last year was £29,050 and receipts amounted to £12,271 from licénces; £26,000 (approximately) from the import duty on wireless apparatus; and miscellaneous receipts £96, making a gross revenue of £38,367 and, after deduction of cost of collection of 10 per cent.. net receipts of £34,531, giving a surplus of £5,481, resulting entirely from increased yield of the import duty.</P>
      <P>Five thousand additional licences were issued during the year, making a total of 24,000&mdash;or eight licences per 1,000 of the population.  The number of licences for the current year is estimated at 32,000.  Increase beyond this figure will depend mainly upon the development of the service, but an eventual total of 60,000 licences or one in fifty of the population is probably a conservative figure.</P>
      <P>The question of development is receiving close attention.  We wish to bring easy reception of Irish broadcasting within the reach of as many of the people as possible.  There are, however, serious problems, technical and otherwise, to be overcome.  The wavelength question is one on which international co-operation is essential, but various alternative schemes of giving a service to increased numbers of listeners are now being carefully examined.  The delay in development is unavoidable, but it might eventually prove to be an advantage, as we will be able to profit by the experience of other countries in dealing with the problems involved, and thus ensure that the scheme of development adopted will result in the maximum technical efficiency and give the best service to the public.</P>
      <P>Expenditure in excess of current revenue will be necessary for development, but it is believed that any money provided would be recovered from broadcasting receipts within a few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vote now before the House provides only for the Dublin and Cork Stations, and it will probably be necessary to present a Supplementary Estimate covering development proposals later.  There has been a considerable <Col N="1285" /> improvement in the general standard of programmes during the past year. Whilst entertainment must, perhaps, remain the chief function of broadcasting, it is the policy, as far as practicable, to direct and develop public taste by always giving in the programme something a little better than the average listener wants and so to create gradually a demand for the best in everything, whilst at the same time providing a sufficiency of light entertainment for simple recreation and amusement.</P>
    <P>Special features of the musical programme have been a series of symphony concerts given in public in Dublin. Many operas have been given in full, including &ldquo;Il Trovatore,&rdquo;&ldquo;La Traviata,&rdquo;&ldquo;Lucia di Lammermuir,&rdquo;&ldquo;Lurline,&rdquo;&ldquo;The Rose of Castille&rdquo; and &ldquo;Les Cloches de Corneville&rdquo;; also a very fine rendering of Hayden's Oratorio, &ldquo;The Creation,&rdquo; was given. Much development of these special performances is hoped for next season. We have also relayed occasionally items of B.B.C. programmes, such as the big symphony concerts and operas, which it would be clearly impossible to produce in our own stations.  A relay of American stations was tried recently and proved fairly successful.  It is hoped also to arrange for occasional relays of Continental programmes next winter, when the conditions will be more favourable than during the summer.</P>
    <P>As regards other programme items, it may be of interest to mention that a novelty last winter was a debate on Free Trade versus Protection.  It is hoped to arrange in future for similar debates between well known persons on subjects of general public interest. The educational side of broadcasting has also been developed, but it is hoped to do much more in this respect in the future, both in the way of adult and juvenile education.  Domestic economy subjects have been fully covered in the programmes, and a series of lectures on health and hygiene has been given.</P>
    <P>A special course of &ldquo;talks&rdquo; on farming subjects is being broadcast by specialists of the Department of Agriculture, and extensive market reports for farmers are given weekly.  Special <Col N="1286" /> prominence is, of course, given in programmes to the Irish language, Irish history, music and all subjects of importance to the development of the national characteristics of our people.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Advisory Committee has been very helpful in regard to programme construction, and its recommendations have been adopted, so far as possible.  There has, of course, been criticism of programmes, but every broadcasting service has to face much the same kind of criticism.  It arises mainly from the fact that it is impossible for even the richest broadcasting organisation in the world to please everybody all the time.  The money available for broadcasting in the Free State amounts to a little over £30,000, as compared with income approaching a million pounds of big broadcasting organisations in other countries.</P>
    <P>Differences in taste about cancel out &mdash;as many people like as dislike almost every programme item, and it remains, therefore, the very difficult task of the directors and the Advisory Committee to arrange programmes to please at least most of the people most of the time.  It can be claimed that steady, all-round progress has been made, but it is admitted that it will probably be slow until the problem in regard to station development has been solved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that I have not any complaint so far as the programmes of the Broadcasting Station are concerned.  I think that the programmes can compare very favourably with those of any other country; I mean so far as we can gather from reading the papers.  But my complaint is that we cannot get the programmes.  So far as those down the country who possess receiving sets are concerned, it is all the same to them whether the programmes of 2 RN are good or bad, because they cannot get them, and that is the real difficulty.  I am informed by those who are supposed to be authorities on the matter, that the strength of the station is not sufficient, and that if it were three kilowatts instead of one and a half the reception all over the country would be much better than it is at present.  As far as I am concerned, following the programmes <Col N="1287" /> from day to day in the papers, I think they are very good programmes, considering the amount of money which the director has placed at his disposal. I think he is providing very good talent, talent that the country can be rather proud of.  But the complaint is that the people cannot get that, and I think that that in itself goes to show that the programmes are good, because if they were bad people would not be very much concerned whether they could get them or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether it would not be good business to increase the power of the Dublin station.  I believe that it would. There is also a matter in regard to income; it may not be strictly relevant to this Vote, but I think it has a big bearing on the income, and that is the tax on wireless sets and parts.  It has a very big bearing on the income, because I suggest that if the tax were not there the amount received for licences would be much larger than at present, and certainly if the reception from Dublin were as good as it is from, say, London, there would be a much larger number of people in this country having wireless sets than there is at the moment. But so far as my information goes, the great fault found by most of those who are in possession of wireless sets is that they cannot ever get in touch with Dublin.  I may mention that on the night that the Dáil was dissolved prior to the September Election.  I happened to be listening in and I tried to get Dublin.  I was not trying to listen-in for the dissolution, because I was not expecting it, but something else of importance was on in Dublin the same night, and I was trying to get Dublin in the hope of hearing the news.  I learned the next morning through the newspapers that the news about the dissolution had been broadcasted the previous night, but although I had a five-valve wireless set I was not able to get it.  That goes to show that so far as the majority of wireless people in, this country are concerned, they are paying licences for a service that they do not get.  That is the point.  They pay the broadcasting people for a licence for which they receive no service, <Col N="1288" /> and that is true as far as the greater part of the South of Ireland is concerned; they cannot get in touch with Dublin, but still they are compelled to pay for these programmes.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the matter, with a view to having the power of the Dublin station increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. MULLINS Mr. MULLINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MULLINS</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Morrissey as to the power of the Dublin station, I think that two years ago the hope was expressed here by Deputies that a high-power station would be found possible within a short period, and no later than last year the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs expressed the opinion that it was quite on the cards that he would be asking the Dáil to give a Supplementary Estimate for that purpose within the following twelve months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said that the Government had accepted the principle of the matter and that it was only a question of negotiation between the Minister for Finance and himself.  Deputy Morrissey's complaint is certainly founded on fact, as anybody who uses a wireless set knows, and the people are paying in most parts of the country for services they do not get.  I was sorry to note that the Parliamentary Secretary omitted all mention of the possibility of a high power station.  If we may take his reference to his coming to the Dáil for a Supplementary Estimate as an indication of the establishment of a high-power station, that would give hope to wireless users in the country.  Now that the broadcasting scheme has paid its way and shows a surplus of £5,000, there is no reason why attempts, at all events, should not be made to construct a high-power station, which would give programmes from Dublin and Cork to practically all parts of the country.  As to programmes, I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that arrangements are to be made in the coming winter to relay continental programmes. The one fault which the man in the street who uses a wireless set has at the moment is that the Irish programmes, in contrast with those of Daventry and London, are too classical. <Col N="1289" /> Wireless, after all, is an amusement, and though sometimes it may be educational, most people use it for relaxation in the evening after a hard day's work.  Their complaint is that the programmes are too classical, in other words, too high-brow.  I think that some steps ought to be taken by which the Director would give more programmes for the plain people of a little bit more of a jazzy nature, if I may describe it so.  I think the Director would find few complaints if he gave a more general all-round type of programme, even only on one evening of the week.  As regards relays from London, some of the best concerts in the Albert Hall were relayed, but although one or two other items could have been relayed with profit, no attempt was made to do so.  In regard to the broadcasting of weather reports, a subject which was mentioned here before, no action has been taken.  I commend that to the Parliamentary Secretary, as the broadcasting of such reports in coastal areas would be very valuable, not only to the fishermen, but to the people generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Dissatisfaction in regard to broadcasting is, apparently, universal. People in Waterford complain that owing to the low power of the Dublin station the sound is drowned by other stations or greatly interfered with by morse.  A high-power station was promised, I think, for Athlone, and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us when we may expect to have it erected.  I suppose that promise will be carried out at some time or another, but meantime the people are not getting the value they deserve for the tax they pay.  It is not fair to sell something, as it were, get money down, and not be able to deliver the goods. That is what it means.  There is another question to be considered, namely, securing representation on the International Board.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could give some information as to what progress has been made in that direction.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that it was the object of his Department to bring broadcasting within the reach of as many people <Col N="1290" /> as possible.  As he has made that statement, I would like to draw his attention to the question of the thirty-three and one-third import duty on wireless sets and components, which, in my opinion, is damping the enthusiasm for broadcasting among the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that that is a point for the Minister for Finance, as the Parliamentary Secretary has no power over it. That is a question of taxation rather than the Parliamentary Secretary's estimate.  I know it is difficult to keep from referring to it, but the Deputy cannot actually make a speech asking that the tax be taken off.  That is another question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CASSIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>That was really the only point I wanted to raise.  I would associate myself, however, with the suggestion made by Deputy Mullins in regard to the broadcasting of weather reports for the benefit of the fishing industry.  I believe that the fishing industry could be greatly helped if the broadcasting station could supply to the various fishing centres, or to post offices in towns which are concerned with fishing, reports of the cross-Channel and Continental prices for fish, and announcements regarding the demands for fish in the various markets. If this suggestion were carried out, I believe that it would in some small way help the fishermen in regard to the prices of fish in the various markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is hardly the time for questions.  As a rule publication in final form of the Post Office commercial accounts takes place about eighteen months after the close of the year.  The accounts have to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General before they can be published.  I cannot say at the moment when they will be published, but if the <Col N="1292" /> Deputy puts down a question I will let him know.  I have seen the accounts, but not in the audited form.</P>
