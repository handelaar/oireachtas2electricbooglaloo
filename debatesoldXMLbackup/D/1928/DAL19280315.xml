      <P>I have no control over Industrial Schools in matters relating to the Salaries and conditions of employment of their teachers.  All Industrial Schools in the Free State are conducted by voluntary managers who own the schools and are responsible for the employment and payment of the teaching staffs.  State assistance is confined to the payment to certified schools of a capitation grant towards the cost of the education and maintenance of children committed to these schools by the courts.  Questions relating to the salary, status, and conditions of service of the teachers are matters for arrangement between the managers and the teachers concerned.</P>

      <P>No scheme for the establishment of a special course of training for teachers of Continuation Classes could usefully be prepared until an opportunity was given for the consideration of such recommendations as might be made on this subject by the Commission on Technical Education.</P>
      <P>These recommendations are now being examined in my Department, and the possibility of affording special training to those teachers of Irish who are considered suitable with a view to their employment under schemes of Continuation Education will not be lost sight of.</P>
      <P>In connection with this matter the recommendation contained in paragraph 307 of the Report of the Commission on Technical Education will be kept in mind, as well as that contained in paragraph 315, which relates more directly to the proposals referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>James Cullen, Cooraun, Edermine, Co. Wexford, made a claim to benefit on the 2nd May, 1927, in respect of which he proved unemployment for one day only. He made a further claim to benefit on the 7th January, 1928, on which he furnished evidence of unemployment for a period of nineteen days.  He renewed his claim on the 5th March, 1928, but signed the Unemployed Register on one day only.  As a waiting period of six days must be completed on each claim before benefit is payable, Mr. Cullen's claim of the 2nd May, 1927, and the 5th March, 1928, were ineffective. In respect of the claim which he made on the 7th January, 1928, he received payment in respect of thirteen days, that is to say, for the nineteen days on which he signed, less the waiting period of six days.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that at present landlords in certain districts in Dublin have brought in builders to give them an estimate for the alteration of such houses into flats, and that the tenants of them are now competing for the smaller type of house with those who are already very badly in need of housing accommodation? With a view to stopping those landlords from altering the houses into flats and putting out the tenants, does he not consider it is desirable to give them the same protection as the smaller type of house?</P>

      <P>The Army Pensions Act, 1927, was enacted on the 3rd April of that year. No provision was made in the Estimates (1927-28) for expenditure under that Act.  It now becomes necessary to provide for expenditure under that Act for the current financial year, and this Supplementary Estimate includes such provision.  The gross total of the <Col N="1270" /> Supplementary Estimate is £40,060, of which £25,060 represents the estimated gross expenditure under the Act of 1927 during the present financial year. The balance of the gross Supplementary Estimate (£15,000) represents the additional sum required to meet the expenditure during the current financial year under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1923.  The number of pensions under that Act which it was estimated would come for payment during the year 1927-28 was 2,495.  The number of payments beginning in January last was 2,979.  It is estimated that at the end of the financial year the number of pensions for payment will be 3,050.  The additional sum of £15,000 is to cover these extra numbers. In this connection, the Estimate for this service for 1927-28 was prepared in December, 1926, and it was not possible to estimate as closely as would be desirable the number of military service pensioners who would be in receipt of pensions during the financial year, 1927-28.</P>

      <P>I know that it is not allowable on a debate on Supplementary Estimates to go into the whole question of the Act under which the money is spent.  Our attitude, however, towards the general question of pensions is pretty well known, and to-day we simply want to confine ourselves to opposing this additional sum of £39,000, which the Minister for Defence says he requires.  In 1927, when the Committee on Public Accounts were examining the accounts of the Army Pensions Department, the Auditor-General reported that he had not seen the details upon which the awards were based.  In their report for the year 1927, the Committee states: &ldquo;For the purposes of audit, a request had been made that the original applications for military service pensions should be forwarded to the Audit Department.  This request elicited the response from the Board of Assessors that the Board could not agree to forward the documents mentioned.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That brings us down therefore to sub-head (1).  Deputy Aiken is dealing with the report of the Public Accounts Committee in regard to the accessibility of certain documents for the Auditor-General. That seems to be a general question that does not arise on this Supplementary Estimate.  The matter has been dealt with by the Public Accounts Committee in their report, and it has again been dealt with this year by the Committee, whose report has been presented to the Dáil and will shortly be in the hands of Deputies. The main question should be dealt with either on the main Estimate for Army Pensions, including military service pensions, or on a motion concerned with the report of the Public Accounts Committee, but I do not think it arises on a Supplementary Estimate for a sum of £15,000.  The matter will arise later when the main Estimate for 1928-29 must be voted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>In that event, if Deputy Aiken would give way, I want to raise a question under sub-head (a) dealing with wound pensions.  I would ask the Minister to look into a couple of cases, which have been brought to the notice of his Department recently, in which men were awarded pensions for wounds some time ago, such awards being classed as final awards and based on evidence submitted to the Board <Col N="1272" /> that the amount given was adequate. It was stated that the individuals concerned would improve in health and that the compensation given was sufficient because of that improvement.  I brought to the notice of the Minister's Department two cases in which his Board were entirely wrong in their judgment and, having given an award to a wounded person, that person, instead of improving in health, got much worse.  He had to attend hospital and undergo operations regularly from that day to this, and two months ago he was in hospital undergoing an operation. This man made a claim to have his case considered with a view to getting proper compensation for his injuries, but the officials of the Minister's Department were steadfast in saying that he got a final award and, no matter what his condition was now, they would not budge an inch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two men to whom I refer are victims of a wrong judgment of this Board who based their award on the evidence before them that the men would improve.  One man has got considerably worse and is likely to get much worse, and I do not think, because of some ruling of the Minister's Department that that individual&mdash;and there may be others&mdash;should be denied justice by the Minister or those who act for him.  Perhaps I would be allowed to draw attention to the fact that when an award is given under the Workmen's Compensation Act doctors appear for a claimant, and on the medical evidence an award is made but, if the doctor is found to have been wrong in his judgment and an award is made on that evidence, there is always an appeal to a higher court, and very often a decision is reversed and an award is made and compensation given for disability. I would ask the Minister, if such a case comes to his knowledge, to see that a man suffering, say, from 75 per cent disability should not have been put out, two years previously, on a gratuity, or a disability allowance, equivalent to 10 or 15 per cent. disability, and that if a mistake was made there should be some way of bringing that case to the notice of the Government, and, further, that the Minister's officials should not write a stereotyped letter saying that as a <Col N="1273" /> final award was made on such a date it could not be re-opened.  I say that it should be re-opened if the circumstances warrant it, and I hope the matter will be given consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>We offer no opposition to awards being given to men who were wounded, or to the dependents of men who were killed.  As a matter of fact, had we the distribution of public funds we would think it our duty to see that all men who were disabled, either in the Black and Tan war or during the civil war on either side, would receive an award to enable them to live, and also that the dependents of people killed during the Black and Tan war or the civil war would get an allowance to enable them to live.  We object to this £15,000, item I&mdash;pensions granted under Section 4 of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.  I will not go into the question of giving service pensions to men who never asked that they should be given to them when they were joining up, or who were never promised these pensions when they were joining up from 1916 to 1921.  I will simply confine my remarks to this item of £15,000.  I submit the Dáil has not enough information to warrant it voting this sum.  As I have already pointed out, the Committee on Public Accounts have not seen the original applications, and no one except the members of the Board of Assessors has seen them.  As far as I can learn, and as far as is generally known, the Board of Assessors consists of three men appointed by the Minister for Defence. These are political appointments, but perhaps I had better not go into that now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Dáil has no information directly, and none of its servants appointed to audit accounts has seen the details upon which the awards are based.  I asked the Minister for Defence, for my own information, a question as to the years of service given by people who were awarded military service pensions, and which entitled them to those pensions. After three months the Minister forwarded to me a list of pensioners, and he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" />&ldquo;Having regard to the heavy expenditure of time and labour that would be involved in obtaining the other particulars asked for by you, the Minister feels the result to be obtained could not possibly justify such expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister gave me the name of each pensioner, the amount he is receiving yearly, and also the county in which he is resident.  I submit these details are not enough.  In going through them I noticed that a large percentage of the pensioners are resident in Dublin, and also that the county of Meath has a large number of pensioners.  I do not know the names of the men in County Meath, but I think I could not justify to myself&mdash;even from the point of view of the Minister that people who served during the Black and Tan war and during the civil war on the Cumann na nGaedheal side are entitled to a pension&mdash;voting for the sum required by pensioners in County Meath. I do not know, even from the Cumann na nGaedheal point of view, how such a large number of men in County Meath could have earned these pensions. People in other parts of the country when they were fighting made some noise, but it was very silent warfare in County Meath, as far as I know.  In thinking over it, I am of opinion the only explanation regarding these pensions in County Meath that could be given is that the Minister was giving pensions to the old Fianna that are lying in Tara.  There is no other possible explanation for it, as far as I can see.  I think before the Dáil votes the money to the Minister for Defence, it should know exactly how it is to be spent, and how the people who are going to get it have earned it.  We are dealing with public funds administered by three men who are direct nominees of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, and the money in this case can be used altogether for political purposes.  Regarding County Meath, if the Minister is not paying out money to the old Fianna that are lying in Tara, he must be paying it to men who were in a secret army, because as far as the ordinary <Col N="1275" /> public are concerned, the people in County Meath had not an army that was making very much noise or doing very much public duty during the Black and Tan war.</P>
    <P>In thinking over County Meath, and when the idea of the secret army came into my mind, I remembered that the head of the I.R.B. in County Meath is now the Cumann na nGaedheal Organiser of the secret army there&mdash; the secret Cumann na nGaedheal army of pensioners.  Even though they did not do very good work during the Black and Tan War they can do it for the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation during the general elections or the by-elections. If these men are getting pensions for honourable service during the Black and Tan War why does not the Minister publish the full particulars? Why does he not tell the public of the people to whom they should render homage for services rendered to the country?  Not alone has the Minister refused to tell the general public who these men are but the Board of Assessors appointed by him has refused to give particulars to the Auditor-General or his staff.  Quite recently one of the Parliamentary Secretaries&mdash;and I think he will hardly deny this&mdash;when the list of people to whom pensions were awarded was going to be published in a local paper interfered and tried to prevent publication. They are even afraid to let people know the list of those to whom pensions have been awarded.  That is a rotten state of affairs.  It is bad for the country in general, and very bad for the people who are getting the money. Giving pensions to able-bodied men is likely to create a general prejudice against pensions, and I, for one, am for giving pensions to men who were disabled fighting for any cause they believed in, and for giving pensions to the dependents of men who fell fighting for any cause they believed in.  I took part in the civil war, and I know that many of the men we were fighting against were misled by men opposite into the belief that the cause for which they were fighting was the right one for Ireland.  Any of them who was disabled, or the dependents of any who fell, I would like to see getting pensions. <Col N="1276" /> This practice of giving secret pensions to people for secret service&mdash; service that is not public&mdash;is wrong and prejudices the whole case for giving honourable pensions to men who gave honourable service.  I hope the Dáil will not give this £39,000, £15,000 of which is proposed to be allocated for these secret military service pensions.</P>

      <P>Deputy Aiken has, of course, gone outside the Supplementary Estimate.  However, I suppose, that is one speech.  Something has to be said, and I suppose there is no harm in letting it be said.  I will have to let the Minister reply at the right time.  We are not concerned here on the general question under any of these sub-heads.  Under sub-head 1 the main sum has been voted, but the question is why the Minister wants £15,000 now, and why he did not know before that he wanted this money.  The general question of military service pensions, including the matter Deputy, Aiken has mentioned, will be under discussion when the main estimate comes up in the next month or two, so that the debate must now be confined to the Supplementary Estimate alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>As you, sir, have stated the question which the Dáil has to consider is why the Minister requires an additional £15,000 to meet pensions due under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.  It is obvious that the Minister has had to incur an expenditure under the heading of this Vote in excess of what he anticipated.  The fact that the whole administration of the Act, and the circumstances connected with the distribution of these pensions, are shrouded in secrecy makes it impossible really for the Dáil to know why the additional £15,000 is required.  I submit that I am in order in maintaining that as the main purpose of the Act was to enable the Government to buy the neutrality, or, at any rate, buy off the hostility of a certain section of the population, the purpose for which the £15,000 is required must be the same. The Minister, apparently, found that the amount he had estimated at the beginning of the year for that purpose was inadequate.  There were, of course, two General Elections during the year <Col N="1277" /> Particular constituencies had to be made safe for Cumann na nGaedheal candidates, and consequently the Dáil is now called upon to pay the price&mdash; £15,000.  The extra seat that was won, in Meath, and I think the extra seat won in Dublin are hardly worth the price to the nation.  I do not think the Deputies who are now in the House, but who were not in the last Dáil, in consequence of the expenditure of this sum, however valuable their services may be, are of sufficient value to justify the Dáil voting £15,000 for the pleasure of having them here.  The whole purpose for which this money is required is one, I think, of which the Dáil should not approve.  We think the paying of pensions in this secret, furtive manner for services given, or alleged to have been given, in the I.R.A. is going to debase the whole tradition of the I.R.A., and is going to sully the record which the Irish Republican Army is handing down to history.  That ideal of voluntary service, freely given to the nation in a time of national stress, given without any hope of pay or reward, is an important legacy given us that we must be careful to safeguard, and if the Dáil lightly approves of the payment of rewards for services in this manner it is going, I believe, not merely to debase that tradition now, but it is going to make it impossible for some future generation to get the same service at some particular moment of national stress.  The men who fought in that particular time are undoubtedly entitled to the consideration of the people of the country.  They are entitled to be given every opportunity of securing an adequate and decent livelihood in Ireland; they are entitled to favourable consideration whenever it is possible to give favourable consideration, in the allocation of posts under Government control.  They are not, however, entitled to pensions and I am proud to say, and I think the majority of the people of Ireland are proud to say, that the vast majority of them are not asking for pensions and would not take pensions.  The fact that particulars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When that report is in the hands of Deputies, and when the main estimate comes up, the matter is bound to be discussed, so that we are anticipating it; in other words, discussing on a very small issue a very big issue which will arise on the big issue.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is, that it appears to me, from the remarks of the Committee, these pensions are not really being awarded for services given at all, but that the assessors are, as it were, awarding so much per head for the men shot by the pensioners, a suggestion that it was not a case of service, but a case of the actual value of the work done that was taken into consideration when the pensions were given.  I submit that that is the continuation of a mentality that grew up in the ranks of the controlling authority of the Irish Republican Army during the Truce&mdash;a mentality that tended to exalt the value of the man who carried out individual enterprises and to discourage the value of the man who served in the rank and file.  I suggest that if pensions for service are to be awarded at all, they should be awarded on the strength of the period of service given, and on no other grounds. If two men joined the Irish Volunteers on a particular day, and if each of them did everything he was asked to do from that until 1921, if they carried out every order transmitted to them <Col N="1280" /> then, they are both on an equal basis when it comes to the awarding of pensions, irrespective of whether one man did one thing and the other man did something that was less spectacular or less important.  If that basis for the awarding of pensions was adopted, merely for service, and the nature of the service, in so far as there was no disobeying of orders at any time, was taken into consideration, there should be no reason why full details could not be furnished.  I conclude, therefore, by asking the House to reject the Estimate on the ground that not merely has the information not been given to the House which would justify it in making up its mind, but that whatever information is in this report is such as would justify the House in rejecting the Vote.</P>

I have no intention of referring to the Report of the present Committee, because it has not yet come out.  The point is this: As far as I can find out from any of the records or any of the debates, I am satisfied that unless a Minister, in asking for money from this House, specifically states that that money is not to be subject to the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, that that money must be audited by the House.

I would like to know if the Minister for Finance suggests that we should defer this matter and introduce a motion for the repeal of the Act, or to correct and check it with regard to the points with which we disagree.

      <P>It is very hard, knowing the facts surrounding this Military Service Pensions Act, to keep strictly in order according to your ruling, but there is this point.  The Title of the Act states definitely that it is a Military Service Pensions Act, that the individuals who benefit under this Act are men who have rendered military service.  Yet the actions of those administering the Act would tend to suggest to the mind of anybody trying to get behind it that the men who are getting the pension for military services are ashamed to admit what these military services were.  I have yet to hear of any individual, benefiting from the Military Service Pensions Act as a pensioner, who will admit what his pension is for, and that is exactly what the attitude of mind on the part of the Government amounts to.  It is tantamount to suggesting that these men must be protected from the public for the service they have rendered.  It is a <Col N="1282" /> service that neither they nor we can be proud of.  I would like to see that situation altered.  Either the Government admit that these people are being paid for secret service, that they are being paid for acts over which they cannot stand, or it ought to be made public.  Let it stand at that and let the House vote on it.  But do not say: &ldquo;These are military service pensions, but we are not going to tell you where the men served, how they served, what they did, or what they are getting these pensions for.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister for Defence that if he is prepared to enumerate the individuals who will benefit under this Supplementary Estimate, to enumerate every detail of their services and state if they come within the Act.  I am prepared to vote for it.  But otherwise I feel that I must vote against it, because I do not believe that the Act is being administered in the spirit in which it was proposed, and in the spirit in which it was discussed and carried through.  I appeal to Deputies, particularly those on the Independent Benches, to realise that they are condoning an irregularity in passing a Supplementary Estimate in this manner. where the House does not know whether it is really secret service or military service pensioners who are benefiting.</P>

      <P>With regard to what Deputy Byrne said about the final awards, I regret he attributed it to the attitude of the officials in my Department. I regret very much that these final awards have to be regarded as final.  I am advised legally that a final award cannot be re-opened.  I regret that, possibly for the very opposite reason to that which Deputy Byrne regrets it for, I being the Minister for Defence and responsible for the finances of that Department, while Deputy Byrne is a man with a large heart and is concerned with the humanitarian side of it only.  Unfortunately I am precluded, not only from re-opening a final award when a man disimproves with a view to giving him a higher amount, but also from reopening it when his condition improves with a view to making a diminution in the amount of his pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the other speakers, I think, were hopelessly out of order, if I may say so, but they got in a certain number of what I will call scurrilous remarks about the administration of these pensions. In response to questions from various Deputies, I had a list issued of all pensioners, giving the amounts of their pensions and the counties in which they reside.  Anyone living in any of these counties, if they are intimately and well acquainted with what happened during the pre-truce period, can judge for themselves if these men on the list of pensioners were eligible for pensions.  If anyone comes along and proves that a man received a pension on false pretences, there is, of course, a perfectly simple legal method of dealing with him.  There is no secrecy whatever about these pensions.  The Act says that pensions shall be awarded for military service which is defined as active service in the rank of officer, noncommissioned, etc.  The basis of a pension is time.  A certain valuation is given for certain periods: for instance for the last few years from 1916 onwards. A pension depends upon time and upon rank.  It is not merely enough for applicants to say that they gave active service.  Applicants for a pension are called upon to give evidence to prove that they had given <Col N="1284" /> active service during the period they claimed for.  The evidence that may be adduced, therefore, does not mean that we pay by what you might call piecework. I think that was what Deputy Lemass said.  It does not mean that It is merely evidence to prove that during a period between such and such a date a man was giving active service.</P>
    <P>There is no secrecy whatsoever about this.  A full list has been given of the men who have been awarded pensions, with the names of the counties in which they reside.  As these Deputies over there who, remarkably enough, care to fling about these suggestions of corruptness&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In my opening statement I explained how this Supplementary Estimate comes to be asked for.  It is due to the fact partly that the Act of 1927 was passed on the 30th April last year, and that no money was voted.  It is also due to the fact that the Board of Assessors got through their work rather more quickly than was anticipated.  Because of that a bigger number of pensioners than it was thought would be on the list had to be provided for during this financial year.  This additional sum is only to make up for that additional expenditure. When a Deputy asks for a list of the people who benefit by this sum of £15,000, it is like as if somebody asked Deputy Briscoe whether he gets his £360 a year out of the tax upon beer or out of the income tax. One does not segregate these things. You have a list of all the pensioners up to a certain date, and you have there quite sufficient data to prove, if you are so convinced of the truth of your suggestion, that we are paying not for service in the Army pre-Truce or post-Truce, but for secret service. Every Deputy on the opposite benches knows as well as I do that that suggestion is absolutely unfounded, unwarranted and untrue.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry, but I was unable to hear one single word said by the Minister.  I think it is rather a pity that the words of wisdom which come from the Front Benches are so often inaudible.  Would it be in order, or would it be too much, to ask that the Minister should speak in such a manner that those who desire to deal with this Vote would have some idea of what he is dealing with?  I have not been able to hear a single word, nor, in practice, have we been able to hear, as a rule, even a quarter of the wisdom that comes from the Front Benches in the announcement of the order of business. Until it is repeated by the Chair, as a rule we have no knowledge whatever what business is before the House, in what order it is to be taken, or otherwise. I do think that, having regard to the amount of education upon economic, social, political and other matters which is so freely and voluntarily handed out to us from the Front Bench opposite, the Deputies there might themselves take a little trouble to go to some elementary school of elocution and enable us at least to hear, even if we cannot be expected to understand, their wisdom.</P>
      <P>The Minister has now, having completely obscured the issue with his unintelligibility of declaration, obscured himself; he has departed from the House.  I think that coming events cast their shadows before them, but I am afraid that it is the intelligibility of the things that they have said, both in relation to this and in relation to other Votes, that will be most effective in removing not merely one Minister but the whole of the Ministers from that Front Bench.

      <P>I am very gradually coming to it.  We are dealing with a particular Vote which includes patents and industrial property in this State. We have set up what apparently is a very expensive Department; it is going to cost us something like £17,000 a year, as far as I can understand.  I can understand that quite clearly, but what we are getting for it is not by any means so clear.  Are we getting a Department whose purpose is to maintain the rights of this country in relation to industrial property, or are we just going to carry on the tradition of the Department which gave us that Bill, and which went out of its way, of its own wish, to attack in advance a decision of the court which stated that we had industrial property in <Col N="1295" /> patents in this country.  In regarding a Vote of this kind you have to regard the history and the mentality of the Department which takes care of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  It enables us to have some respect for the particular Vote and the particular law which we are supposed to fulfil. The purpose of an Industrial Property Act is to see that certain contracts which are entered into by the State with an individual in relation to a new manufacture shall accrue in advantage to that State and, above all, to the residents in that State.  We have set up a particular system, which, for a little country of less than three million people, sets upon those who come to apply for a patent in that State a cost out of all proportion to the cost of the same services received from other countries.  We have set up a system which compels us to pay to somebody outside the Government for what the Government is supposed to give us more even than we pay the Government. You can get a patent in France and in two or three other countries for the price at which you can apply for a patent in the Free State.  You can get a patent for England and for the Free State cheaper than you can get a patent for the Free State alone. That is rather remarkable.</P>

You laid down this extraordinary regulation. that in order to get a patent in the Free State you either have to have a certificate from the British Government that you already have a patent there, or you have to have a certificate <Col N="1296" /> from a patent agent that he has gone through the British Register for fifty years and found that there is no such patent recorded.  That is the basis of your patent.  It is a patent by reference, and a patent by reference only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am suggesting is that we are suffering from heavy costs on account of a Department which has been set up and which is going to cost £17,000 to produce nothing of value.  The patent which you get is not worth the paper it is written on.  A patent is a contract between a State and an individual in which, in consideration of that individual divulging for use knowledge which he has of a new manufacture, the State gives him the monopoly of the use of that for a certain period of years.  Now, the validity and value and use of that patent depends altogether on the amount of care which is taken by the State in seeing that that thing is in itself new.  The British patent agent's inquiry into the British records gives you something which is practically of negligible value.  In any developing industry the examination to-day will not include the things which are going through, and when you get your patent it is not worth it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a series of patents which illustrate very accurately the value of the commercial property which is being given to the community at this high price.  Take the case, first, of your patent agent's examination.  All that includes is the statement that in a particular patent office there is not a record for fifty years.  Anything which was invented fifty-two years ago you can get a patent for, and it is of no value when you have got it. <Col N="1297" /> Assume you take the other line, and go through and get a British patent, and you bring it back here and register it and pay your fees in relation to it, what is it worth?  Unless it is backed by the patent of some other country, which does make a proper examination, it is not worth the paper it is written on.  I have here a patent which was taken out in England through one of the most prominent and most accomplished patent agents there.  It has eleven separate claims, two of which are generic, which would make it a master patent.  It went through without any difficulty, and is capable of being registered in the Irish Free State.  It went to America, and the report of the American Patent Office was that there was not one single claim in it, generic or otherwise, which they would pass.  I have here another British patent which, after it had been passed and registered, they discovered was bad.  I will take another case of a British patent that I know went through.  It had four claims, and it was a very fine patent indeed.  The man started manufacturing the goods under it, brought them to England, and a man showed him on his shelves in England actual things for sale, made in America under an American patent, which completely voided and made useless his own.</P>
    <P>My objection to spending this £17,000 or so is that we are putting a whole lot of people to a lot of quite unnecessary expense merely to get a patent by reference to, probably, one of the  patents in the world.  In France they will accept for registration practically anything you give them.  They give you a brevet; they mark it &ldquo;Not guaranteed by the Government.&rdquo;  You know what you are getting.  In the Free State you are getting a patent which ought to be marked &ldquo;Not guaranteed by anybody,&rdquo; and in itself of no use to anybody unless it is guaranteed by an American patent.  If we had taken the line of saying &ldquo;Let us have a search through the American Patent Office,&rdquo; then we would probably get something of value.  If we had taken the line of saying &ldquo;Simply let us register this patent. as they do in France and other countries, and then let the man fight <Col N="1298" /> for his patent on the value of what is actually contained in the document.&rdquo; we would have done something reasonable and logical.  We have done neither one nor the other.  We have pretended to set up a patent which simply is not worth anything.  That is why I say you have to take into account in this matter the history of this office and find out whether they really did mean to give us any property in our patent, or whether this is purely a revenue department; whether we are simply trying to collect money, and if we are, we could collect it much more cheaply than by setting up a Department which will cost £17,000.</P>
    <P>When our courts did declare that we had industrial property in all existing patents in this State, we introduced deliberately an Act to upset in advance any further decision of the courts which would uphold that decision. When I came to look up that Act, typical of quite a whole lot of rubbish which has been poured through this House, as through a funnel, in the name of laws, I find that this actual law which was introduced to upset that did not exist.  It had never been reduced even to written form.  It simply consisted of its short title.  I have been through the thing, looking for it.  I may be wrong.  I tried to find it in the House, but I am informed that it was purely and simply a bogey man, put up to tell the courts which said we had industrial property in this country that we were not going to have the black flag of piracy raised by the courts or anybody else.  That is the meaning of it; that is the mentality.</P>

      <P>I am criticising it on the ground that we are setting up a new extravagant department of State: that we are going to spend £17,000 in doing nothing of any particular value <Col N="1299" /> as far as patents are concerned.  When we come to discuss this as a whole Estimate we will go into the other details, but there is no more dust in the sunbeam than in the rest of the room.  So far as patent legislation is concerned and the Department is concerned and the Industrial Property Act is concerned this £17,000 spent upon it is simply waste of money.  If it is going to be used purely and simply as a means of collecting revenue well and good.  But let us say so, and let us put up a cheap department for collecting money; but do not let us continue the farce of pretending to set up anything in the form of an industrial property department, because we have not done anything of the kind.</P>

      <P>Now that we have listened to the oration of Demosthenes, and have had an oration telling us how we are to prepare to deliver our speeches in this House, and now that the big gun from Cork has thrown off all its shells, I shall endeavour to apply the test of commonsense to the problem before us.  We are asked to pass an estimate of £7,082, as I see it on the Paper.  The Deputy referred to a sum of £17,000.  He is just as accurate in that statement as he is in the other statements he made to the House.  He held up here, for our edification, the conditions of the various patent systems that are in operation in other countries, and one of those systems to which he referred to was the French system.  He told us what could be done in France, and he compared what we were doing in Ireland to what was being done in France, to the disadvantage of the former as pure waste of time and money.  I know perfectly well I am in order in answering arguments put forward by Deputies in this House, but my own commonsense tells me that that argument has very little to do with the particular estimate&mdash;a matter to which the Ceann Comhairle has called attention.</P>

      <P>I venture to lay before the House one or two details of the French system just so much eulogised by Deputy Flinn.  Under the French system you are given first a stamp of receipt of specification, but it leaves the question of prior application to be afterwards determined.  In one word, all that is done by the French system is merely official sanction given with regard to the date of registration, and nothing more.  And that is all that comes of all the talk and eloquence and noise and thunder that we heard from Deputy Flinn.  I think it would be in the interests of the constituents he represents that he should apply commonsense, and a little courtesy as well as commonsense, when dealing with problems of this kind.</P>
      <P>May I now come to another statement he made as to the cost of specifications in the Free State and the huge sums that he said we have to pay for these.  I find that on an application accompanied by a provisional specification the huge sum of fifteen shillings has to be paid.  On filling up the complete specification the sum of £2 5s has to be paid.  On application for the result of the search in the various sections £1, and on the sealing of the patent another £1.  These are the gigantic sums that have to be spent in the Saorstát upon the patents.</P>

      <P>Not for one second. I am pointing out, dealing with this question purely as a financial estimate, that under this Act very substantial benefits will accrue to the inventor in the Free State.  I may point out that it protects Irish genius and Irish inventive skill.  It will protect the Irish trade marks, which were very inefficiently protected.  In dealing with that matter very briefly, I may say baby and all as I am in the eyes  Deputy Flinn, that one pound of experience is worth a ton of oratory such as we have listened to, and the experience that I can give is practical experience.  I shall, as a business man, take an article that is coming into this <Col N="1301" /> country for many years.  I do not know whether the Deputy is a business man or not, but from the way he talks it appears to me that he is not. Hitherto articles could come in here ostensibly bearing Irish trade marks that were absolutely of foreign origin. This Act effectively puts an end to that system of duping people into buying as Irish goods that were not made in Ireland.  For many years, in my own particular business, I have sold a shovel branded with a shamrock. I have had people coming into my shop demanding Irish shamrock shovels, and I have had specifications from various councils throughout the country demanding Irish shamrock shovels.  And although, from time to time, I recommended Irish goods and pointed out that this particular shovel was made in Birmingham and not in the Saorstát, it has still been looked for, because the shamrock brand was on it.  Has the Deputy any cross-Channel experience in these matters? Does he realise the piracy that has gone on for years in the selling of goods as Irish which were not Irish? Does he know that if he wants &ldquo;a Jameson&rdquo; in England it is impossible to get it unless he sees the label.  The Deputy talks about babies, but I never met a greater baby than the Deputy. He has not yet cut his eye-teeth as far as patents are concerned.</P>

      <P>Under this Act we have one very important thing. You must have money to work this particular office, and for that expenditure we get one very important thing in return, which I suggest is worth the whole of the amount involved.  It will prevent the exploitation of foreign patents for the benefit of non-nationals in this country.  I suggest to the high-sounding, oratorical Deputy on the other side that that fact is worth the money alone.  A monopoly will be given to Irish brains, and we will have the prevention of abuses such as the registration of dud patents with the object of commercial exploitation. The Deputy talks so learnedly of all these things that one feels reluctant <Col N="1302" /> to get up and reply.  We are living in one of the most progressive ages through which the human race has ever passed.  In these days one single invention could, perhaps, revolutionise the whole future of this country. There is a case for patent rights in America with regard to various things involving the motor car industry, and the sum involved is one hundred thousand millions, yet we are told in this House that this extravagant Estimate of £7,000 is beyond all human comprehension and should be rejected.</P>

Let us put the plain question that matters, so far as this Estimate is concerned.  Is this a paying proposition to the Free State?  Are the people getting good value for their money, or are all the allegations of Deputy Flinn true?  It is estimated on the credit side of this Vote that we will have incomings to the amount of £27,500.  That money, even if Deputy Flinn is correct and even if we have to expend a sum of £17,000, although the figure before the House is only £7,000, will give a return of cent. per cent.  If the Deputy whose high-sounding phrases almost bored us to death could apply his common sense to this matter he would be more careful in his statements and would not put forward senseless and ridiculous arguments fit only for a baby's school.</P>

      <P>We only hear from Deputy MacEntee puerilities, the juvenility of which should shame his years.  Deputy Flinn talked about intelligibility and elocution.  I do not profess to be a student of elocution like Deputy Flinn, but I have not had anything made intelligible to me by the Deputy with regard to this estimate. There is a certain amount involved under the Act, which was passed through this House when the Deputy was fighting on the hills, and when his principles would not allow him to come into this House.  It is a pity that we had not the benefit of his elocution when the Bill was going through.  It is now an Act.  We established an office under that Act and we are giving a patent which is a commercial property, and the mere fact that the Deputy says it is not carries no weight with me. When Deputy Byrne asked Deputy Flinn to substantiate his statement by facts the Deputy slipped away from <Col N="1304" /> facts and we have had none given.  We have had a statement of the Deputy's views.  We have it alleged that a patent granted in England was regarded by the United States as being no good.  In that regard it may be said that a patent granted in France might be regarded here as no good.  There is a difference in connection with such matters.  Some countries give patents of little commercial value and charge very little for them.  France is one of such countries.  Deputy Byrne has corrected Deputy Flinn and given him sound information about patents which probably the Deputy did not know before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, he did not give it to the House before.  He said that a British patent could not be accepted at its full value in the United States.  To say that a patent granted in the Irish Free State would not be accepted in the United States, and that it would not be of commercial value is not true.  We may, indeed, go the length, as they do in some countries, of giving a guarantee that if such patent were upset there would be compensation paid.  We do not propose to do that.  We set up an office, we have staffed it, and there will be revenue obtained from citizens to whom we gave a good commercial property of a specific type.  Has there been the slightest evidence from Deputy Flinn as to what value this office does give? Has anybody been made the wiser by all that has been said here by Deputy Flinn about this estimate?  Why are we discussing this matter on an estimate for setting up an office which was established by law and which I was bound to establish by the law as passed by this House?  The office has been established.  A Comptroller has been appointed.  His salary, and the salaries of the different officials, who are considered necessary for running the office are set out.  I am asking for money to pay them.  The office is running according to law.  The Bill dealing with this intricate and complicated subject was withdrawn after its introduction in order to get better views upon it.  It was reintroduced later, and it took <Col N="1305" /> almost eighteen months to pass.  It was subject to a special examination by a Select Committee of both Houses, and we had on that Committee people of much more legal ability and much more skill in worldly matters than is possessed by Deputy Flinn.</P>
      <P>They have decided that a patent given under this Act was a valuable property and worth the money we set out to get by way of fees.  If Deputy Flinn wishes to make out that the office is not doing its duty, he must make it on the basis that it is not doing the duty appointed to it under the Act.  If he says such duties under the Act are useless and of no benefit to the public, let him bring forward a motion for the amendment of the Act, and when he does so let him substantiate his case by facts and not by mere statements by way of debate.  Another matter has been brought forward and which, though not as important as other matters, I might be allowed to deal with, as it gives a completely wrong impression to the House about a Bill that only advanced as far as the Second Reading. Deputy Flinn said that Mr. Justice Meredith gave a decision establishing industrial and commercial property in this country.  The effect of the judgment was that the particular patent could not be held valid in this country. inasmuch as that was contrary to all the views previously held, and inasmuch as it was the view that ran through the whole of the Patents Act, a Bill was introduced so that if that judgment went through it should be accepted, but we would establish by law from that date a new situation which we believed to be the old situation. The Bill was not proceeded with, for the action, which was an interlocutory one, was not proceeded with, and there was no necessity to go further.  This Act re-established the position that everyone believed had been here and that everyone desired to have here.  The Deputy made a completely wrong statement with regard to the judgment.</P>

The fact is that the day the Bill was introduced the judgment was before <Col N="1306" /> the House.  How then could it be said to be attacked in advance?  It was before the House when legislation was introduced and there was no attack in advance on the judgment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It was an interlocutory motion.  The judgment was clear and precise, and there was no attack on it.  There was a recognition of it in a speech made by the late Minister for Justice.  The judges had their say, and that had to be recognised as the law for the time being, but we had to establish a law for the future, and it is the duty of this House to establish law for the future.  I am asking the House not to vote £17,000, as Deputy Corry seems to imagine, nor even the £17,000 Deputy Flinn managed to bring into this estimate, but a sum of £7,000, against which we have revenue amounting to £27,000.  If in a normal year I found the expense of the office was only going to be twice £7,000, and the revenue in a normal year twice £27,000, I would immediately set about reducing the fees.  If the office was bringing in £27,000, and the expenditure only £7,000 in a half year, obviously the fees would be too high. A considerable number of trade mark and patent applications were registered here pending the passing of this Act. The first six months were spent in clearing off arrears and collecting money due for registration of patents here from those who wished to have their patents given force and effect in the Saorstát.  It is not certain that the revenue will be £27,000.  It is impossible to estimate accurately what it will be. It may be £27,000, or it might easily be under £27,000.  I do not regard the Deputy's admission or negation as worth anything for this reason, that the statement given here puts down £15,000 as given for trade marks.  There has been recently, and even since the estimate was printed, a rush for applications for trade marks, and that £15,000 could easily be doubled as a correct estimate of the moneys likely to be received before the end of this year.  It looks as if the trade mark is likely to be more remunerative, whereas the <Col N="1307" /> patents side will likely fall.  It is possible that the estimate of revenue originally put down with regard to the half year may be realised.  Even in a normal half year, if that is the case, there would be a case for reducing the fees.  At the moment fees are being charged on property which is being given, and it is good property and worth the consideration asked for it.</P>

He has said that <Col N="1309" /> I only used myself purely as a vehicle in the matter, that &ldquo;Deputy Flinn's objection is that he does not want to pay £1 for an Irish patent.&rdquo;  That was said two or three times, and it gives the House the idea that one could get in some way an Irish patent for £1.  I do not want to go into that to any great extent, because we are coming back to it.  The regulation is that to get a patent in the Free State you have got to do two of three things.  You have got to apply to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and you have to make a provisional application, and then your final application.  You pay the fees which Deputy Byrne knows about.  One is fifteen shillings.  They are slightly lower than the British figures.</P>

      <P>And in addition, in order to make that patent of any validity and get it sealed, you have to do one of two other things; you have got to pay the whole of the charges up to the acceptance of the final specification in the British Patent Office.  Now, the cheapest you can do that for is slightly more than the cost of taking out a Free State patent.  Therefore it has got to cost you twice as much, but you have no alternative.  You can go and get a British patent agent to go through the files and provide a Ministry of Trade and Commerce certificate that the subject matter which you are claiming is not included in the British file for fifty years.  To get that from a competent professional man whose verdict it would be commercially wise to rely upon will cost twice as much as the cost in the Irish Free State for the patent.  There is one other matter on which I would like to say a word by way of explanation, because I do not believe the Minister wants to misrepresent it.  I have here a document dated December, 1924, which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Know ye, therefore, that we, of our especial grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion do by these presents, for us, our heirs and successors, give and grant unto the said  our especial license, full power, sole privilege, and authority, that the said patentee by himself, his <Col N="1310" /> agents, or licensees, and no others, may at all times hereafter during the term of years herein mentioned, make, use, exercise, and vend the said invention within our United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and Isle of Man....</P>
    <P>That is December, 1924, and that patent has fourteen years to run.  It is the subject matter of the British patent that was submitted in the form and through an American patent agent, an accomplished and properly qualified man&mdash;the subject matter of a patent which had eleven claims, two of which were generic, every one of which was passed by the British Office.  The whole of that subject matter was submitted to the American Patent Office, and their answer is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>All the claims are further rejected on the Hammond patent on the ground of an existing patent.</P>
    <P>They rejected them on about five other grounds.  I do know something about the commercial value of the patent, and I know that any patent rejected in America on the ground of the Hammond patent is not worth the paper it is written on as a commercial proposition. That patent here which has been rejected as of no value&mdash;and I know from actual experience from trying to use it that it has no commercial value&mdash;can be registered in the Free State so long as I am prepared either to pay the charges in the Free State and more than that to the British Government to register it or to pay twice as much to a British patent agent to tell me it does not exist in the records for fifty years.  The Minister says I am not prepared to pay £1.  I say to him that he ought to know within the terms of his own Act that I am compelled to pay not merely £1 or £3 in order to get that patent but that I have to pay more than I paid to the British Government or to pay twice as much as I pay to him to the British patent agent before he will allow me to register my patent.</P>

      <P>The Minister has insinuated that because there was a dispute between his Department and Deputy Flinn over £1 Deputy Flinn is opposing this Vote.

We must presume at any rate that the Deputy is acting on behalf of his constituents, and certainly in this matter he has the support of his Party.</P>

With regard to the reading of that document, I do not know what the effect of that was intended to be, except to give the idea to the House that there was an appreciation on the other side that the Deputy had some affiliation, native or otherwise, with the Isle of Man.  Outside that I do not know what the effect of the recital of that particular screed was intended to have.  The fees that are charged and the fees that will continue to be charged do not arise on this Estimate. Certain fees are laid down in the Act.  Certain regulations are established with regard to fees.  These are published.  Deputy Aiken could have taken the trouble to burden himself with them for this debate.  The Deputy can read the Act; he can possibly <Col N="1312" /> understand it, and he could have come in here and argued with regard to that.</P>

As far as the general regulations and fees are concerned they do not arise on this Vote.  They cannot arise.  If people want them changed there is a method of having a discussion on the advisability of changing them.  There is a method of having such a discussion, but it is certainly not on this Estimate.  This Estimate is for a body set up in accordance with an Act passed by the House.  The matters that should arise on that are: Are the salaries insufficient or sufficient? Is the office overstaffed or understaffed?  And so on.  I do not see how we can proceed to argue what the Act has laid down.  If the office is doing things it should not do it could be queried on them, but nobody has made an allegation that the office is doing anything that is contrary to what the Act orders the office to do, and there is no allegation that it has been over-zealous in its duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the end of a transaction in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce played a chief part in 1926.  In May, 1926, when the English coal strike was in full swing, powers were conferred upon the Minister to take the necessary steps to provide the country with a sufficient supply of coal while the strike was in progress, and to take measures to deal with profiteering.  The Minister, as far as I can make out, although he ascertained at the end of April, 1926, that there was only a six weeks' supply of coal in the country&mdash;a very small supply when you consider that a large strike had been embarked upon in England, which continued for several months afterwards&mdash;took no steps to deal with the situation and put into operation the facilities conferred upon him by this House.  It was not until a severe shortage made itself felt in the beginning of October that he did take steps to deal with the situation.  When the question was last discussed in this House he stated that he had been in constant communication with the coal merchants.  It is an extraordinary thing, one which we on this side of the House find it very hard to understand, that the coal strike could have been proceeding for several months, with stocks being depleted here in the city, and that the Minister, who says he was in touch with the coal merchants during that period, did not find out the gravity of the situation until there was a very serious situation.  That was in the beginning of October.  He then offered certain financial assistance to the coal merchants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the bargain made by which the Minister was to assist the coal merchants to provide coal to deal with the serious situation that existed are deserving of examination by the House.  This is only a small item, no doubt, in the eyes of the Minister.  It only involved, in the first instance, a sum of £112,000, but what we on this <Col N="1317" /> side of the House are interested to know is whether the same business acumen or lack of that quality which displayed itself in this particular transaction was also displayed during the period that we hear so much about, the period since 1922, when we were absent from this House, and when the Minister was embarking on very much larger schemes and spending millions of the Irish people's money upon the Shannon scheme.  It was not until the 26th October, when the strike was at its height, and when the situation was most serious, that any steps were taken by him to provide coal.  The terms that he offered the Association on that occasion were that they should be allowed 22/- per ton, as far as I understand it, after the coal had been landed in Dublin, to cover the margin between the cost of delivery in Dublin and the cost as delivered to the consumer.  This transaction was based upon the importation of 35,000 tons of coal.</P>
    <P>If that coal had been ordered in April, May, June or July, it is probable it would have been got at a reasonable price.  The extraordinary thing is that the coal was not ordered until the situation was exceptionally difficult, until it was almost impossible to get coal, and until, in the words of the Minister, &ldquo;there was an embargo upon the export of continental coal.&rdquo;  Under these circumstances he made a bargain with some continental firms for the importation of 35,000 tons of coal, as well as giving the Coal Merchants' Association their handsome terms, paying them, when the coal had been delivered in Dublin for their expenses and their services in connection with it, to the tune of 22/- per ton.  He also made the remarkable bargain that any coal that the Association did not see fit to take would be left upon his hands, so that in December&mdash;I do not know whether the strike had terminated at the time or not&mdash;there were 27,000 tons of this coal still on the Minister's hands, and he estimated that there had been a loss of £50,000 on the transaction.</P>
    <P>We read in the newspapers where public bodies are often summoned to give an account of themselves before a public inquiry as to how their finances and their transactions, generally, are carried out.  At the present moment, for <Col N="1318" /> some reason that is understood on the opposite benches, but that is not very clear to me, the Galway County Council, for example, has been called upon to explain how its finances stand, and the meaning of its transactions during the past three years.  But in this House, which is called the Sovereign Assembly of the nation, when the Minister was asked by the late leader of the Opposition to give figures and details of the consignments, prices and percentages of the different kinds of coal which were included in his importation orders, he refused to give the information. Apparently, one has to take for granted what a Minister on the other side of the House says is the law, and it is not alone a mere waste of the time for Deputies on this side to get up and criticise the expenditure of public money, but if we are to believe Ministers, it is real impertinence on our part to question this transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>ACTING-CHAIRMAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I think, has gone far enough at the moment. If the Deputy wants to discuss the estimate of £112,000 that was passed in 1926, he would not be in order.  That estimate has already been discussed and passed.  What the House has now to deal with is the Supplementary Estimate before it for the sum of £580.  As the Ceann Comhairle ruled earlier in connection with another matter, the contract relating to the estimate of £112,000 in 1926 has already been discussed and cannot be re-opened.  Deputies must confine themselves to the Supplementary Estimate before the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="ACTING-CHAIRMAN ACTING-CHAIRMAN">
      <NameTxt>ACTING-CHAIRMAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not with the terms of the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I am not permitted to deal with the contract terms, but what I do say is that the House ought to refuse to grant this Supplementary Estimate of £580 until they have had an explanation from the Minister as to why this coal was not <Col N="1319" /> purchased at an earlier period and as to why steps were not taken by him under the powers conferred on him to deal with the profiteering in Dublin. It was only in October, six months at least after the strike had commenced in England, that the Minister took any real steps, if I can call them real steps, to deal with the fuel shortage in Dublin. Then he suggested to the City Commissioners that arrangements should be made to deal with peat. Apparently the Minister had never heard that there were Irish coalfields in this country, and for the whole of that six months, during which these powers, which he had himself sought, were in his hands, he took no steps to develop the Irish coal industry, and he certainly did not take steps to facilitate the purchase of peat or coal at reasonable prices for the poor of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Of course, I can understand that the Minister, who has such a large army of officials around him&mdash;he has an entirely brand new Department which only came into existence since the Free State came into being&mdash;may have been at a loss to know what particular branch or sub-department of his Ministry should deal with this question of the purchase of foreign coal and the other remedies which should have been taken to deal with the situation.  He has several branches in his Department.  He has a Trade and Industry Branch.  He may have been at a loss to know whether it was the Trade and Industry branch that should deal with the situation or the Financial Branch.  On the other hand, the Transport and Marine Branch, in which is included the steamship Helga, I suppose, might have been called upon to deal with the situation. There was also the Geological Survey. Of course, the Geological Survey would not have a direct bearing on this question because in the nature of things when a Government Department comes to deal with a business transaction, it does not want to leave itself open to a charge of being slovenly.  It wants to be fine and large and imaginative and to stretch the transaction as far as possible. It does not go down to Castlecomer or Arigna but it goes across to Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> I suppose the fact of our purchasing this coal from Germany helped to strengthen the League of Nations or something, or it gave the Minister for External Affairs something to do.  At any rate, we went to Germany, although at the particular time that we went to Germany to buy coal, coal from Arigna was coming up to Dublin and was being exported through the port of Dublin.  So we had the extraordinary sight that, side by side with the importation of Germans, Frenchmen and Belgians, we had the importation of German coal and the exportation of our own coal.  No steps were taken by the Minister to develop these coalfields.  In reply to a question the last day he told me that he could not find time to send his staff down to Castlecomer to examine the outlying seams of that coalfield.  I suggest to the House that the Minister had an unique opportunity at this time to develop Irish coalfields, and as that opportunity will not occur again, that the Minister should explain to this House why he did not take some steps to develop the coal resources of the country at that time.  Of course, the Minister was enjoying himself, I suppose. It is, in fact, extraordinary to me how this large body of officials, who are costing the Irish people £120,000 per annum, even got to know that there was a coal strike on.  They seem to have fallen asleep in the middle of it, and they only woke up to the gravity of the situation when the coal merchants approached them and when the cries of the poor for some help to relieve them in their distress began to be heard about the city.  They in their handsome apartments, with their beautiful furniture, their carpets and all the rest of it, are too engrossed with their golf and all the rest of it, and could not be bothered with the poor of the slums or whether they were starving for coal in the back streets of the city.  It was not a matter for the Department apparently.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce is not there to look after Irish industries.  It is there to fill up forms, to supply returns and furnish statistics of emigration and the decline of our industries.  It is not there to do any solid practical work such as <Col N="1321" /> could have been done in the opportunity that offered itself in 1926 to develop the coal industry of this country.  Then, as if the Minister were not satisfied, in true red-tape style and with the traditional regulations behind him, he purchased this coal at the farthest place possible from the point of delivery, and bought it at a time even when it exceeded the highest price of the period of the coal strike. The Minister was not satisfied with that.  To show us that he had real business acumen, that he was not a slovenly business man, and that he could give an example to the business men of the country of how a business transaction could be carried out, what kind of coal did he buy?  The average price, we are told, was £3 10s. 0d. per ton, but it included briquettes, briquettes with the Kaiser's head on them, and which, when they were burned in slum rooms in the back streets of Dublin, went off in explosions and created a shocking odour. They were perilous to the health of the young who had the misfortune to be seated beside any fire in which they were lighted.  I submit this whole transaction is a typical example of the well-known saying that you have often a successful operation and that a surgeon has reason to be proud of himself even if the patient dies.  Here we have an Estimate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have here an estimate to make up a further amount of £580 to complete this transaction.  I submit to the House that the Minister is in the position of the doctor of whom I spoke. He has carried through a very successful transaction.  Whether he was made a tool of by the coal merchants of Dublin or not I do not know; but I know that this transaction did not benefit the poor of Dublin, for whom it was supposed to be carried out, and that the Irish people have to suffer a heavy loss as a consequence.  I hope when the Minister is replying he will be good enough to give us the facts and the figures of the situation which he <Col N="1322" /> refused to give to Deputy Johnson when he asked what amount of each quality of coal was purchased by the Minister, what was the amount per ton paid for it, and what was the amount of coal on his hands at the conclusion of the whole business for which he could find no purchaser.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has, more or less, a rather intimate knowledge of the coal business, and who, at the time of the coal strike, was largely connected with that business, I would like to say that when the strike occurred there were very few people who believed that it would not collapse within a reasonable time.  At the time of the coal strike Ireland was in the exceptionally lucky position of having enormous stocks of coal in Dublin, which made it look as if the people in this country would have sufficient coal for at least a three months' supply.  It would have looked foolish on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have, at that time, rushed in and purchased coal which might have left a considerable quantity of coal on hands had the strike collapsed at an early stage.  It was the general opinion of the people in Ireland, and in England, that the strike would not last long, and this opinion was shared by the miners.  During the strike every person in the coal business made every possible effort to procure fuel.  The firm in which I am interested, were, as I have said, in the coal trade, and they approached all the various Irish coal mines.  We were unable to get from them any quantities of coal.  From Arigna, Castlecomer, and other companies we received letters that they could not guarantee a delivery of coal inside of six weeks.  Therefore, to say that there was any neglect on the part of the coal merchants in the matter of endeavouring to develop the Irish coal mines by purchasing coal from them at the time is absolutely unfounded.  Certain institutions were given preference by the Irish coal mines.  The coal which was sent round from these collieries was divided and rationed amongst institutions such as asylums, which could not get coal otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After two or three months of the coal strike, the position became acute and <Col N="1323" /> when we were approaching the winter, and when there was no such thing as fuel in the country, the Government took steps to provide coal without waiting until what might have been a serious situation had arisen.  The Government were obliged to go to Germany, America and many other places, and to get coal wherever they could get it.  In very many cases that coal took six weeks to reach Ireland, and it was very difficult for anyone at that time to look six weeks ahead.  As one conversant with the coal trade, I am aware that a great many huge losses were made by the persons in the coal business at that time.  I can verify that statement.  We had a large quantity of briquettes which are sneered at now.  But the people were mighty glad to get them no matter what the cost.  Individual merchants, like the Government, had to take precautions and yet with all these precautions, it was found when the strike was over that many of the coal merchants had large quantities of briquettes and coal on their hands.  Remember that the coal which the Government had ordered took six weeks in transit.  Under the circumstances, I must say that the attack that has been made by the opposite benches for the losses in connection with this coal is very unfair.  No person was in a position to know how soon the coal strike would collapse.  If the Minister had neglected to order that coal and if the coal strike had gone on during the winter period, a large number of people would probably have died of cold and from the impossibility of not being able to get sufficient fuel to cook food.  I do not think that the statement which was made by Deputy Derrig carries any weight because the position was at the time very uncertain.  I am perfectly satisfied that under the circumstances the Minister did the best he could for the country and he did this under very exceptional and special conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise for the reason that I do not want to give a silent vote on this matter.  I listened, with a good deal of attention and interest, to the speech of Deputy Derrig.  I must say I was particularly struck by the manner in which he marshalled his arguments against this Vote.  His case was spoiled <Col N="1324" /> only by his rather petty remarks relative to the fine times enjoyed by the Minister and his officials.  That is a class of cheap sneer in which I do not want to indulge and I hope I shall never countenance such things.  At the same time, having the experience that I have and the opinions that I had during that particular period of the coal shortage in this country I cannot agree to vote in favour of this Vote.  In the City of Cork we had to set up a Coal Emergency Fund in order to meet the requirements of many of our people who were then unemployed and in order to provide them with coal. Knowing as we did and having proof we have now that most of them in the trade engaged in that pleasurable occupation&mdash;to them at least&mdash;of profiteering&mdash;and we have evidence of gross profiteering having occurred in the coal trade in the City of Cork&mdash;I want to make manifest by my vote on this occasion, my own protest against profiteering by the coal merchants in the period under discussion.  That period synchronised, as I have already said, with a period of serious depression and unemployment in Cork City.  For that reason I intend to vote against the passing of this £580.  Deputy Shaw told us of the enormous stocks of coal which were in Dublin on the outbreak of the coal strike.  Is it not strange that we in Cork heard nothing about the large accumulations of stocks of coal in Dublin in or about that time?  It would have been quite easy for the coal merchants in Dublin and those associated with Deputy Shaw outside Dublin to have remembered that charity begins at home and that Cork was not so far from Dublin.  They might have let us know about these accumulations in Dublin.  It is rarely I find that I have anything in common with the Fianna Fáil benches but on this occasion I intend to vote against the proposal to pay £580 for coal purchased during the coal emergency in 1926.</P>

      <P>In opposing this Vote I wish to point out that judging by the material received there was no supervision whatsoever as to the quality of the coal purchased.  Anything and everything was called coal and dumped into this country and paid for out of Government <Col N="1325" /> funds.  Apparently a large staff was employed in the Minister's office but he could not spare anybody to look at what was being paid for out of the public funds.  I maintain that this Vote should not be looked for under the head of Vote 72.  It should be looked for under the heading of Vote 64&mdash;Warlike Stores&mdash;for the material that was received from Germany was undoubtedly the same material that the Germans used in manufacturing poison gas.  I consider that when the Minister was bringing this coal over he had a right to bring over at the same time a supply of gas masks, or get them in England.</P>

Let us go further and see the contemptible manner in which this coal, if you can call it coal, is being unloaded on the people; let us see the manner in which the Government is seeking to unload this material on the public.  It is more contemptible still.  I and other Deputies have asked questions about this coal.  For instance, in Haulbowline national schools the Government insisted on this fuel being burned.  They insist on it being burned where the children are, despite the fact that a medical officer of health sent a certificate to the Board of Works to the effect that this coal was dangerous to public health.  Still, the Government and the Board of Works insisted on the coal being used until the matter was exposed here.  Then they said that they did not know it was being used, and they would have inquiries made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>You will get it here. There was a large quantity of this material dumped into Haulbowline after the coal strike, when it was no longer necessary to bring it to Dublin. In reply to a question a short time ago, I was told that though good quality coal was held up in Haulbowline for supplying the British men-of-war in the harbour, any material was good enough to be supplied to the Irish taxpayers. We were told also that until the supply there was exhausted, they could not consider giving any other quality of coal to the inhabitants of Haulbowline. They also said that they had a free launch bringing it over.  The amount at present charged for this famous material in Haulbowline&mdash;the stuff you would want to use a gas-mask in connection with&mdash;is £2 8s. a ton.  That is the price charged for stuff that the coal merchants of Ireland actually paid people to take away.  We hear cheap sneers, particularly from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that there are no brains on this side of the House, and that all the brains are on the other side.  I am afraid when the College of Surgeons gets a hold of the Minister's head and chops at it with a hammer and chisel, it will bring a lot of sawdust out of it.</P>

      <P>I noticed that the Minister refused to give an explanation to Deputy Johnson as to the class of fuel that was received.  He purchased it, I presume, in connection with one of his Public Safety Bills. What he really got was warlike material to make poison gas of.  I suppose it was meant to smoke us all out. I do not know if that was the real purpose the Minister had in purchasing it.  I do not think there is anything more despicable than the manner in which the Government are trying to unload this material on the public.  To my mind it is material that they should be made pay for themselves.  It should <Col N="1327" /> be included in Vote 64, because it is undoubtedly, as proved by the Medical Officer's certificate, material that is a danger to the public health.  The certificate is in the possession of the Board of Works, and I think the Minister saw it.  I oppose this Vote, and I suggest the least the Minister might do is to pay the money himself, seeing that he made such an idiot of himself in purchasing the coal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very easy thing to be wise after the event.  A good many people engaged in the coal trade found themselves exactly in the same position as the Government did.  I remember after the commencement of the coal strike asking one of the biggest merchants in the South of Ireland, a man interested in the importation of close on one million tons of coal in the year, how long he thought the strike would last.  He said he thought it would last two or three weeks.  I asked him that because if it was going to last longer many people would lay in supplies of coal to carry them over a period.  But so insistent was he that the strike, on account of its size, could not last more than two or three weeks, no precautions were taken.  Those who were interested in the coal trade for years, for generations, and who owned mines in England and were in close touch with all the circumstances of the trade, were of the deliberate opinion that the strike could not last more than two or three weeks.  I do not see how a Government Department could have any better information as to the duration of the strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The surplus that was left in the Government's hands was nothing to the surplus left in the merchants' hands.  There were merchants who paid £3 and £3 10s. per ton for coal, and they were people who knew the inner workings of the trade and the inner workings of the strike.  On their hands were left thousands of tons of coal.  This is what happened to them, and how could a Government Department be expected to be wiser than people who were so intimately connected with the coal trade?  I take it the advice the Department looked for was the advice of those interested, <Col N="1328" /> those who knew every particle of what was going on in the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">

      <P>We have had typical meanderings in speeches here, from Arigna to Germany, and from Germany to America, and we have got also the expert opinion of Deputy Corry.  What was the condition of the country at the end of this strike?  It took six weeks for cargoes to arrive here.  Nobody knew but that the strike would last for another six months, and I think the Government was in an extremely happy position to have such a small quantity left on its hands.  If the quantity left on the Government's hands is compared with what was left in the hands of the Northern Government and the British Government, I say no case whatever can be made out against this Vote, and no case whatever is being made out against it by the Opposition Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask, from the experience that has been gained by the Minister, what provision he intends to make for future industrial troubles in England.  We have in this country an almost inexhaustible supply of peat fuel, and from experiments carried out by the Leinster Carbonising Company they maintain that their compressed fuel is equal to coal in the ratio of 7 to 8, and that its cost would be proportionately the same. This company are experimenting in what may eventually be necessary as a stand-by for coal strikes in England, and I suggest that their output, which is the product of Irish labour, should get a preference in Government and public institutions.  The Government should allow public bodies who are acting as the trustees of public money to give a preference to this commodity.  If the cost should be anything higher, we have at least the advantage that it is the product of Irish labour.  A few months ago we had a Vote for £150,000 <Col N="1329" /> for the relief of unemployment, and I think any money spent on this commodity over and above the proportionate value of coal, will be well spent.  It would give an opportunity for developing further the peat industry, and provide a stand-by or storage for times of industrial crisis.</P>

In the disposal of public money they should get preferential treatment for this product of Irish labour.</P>

      <P>Deputy Egan made a statement and I am merely commenting on it, and I hope I am not transgressing the rules of order.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce had been thinking in the interests of the people, and had less in common with Lord Londonderry and his type, he would have made better provision than he did <Col N="1330" /> to meet the emergency.  For the information of Deputies I challenge the Minister to deny that hundreds of tons of these briquettes had to be taken from the stores on the north side in which they were placed and dumped in the Liffey, owing to the fact that they went on fire in these stores.  Is the cost of these briquettes going to be recovered?  The money which purchased them was public money.  I think the Minister is in duty bound to let the House know exactly what caused such wholesale squandering of public funds.  Was it because he neglected to rise to the occasion, and that he had so much in common with Lord Londonderry and the coalowners of England, and that a demand for coal in England in the early stages of the strike would embarrass the coalowners?  The lesser the demand the more convenient it was for those who were propagating that strike.  As the last Deputy said, the Minister should also let the House know what provision he intends to make in the future for such an emergency, because no matter what Deputy Egan or anybody else may think to the contrary you can be quite certain that the miners of England are not yet beaten.</P>

I think it is an extraordinary thing, if it is true, that the State controls individuals or institutions with regard to the fuel they burn or where they should get it.  Are we to understand that the State is supplying some institutions in Cork with fuel free?  Otherwise I cannot understand the remark of Deputy Corry, and I want it cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister can hardly be satisfied with the advocates who have come forward to his assistance from his own side in connection with this Vote.  It is rather an extraordinary thing, for instance, to find Deputy Shaw putting forward, as a reason for the Minister not taking action, that there were large stocks of coal on hands when the strike started. One would have thought that that would make the Minister's task easier to conserve these stocks as much as possible, so that if the strike lasted over any length of time there was always that reserve and it would be available. That was the reason Deputy Shaw gave in defence of the Minister.  Then both <Col N="1332" /> Deputy Shaw and Deputy Egan asked how could the Minister have realised, when they and their friends did not realise, that the strike was going to last.  If a State or a Government is of any use at all, surely it is the business of the State and the Government to look ahead to protect the people from such a misfortune overtaking them as overtook them in October, November and December, 1926.</P>
      <P>No one can look back at that time without being perfectly satisfied that a big Department, with great resources in men and money, failed utterly to meet a situation that could have been easily dealt with.  It had got plenty of time and could have got the great assistance that Deputy Shaw alluded to in dealing with it.  They had the whole of the fine summer when there could have been encouragement to produce peat fuel.  They could have got big stocks of coal and they could have got two not inconsiderable coal mines within the country working that, one would have thought, would have been a large help.  Yet, in the Minister's speech I did not find any mention of communication with either Arigna or Castlecomer or any other place.  I suppose that would not be laying the economic foundations of the State in the scientific way the Minister described in his speech in the tariff debate. I think this is about as discreditable a transaction or episode as any Government could have in its history. At the end of October you have an unfortunate people in the plight that they could not get coal or fuel or anything else, due entirely to the failure of the Government to take any action.  You had them lining up in queues paying 2d. a sod for turf and 1/- a stone for coal, and many even unable to get it at that price.  Yet we find that men who claim to be good citizens come forward and defend such a transaction as that. The Minister need not attempt to make a scapegoat of the Coal Merchants' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no such organisation, and there never was.  There is no trade union of that name.  There is no limited liability company of that name.  When he met the coal merchants in May, 1926, he had no right to assume that there was an organisation behind them. <Col N="1333" /> When he expressed his surprise that that organisation did not keep him informed of their dwindling stocks and their gradual disinclination to buy, and that it was with great surprise he discovered that at the end of October only five out of nineteen merchants were ordering coal, he should not attempt to make a scapegoat of the Coal Merchants' Association.  Any fool could have told him there was no such Association in existence, for all practical purposes.  Yet he told us that the way it was brought to his notice was that a certain gas undertaking complained that they were unable to get coal they required.  When he asked about it he found that the coal merchants had offered them suitable coal. Another mark of his innocence was that he never discovered that when coal is scarce the merchant who has any coal has every possible class of coal.  If one went to a merchant, and if there was any coal in the stores, he would be told that even if he wanted to buy anthracite beans he could get them, and the probability is that his order would he promptly fulfilled out of the scrapings of the yard.  That was very common during the old times of coal control.</P>
    <P>There could be a great deal said regarding the methods taken by the Minister to meet the situation, especially in regard to prices, when he did proceed to act at the end of October, but, as you, sir, have ruled that all mention of prices is out of order, I suppose that cannot be gone into.  I can only say that when the Minister agreed to 22/- per ton as a reasonable sum to allow for the discharge and delivery of coal in Dublin, he was deliberately encouraging merchants to profiteer.  That is, I think, more than half of the present price of the best coal.  No such price was allowed for such services in 1920, when money was about one-third of the cost it was in 1926.  Certainly not more than half.  No such price was allowed at that time, and 22/- for such a service as that showed that the Minister was dealing with the whole situation in a most careless and indifferent way.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy Egan that everything went well and that the Government were to be congratulated in <Col N="1334" /> having met the situation in such a splendid way.  Certainly a number of people in the country are to be congratulated. Only last week a coal merchant in the provinces was showing the position to his friends, and invited their inspection of his books, showing the splendid profits he made during the coal trouble of 1926.  He has been every winter since, including the present winter, in the South of France, and only last week a coal merchant known to a number of Deputies on the other side was showing figures to his friends and boasting how well he came out of it. That sort of thing is going to go on again and again, and if the House takes up the attitude that it is all past and done with, and that there is no good to worry about it any more, I hold that in justice to the unfortunate people who suffered so much during that time, and in justice to those who had a right to claim protection of the State, any man with any sense of feeling in his heart, or decency in his head should not vote for this Estimate.</P>

      <P>This debate has wandered over a variety of things, from the League of Nations to the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; and geological survey, but really they have nothing to do with this particular item.  Deputy Derrig wandered into another line, and I was glad to hear Deputy Anthony announce that he would not follow that line. There is a particular type of meanness which is only limited by the order of one's intelligence.  If a man wants to attack people he ought to attack those who are here.  He should not attack civil servants who are outside <Col N="1335" /> and talk about their gorgeous apartments and so forth.  If the Deputy is courageous and wants to break a lance let him, at least, do it with people who are in the House.</P>

      <P>If it is, there are pupils and there are people who need admonition.  Deputy Derrig spoke about Irish coal and said that in answer to a question put to me recently I stated that I had no time to go into it.  That is a complete misstatement. I said nothing of the sort. I do not know whether the Deputy is deliberately falsifying what was said openly or whether he is incapable of understanding what was said.  I would ask him to get the answer and see why a particular geological matter could not be looked into at a particular time. I was asked why we allowed the export of Arigna coal at that time.  We could not prevent it when it had been contracted for previously for export. We came upon cases where ships were able to fill up with bunker coal here. There were only one or two which could do so.  That was stopped after <Col N="1336" /> a while when attention was directed to it, but one could not interfere with contracts when firms had entered into them previously.  Deputy Derrig and others seemed to be under the impression that there was no Arigna coal bought at the time of this crisis. Deputy Shaw gave him the correct answer.  Neither in Arigna nor elsewhere could the supply of orders be met, and any assistance asked for was given both to those producing peat and those cutting coal.  Everything possible was done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the full representations, but they were helped to get coal out, and they were enabled to meet their orders, and it was not put to us that anything extra we could do would enable them to get more coal out in order to give their customers greater supplies.  Deputy Anthony spoke of profiteering.  I do not know that there was profiteering under the particular items of this Vote.  I say now, as I said previously when dealing with this matter, that it is quite wrong to assume profiteering because a particular price was quoted as the selling price for either peat or coal.  I made investigations in what seemed to be glaring cases, but I found there was nobody receiving, on the many transactions that the particular consignment had to pass through, an amount which could be called profiteering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>Was any attempt made during that period to control the price of coal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Attempts were made to control the price of coal in certain respects.  We had to watch certain things which were happening.  We made investigation in what seemed glaring cases, but the result showed that there were so many middle-men engaged, who seemed to be necessary to bring coal to the cities&mdash;and that was the big consideration at the time&mdash; that no one could be said to be receiving what could be described as <Col N="1337" /> profiteering.  In the end, what the consumers had to pay looked like profiteering, but the amount charged was made up amongst all the hands concerned in the various transactions.  I came across no cases of profiteering, and many cases were examined.  Somebody said that a certain coal merchant was able to go to the South of France by reason of the profits made then.  Profiteering did not arise on a particular consignment, but on the amount of money a man was able to speculate against the end of the strike.  A man may have gone to the South of France on money made in a legitimate way.  He may have had money to speculate.  He took his chance of getting a consignment, which he may have ordered, getting to this country after the strike.  I do not know whether I will be blamed for the outbreak of the strike or for its collapse. I could be criticised severely if I bought an enormous quantity of coal, double the amount of coal that was bought.  If the strike collapsed and that amount of coal was left on my hands, while coal was coming in at the old rate, what denunciation there would be!  I would not, however, try to justify myself as I might do, according to Deputy Moore's statement, that because there was plenty of coal in the country I should buy more coal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>According to my note, the Deputy said that one good reason for getting more coal was that there was plenty of coal in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is he did not buy coal at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am to be criticised for anything, it is that there was not enough coal bought.  There was a very uneasy period.  On the one hand there was the fact that coal was not in the country at that particular time, that it was impossible to get coal of the quality one would have liked, and that for any quantity one had to pay a big price.  That had to be ordered against the collapse of the strike.  That collapse <Col N="1338" /> being inevitable, the only thing in doubt was its date.</P>
      <P>I have not previously attempted, and I will not now attempt, to make a scapegoat of the Coal Merchants' Association. I may disregard what Deputy Moore said in that connection.  If the Coal Merchants' Association made certain statements about me I am not saying that they made a scapegoat of me. That Association made certain statements to me with regard to the amount of coal in the country.  They decided to keep on forward purchases, but there came a period when these purchases were not being met, because coal had advanced about three times the purchase price, and the finances of the concerns did not allow them to make the same forward purchases that would be possible when coal was one-third the price.  It is not good criticism months after the events to be very wise and to say there should have been certain forward buying and certain things should have been looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Corry's question, I am quite in the dark with regard to that whole episode.  I do not know how that particular school comes to be supplied with Government coal, or how the Government could insist on that particular school taking a particular type of coal.  It could not apply to an ordinary school, but Haulbowline is not that.  With regard to the British ships getting coal, they got nothing from Haulbowline but what they themselves put there.  They got the coal previously lodged there, and they were not supplied with coal from my Department, and I was not forcing briquettes or anything else on them.  Deputy Boland raised the point about arrangements for the future.  I do not know as to the future demand I should have to estimate for year after year.  That is a matter for the trade.  And at a critical period steps have to be taken to meet the crisis.  The Deputy went on to refer to another type of product, and his reference in that respect was hardly relevant to the estimate.  I may be allowed to answer in this way, though I am not exactly sure as to what he is referring to, I can say that there is always a provision that institutions under Government control should use a <Col N="1339" /> certain amount of Irish coal and the same would apply to the mixture of which the Deputy was apparently speaking.  Deputy Cooney asked was it a fact that a lot of briquettes had to be thrown into the Liffey.  I do not know. It looked when a ship went on fire as if the only way of putting out that fire was to sink the ship, but the fire was put out before that became necessary. There was a payment of £10 or £15 to the Fire Brigade for their services in that connection.  If a certain type of coal is subject to spontaneous combustion I will not take that as any responsibility of my Department, nor would I regard it as criticism of the coal to say that it took fire.  I have also heard the criticism that on occasions it could not be got to take fire.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister state what assistance has been given to the Arigna coal mine to enable coal to be got out?  On last Tuesday a contract for 500 tons of coal for a mental hospital was decided.  The Arigna mine tendered, and there was also a tender from a Scotch firm.  The quotations were equal, but it was a condition that the coal had to be delivered by a specified time.  Owing to lack of railway facilities the Arigna coal could not be supplied in time, and as a result lost the contract.  At present the Arigna mine is unable to supply the requirements of one of the local institutions.</P>

There is one transaction about which an action at law was taken.  Payment for that is still pending.  I can state roughly, however, that the loss to the State was about £60,000.  There would be a variation on that according to the payment to be made in the transaction mentioned.

Deputy Maguire's question related to the extent or nature of the help given, and if it was of a kind that would be permanent it ought to have assisted them to fulfil that later contract.

      <P>I do not desire to say very much on this Bill.  I do not think I could say very much unless I were to repeat what I said on the original motion.  But there is one point I would like to put forward for the consideration of the Minister and the House and it is this: During the discussion on the motion the Minister and the House refused to restore the old conditions to all the old age pensioners and blind pensioners.  I want to ask the Minister and the House to make a much smaller concession.  I put it to the Minister that he should agree that the old conditions, that is to say, the conditions which obtained prior to the passing of the 1924 Act, should be restored so far as the blind pensioners are concerned.  I think there are roughly about 3,000 of them in the Saorstát. The number of blind pensioners whose <Col N="1347" /> income, as distinct from the pension, would be in excess of 6/- per week is rather small, and if the Minister and the House were to agree to my suggestion the cost to the State would be comparatively small.  The House, of course, is aware what my views are, that the old conditions should be restored to all, both the blind and the old age pensioners. However, the House by a majority decided that that would not be done.  I suggest, however, that a special case can be made for the blind pensioner. The old age pensioners, whether men or women, even if they are over seventy years of age, may be of some use in the home.  There are many useful little things they can do, and in many cases they are helpful in the home.  On the contrary, the blind pensioner is of no help.  As a matter of fact it is the other way about, and therefore I hope Deputies will agree that blind pensioners are on a different footing to the old age pensioners, particularly when you take into consideration that under the Acts in operation at present, as they apply to the blind, a person must be so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential in order to qualify for a blind pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a recommendation made by the Old Age Pensions Committee I know, of course, that the Minister has promised to introduce legislation to amend the Act in so far as it deals with blind pensioners.  I hope that the introduction of that legislation will not be delayed much longer.  In regard to the provisions in the Blind Persons Act to which I have referred, let me give an illustration of cases that can occur. Take the case of a man who is a tailor. He has been at the tailoring business all his life-time and reaches, say, the age of 55 or 60 years.  He becomes blind to such an extent that it is absolutely impossible for him to carry on his ordinary trade, but in the opinion of the Department's inspector he has still sufficient sight to enable him to shovel, say, mud into a cart.  That is the position as it is under the Act at the moment.  A man in a position such as that cannot obtain the blind pension. The concession that I am asking for on behalf of blind pensioners is not, <Col N="1348" /> I submit, too much.  The cost of it will be very small, and I hope the Minister and the House will see their way to agree to it.  I hope the Minister will give the matter his favourable consideration, and will embody a proposal in the Bill, on the Committee Stage, to carry into effect the terms of the concession I plead for on behalf of the blind pensioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'KELLY Mr. O'KELLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>The views of this Party were expressed on this subject when it was under discussion in the House a fortnight or so ago.  We were anxious that the rights which the old age pensioners and blind pensioners enjoyed before the passing of the 1924 Act should be fully restored to them. That is what we would like to have done, but the Government and the House thought otherwise.  A majority decided to accept the amendment proposed at the time by the Minister for Finance.  We may take it that the Bill now before us is constructed on the principle of the amendment then passed.  We do not take this Bill, or the proposals contained in it, as a satisfactory fulfilment of the things that we would like to have done for, or the rights that we would like to have restored to, the old age pensioners of the country, but in so far as the Bill restores part of their rights we are satisfied with and do not propose to offer any opposition to it.</P>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to the appeal made by Deputy Morrissey for more lenient treatment for the blind. In the vast majority of cases, probably, their blindness is an affliction of Providence. Therefore, they are not in a position to help themselves.  They are a class in the community that the State, if they can afford to do it at all, ought to treat with more than ordinary generosity.  I would like to emphasise the point that it is our view that the request put forward by Deputy Morrissey, if it can be done at all, should be acceded to so far as the blind are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a general feeling, which, I think, is not confined to any Party in the House, that the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act by the officials in the Department of Finance, who are naturally acting under the <Col N="1349" /> instructions of the Minister, has been too severe.  The difficulties placed in the way of some old age pensioners as regards getting the pension seem to be too difficult and extravagant.  Cases have been brought before the House by Deputies from all Parties.  Scarcely a day passes that some question is not asked with regard to some old age pensioner in the country whose claim to a pension has been admitted by the local committee, but which has been turned down either by the local inspector or the Department of Finance.  Cases have been brought to my own notice where difficulty was experienced by blind persons in securing evidence such as a baptismal certificate on which to base a claim.  Such certificates could not be got for one reason or another. Of course, we know there is a difficulty with regard to the census.  It is fairly common.  Notwithstanding that, some cases have been brought to my notice where no less than three sworn affidavits were submitted to the Department and to the inspector by people of repute in support of claims to pensions made by old people.  The persons making the affidavits offered their testimony that the person applying for the pension had reached the age limit required, but even that testimony was not accepted by the Department, although there was no question as to the reliability or respectability of the witnesses who made the affidavits.</P>
    <P>My opinion is&mdash;and I think it is not alone the opinion of my friends on this side of the House, but that it is fairly general amongst members of the House and in the country&mdash;that the screws have been applied too tightly in the administration, and that there should be a relaxation and a little loosening up of the rules governing the admission of evidence of age and also on the question of income.  Of course I take it this law will be passed limiting the amount of income, but even within the law unamended as it stands, or amended as it will be, there should be a considerable amount of alleviation of the sufferings of these people if the officials were permitted, under the instructions of the Minister, to exercise a little more leniency in their treatment of applicants.  I think in cases of the kind which I mentioned, where there have <Col N="1350" /> been three affidavits of people in the neighbourhood, some of whom had good reasons for knowing all the particulars concerning the applicant for a pension, evidence of that kind should be taken.  Further than that we on this side have nothing more to say with regard to the Bill.  It is not now in our province or in our power to increase the benefits to be given to old age pensioners.  If we had that power we would do so, but there is no use in going into that again.  We have already expressed our views, but we do take some credit for the fact that one of the first fruits of our coming into this Dáil has been to secure for these old age pensioners some of the rights which were filched from them and which are now being restored, largely, we claim, owing to the fact that we are here.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to the appeal Deputy Morrissey made.  The Minister should consider carefully whether he could not make a further concession in the case of blind pensioners.  The tragedy of their situation has been graphically described by Deputy Morrissey.  I am not going to add anything to it.  Most of us have been in touch with cases of the sort when a worker is struck blind and helpless. Anything that we could do to relieve the situation for them, to give them some help, to remove from them a little of the sense of utter helplessness, I think we should endeavour to do, and I would strongly urge the Minister to consider sympathetically, as I know he will, the appeal of Deputy Morrissey.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to the plea of Deputies Morrissey, Alton and Sean T. O'Kelly, with reference to the blind.  I hope the Minister will take those three thousand blind pensioners into consideration when giving the increase on the 6th April.  At the present time, to my mind, speaking as a medical man, the test is too severe.  That, of course, cannot be remedied at present, but I hope the Minister, when he is deciding what is to be the actual test for blindness, will take that into consideration.  There is a <Col N="1351" /> type of pensioner in rural districts of Ireland whose claims have not been considered sufficiently, and I hope that when the Minister is issuing his new books on the 6th April in the first week of the coming financial year, he will consider the old age pensioners in rural Ireland, the old age pensioner who has kept for himself the grass of a cow which he does not own and who is living in an old thatched cottage.  The value put on the means of such an old man or old woman has been heretofore too high. I submit that there should now be a revaluation of the means of all these old age pensioners.  If their means are re-valued, everyone of them will practically come within the scope of the present Bill.  Take, for instance, the case of an old age pensioner living with his son.  The old age pensioner has no legal rights in that house except that he is there by virtue of the goodwill of his son.  I know of such cases in County Roscommon.  If these people were turned out on the road they would then be entitled to the full increase, but at present they will be excluded from the benefits of the Act.  It is to ask the Minister to consider the cases of these old age pensioners in rural Ireland when he is issuing the new books in April that I rise on the present occasion.</P>

      <P>I, too, join with Deputy Morrissey in appealing to the Minister for a further concession for the blind. Personally, I consider that a blind person of any age should be a pensioner, because even where you have a young person blind he or she is a tax on the family to which he or she belongs. There is no ratepayer in the country who would grudge the little that is given to the family who have to maintain and provide for that blind person. These blind persons are not able to do anything for themselves.  They are not able to do anything for the household. The household is taxed by caring for them and looking after them, and I think it is the duty of the nation and of the Dáil to help these afflicted people.  I think all the family is afflicted by reason of having that blind person amongst them.  I am certain nobody in this House representing any <Col N="1352" /> constituency need be afraid to go back to his constituents after voting to give some concession like this to the blind people.  I am certain the Minister will accede to Deputy Morrissey's request. I would be very glad, indeed, that he would, because it would cost so little.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to go into the general question of old age pensions, but there is one aspect of which I have some experience as a member of a sub-committee dealing with old age pensions.  It has been a very contentious one and has operated very unfairly to the applicants.  That is the means on which the pensions officer bases his calculation of the applicant's income.  That applies with particular significance to country people, people living, as Deputy O'Dowd pointed out, on a form of charity with relatives.  It is a difficult question to decide, undoubtedly.  The extraordinary part of it is that if a person living on a form of charity like that is supplied with ordinary requirements in the way of housing accommodation, perhaps some food and other little allowances on the farm, the calculation of means is worked in a way that is very unjust to the applicant.  I have found that the pension officer, who is there as a civil servant, authorised to investigate the various claims on their merits, is somehow hedged in and is not in a position to negotiate with the Committee so as to arrive jointly with the Committee at a calculation on a proper basis.  I fail to understand why there should be any form of secrecy on the part of the pension officer, why he should not place his cards on the table before the Sub-Committee, who are the representatives of the people, and who have full knowledge of local requirements and of the means of these applicants.  I do not think you could find a better judge of the means of an applicant in a country area than the representative living in that area. They are people mainly drawn from the farming class.  They understand to the last degree what the value of farming allowances is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, you have their opinion set aside.  The pension officer comes along.  He is generally a young man who has very little experience of <Col N="1353" /> rural conditions and, if he has experience of rural conditions or agricultural conditions, they apply to a different area to the one he is operating in.  I have in mind the conditions in the West where the value of land is infinitely smaller than it would be in other parts of the Saorstát.  Those pension officers calculate the means of the applicant and, when asked by the Committee on what basis they have made the calculation, I have, again and again, heard them refuse and state that their refusal was because they were not authorised by their employers, the State, to give away the basis of the calculation on which they make out the means of the applicants.  I cannot, for the life of me, understand why that secrecy should be observed by the officials as to disclosing to the Committees the basis on which these means are calculated. The local Committee are the best judge of the means.  They are the people who pay for the cost of the old age pensions.  Why then should the pension officer be instructed to keep back from them information he has at his disposal?  The only logical answer to that is that there is a desire on the part of the Government not to allow the old age pensioners to know the full pension to which he or she is entitled according to law.</P>
    <P>No improvement that has taken place towards increasing the old age pension, no improvement in the increase of one shilling a week to the pension, will benefit the applicant.  Any possible benefit that may come to him will depend upon an alteration in the system of the valuation of the land held by the applicant or his relative.  That is the one pivot upon which the applicants will benefit at all as a result of this increase of one shilling a week to certain old age pensioners.  It is quite possible for the officer to gauge the means of every applicant who comes before him as beyond the standard set down, £15 odd, so long as he has the right to keep secret the basis upon which he calculates the means of the applicant.  There should be a full and open discussion by the pension officer with the Old Age Pensions Committee and the applicant for the pension.  I would ask the Government to consider seriously that very important aspect of <Col N="1354" /> the case, and to amend the law, so that in all cases the pension officer will submit to the Committee the basis upon which he is calculating the means.</P>
    <P>As to the blind people and their applications for pensions, there are various instances, in my locality, where I know that those people are in a pitiable condition. Any appeal made on their behalf will, I am sure, have the sympathy and assistance of every person in this House.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the plea made to the Minister by Deputy Morrissey, and I do so as a colleague of Deputy Morrissey on the Old Age Pensions Committee.  The condition of the blind people in this country was brought home very forcibly to me and to the other members who acted on that Committee.  The recommendations made by that Committee to the Minister would, in my opinion, have been of very great service to the old age pensioners throughout the country and especially to the blind.  The Minister and his Department have adopted some of those recommendations.  I hope they will continue the good work and adopt a great many more of them.  I am not going to diverge into the question of the cut in the old age pensions.  I am one of the few left in this House who voted against the old age pension cut in 1924, and I think if we had the assistance then of those we have now on the opposite benches that cut would never have taken place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to Deputy Morrissey's and other Deputies who have seen fit to say a few words on the question of blind pensions.  There would be, perhaps, only about 3,000 blind people in the Saorstát.  That being so, the amount of money required to meet the matter would be relatively very little, and I trust that the Minister for Finance, if he can at all see his way, and if it is at all practicable, will consider the case made for the blind people.  I am quite at one with the Deputies who have spoken on the question of the definition of what constitutes a blind person.  It is rather a difficult matter to give a clear definition of what constitutes a blind person.  I consider that the definition as it stands is too severe.  I would, <Col N="1355" /> respectfully, ask the Minister for Finance to reconsider this matter.  I understand that he has made a partial promise that he will do so.  For myself, as a medical man, I think that any person whose vision cannot be improved by suitable glasses, or whose blindness is due to some disease, should be considered as within the Blind Pensions Act.  I consider that that should constitute a fair definition of blindness. Some people are practically blind.  You get very few people who are absolutely blind.  There is always some degree of vision there.  But, at the same time, these people would not be able to follow their usual pursuits.  They could not, for instance, go up heights and they could not deal with any small objects such as, say, a tailor would have to deal with in the course of his work.  People of that kind whose vision cannot be corrected by suitable glasses might be defined as within the term &ldquo;blind.&rdquo;  It is very hard lines to say to a man &ldquo;We will not give you a blind pension, although you are not able to follow your ordinary calling.&rdquo;  I do not think that is fair and I certainly think that the definition of blindness should be reconsidered, and, if possible, revised.  I think it was Deputy O'Kelly who said that one of the fruits of the Fianna Fáil Deputies coming into the Dáil was the motion in the Dáil recently.</P>
      <P>I make bold to say that I do not think the advent of the Fianna Fáil Deputies made the slightest change at all.  All of us on the Government side were very much grieved and very much put about when the cut took place in 1924, but, for reasons that I will not go into now, and because of things that took place all over the country, I say the cut had to be made.  I say further that were it not for the fact that this cut was made that many of those who to-day are being paid old age pensions and blind pensions would not have been paid any pension at all during the last couple of years.  I join with the other Deputies in asking the Minister to reconsider this whole question and, if possible, to revise his definition of blindness.</P>

      <P>As Deputies have already pointed out, there are a lot of blind people in the country.  I want <Col N="1356" /> to ask the Minister to consider the difficulties that are placed before blind people when they come to make application for a pension.  There are very few eye specialists outside of Dublin; we have only one or two in Connaught. It means that generally the information required by the Minister is so minute and detailed that the people prefer to see a specialist and get his opinion and his certificate.  That puts them, of course, to a lot of expense.  I just want to point out to the House a particular case about which I was speaking to the Minister.  It just shows the difficulty and the amount of trouble that there is in securing a blind pension.  There was a man from Connemara who had to come thirty or forty miles to see an eye specialist.  I have here a certificate which that man got.  The doctor who gave the certificate is professor of ophthalmology in the University College, Galway.  His certificate reads:</P>

Considering the decrease in the price of live-stock which has taken place since the amending Act passed in 1924, will the Minister consider the advisability of revising the regulations issued by the Revenue Department to the Pension Officers when considering the question of the pensioners' means?</P>

      <P>I voted this time with the Government.  I agree that the medical examination for blindness is entirely too severe, and it does not give applicants a reasonable chance.  The proper test should be whether or not they are fit to carry on their own work.  For instance, if a tailor is able to carry on his work he is not sufficiently blind to get a pension; but if he is not able to carry on, he should be entitled to a pension.  I do not think the medical officer's test is sufficient.  He goes out on the street, let us say, and asks an applicant for a pension whether the animal on the street is a cow or a horse. If it is a cow and the applicant says so, that is not sufficient evidence that he is not entitled to get a pension.  There should be more leniency in those examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards means, I still agree with <Col N="1358" /> some Deputies that very often applicants for pensions are maintained by their children or relatives at considerable expense.  These people have to be looked after, and probably they often suffer from illness.  They really are a considerable expense.  I have come across cases where old persons are retained by their relatives.  Instead of the relative sending the old person to the County Home he looks after him, and in a case like that there should be some leniency.  I desire to support the statements made by other Deputies on this matter.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Holt, the appeals come before a section of the Local Government Department, and when it is a question of plain fact the officers in charge or the clerks dealing with it are quite capable of saying that these facts being so the appeal must be turned down because of the statutory limitations. Where it is a question of whether or not the facts are correct, it is usually the custom to send a Departmental Inspector actually to examine and verify the facts to see whether they are as stated.  The question of setting up another board to deal with appeals is not a practicable suggestion at all.</P>
      <P>With regard to the assessment of means, the assessment of stock, etc., for the purpose of seeing what the income of the person is, that is a matter that is kept constantly under review. As late as three months ago the position was reviewed between the officials of the Local Government Department and the Department of Agriculture with the object of seeing an excess value was not placed on things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tubridy points out certain matters.  He suggests the description of a case of blindness that he read out is a clear definition.  I submit it is not too much to ask ophthalmologists that they will have a clear idea as to the degree of blindness that would qualify for a blind pension.  That can be stated in strict technical terms, and, instead of being stated in strict technical terms, it is put in general terms, so that there is or there might reasonably be a tendency to say, &ldquo;Well, if this is a real case of blindness, it would be stated in the technical terms that a <Col N="1359" /> proper description should be enshrined in.&rdquo;  If a person who is blind goes to an ophthalmologist and pays for an examination, and gets a certificate in general terms he is not getting the value of his money and he is not helping himself to be dealt with properly under the Act. Personally, I would say that if a doctor fully qualified to give a clear statement in definite technical terms gives a general description of it, I would be prejudiced against that case of blindness.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, sir, you did not let us drift a little further.  I rise to support the suggestion put forward by Deputy Morrissey that the Minister should give special consideration to the blind people.  I have a few particular cases in mind which prompt me to participate in the debate.  We are all trying to do what we can for our own constituents.  As a matter of fact every Deputy got up to say that there were some blind people in his district.  There are a few blind people in my constituency, and I hope they will come under whatever benefits the Minister will give.  When asked a question a few moments ago relative to a case, the Minister said that if there was any doubt as to the information furnished they would send an Inspector, but if the facts were plain the matter was decided in the Department.  I have before me an answer of the Minister to a question I put about an old age pension in Galway.  I asked on what grounds the pension was refused, and the answer was that the applicant's yearly means exceeded the statutory limit of £39 5s. I should like to know how these means were arrived at.  He was also asked by other Deputies, but he did not say how they were arrived at.  In this particular case the man has no means, because he is living with his brother who could put him out in the morning if he wanted. I suggest that the Minister should bear in mind this particular case of John Lardiner, Carnmore, Oranmore, Co. Galway, and send an Inspector down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the suggestion of Deputy Morrissey, I should be very glad if the Minister would give careful consideration to it, and do something for these particular cases, because they deserve consideration.  With the rest of my Party, I did my utmost to get the shilling back for every pensioner.  We failed, because we were out-voted.  I think it was Deputy White made reference to the fact that only for certain things that occurred there would be <Col N="1361" /> plenty of money.  I will not say anything to the Deputy, there was enough said about him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the suggestion of Deputy Morrissey and to suggest that possibly it might be put in a form which would enable it to be accepted.  This debate, I think, has been unique in the history of the House. There has been no party division in this matter.  There is a consensus of opinion on all sides of the House, apparently, in favour of this thing being done. From the Labour Benches, the Fianna Fáil Benches, the Independent Benches, the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches there has been a request to the Minister to do something.  This is probably the first entirely non-party request for the expenditure of money which has been offered to the Minister, and, as far as I understand it, in so far as the alteration of conditions would involve a payment, neither at this stage nor at any later stage would it be possible for an ordinary Deputy to introduce an amendment.  It has to be done by the will and co-operation and on the initiative of the Front Bench opposite. Where the whole House is of one opinion in relation to the alteration of a measure, it does seem rather absurd &mdash;at least it would seem absurd to the public&mdash;that we should pass a Bill which everybody desired to have altered in a certain direction in a form in which it was not altered.  What I am suggesting is that we have no power.  In the ordinary way we would divide against this Bill to disapprove of its contents, but in so doing we would be taking away benefits which every party in the House, without any discrimination of party complexion or affiliation, desires to have.  Every party, without any relation to party division, is in favour of an alteration in this Bill in a direction in which we have no power to alter it without the consent and on the initiative of the Minister for Finance.  I think I am speaking for every party in the House, and any Deputy who speaks will be in exactly the same position.  No one is asking for party advantage out of this.  No one is going to say.  &ldquo;We scored or you scored&rdquo;; &ldquo;We have taken it away from you or succeeded in doing it.&rdquo;  As <Col N="1362" /> far as this particular concession is concerned, it is a concession asked of the Minister for Finance by the whole House.  The request which we make is that on the Committee Stage he shall insert an amendment which will enable this small extra expenditure for this purpose, universally approved by the House, to be met.</P>

      <P>I think that if the scales for pensions to blind persons are to be differentiated from the scales operating for old age pensioners, the matter should be given a good deal more consideration than Deputy Morrissey or any of us have had an opportunity of giving it.  It is proposed, and a Bill is at present in preparation, to alter the definition of blindness.  I have recognised for some time that the present definition is too strict.  It was something like this: that a person shall be so blind as to be incapable of performing any work for which eyesight is essential.  That is regarded as being too rigid, and it is proposed to alter it.  The Bill which is in preparation will substantially increase the number of persons receiving blind pensions. I do not know, and perhaps nobody can know even during the passage of the Bill, how much it will increase the number of persons receiving blind pensions.  It may increase them by one-third, or even double it.  Consequently, nobody can say what the cost would be of anything we would do in the way of complying with Deputy Morrissey's suggestion. There are other matters.  There are people whose cases are as pitiable and who are as much a burden on their families, if they are assisted by their families, as the blind persons.  There are old age pensioners absolutely crippled, and as good a case could be made out for dealing specially with them as dealing specially with the blind.  As a matter of fact, if we introduce a new definition of blindness, it may be that people will be receiving blind pensions who will be much less helpless than a good many of the old age pensioners.  I do not think the case is made out.  I admit that blind people deserve special consideration, that they are a most pitiable case, speaking generally, but I do not think that a case is made out for <Col N="1363" /> the particular thing that Deputy Morrissey suggests.  Deputy Daly drew attention to another aspect of the whole matter.  At present the old age pension may be obtained at seventy years of age and the blind pensions at fifty years of age.  If we were going to give more money to the blind persons, instead of doing what Deputy Morrissey suggests, making a special scale for blind persons, it might be better to lower the age limit, and make it forty instead of fifty.  Then turn round and take an entirely different way.  It might be that in certain cases of complete blindness there would be a case for going beyond the ten shilling limit rather than what Deputy Morrissey suggests, that is, if once we are going to depart from the ordinary old age pensions scale.  I suggest that this particular matter of the blind is a matter complex enough to be dealt with separately.  I do not think we should do what has not yet been done, and make a separate scale for the blind by, as it were, a side wing, such as an amendment introduced into a Bill dealing with a different matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's motion was not accepted.  I suggest that his motion not having been accepted, and taking the view the Dáil accepted, that we cannot restore in their entirety the pensions and conditions in existence before the 1924 Act, if we are going to do something special for the blind it would require more consideration than has been given to it here.  If we are going to spend thirty, forty or fifty thousand pounds on the blind, as might easily be the case, we ought to consider the matter. As I say, the new Bill is certainly going to bring a considerable number <Col N="1364" /> of persons into the category of blind persons who are at present unable to obtain pensions, and we ought to consider what would be the best way we could spend any extra money voted.</P>
      <P>With regard to the administration of the Old Age Pensions Acts, I do not think it strictly arises here, but as it has been discussed perhaps I may say something about it.  What the Department does is to try and take an even course.  As a matter of fact, there is no instruction to officers to try and keep down pensions.  The only instruction I am aware of given to any officer of the State in connection with the matter was that in case of extreme doubt he should err on the side of agreeing with the pensioner.  But it is often very difficult to get certainty.  Deputy O'Kelly talked about affidavits.  I do not know whether he saw the affidavits himself, but if he did he probably would realise why they could not be accepted.  If a definite affidavit stating the reasons on which the opinions of the person making the affidavit are based, is put in it will be accepted.  But an affidavit saying that John Smith was seventy years of age will not be accepted.  An affidavit saying &ldquo;I am seventy years of age, and I was at school with John Smith; we were in the one class,&rdquo; will be accepted.  Definite affidavits containing the particulars on which the opinion of the person making them are based are accepted.  You cannot rely upon any evidence absolutely. As Deputies are aware from a question asked some time ago there were cases where even birth certificates were faked.  In one district over £15,000 was taken from the Exchequer by a systematic conspiracy for the faking of affidavits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You hear complaints in this House that persons entitled to old age pensions are unable to get them.  Outside the House you hear a great many complaints that persons who have means or are otherwise not entitled to the pension have nevertheless got it.  We know these cases slip through in spite of all precaution.  A horrible murder was committed in the County Wicklow some months ago.  In the evidence at the trial of the murderer it appeared that the murdered woman, who was an old age pensioner, had a farm of land <Col N="1365" /> and in addition an annuity of £100 a year.  She was one of the people who slipped through.  The duty of an officer administering the Old Age Pensions Act is to let people in who are entitled to the pension and to keep those out who are not entitled to the pension. Mistakes will happen in both directions occasionally.  Sometimes people not entitled will get pensions, and occasionally a person who is entitled may fail to prove a case, but the whole effort is to administer the Act absolutely fairly. And as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health said, the question of the value to be allowed for stock and crops and so forth, in calculating means is periodically revised and has recently been revised, and I think on the whole it is as fair as it can possibly be made.  On this Bill I would just say this: It will give immediate benefit to the whole of the poorest section of the people receiving old age pensions.  It will give it to the people who most need it, and most deserve it. I believe, absolutely, and any examination I have made of revenue returns or anything like that confirms me in the view that what is in this Bill is as much as can be afforded at the present time, and that further extension should wait until there is some improvement in conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. MURPHY Mr. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice, after question time to-day, that I would raise a certain matter that was the subject of a question of mine yesterday.  That matter is the failure of the Local Government Department to give the necessary sanction to the proposed appointment by the South Cork Board of <Col N="1366" /> Health of an existing Medical Officer when a dispensary district became vacant.  Now, the question proposed to the Minister was as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that sanction has not yet been given to the proposal of the South Cork Board of Assistance to appoint Dr. E.F. Nyhan, Johnstown, County Cork, to the vacant dispensary district of Carrigaline, and if he will state why sanction has not been given to the proposal to transfer Dr. Nyhan from one Board of Assistance area to another.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this matter as one in which a very important principle is involved. It is not raised because of the merits of the appointment itself or because of any particular person interested in the appointment.  I regard it as one in which the principle is of retaining and guarding whatever freedom the local authorities still enjoy since the passing of the Local Appointments Act.  I have no doubt as to the value of the Local Appointments Act.  I regard it as a measure from which a great deal of good has accrued, and it is because of that, and because I recognise that local authorities have still some rights and ought to have still some freedom that a matter of this kind is very worthy of discussion in the House.  The facts in this case are as follows:&mdash;Some months ago a vacancy occurred in this particular district.  The Board of Assistance notified all the medical officers in that particular area that a certain vacancy existed.  In response to that no application from any existing officer in that area was received.  In fact, only one application was received, and that happened to come from an existing medical officer with practically twenty years' service, who happened to be, at that particular time, the employee of another Board in Cork County.  Nothing has been said against the merits of the appointment so far as the particular candidate was concerned.  He had been twenty years in the public service and performed his work satisfactorily and well.  Perhaps he never had sufficient influence to get out of the remote country district and receive the promotion <Col N="1367" /> his merit and abilities would entitle him to.  In view of the fact that the principle of the Local Appointments Act is to secure efficiency and ability of the best type, I suggest that there was no reason whatever why an appointment of that kind should not have been ratified in the ordinary way. It is evident that even in the minds of the officials in the Department who failed to accede to the appointment of the Board of Health in this case there was some doubt as to the wisdom or even the legality of the action they took in this matter, because their statement is that the most desirable way of filling this vacancy was by application in the ordinary way through the Local Appointments Commission.  You will notice, in the first instance, at any rate, that there was no definite refusal to sanction this appointment, and it was only in the reply of the Minister to the question addressed to him yesterday that he has definitely stated he was unable to accede to the request of the Board for sanction in this case.  I am anxious to know, and really that is the point of raising this matter, why sanction has not been forthcoming in this case.  There is nothing in the Local Appointments Act so far as I can read it to preclude any local authority in any particular county or any other portion of the State from appointing to a position like this any existing officer.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  An appointment of a person to fill an office to which this Act applies may, subject to the sanction of the Minister, be made by a local authority without requesting or obtaining a recommendation from the Commissioners under the subsequent provisions of this Act if, but only if, the appointment is made within three months after such office became vacant or (in the case of an appointment to a new office) was created and the person so appointed is a person who at the time when such office became vacant or was created (as the case may be) either:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) held a pensionable office under the said or any other local <Col N="1368" /> authority or any two or more local authorities the duties of which related to matters the same as or similar to the matters to which the duties of the vacant office relate.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Act are very clear and there is no answer even in law to be given for the extraordinary action of the Department of Local Government in this matter.  Here an appointment is made that is in accordance with the spirit, and so far as I can read it, the actual Terms of the Act of Parliament, and sanction has not been given to that appointment.  I regard that as a very important matter, and I suggest in view, of the fact that the powers of local authorities are very restricted in matters of this kind that there should be no further filching away of the powers and rights of local authorities in this connection. The Minister may claim that he is not satisfied that the local authority in one particular portion of a big county like Cork would be able to pick out of that county the best person for a position of this kind.  If that is so there is nothing to show and there is no right to assume that a local authority even from amongst its own employees would be able to appoint the proper person to fill a position of this kind, and the obvious thing for the Minister and the Department to say is that local authorities should have no rights in this matter, that each appointment of this kind should be made through the Appointments Commission.  It seems that is the claim the Department is making and the claim underlying the action they have taken in this matter.</P>
    <P>On some other occasion I hope the House will resist any claim of this kind.  I hope it will say the local authorities will and are entitled and should be allowed to give promotion to men who by their service and ability have shown themselves fit to merit it, it being the recognised principle in all services that ability, merit and services are qualifications for promotion.  I am particularly keen on this matter for more reasons than one, because as far as I can remember the particular section I am relying on was inserted in this Act at the request of the party I am associated with.  I would like to hear from the Minister a much more <Col N="1369" /> satisfactory explanation than was contained in the answer to the question addressed to him on this matter.  I hope it may be possible even yet to have an assurance that this particular case will be reviewed in the light of the facts I have stated.  Otherwise it seems to me colour will be given to the contention of a number of people in this country who have held that view, which I do not share up to the present at any rate in connection with the Local Appointments Act, that the sole aim and object of the Act have been to restrict the powers of local authorities and reduce their authority in matters of this kind to a shadow.  The proof that that is not so can be provided if we have an assurance that this matter will be looked into and that in future local authorities wishing to act in a bona fide fashion in connection with matters of this kind and utilising the powers vested in them by the Act itself will not be hampered in the discharge of their work in that direction.  If sanction is refused in this case the appointment will be made by the Local Appointments Commission.  A good many Deputies in this House have experience of the time it takes for the Local Appointments Commission to make such appointments.  I remember hearing questions addressed to the President here from time to time in connection with the extraordinary delay that took place in several counties in the Free State in connection with such appointments.  I know of cases in my county where local authorities are awaiting recommendations in connection with appointments of this kind for months.  Such a delay is not good for the taxpayer who has to pay a much heavier charge than the normal one for substitutes for the medical officers in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Neither is it good for the poor who are dependent for the treatment of themselves and their children, in case of illness, on the medical officers. There is one thing which makes a medical officer particularly interested in his work, that is the permanent nature of his office.  These prolonged delays in the making of appointments are unsatisfactory, for the reasons I have stated.  If the claim of the Board, to which I have referred to-night, had <Col N="1370" /> been admitted, no delay would have been caused in this case.  I suggest that the failure of the Department to agree to the principle contended for by the Board is, at least, a departure from the spirit of the Act.  It is a departure that should not receive sanction.  It is a departure that local authorities will be justified in resisting if and when they come up against a situation such as I have endeavoured to describe.  I should like to hear from the Minister a much more satisfactory explanation than we have had in this case up to the present.  I should like to know exactly on what grounds sanction is withheld to the appointment and how the attitude of the Department can be reconciled with the duty of the Department to do its work in the public interest and in the public interest alone.</P>

      <P>As a member of the South Cork Board of Health, which is concerned with this appointment, I desire to support the plea which Deputy Murphy has made.  Dr. Nyhan attended before our Board and put his case forward.  He had been in the medical service for nineteen years. That period he spent in an out-of-the-way district of West Cork.  Surely an official who has given efficient service for that length of time is entitled to promotion.  Dr. Nyhan had given satisfactory service during that period and was anxious to get in somewhere near the City of Cork, so that he might educate his family.  In the district in which he was, there were no opportunities for education.  I think the attitude of the Local Government Department in this particular case is very unfair.  The Board unanimously appointed Dr. Nyhan, and for the Department to interfere now is unfair. If an official cannot expect promotion after nineteen or twenty years' faithful service, I think it is very hard.  In this case, it is very unfair if Dr. Nyhan is to be kept in an out-of-the-way district after 19 or 20 years' service.</P>

      <P>Although I am not a Cork Deputy or a Cork man, I should like to intervene in this debate for a few moments.  If my interpretation of Deputy Murphy's motion is correct, it <Col N="1371" /> would seem that he has good grounds for believing that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has some idea of setting aside Section 5 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act.  That is the only section that provides for promotion.  I am not particularly jealous of the rights and privileges of local authorities, but I think one of the best sections of that Act was that providing for promotion&mdash;the section which gave a man who attended to his business a reasonable expectation that he would be rewarded by promotion.  In the present instance I believe promotion is justifiable.  I know the doctor mentioned. He is in a very backward district&mdash;one of the most backward in Ireland, if I may say so with due respect to Cork.  I think it will be admitted by everybody that a man who has given good service in a district like that should not be debarred from promotion.  If this appointment be referred to the Appointments Commissioners, they must make a new appointment. The Appointments Commissioners cannot deal with promotion.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister, if he is satisfied that a proper promotion has been made&mdash;that promotion has been given on the merits&mdash;to issue his sanction forthwith.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Murphy on this question.  As one associated for a long time with local authorities, as one who was interested in the passing of this Act dealing with local appointments, and as one connected with one of the few public bodies in the country that welcomed the Act, I have to say that, in my opinion, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has completely overreached himself in declaring that promotion of this kind cannot be made by local authorities. Section 5 of the Act reserves to local authorities the right to deal with appointments within three months, on certain clearly-defined conditions.  If those conditions are complied with, I do not see that the Minister can have any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers and privileges of local authorities have been considerably curtailed. Perhaps that is a very good <Col N="1372" /> job.  But, seeing that their powers have been curtailed, I think it is unwarranted that the privilege they retain&mdash;the privilege of promotion&mdash; should be stolen from them by the Minister.  I do not want to go into the question very deeply, because I have a similar motion down for next week.  I do not desire to say more now than that I support Deputy Murphy very strongly on behalf of the local authorities. Local authorities all over the country will feel that they have a genuine grievance if this matter is allowed to go unchallenged, and, if their right is not conceded, I feel sure there will be a fight.</P>

      <P>What I have got to say in this matter I should like to be taken in the nature of a request to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to reconsider his decision refusing sanction to this appointment.  I feel certain that he does not want to act in any way at variance with the carefully-considered opinions of the local authority.  I suggest, therefore, that the Minister should reconsider the only reason which he apparently has for refusing to sanction this appointment&mdash;that the doctor does not happen to be in the actual area of the South Cork Board. I would ask the House and the Minister to remember that the doctor is resident in an adjoining area.  Doctor Nyhan has proved himself, by the service he has rendered in the West Cork area, a most painstaking and efficient medical officer.  For that reason, it is the opinion of the people resident in South Cork, as well as the opinion of the members of the South Cork Board, that Dr. Nyhan should be appointed. They suggest that he should be appointed for that reason and for no other reason.  I am nearly certain that the Minister had not sufficient information before him when making this decision.  If he had full information before him, I feel absolutely certain that he would take no other course than that of sanctioning Dr. Nyhan's appointment.  He would do that, I am sure, if for no other reason than as a mark of appreciation of a medical officer who rendered good and faithful service to the poor under the West Cork County Board.</P>

They circularised the dispensary doctors in their own area, pointing out that this vacancy existed and that the Board were prepared to fill it by promotion&mdash;that they would proceed to fill the vacancy by promotion at their next meeting.

      <P>At the meeting at which the applications were to be considered there was no application from the dispensary doctors in the <Col N="1374" /> South Cork area, but to that meeting there blew in an application from a doctor in an area entirely outside the jurisdiction of the South Cork Board of Health, and we are being told that by preventing the South Cork Board of Health from appointing a person whose application blew in like that, we are preventing them from appointing the best person in County Cork and preventing promotion where it is due.  I submit that that is quite absurd.  The position is that, subject to the sanction of the Minister, a particular body can make promotion inside its own jurisdiction.  Subject to the sanction of the Minister, according to the Act, it can make promotion from inside.  The Act recognises that public bodies have not technical machinery for discriminating between the comparative merits of persons who are professional people or who are technical people, and it sets up the Local Appointments Commission to help local bodies to have technical and professional people properly selected.  Clause 5 gives power of promotion, subject to the sanction of the Minister, and Deputy Murphy has asked me whether the Ministry of Local Government is prepared to work this Act in the public interest, and in the public interest alone.  I say &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; and I wish we could get local bodies to do the same, but, if public interest is to be served, local bodies must be given the best qualified people they can get.  An assurance must be given that the procedure to be adopted under the Act will be such as to give merit its proper place where merit exists.  If we fail, on the one hand, to give local bodies the best assistance we can, and if we fail, on the other hand, to recognise the merits of professional people, we fail to give the benefits of the Act to the best interests of the public.  Let us assume that the South Cork Board of Assistance desire to go outside their own area and select a man from among dispensary medical officers outside that area.</P>

      <P>I have read every section in the Act, and I am trying to explain my interpretation, and <Col N="1375" /> that of my Department, so as to serve the best interests of the public.  I ask Deputy Dr. Hennessy if the South Cork Board of Public Assistance want to go outside their own area and, in the spirit of the Act, find a man outside and bring him in as a dispensary doctor, what ought their procedure be?  Ought they let it be known by advertisement, or otherwise, that that position was there?  Ought they give every doctor in the North Cork area, or in County Waterford, who may desire to transfer to the Carrigaline district an opportunity of sending in an application?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did they not do so?  My attitude and that of my Department is that if the South Cork County Board of Assistance want to go outside their area in order to effect a promotion the proper steps must be taken, even if we are only to consider the position of dispensary medical officers themselves.  If those in the general service or the service in County Cork are to get fair play in the matter I suggest even to those Deputies who think that the rights of public bodies are being taken from them, that, having not received an application from a doctor within the area, if the South Cork Board want to go outside it they ought to come to the Minister and say that they want to do so.  According to the Act, they are supposed to do that, if they want to go outside.  I say that the County Board of Health, as they stand, are not competent to judge between the merits of different candidates outside and of whom they have had no personal experience.  If they want to go outside and restrict the area of application to County Cork, I think the Local Appointments Commission ought to be asked to make a selection, even as between dispensary medical officers in Cork.  I say in this particular case the local body whose rights and magnificent intentions have been spoken about here are not discharging their common duties and they are certainly not endeavouring to carry out this Act in the spirit or letter of it when going outside their own district to make an appointment they take an application that simply <Col N="1376" /> blows in without any other doctor in West Cork, where no doubt there are many out of the way places, being given the opportunity of applying for the position, or without any other doctor in North Cork being given the opportunity. On the merits of the case we are discussing it would be impossible for the Department of Local Government to hope they would stand in any kind of reasonable light either as regards the medical profession or public bodies as a whole if they allowed appointments to be made in this haphazard way.</P>

      <P>I made the important point in raising this matter that in connection with two or three similar vacancies which arose in the same Board of Health area previously no application was received from an existing officer in the area, and that the Board of Health believed they had a perfect right to make this appointment in the way they did.  It was well-known locally there was no applicant for the position in the Board of Health area.  The Minister in his reply blamed the Board of Health because they had not notified the Department of their intentions to promote a doctor from some other part of the county of Cork, and practically in the same breath he said that if such intention was notified to the Department his view would be that the Board of Health would not be the proper body to make that appointment but the Local Appointments Commissioners.  I see no reason to change the view I expressed when in opening this discussion I characterised the Minister's answer as entirely satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I find that at the time of her brother's death Mrs. Murphy was in receipt of the full rate of dependents' allowance in respect of her husband, who was then a member of the Forces.  This rate of allowance was payable only in cases of total dependency, consequently Mrs. Murphy's claim in respect of her brother could not be entertained, as no award can be made under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 and 1927, except in cases of total or partial dependency.</P>
