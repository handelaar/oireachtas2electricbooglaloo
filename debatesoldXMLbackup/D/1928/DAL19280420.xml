    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some remarks with reference to the reports concerning yesterday's discussion in the Dáil which appear in the issues of both the Dublin daily papers this morning. These papers, by the courtesy of the Dáil, are entitled to have their representatives here for the purpose of getting speedy reports of the business done, but when inaccurate and altogether misleading reports appear it is necessary, I think, that attention should be drawn to the fact.  The House will recollect that on the Railway Vote yesterday I moved to reduce the amount by the sum of £27,360.  Both papers state that the Vote which I was moving to reduce was for £25,636.  The Vote was, in fact, for £52,136.  There is no such figure mentioned throughout the Estimate as £25,636.  It is a pure concoction which is originated in the imagination of the reporters present, and nowhere else.  The difficulty that arose was due to the fact that a Vote on Account had been passed by the House amounting to one-third of the total Estimate in each case.  The proposal, therefore, to reduce the entire Vote by the entire amount of a single Sub-head was considered to be irregular, and it was necessary to reduce the amount mentioned in the amendment. It was a difficulty which might easily arise, and when it did arise and was detected, it was very easily remedied.  I do not wish to say anything else in the matter.  We hope we will get a fair report of the proceedings here in the Press, and that there will be, at least, nothing in the nature of flights of imagination such as we have had on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference which I made during the debate on that Estimate to the colliery railway lines was also misrepresented and reported in a manner which gave an entirely wrong impression of what I did say.  I presume that was due to the fact that the discussion was not understood by the Press representatives <Col N="252" /> present.  In the other case, however, that interpretation cannot possibly be placed on their action.  They have concocted a figure for which there was no justification whatever.</P>

      <P>I am not interested in the dispute between Deputy Lemass and the newspapers, but in the interests of accuracy the motion moved yesterday&mdash;Vote No. 57 &mdash;was that a sum not exceeding £25,636 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929.</P>

      <P>The situation is quite simple.  The error which occurred yesterday on an amendment of which there was only short notice was one that it was quite easy to fall into.  The Book of Estimates gives the total amount of the Vote.  The entire Vote for the total amount, is £52,136.  A Vote on Account was taken for one-third of the total Estimates and for varying amounts of the particular Votes.  When a motion is moved on the Estimate, it is for the sum mentioned in the Book of Estimates, minus the sum already taken on account.  In this case the sum asked for was £25,636.  That sum of course was not mentioned until the Committee on Finance had actually a motion before it.  The amendment on the Paper was an amendment to reduce the Vote by the whole amount of one sub-head.  There are plenty of cases in which that would appear as being greater than the amount actually asked for in the motion.  The error, as I say, is one that it is quite easy to make and was not of an overwhelming or extravagant nature.  When it was seen, it <Col N="253" /> was solved in a simple way, with the co-operation of Deputy Lemass and the Chair.  There is hardly any ground for its being magnified.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,065 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for the Salaries and other Expenses of the Railway Tribunal constituted under the Railways Act, 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The moneys that are requested under this Estimate are requisite under the terms of the Railways Act, 1924.  The details are set out in the two Sub-heads, A and B.  It simply refers to the salaries paid to the Chairman, to the two ordinary members of the Tribunal and to the small staff that is referred to in the Estimate.  In addition, there are certain small travelling and incidental expenses.  With regard to travelling expenses, as far as I am aware no sum has yet been paid in any year since the Tribunal was set up on foot of travelling expenses, because the members had not to go away from their headquarters, and we are lessening the amount of the Vote by £10 this year.  The Telegraphs and Telephones item is based on the best Estimate that the Post Office could make of the requirements of the Tribunal. Advertising has dropped.  That item refers to the publication of certain <Col N="255" /> notices as regards sittings, which the Tribunal is bound to publish, and as the business of the Tribunal has been to a certain extent concluded, we expect that fewer notices will be published in the Press for the future.  Consequently, we have reduced the Vote to half.  The same applies to reporting; it is not expected that the same amount of reporting will be done in future.</P>
      <P>In connection with this Estimate, I would draw the attention of Deputies to the matter detailed on page 236 of the Book of Estimates, in which it is stated that:&mdash;&ldquo;The receipts in connection with the Service are estimated as follows&mdash;Extra Receipts&mdash;Payment by the Amalgamated Company under Section 15 (4) of the Railways Act, 1924,&rdquo; and then the sum is set out.  What happens is that one takes the total expenditure on the Estimate of the Railway Tribunal during the year and deducts from the total the amount that comes in by way of fees and stamps. The remainder is then divided between the State and the Great Southern Railways Company.  There is a sum of £20 or £30 not actually halved in these estimated receipts at the end of the year.  That matter is made perfectly correct.  If the amount is estimated by way of fees and stamps is greater than the amount shown there, there is a less sum to be taken from the Great Southern Railways.  When there happens to be a less amount the railways company pays a little more.  The expenses are halved between the railways company and the Tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say why these receipts are not shown in the Appropriations-in-Aid?  Then there are two separate items for fees and fee stamps.  Are all the fees paid in the form of stamps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not always. There is a distinction between them. As to these matters being shown as Appropriations-in-Aid, a definite policy was adopted recently, and I think that came before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Any change that is made has to go before the Committee of Public Accounts, and I assume that this did go.  Matters of that sort up to <Col N="256" /> about two years ago were shown as Appropriations-in-Aid.  For the future they will all fall in as general Exchequer receipts, but each Vote will show the amount of the general Exchequer receipts which would really in the old days have been marked out as Appropriations-in-Aid. But the money goes into the general receipts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state why the Report of the Tribunal for last year has not yet been published? I think in previous years the Report was out in February or early in March, and so far as I know no report is at hand yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to make inquiries about that.  It would depend on the circumstances.  If the Deputy would ask me by way of a question, I will get the information, or I will take his request now to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is because this is so new to us&mdash;or there may be some other reason&mdash;but it appears to us that the Minister is altogether too illiberal in his information in connection with these Votes.  We think that it would not be unreasonable to expect that the work of the Tribunal since it was established should be reviewed, and that the Minister should state whether or not he is satisfied that it is really fulfilling a useful function.  Most traders who are watching for changes in railway charges, watching for some improvement with regard to railway conditions, are not satisfied that there is any reality about the work of this Tribunal, and have given up hope of any reform, certainly of any useful reform, in railway work.  Since the Tribunal was established, as far as I know, the only definite thing it has really done has been to complete the amalgamation and the absorption of the lines. It is now four years since it was established, and it is still preparing to face the principal work for which it was appointed, that is, to fix standard charges.  Four years after the Act was passed implementation is still in progress; in fact it is not yet well begun. How many generations are to pass before the Act is fully implemented? Is the Minister satisfied that even when <Col N="257" /> it has completed fixing approved standard charges, these charges are going to be useful where they can be applied? He must be aware that in England, which has had standard charges in existence since the beginning of the year, there is a rush of applications to the Tribunal to lower the standard charges below the minimum which the Tribunal has fixed, and this is necessitated by the competition of road transport.  If the same thing is going to prevail here, does it not look as if all this work of the Railway Tribunal is so much waste of time?  It must be remembered that it is not merely the Railway Tribunal that is engaged in this work; it is a big portion of the Minister's transport staff also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister might have told us how much of the time of his own transport staff is engaged in helping the Tribunal.  I personally look upon this Vote as being not a correct Vote at all, because from my knowledge of what is going on the Director of Transport in the Minister's Department is mainly occupied in preparing information for the Tribunal.  Several other members of the staff are also engaged in the same work.  It does not seem to me altogether correct to put down the amount here as the expenses of the Tribunal when, at the same time, you have another Department engaged in working for the Tribunal.  That does not seem to me to be a correct way of representing the cost of the Tribunal. Then you have a state of things prevailing whereby a semi-Government Department, namely, the Creamery Board, has had to notify the Great Southern Railways that, unless they give a reasonable rate for the conveyance of butter, they will be obliged to convey the whole of their traffic by road.  Is the Minister satisfied that the Railway Rates Tribunal is the best way of dealing with the railway problem, and that it is going to bring about such a change as is required at the present time in the commercial interests of the country?  When they have the standard charges fixed, I understand they will then have to examine the question of through rates, and on that perhaps the Minister will give us some information as to what the position is.  To anyone who has <Col N="258" /> any inside knowledge it would look as if there would be a very difficult problem there, because on the Great Northern line and on the British railways the classification is totally different to what has been agreed on in the case of the Great Southern Railways.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister when the Tribunal will be in a position to deal with the claims of the different ports.  We all know that under the system that has prevailed up to the present the western ports have not got their fair share of traffic.  I would like to know if the adjustment of that is to wait indefinitely, or has the Minister made any calculation as to the time when it can be attended to.  There is the further question as to what use is to be made of the light railways that have been amalgamated with the Great Southern Railways.  Will the Tribunal be in a position at an early date to give their attention to that problem, to see whether the Great Southern Railways are making the best possible use of these light railways, whether these are to continue to be a source of high rates to traffic on the main lines or whether they cannot be worked more economically than by the system which prevails at present?  Under Section 30, subsection (2) of the Act, it would appear that the Tribunal has the power to see that each port gets its reasonable share of traffic from the railways.  That is not the case at present, and I would like to know whether any adjustment is likely to be made, and whether any action will be taken by the Tribunal at any time in the near future on that question.</P>
    <P>Even when the Tribunal has completed its work and fully implemented the Act of 1924, there will be still the position that the Great Northern, the Sligo and Leitrim. and the Londonderry and Lough Swilly systems as well as the little railway which we discussed yesterday, the Dublin and Blessington line, will still all be outside the control of the Tribunal.  Therefore, it seems to me that it does not look as if the traffic problem of the Free State is at all near solution.</P>
    <P>It is time, I think, that the Minister made some pronouncement as to whether he considers that the working <Col N="259" /> of the Tribunal is fully justifying its cost.  It is not a question merely of the cost of the Tribunal itself, but of the services which are being given to it by the Minister's Transport Department. There is also the question of the very serious cost that it is entailing upon the traders of the country who are interested in this matter.  I know that it has been a matter of very serious cost to numbers of people who have been attending the Tribunal. They had been giving it their attention ever since it began to function, and the employment of counsel and the attendance of witnesses at each sitting of the Tribunal is a factor in the working costs of many big concerns in the country at the present time.  I hope the Minister will give us as much information as he can on this Estimate.  I do not think it is quite fair that we should be asked to vote money for services without having some picture as to what way these Departments are functioning, and as to what their hopes are for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that part of the duty of the Railway Tribunal will be to take into consideration the question of the transportation of livestock and the freights charged on same, as well as the necessity for providing a more humane system of transportation. There is no doubt but that we are completely out of date as regards the transportation of live stock, both from the economic and humane points of view. Take, for example, the transportation of sheep.</P>

      <P>We are to have, I understand, a general debate on transport problems on the Vote for the Department of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I think we could easily arrange that the question of transport, so far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible for it, should be taken separately. It is on that, I think, that Deputy O'Reilly's point would arise.</P>

The Railway Tribunal is a more restricted question than that.</P>

      <P>I think members on these Benches are quite right in calling attention to the fact that the Railway Tribunal has been spending public money for four years, and has given no return for it.  I wish to call attention to the practice that is going on of diverting traffic through ports in the Six Counties and away from the ports at Greenore, Dundalk, Drogheda and Sligo.  Before we agree to vote any moneys for the Railway Tribunal, I think we should have some assurance from the Minister that the Tribunal will give serious and immediate attention to this practice, which has been going on for a long time.  During the last few years, you have this situation: that traffic which used to go through Greenore, Dundalk and Drogheda and, I believe, also through Sligo, is now going through Belfast and Derry.  If you take the trade returns between the Six Counties and the Twenty-Six Counties, you will find&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think if the Minister suggested to the Railway Tribunal that it should so fix rates that it would favour the using of the ports of Greenore, Dundalk, Drogheda and Sligo instead of using the ports of Belfast and Derry, the Tribunal might be doing something for the money it is spending at present and has been spending for the past four years.  The Tribunal has done no good, and immense harm is accruing because of the fact that it is not doing the work which it should be doing, and to do which, if it was not there, some other body might be set up.  If the Minister cannot see his way to get what I am suggesting done through the Railway Tribunal, then he should set up some other body to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to say anything on this particular Vote, but there is a point which I would like to see considered.  We have been told that the general transport policy of the Government can be discussed on the main Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  On that Vote, no doubt, there will be many other big questions to be discussed, such as the industrial policy of the Government and the action it has taken in the matter of unemployment.  A very long and probably involved discussion may take place.  We will be discussing the general policy of the Government after we have discussed and decided whether or not we will vote money in connection with the particular machine the Government has set up in order to implement its policy.  It appears to me that it would be more convenient for the Dáil and a better system if the general question of policy were discussed on the main Vote before the minor votes of the Department were taken.  This discussion on the functions of the Railway Tribunal might be usefully deferred until the whole transport policy of the Government had been considered. I wish the Minister would give us his views upon that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish this question had been asked by Deputy Lemass some time ago, and we might have been spared all this wild matter talked about the Railway Tribunal.  The Railway <Col N="262" /> Tribunal was set up to discharge certain statutory duties conferred upon it by Act of Parliament, and is paid to perform these duties.  The only question that arises is as regards the salaries and travelling and office expenses. If people object that the Act is not working then there could be a Bill brought in to repeal or amend the Act so as to enable the Tribunal to do that which it has not now before it. The criticisms against the Tribunal result from a misunderstanding as to its position.  Deputy Davin put it properly when he said these arguments might be better put up before the Railway Tribunal.  The traders have not done their duty before the Tribunal. They have ceased to function as a unit before the Tribunal.  The Tribunal has certain judicial functions to discharge, and I believe it is discharging them quite well.  We are asking for money to pay the expenses of the office, salaries and travelling expenses.</P>

      <P>That is a matter that can be discussed on the main Vote. That will arise on the question as to <Col N="263" /> what interest my Department has in it other than what the Railway Tribunal has thrown upon it as its duties by an Act of this House.  I could segregate and refuse to discuss on my Vote any duties put on the Tribunal.  That Tribunal, by an Act of this House, has certain functions to discharge, and it has to be paid for discharging those duties.  In so far as it is carrying out functions which this or a previous Dáil gave it, I am not responsible as to whether these functions should be with the Railway Tribunal or be again with my Department.  There has been a segregation of duties.  We are only discussing the Tribunal, its statutory functions and the fact that it has to be paid.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will admit we are entitled to know how far the Tribunal is carrying out its functions, what progress it has made, and when it is likely to have completely implemented the Act of 1924.  Is it not reasonable to ask for information on these points?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that it is not reasonable.  There has been talk as to what good the Tribunal is doing.  In so far as it should do certain good by carrying out functions laid on it by an Act of this House it ought to be doing that.  Outside that the Tribunal has no functions.  For instance, Deputy Moore went on to criticise on the Vote for the Tribunal as to whether certain people are being properly paid to do certain duties imposed by an Act of this Dáil.  Deputy Moore raised the question that when the Tribunal has done its work certain railways will still be outside the amalgamated concern.  That has nothing to do with the Tribunal.  It cannot bring them inside the amalgamated concern, and a majority of the previous Dáil said that they should not be brought in.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good has a clear realisation of what the Tribunal has to do, which other people have not.  The Tribunal has to classify various classes of merchandise, determine the standard revenue, fix the standard charges, hear individual applications re railway matters.  These are the main functions of the Tribunal. The first two are general.  There has been a classification established and a standard revenue has been determined. Number 3 is proceeding&mdash;the question of the fixing of standard charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good apparently wants to raise the question whether or not the standard charges have been properly fixed.  He has some complaints, apparently, about standard charges.  Deputy Good, I think, agrees with me that the Tribunal is tied pretty definitely hand and foot with regard to standard charges, because there has to be a determination of revenue, and from that the charges come.</P>

      <P>The Deputy repeats that.  As I say, the third duty is proceeding.  Deputy Moore's complaint amounts to this, that the <Col N="265" /> Tribunal has done no good under any of the first three heads.  I do not know what the Deputy's complaint amounts to, whether it is that the Tribunal has not been given sufficient duties or freedom, or has not been exercising its present duty, or gone within the limits of its present freedom.  He tells us, however, that it has done no good. That is not a criticism against the Railway Tribunal if they have carried out their duties, and I think they have.  I am not sure that we can discuss in this House a body that is pretty definitely a judicial body, or how they have carried out their duty.</P>

They had four main duties; they have carried out two, and we are proceeding to the third, and as far as the fourth is concerned&mdash;the grouping together of a certain amount of possible activity by the Railway Tribunal on applications made&mdash;if they have not done any work under that head it is because there are very few applications.  They have not the help the House thought they would have got when the previous legislation was under discussion, because the traders have not been actively looking after their own interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made a statement and Deputy Moore, I think, has justified it, to a certain extent. With that I am quite content.  Another definite point raised was the question of the diversion of traffic to various ports.  The Tribunal has a function there which is rather a limited one. Section 30 (2) states:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act the amalgamated company shall not by the rates or fares charged, whether through or local, or by the facilities provided or the accommodation afforded by it, or otherwise, place any one port in Saorstát Eireann at an undue disadvantage as compared with any other port in Saorstát Eireann to, from, or through which traffic is or may be carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function is limited definitely to that.  There has been no application on behalf of any port that by the rates or fares charged or by the facilities provided or the accommodation afforded any one port of the Saorstát <Col N="268" /> has been unduly prejudiced as opposed to any other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>When any question of port preference arises it will arise on an application made by the port which is prejudiced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly the Ministry, but eventually it will be referred to the Railway Tribunal if it was a matter of preference being given by reason of rates or fares charged, facilities provided or otherwise, due to action caused by the Amalgamated Company.  That is the function of the Tribunal in that regard.  Deputy Aiken was talking of ports outside the Free State and, in so far as it is possible, the Tribunal might take a wider view of its duties than what I have read out.  I may say if the Amalgamated Company by reason of charging very high fares was diverting the traffic outside the harbours of this country, the Tribunal would probably communicate with the Amalgamated Company on that matter, but the Railway Tribunal's functions are very definitely limited by an Act passed here.  They have certain duties and I think they are carrying them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as delay is concerned, there is possibly more delay than was anticipated when the Act was under discussion here.  In the main, that delay is due&mdash;and I do not think it is a criticism of the Railway Company&mdash;to the fact that the Railway Company found it hard to get material in a presentable form for the Railway Tribunal.  There was amalgamation and absorption and a big scheme had to be carried through.  The Railway Company had to furnish statements of its traffic revenue.  These statements were taken on a basic year and the receipts and expenditure for that year had to <Col N="269" /> be brought up to what would be regarded as normal in present conditions. That meant an immense amount of work on the part of the officials at Kingsbridge, and it has lasted longer than was thought.  There has been more delay perhaps than was anticipated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly think that the point raised by Deputy Aiken is a very serious and important point and that a responsibility certainly does rest on the Tribunal, and on the Ministry possibly more than on the Tribunal.  To what extent Deputy Aiken's complaint is justified is a matter for the Ministry to ascertain.  I have been informed that since the amalgamation came into operation there has been a considerable increase in the amount of traffic going from the Western areas to Northern ports.  I have been informed that that traffic is greater than the traffic before the amalgamation came into operation. How does that come about?  It comes about because through rates are being lowered so as to give, by these lower rates, an inducement to the trader to send his goods to the Northern ports rather than through Dublin, Greenore or Dundalk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy practically put the case that way.  In any event, he contended <Col N="270" /> that the onus is upon the Minister's Department to bring it before the Tribunal. If that is so, the matter would arise upon the Vote for the Minister's salary rather than on this Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility is disclosed in the section which the Minister read out to the House.  I think it is the duty of the officials of the Railway Tribunal to make inquiries and to find out how far these preferential through-rates operate against the ports of the Saorstát now as compared with the period before the amalgamation came into operation.  Deputy Aiken may have been nursing the County Louth when he referred to Dundalk and Greenore.  But there is responsibility on the Tribunal, and I want to know if the officials of the Tribunal have tried to find out how far the case made by Deputy Aiken is correct or whether it is not correct.  I am informed that substantially it is correct.  If the Great Southern Railways are a party to the lowering of through rates from the western parts of Ireland which now give a preference to northern ports as against ports in this State, I say that is a serious matter which the Tribunal should investigate. They should investigate it as fast as they can.  It is a fact that there has been a reduction in the traffic passing through the ports of Greenore, Dundalk and Dublin&mdash;that is to say, traffic from the western areas of Ireland.  The duty rests upon the Railway Tribunal to find out how far that is so, and the duty rests upon them also to say how far they can rectify these complaints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I say if any organised body of traders appearing on their own responsibility fail to bring that matter before the Railways Tribunal, it is the <Col N="271" /> responsibility of the Ministry to do so. We have heard some views expressed as to whether or not the traders were represented before the Railway Tribunal. I do not know what traders' associations we have in this country, whom these associations cater for, or who is actually involved in their membership. The Free State Traders' Association is named as the body represented before the Railway Tribunal in connection with standard charges and revenue.  I am not satisfied that the Free State Traders' Association represents the best brains of the business men of this country.  If they do, God help the business men of this country.  It is no wonder that the business men are complaining about high charges when they do not appoint business men with brains to put the case before the Tribunal.  I do not say that the Chamber of Commerce was represented there because I would be surprised if the Chamber of Commerce allowed themselves to be misrepresented by what is known as the Free State Traders' Association.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Reilly referred to high charges for the carrying of live stock. There is an association to deal with that matter.  There is the Cattle Traders' Association and several associations that cater for the trade in live stock.  I believe they made their case before the Railway Tribunal or made an attempt to make it.  That is a matter for the traders themselves.  But the other question raised by Deputy Aiken is a question where the ports are concerned, and that is a more important matter for this House.  With regard to this question raised by Deputy O'Reilly, that is a matter for the Cattle Traders' Association.  You have some of the leaders of that body here in the House and, so far as I know, they have not made any complaints up to this.  They may do so before the debate ends.  I am anxious to know if we may have from Deputy Good a statement as to whether the Free State Traders' Association who made the case on behalf of the business men of this country before the Tribunal represents the intelligent or intellectual element known as the Chamber of Commerce in the Free State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is more in touch with railway matters than any other Deputy in this House, and he should know that at each meeting of the Tribunal the traders were represented. They had at each of these meetings a representative of the Traders' Association.  But the difficulty that the traders have been in all through in connection with that association is that the original Bill set out that the standard revenue must be maintained.  That is in the Act now. It is obvious to anybody, and I am sure it is obvious to Deputy Davin, that the revenue of the railways has been falling by reason of the competition by buses for their traffic.  The problem is a falling revenue, or at least, a falling trade, and how, under those conditions, you are to maintain the standard revenue.  If you reduce your charges to meet increased competition your revenue naturally falls.  What are the traders to do?  If they put up a proposition that certain trade is going in a certain direction, and that the rates should be lowered in order to encourage it to go in another direction, then you are met with the same problem, the standard revenue.  I do not know how this Act is eventually going to work out; I was very doubtful as to its wisdom when it was going through this House, and I did not hesitate to let the. House know that fact.  The farther the problem goes the greater the difficulty I see.  I do not know how this question of the standard revenue will be maintained in the future.  I have very great difficulty about it.  The Minister talks about traders not having done their duty.  I question that, because the traders have appeared before <Col N="273" /> the Tribunal.  They have been represented, as I said, before every meeting of the Tribunal as far as I know.  I have seen the reports of the meetings of the Tribunal, and I have seen that the traders have been represented there.  As I say, what can they do?  If you were there yourselves, if even the cream of the intelligence of this House. Deputy Davin, was sent to the Railway Tribunal to put forward the traders' case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>How could he put forward a case that would maintain a standard revenue with falling income?  If he could do that he could do something which the ordinary trader could not do, and which I certainly could not do. So far as I see, the Tribunal can only deal with matters that are put before them.  They can express an opinion on these different proposals, but I do not think, of their own initiative, that they can bring forward proposals for consideration. At least, I do not understand that to be the function of the Tribunal, but if it is so, I am not aware of it.  Complaints have been made that traffic has gone over to the railway companies functioning in the Six Counties. It is common knowledge that the rates on railways in the Six Counties are lower than those in the Free State. They are lower by a very considerable percentage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows more about the difference than I do, and he knows more about the causes of that difference.  He knows more about the expenses in connection with railways than I do, and there is no use in putting a question of that kind to me.  He cannot blame traders if they send their goods over the cheapest route.  That is what is happening at the moment. Goods are undoubtedly going from the West over the northern railways and through the northern ports because that is the cheaper method.  If you want to get that traffic diverted through southern ports and over southern railways you will have to get some means of lowering the rates, and if you lower the rates you will have to <Col N="274" /> get some means of meeting the clause in regard to standard revenue.  These are the real problems.  As I said to the Minister, we might as well face facts in connection with this question.  These are the difficulties we are up against. There is no use criticising the Railway Tribunal because it is tied hand and foot, as the Minister has said.  If a proposal is put forward by the traders on one hand to reduce rates, the Tribunal want, on the other hand, to see how the standard revenue is to be maintained. So long as these factors are there, one operating against the other, and if the traders appear before the Tribunal, I do not see that much can be done under the conditions prevailing at the moment.</P>

      <P>I do not often agree with Deputy Good, and I do not doubt that his conscience will trouble him somewhat when he finds that I do now. His position, broadly, is that the traders, the railways, and the country, so far as the railway position is concerned, are between the devil and the deep sea.  Apparently, a rather inept amalgamation scheme in connection with the railways was put through without considering the larger possibilities and development which lay in the co-ordination of road and rail traffic.  As a result, the country is in the position of trying to maintain two separate competing means of traffic, which in density has never been sufficient to maintain on a national and profitable basis one system.  The density of traffic on the Irish railways at the very best of times, when the Great Southern and Western Railway Company's shares were at 104, was never more than practically negligible compared with other matters.  They succeeded in paying those rates and in keeping up those dividends because they were in a position to get monopoly rates for traffic. The Irish goods rates were the highest in the whole world.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good in the course of his remarks stated that the rates in operation between ports in the Six Counties and England are lower than those between Free State ports and those across channel.  He did not inform the House that the same classification as regards merchandise traffic is in operation in the Six Counties as in the Saorstát.  Neither did he inform the House that one reason that traffic is diverted to ports in the Six Counties is the fact that the steamships plying between Ireland and England are controlled by cross-channel combines which very often give preferential through rates, as between Ireland and England, to ports in the Six Counties to the detriment of the Free State ports.  There is one thing which the Railway Tribunal should consider without application from traders or other associations, and that is the question of the simplification of the classes of merchandise traffic.  I am not going to go into detail as to how many various classes of traffic there are.  To some railway people, in addition to many <Col N="276" /> traders, that classification is a regular cross-word puzzle and, so far as the Tribunal is concerned, it should go into the question of the classification of merchandise traffic with a view to simplifying it.  That would be to the benefit both of the traders and the railways. The Tribunal should also take into consideration the possibility of a bigger grip being put on the means of communication between the ports in this country and England.  Yesterday I referred to the fact that there was a possibility of one railway, the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway, which is outside the amalgamation scheme, being taken over by the London, Midland and Scottish Company. This is an attempt on the part of that company to try and capture another means of communication between this country and England, and to manipulate the rates so that they will be in the interests of the Six Counties and to the detriment of the Saorstát.  That matter, as I say, should also be considered by the Tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to stress upon the Minister the impossibility of having these matters adequately discussed until the main Vote of the Ministry comes before us.  The question of preferential rates given by foreign shipping companies in order to attract traffic to the Six Counties can hardly be discussed on a Vote of this kind.  The whole question of transport policy should be discussed before these separate Votes come before us.  Deputy Good put a proposition to the House. He said that a standard revenue for the Railway Company has to be maintained and to enable that standard to be maintained the Tribunal can fix a certain standard schedule of rates which will give the company standard revenue with the important qualification that the company must have economic and efficient management. How that standard revenue is to be given to the company while, at the same time, the wishes of the traders as regards rates are to be met is the problem.  You, sir, ruled that Deputy Good is in order to put that problem before the House, but, apparently, it is <Col N="277" /> out of order to suggest a solution and that solution will have to be put forward on the main Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather a different thing.  Deputy Good was on the question of the Tribunal.  I did not rule exactly that Deputy Good could state the problem. I agree with Deputy Lemass that the question of the solution of that problem would carry us a far greater distance beyond the Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Entirely.  What does it matter?  Let us say that the administration of my Department with regard to the problem of transport is riddled from top to bottom.  Let it be proved that it is entirely negligent and careless about all matters of transport. Is that any reason why the Dáil should refuse to pay the salaries of the chairman, the two ordinary members and the officers of the Railway Tribunal? They are actually established.  They cannot be put out of office until amending legislation to the Railways Act of 1924 is brought in.  What they are doing has nothing whatever to do with the policy of my Department in matters of transport.  The members of the Tribunal must carry out their duties until the Act is amended and they must be paid the salaries which are fixed.  This Vote has nothing to do with the salaries of officers of the Transport Branch.  The only thing that can arise is how far the members of the Tribunal are carrying out their duties.  Surely we are not going to say that they are so negligent that we must refuse to pay them their salaries for <Col N="278" /> the next couple of months.  If, of course, legislation were introduced in three or four months' time and the Tribunal were disbanded these expenses would not have to be met and the moneys would not be needed.  The Deputy does not commit himself to any approval of anything done in the way of transport by my Department by passing this Vote.  That is entirely a separate matter.</P>

For example, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce made representations to the Tribunal. I understand that they are putting the case of the Tribunal that not by increasing, but by decreasing, rates they will increase the standard revenue. The action of the Ministry in that respect might be a basis for discussion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we should not be influenced by anything that might be likely to arise from refusing to pass this Vote. and I suggest that Deputy Lemass's proposal should receive thorough consideration from the Minister.  The position seems to me to be that the work the Railway Tribunal is engaged on at present is that of reviewing the proposed standard charges. That work may be useless or it may not. There are many people who have been watching that Tribunal very closely who think it is absolutely useless. These are people who have been watching <Col N="279" /> its operations and who have a very great interest in railway problems. They think that until the question of road versus rail is considered, and until there is some co-ordination between these two branches of transport, it is useless to be considering standard charges, and that there can be no such thing as standard charges, as they are fluctuating so much.  I may say that that is borne out by a report that I have got from England, that although the standard charges are in operation there since the 1st January, the Tribunal has been taken up with applications to modify these standard charges. If we take this Vote seriously, I suggest that we should not vote to continue the work of the Railway Tribunal without having a statement from the Minister as to what his transport policy is, and if he is going to make any arrangement in regard to the work of the Tribunal.  It may arrive at marvellously accurate conclusions this year on a certain basis, but that basis is liable to change.  It is changing at the moment.  We do not know what the state of traffic will be on roads next year.  That is because we have no pronouncement of policy from the Minister, and we think, therefore, that the Vote should be postponed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>I again put it to Deputies that Deputy Moore's plea is a refusal to pay moneys to the members of the Railway Tribunal because they are not going to consider something which they could not possibly consider.  If it were brought before them they should have to refuse to consider it.  If a case can be made that there has been a mishandling of the whole transport problem, I should be criticised for it, and not the members of the Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my statement was that they are considering things, the consideration of which will afterwards be found to be a waste of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is a waste of time or not, they are doing all this work with the authority of the Legislature.  All this means is that they should carry on in the way that the Legislature decided that they should <Col N="280" /> carry on.  I may say that there is going to be no burking of criticism of the transport system.  That will arise on the Vote for my Department.  I put it to Deputies that it is a grave injustice to be criticising members of the Tribunal for doing something that they are not bound to do and that in fact they are precluded from doing. All this criticism will range about the transport section of my Department, except on two points, namely, what are the functions of the Tribunal and how far they carry out their duties.  On the question of the appointed day, the appointed day cannot be determined until the standard charges are fixed. I cannot say when the standard charges will be fixed.  Even though my Department were ready to do that, I cannot say whether other interested parties are prepared to do so.  I think that the Tribunal appeared to be prepared to discuss it recently.  In so far as the Tribunal is ready to hear the standard charges discussed, the Tribunal is making all speed towards the fixing of the appointed day.  On the question of ports, Deputy Davin says it is an important matter.  It is, of course, an important matter to see that a port outside this country does not get undue preference in relation to a port in this country.  Has that been done?  If a complaint had been made that such a situation had developed I think that is a case that could be made against my own Department again, because the Railway Tribunal has only power to come down upon the amalgamated company if it is shown that the amalgamated company, by reason of rates, facilities, accommodation, etc., is unduly preferring one port to another, although I would not insist definitely that that must be raised by the prejudiced port.  In other words, if the Railway Tribunal got a clear case before it, it is precluded by the terms of the Act from raising that.  I do not think that is the case.  I think the natural course is that the port which finds itself prejudiced is going to be very clamant before the Railway Tribunal with regard to what the amalgamated company is doing.  Remember, it is only when the amalgamated company comes into the matter that the <Col N="281" /> Railway Tribunal enters into it at all, and it is only the Railway Tribunal we are discussing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can help Deputies.  This Book of Estimates is prepared after a certain system.  The system is such that the salaries and allowances for the Railway Tribunal are included in one separate Vote&mdash;Vote 58.  The salaries, allowances and expenditure of the Minister's general Department are in another Vote&mdash;Vote 56.  The Railway Tribunal is working under an Act. The Minister is only responsible for how he spends the money under the law as he finds it.  I think the point in Deputy Moore's mind is that he feels that a different kind of legislation ought to be in operation, dealing not only with railways but with transport generally.  Now until you get that actually passed into law, the Act which provides for the Railway Tribunal remains in force and the Railway Tribunal remains in existence.  To that extent the question that arises is, whether the salaries of the Tribunal ought or ought not to be paid.  Of course since the House is asked to pay all salaries it is quite clear that the House need not pay if it does not like, although it is provided by the Act that there shall be a Railway Tribunal. When discussing a general question of policy even on the main Vote of the Minister's Department, it is technically not in order to advocate legislation as the Estimates do not give an opportunity for reviewing all the Acts passed.  If Deputies reflect on that for a few minutes they will see that it. would be an impossible situation if every Estimate gave an opportunity for going back over all the Acts of Parliament under which the Estimates have been prepared and from which the Minister could not depart, even if he so desired.  On the main Estimate for certain Departments, such as the Department of Industry and Commerce, for example, when a question of policy is put down for discussion, such as transport, it is difficult, it is in fact impracticable to insist upon the point that you cannot advocate legislation, because at certain points manifestly when changes are advocated, legislation <Col N="282" /> will be necessary.  Therefore, that particular situation should not be insisted upon too rigidly when it is a question of policy.  But even on the main Vote for the Minister's Department, which includes the Minister's salary, it will not really be possible to tear up the Railways Act of 1924&mdash;to go into it and repeat the debate that took place pro and con during the passage of the Railways Bill in 1924. I do not know whether Deputies are under a misapprehension as to what the situation really is.  If they want an amending Act, they cannot either get a discussion on that on this Railway Tribunal Vote, nor can they get an amending Act by the refusing money here.  After the Minister's main Department has been discussed, if the money for the Minister's main Department is refused, a certain situation will arise, but even the fact that this Vote 58 had been passed would not make any substantial difference in that situation.  I do not know whether that makes it plain.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned the other night. I had said, speaking as a layman and from my experience of having gone through that fell disease called smallpox in this country, and seen a great deal of it in the East, that I was convinced of the efficacy of vaccination. Really I do not see how anybody who has had anything to do, however slightly, with cases of this kind could think otherwise. I think it is only because we have had such wonderful immunity for so many years that people here underestimate what a terrible disease smallpox is.  During the Middle Ages, all through the eighteenth century, and partly in the nineteenth century, at different periods these countries were devastated.  The attacks practically swept certain districts clean, and it was only by the lucky discovery of vaccine by Sir William Jenner that relief was brought to the people suffering from this terrible scourge.  Of course, I am quite aware that a great many people think that improved sanitation has had a great deal to do with it.  The learned medical Deputies who have spoken have shown that although sanitation has been a great asset in the improved health of these different countries, and has reduced the disease in many ways, still smallpox is not one of these complaints that is affected by sanitation to any great extent.  In fact, I know of cases where sanitation could not have entered into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been stated that certain complaints have been passed on by vaccination.  I do not think that has been proved at all.  In fact, I think Deputy Sir James Craig denied that it would be possible to do it through vaccine.  It might have been possible when the vaccine from one person was used to vaccinate another.  I think I understood the Deputy to say that, but <Col N="287" /> under the present system of pure vaccine such a thing is absolutely impossible. Therefore, one can but come to the conclusion that if any of these cases did arise, the disease must have been in the child, perhaps in a very highly developed state, wanting practically nothing to bring it on.  That, of course, is a matter that only the doctors know.  I know people who were vaccinated and passed immune through epidemics of smallpox that were of a very serious character.  I can remember a case where a man who did not believe in vaccination got the disease abroad, and, from being more than usually prepossessing, that person's after-life was a perfect torment.  He recovered, but I can only say that his appearance was more of a leper than of a human being for a very considerable number of years.  Having seen these things myself, they have thoroughly convinced me that there is a reasonable certainty of immunisation from this terrible disease by vaccination.  There may be cases now and then where it may fail, but that must be always the way.  Taken as a whole, I contend that vaccination has been one of the greatest blessings that has ever been vouchsafed to these countries.  Let us hope that we will never have epidemics like those we had in past ages.</P>
    <P>The people at the ports, of course, are most particular in having foreigners carefully examined, but it lies with the internal Governments to see that the interiors of all countries are kept clear of this disease by rigidly carrying out the rules and regulations that are laid down for the general good. It is said that it is wrong to put compulsion on anyone, to make them do what they do not believe in.  We have all to give in on certain things that the large majority of the people believe to be for the good of the country.  I think it will be a very bad day, and that we will pay a fearful penalty, if these rules are relaxed in the case of this fell disease.  In England they are allowed to maintain a conscientious objection, with the result that in many places the disease breaks out.  Of course their arrangements are very good for isolation and for stamping it out, but <Col N="288" /> if vaccination was maintained as strictly as it was in years gone by, I am quite certain there would be none of these cases at all.  As a layman, that is my impression, and I hope that the authorities in this country, where we have had no epidemics, and where I hope we never will, will do their best to maintain the law as it stands at present, and not weaken it by giving way to conscientious objectors.  I hope that the law will be maintained as it is, and if epidemics break out on the other side of the water we shall have the advantage of not having the conscientious objection clause.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the Bill.  I have not been convinced that the Bill is not a necessity, even after listening to such an eminent authority upon this subject as Deputy Sir James Craig.  Deputy Sir James Craig told us that the disease is a purely air-borne disease, that sanitation has little or no effect upon it, and that by endeavouring to ward off the disease by means of improved sanitation no useful purpose can be served. Now, Deputy Everett stated what, in my opinion, was a very clear truth, when he referred to the sharp differences of medical opinion upon this subject.</P>

      <P>I am going to quote, for Deputy Hennessy's benefit, the opinion of a very eminent medical man, the late Sir Edward Chadwick, who maintained that cases of smallpox, typhus, and ordinary epidemics occur in the greatest proportion in common conditions of foul air, stagnation, putrefaction, bad house drainage, filthy street surfaces, and from overcrowding in foul houses.  Being an ordinary layman I do not propose to say which of these authorities is correct, but I do propose to have the common sense to accept the opinion of either one or the other, and I accept the authority in this particular instance of Sir Edward Chadwick.</P>

      <P>Well, I do not profess to regulate the eminence of any men in a profession, but Sir Edward Chadwick has obtained great eminence upon all these questions of sanitation and particularly upon the particular question of the disease we are now discussing. I simply accept what is ordinary every-day common knowledge on this subject, and I put that forward in the light in which Sir Edward Chadwick has been accepted by the great majority of the people in England.</P>

      <P>It was a pity that Sir Edward Chadwick, for whose opinion I have the very greatest respect, did not go a little further and tell us what are the causes of small-pox, what brings these impurities into the air which create the germ from which small-pox originates, whether it springs up spontaneously, or from what source it emerges.  If what Sir Edward Chadwick has said is true it is perfectly clear that germs will appear from putrefaction, bad drainage, and other things of that nature.  I would go even further and would say that impure water plays a very important part in the creation of small-pox.  It is a most extraordinary thing that where investigations have been made as to the origin of small-pox, in almost every instance it can be traced by one method or another to impurities in water.  I will give you an instance of that.  At Ebbw Vale, in South Wales, where many cases of small-pox have occurred and where it is a somewhat recurrent disease, it was found, when an endeavour was made to trace the origin, that the water supply was very dangerously polluted.  It has also been found in many other instances that scarcity of water leads to small-pox.  I am sure that before this debate closes we will have the benefit of the views of some of the medical men on this question and I hope that they will endeavour <Col N="290" /> to tell the House, from their intimate knowledge of the subject, what the real origin of small-pox is, or if the origin can be traced.  If they can show that the opinion of Sir Edward Chadwick is untrue it is up to them to do so, but until they do that, that view cannot reasonably be accepted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sir James Craig painted for us a wonderful picture of the dangers that might arise from contact due to intercourse between England and this country.  I hope I am not misquoting Deputy Sir James Craig, but it was, I think, one of the medical Deputies who drew a picture of the danger existing through intercourse between England and ourselves.  I cannot accept that as having the weight with which it was urged upon the House.  I do not think that there is a great element of danger. What has happened in countries where there has been absolutely compulsory vaccination?  Has it warded off small-pox or has it not?  Has it been the complete agent of immunity that Deputy Sir James Craig told us of? Let us see for ourselves what has really happened where they have had compulsory vaccination.  There is a certain area that has been called the land of inexorable vaccination, and that is Brazil.  Brazil has compulsory vaccination from one end to the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>The disease does not spare any particular area in the world.  I am endeavouring to put very salient facts before the House, and perhaps the Minister will be able to refute them.  In Brazil a child cannot enter any school, primary, secondary or otherwise, without being vaccinated. No person can enter the public service without being vaccinated.  People cannot even enter private service without vaccination; you cannot take on a domestic servant unless she has been vaccinated.  So that you will see, as far as vaccination is concerned, that that country deals with it in a very drastic way.  In the year 1925-6 in Rio de Janeiro 652,703 persons were vaccinated, and in that year there were 2,187 deaths from small-pox.  Where does the <Col N="291" /> complete immunity that Deputy Sir James Craig has claimed for vaccination come in in face of a startling fact of that nature?  I am endeavouring to follow the logic of facts, and I have had the advantage of being trained in the same school of logic, I believe, as Deputy Sir James Craig himself was, so that perhaps I might have some little glimmering of knowledge on the subject. Of these 2,187 who died from small-pox, 1,326 were under twenty years of age.  I do not wish to suggest anything of a non-professional character, but, after all, there is an underlying element that this does bring grist to the mill somewhere.  In the area I have referred to where they have compulsory vaccination for small-pox there were almost 50 per cent. of fatalities, and if the medical men are able to get over that I will be exceedingly interested to hear them.  Deputy Sir James Craig made one very fatal admission. He said that if small-pox is to be warded off and if vaccination is to be effective it should be repeated at periods of seven years, or not later than twelve years.</P>
      <P>I happen to be one of those who was vaccinated in his early days.  I have escaped small-pox, even though I have travelled from one end of England to the other, where they have no compulsory vaccination.  I have lived on both sides of the Channel, and never contracted that disease.  I want to say to medical Deputies that 90 per cent. of the people of this country, after the seven-year period has elapsed, according to the statement of Deputy Sir James Craig&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Sir James Craig stated, after Deputy Dr. Ryan had mentioned the seven years, that after seven years&mdash;if I am not mistaken&mdash;the <Col N="292" /> effects of vaccination passed.  My recollection is that Deputy Sir James Craig did admit that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Sir James Craig will give me credit for this, that I do not mean to be discourteous to him.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate this fact, because I think it is pretty universally admitted by members of the medical profession that vaccination has no effect after the seven-year period.  The value of vaccination passes away after that period.  Therefore, 90 per cent. of the people of this country are open to contract small-pox if what the medical men tell us is true.  What has prevented them from contracting small-pox? I think plain common-sense will tell any man the reason is this: that vaccination has not got the merits which the medical profession claim for it.  Why do I take up such a rigid opposition of this Bill?  My answer is, because of practical experience.  I claim to have a greater responsibility as a family man than any member here.  That may be regarded as a startling claim, but I have a serious responsibility in that respect.  I can tell the House that one of my own children, a rather delicate lad, was brought to the doctor against the wishes of his mother to be vaccinated.  On the first occasion the vaccine did not act, nor did it act when he was brought back the second time.  He was brought back despite the protestations of his mother. On the third time it did act, and although Deputy Sir James Craig and other medical men in the House have said that they never knew of a case where ill effects arose from vaccination, I can tell the House that, following vaccination in the case of that child, his body was covered practically from head to foot with a scaly substance. That is one of the reasons why I stand up here against the attitude taken in this House by members of the medical profession.  I say the members of the medical profession have not been logical in their attitude by opposing Deputy Everett's Bill.  If this question goes to a division.  I will vote in support of the Deputy's Bill.</P>

      <P>I found it very hard to observe the rules <Col N="293" /> of order while my colleague, Deputy J.J. Byrne, was speaking.  At almost every sentence I felt inclined to interrupt and contradict him.  Speaking on this matter from the point of view of the ordinary lay woman, I say if this conscience clause is passed it will give two classes of mothers in this country a very good excuse for not getting their children vaccinated&mdash;(1) those who are too foolishly fond of their children and say they do not want them vaccinated, that vaccination would hurt them; and (2) careless mothers who allow their children to remain unvaccinated.  These classes will be conscientious objectors if there is any loophole through which they can avoid the law.  I think the House would be criminally guilty if they allowed this conscience clause to pass, thus leaving the young children of the present day, as well as the unborn children of the future, open to such a terrible disease as small-pox.  Those of us whose memories go back to the eighties can recall the number of pretty, prepossessing people, as Deputy Wolfe described them, who were hopelessly disfigured by this dire and fell disease. I can remember, in the County Cork, seeing men go around who were afflicted with blindness from the effects of smallpox.  I am not concerned with what has happened in Brazil, or with the opinions of Sir Edward Chadwick. What I am concerned with is Ireland, and with what is occurring in our own country, and the fact is that this country has been immune from small-pox since the vaccination laws had to be rigidly adhered to.  I am far more concerned with the opinions of Deputy Sir James Craig than with the opinions of Sir Edward Chadwick.  Deputies should realise that there is a terrible responsibility placed upon them before they vote for the conscience clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy J.J. Byrne spoke as a family man.  I speak as a family woman, and I may mention here that my family runs into two figures.  Every one of my children has been vaccinated.  The process gave them no pain.  I was there myself when the children were vaccinated. They did not even cry during the process.  After the vaccination they were ill for a couple of days.  But <Col N="294" /> what are the trifling effects that a child may suffer after vaccination compared with the terrible effects that children may suffer from this dire malady of small-pox?  I have read some of the objections that in the early days were put up against vaccination.  Deputy Byrne's theories seem as ridiculous as many of the objections that were put up when Dr. Jenner first discovered the effects of vaccination.  It was prophesied that vaccination would brutalise the children; it was averred that the vaccinated children became ox-faced; that abscesses broke out to indicate the spread of horns, and that the countenance of the person affected became gradually transmuted into the visage of a cow, and the voice into the bellowing of bulls.  There seems to be about just as much sense and logic in some of the arguments which the anti-vaccinationists have put up in this House as there were in the objections I have just mentioned.  I appeal to Deputies to think of their responsibilities to the children of this country and to oppose this measure of Deputy Everett's.  Like Deputy Sir James Craig, I also regard Deputy Everett as a pleasant comrade in this House, and I am sorry to have to oppose him, but my responsibilities are far too great, and I therefore appeal to the House to reject this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Byrne, who has made up his mind in this matter, I confess I have not decided how I will vote.  I have listened with great interest to the discussion, and particularly to the views of the members of the medical profession.  I would like, when other Deputies who are in the medical profession follow, that they would elaborate a little bit more some of the points raised.  I have tried to get as much information as I could in the last few days on this matter. There is one thing I am not clear about.  It is suggested that because of the manner in which this lymph is brought about there is a danger, and that it has happened, that syphilis has been transferred from one person to another.  I have also heard, and I would like to get confirmation of it, that if calf lymph is used it is impossible to transfer syphilis from the <Col N="295" /> calf as it is a purely human disease.  I would like to have that confirmed by some member of the medical profession in the House.  The reason I took particular interest in this is, that I was rather impressed by what Deputy Sir James Craig said, that the introduction of glycerine into the lymph kills all germs.  I know from what I have discovered that glycerine does not kill the germ of syphilis, and therefore I would like to have it confirmed by some member of the medical profession that it is a fact that lymph taken from a calf cannot bring about the transfer of the germs of syphilis.  That would do away with one of the difficulties I have. Deputy Byrne gave us at great length a history of Brazil.  I must say that I was not impressed with his references to Brazil.  He left out what should be one of the main points of his argument. He did not tell us whether those people who died from small-pox in Brazil were citizens of Brazil, or had just come in to the country, and who happened to get the disease.  It is generally accepted by those who believe in it that vaccination brings about immunity for a period of five or seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard it said that children under the age of seven years are more likely, if coming in contact in any way with the disease, to contract small-pox than older persons.  That does not agree with the theory that they are immune for a period of from five to seven years.  I am sure the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who is responsible in this matter&mdash;and it is not a political question, as it concerns people of all shades of opinion&mdash; in his opposition to this conscience clause, will have got advice from the medical profession at his disposal, and that he will be able to give us some enlightenment to counter the eminent authorities quoted here in favour of the conscience clause.  I would like to hear from the medical men who will follow in this debate some definite medical opinion.  Are they satisfied as medical men to advise this House, composed mainly of lay people, that vaccination is necessary and essential as a preventive of small-pox?  I am not at all impressed by people who say that mothers <Col N="296" /> are afraid of inflicting pain on their children.  I know of other operations that have to be performed and that inflict more pain on children of a younger age than that at which children are vaccinated.  I would be glad it medical men would enlighten us if this is necessary as to why it is necessary. I do not ask them, like Deputy Byrne, to state what is the cause of this, that or the other, because there are many diseases the cause of which cannot be explained.  It is generally accepted in the medical world that vaccination is a means of helping people to withstand small-pox when it breaks out.  I would like a more elaborate discussion on the subject from the medical point of view, so that those of us who have not made up our minds as to how we will vote on this Bill will feel when we are going to vote that we are doing the right thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. CONNOLLY Mr. CONNOLLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOLLY</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is of a very mild form.  It leaves it optional to people to have their children vaccinated, and it leaves it optional for elders to be vaccinated.  Vaccination is a question of vital importance, as far as the national health is concerned.  I do not think it is reasonable or fair that there should be a law in any country that would inflict punishment on a child and that the parents would have no control in the matter.  A child is brought under the law immediately by an Act of the Government, and is sent to a doctor to be inoculated with a virus of some kind, a virus that is foreign to the body of that child.  From the views that have been put before us by the Deputy doctors.  I can scarcely conceive that the members of this Dáil will for one moment give any serious consideration to the points on which they tried to establish their case.  They have not established that children remain immune for six months after vaccination. Under such circumstances why should we accept the statements of the doctors?  Why should we continue to ask the people of this country to send their children to doctors to have such punishment inflicted on them? There is no reason why we should do it.  I think this should be a matter for the mothers and fathers of the children to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> A child is sent to a doctor and it is vaccinated, and when brought home it immediately becomes extremely ill.  If the child is healthy and strong that virus enters into its body directly, and the blood of that child kills the virus and it has no effect.  In the case of a child whose health is not up to the proper standard after inoculation by this virus, which is foreign to its body, it becomes seriously ill.  In many cases day after day the mother is in consultation with the doctor as to why the child suffers.  The doctor has to prescribe an antidote against the virus with which he has inoculated the child in order to preserve the life of that child.  There is no doubt that the health of children has been impaired by this inoculation.  In the case of a delicate child who has been vaccinated the volume of blood is not able to resist for any length of time.  I am sure that the Deputy doctors who have spoken on this matter will admit that in 99 cases out of a 100 it means certain death in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Why should we expose our children, if they are delicate, to death?  Why should we expose our children to the risk of sickly lives by the infliction of this punishment, if it is not going to be effective after six or twelve months or after three, four, five or six years? The limit the doctors are prepared to say this inoculation will keep the children immune from small-pox is seven years.  That is the farthest they will go.  Further, they are not prepared to guarantee that the child is immune from catching small-pox for any period. It is all-important that the fathers and mothers should be the sole directors in this matter and that their views should be the sole consideration.  They should not be compelled to inflict upon their children this punishment.  It is a punishment on the parents, in the first place, and a punishment on the children, in the second place.  On the evidence of most doctors of the world, this vaccination serves no useful purpose. The doctor-Deputies who spoke here would not put the period of immunity at more than seven years. These are the facts from themselves, and they have not been and will not be refuted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> The Deputy doctor on my left here spoke of the procuring of the lymph from the calf.  He told us how it was tried and tested before being distributed to the dispensary doctors.  He did not say upon what that lymph was tried.  It is very strange that if the lymph is pure it has got to be tried and tested.  Upon what is it tried and tested?  Is it upon a dog?  Is it tested upon a cat?  Having tried and tested it upon a dog or cat, is it fair to send that very substance through the country and have it tried upon the children of the country?  I do not think that is reasonable or just.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept the general opinion of 90 per cent. of the population of this country that this matter of vaccination against small-pox is really a bogey.  It is a bogey that goes a long way to inflict punishment on many children.  It is through that bogey that 75 per cent. of the children in this country are vaccinated.  It is this way: the parents will say, &ldquo;It is just a little bit better to have the child vaccinated lest it be said later, in the event of the child contracting this disease, that it was my fault.  I will save myself in that respect.&rdquo; I do not think that the doctor-Deputies, when speaking on this matter here, should have disclosed their identities as doctors.  Everybody knows pretty well what weight the opinion of a doctor carries in country districts. In rural areas, most of the people regard the doctor as a sort of deity in some respects.  In general, the doctor's opinion is accepted as being something final; it is accepted as having been based on favourable evidence and it is felt that in everything he says he must be right.  That is why I submit that the medical Deputies in this House should not have disclosed their identities when speaking on this Bill. They are here as Deputies and not as doctors.  Giving their views as doctors on a Bill of this kind, will have a very detrimental effect upon the population of the country.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with vaccination and that is the punishment to the child.  That is why this matter of vaccination should not be continued any longer.  Again, the mother or the parent of the child brings that child to the hospital or dispensary. <Col N="299" /> The child is inoculated with the virus.  The mother sees that the child immediately cries and she gasps. The first opportunity she gets she extracts that substance from the body of her child.  That is because the natural instincts of that mother tell her that it is wrong to have any foreign sulbstance introduced into the body.  I have seen instances in the matter of travel where a peculiar situation arose in connection with vaccination.  There are first, second and third-class passengers on the boats.  The first-class passenger was supposed to be immune from small-pox when he got into another country.  The second-class passenger was supposed also to be immune from small-pox when going into another country.  Why was it that the third-class passenger was not considered safe or immune from small-pox when he got to another country?  I have seen these passengers on the boats and I have seen the third-class passengers inoculated.  I have seen young men suffering from the hardship and pain inflicted on them by this vaccination and I have seen them sick for days. Directly many of these men got the opportunity, they had the substance extracted from the arm.  When the substance was in a part of the body which they were not able to reach themselves, I have seen them get other young men to extract it.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is right for this House to have a division on this Bill. It is a question whether the father or mother should be compelled to have their children vaccinated with some foreign substance that is going to do them no good whatsoever, in the opinion of the principal doctors of the world. No doctor will guarantee that the vaccinated person will be immune from small-pox within six months after the vaccination.  There are a number of large families in my district, and not one of the children has been vaccinated. I know families with 6, 10 or 12 children and none of them has been vaccinated.  These children have remained immune from every disease for the last 20 years.  I make that statement of my own personal knowledge. I can prove that no doctor has visited the homes of those unvaccinated persons <Col N="300" /> for 20 years to treat them for any disease, such as the 'flu or diphtheria or measles.  I can prove that none of these children has ever contracted measles.  They are the healthiest children in the district.  I know families who have been unvaccinated and they did not have a doctor in the home, except in the case of accidents.  I am aware of vaccinated children who have suffered from diphtheria, measles and other diseases, that are never known amongst those who have not been vaccinated. It was only last Good Friday I met with a case of a family of five children unvaccinated in a district in which there was an outbreak of measles. Not one of that family contracted the measles.  That is a clear indication that the blood of unvaccinated persons offers a better resistance to disease than is offered in the case of those who have been vaccinated.</P>
    <P>It is in vain to try to persuade such people that the introduction into their bodies of calf lymph or any other lymph, is going to be of any benefit to them or to make them immune from this disease.  This House should do nothing to impose such a barbarous operation on the children.  I do not think it is quite fair that men who have no practical experience of families and people who have not practical experience of the conditions that obtain universally, should vote against this Bill.  This is a very mild Bill.  I expect that the law with regard to vaccination will, in fact, be ultimately abolished altogether.  Having regard to the opinions of so many people, I think the Bill is a reasonable and just one.  It gives the option to people who want their children vaccinated to have them vaccinated.  It gives the right to adults, if they want to be vaccinated, to be vaccinated.  I put it now here to the Deputies: which of us here in our senses will submit ourselves to a dispensary doctor and say, &ldquo;I want to be vaccinated&rdquo;?  We will not, because we have come to the use of reason, and we have no belief in the substance they are going to put into our bodies.  I know of one of the most up-to-date countries in Europe, and in that country it is an offence to have vaccination carried out.</P>

      <P>I am sorry. I should have said the Royal Academy of Medicine, the Royal College of Physicians and the Irish Medical Association have all passed very forcible resolutions dealing with this particular question.  Irish medical opinion is very strongly in support of the present vaccination laws.  A terrible lot of nonsense has been spoken about this matter in support of the Bill.  On the part of Deputy Everett and, I think, Deputy O'Kelly, no evidence has been brought forward in connection with the matter. One or two attempts have been made to drag points across the discussion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Everett said that he avoided bringing in arguments at all, and his plea at the tail-end of his speech was a kind of <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal to the House.  &ldquo;This is only a little bit of a Bill brought in by a little Private Deputy, and the House ought to let it go through.&rdquo; He said that if the medical profession would impress on the Medical Department of the Department of Local Government and Public Health the necessity for dealing with other diseases in the same way as they impressed on them the necessity for enforcing the Vaccination Acts, we would not have a large and increasing number of people dying from consumption.  If, in approaching the question of vaccination, Deputy Everett informed himself in the same way as on the question of consumption, he has not done very justly by the people in attempting to speak in an authoritative and argumentative way against the present Vaccination Laws.</P>
      <P>In so far as consumption is concerned the annual report for the year 1926 shows that from 1916 onwards we had a very steady decrease in the number of deaths from consumption in the country.  The returns for 1927 have not been published yet, but it shows a still further decrease in the number of deaths.  In 1916 there were 6,471 deaths from tuberculosis of all kinds.  The average for the years 1916 to 1925 was 5,375.  The total number of deaths in 1926 was 4,362, being 1,013 less than the average for the last ten years.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was speaking here of a large and increasing number of persons dying from consumption and within our jurisdiction here.  I say the number has consistently decreased from 1916 and perhaps before that year.  At any rate, the number that died in 1926 was 1,013 less than the average for the previous ten years.  The number of deaths in 1927 was 4,184, or an additional 178 less than in 1926.  It represents a decrease in deaths from tuberculosis of all kinds in rural and urban areas in respect of men and women, and if Deputy Everett can make the statement with regard to consumption that he has made in the face of these facts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I say that it is not treating a very important matter, the public health of the country, in a reasonable way for Deputies to approach it with a want of facts, and I charge Deputy Everett with approaching it in that way.  Deputy O'Kelly said, with regard to the attitude of the Local Government Department:&mdash;&ldquo;I do not think that the Local Government Department can be very serious about this matter, because if they were they would have made a more serious effort in the last four or five years to enforce the Acts where there were deliberate efforts made by local authorities to put them into <Col N="304" /> operation.&rdquo; That suggests that the Department has not assisted local authorities who have statutory obligations to put the Acts into operation, and has not given them proper assistance.  I would like to know on what facts Deputy O'Kelly bases that statement, because the actual facts are that from, say, 1910 to 1913 there was a very definite fall in the number of vaccinations.  In 1910 there were 62,000 odd vaccinations.  In 1911 the number fell to 57,000; in 1912 to 51,000, and in 1913 to 43,000.  Except for a rise during the years 1915, 1916 and 1917&mdash;a rise about which I have not been able to get any interpretation except that it was brought about as a result of war conditions, the vaccination of men in the country going to the Front, and the influence that would have on the general population in having vaccination carried out &mdash;except for that rise and one small rise in 1919, the year when instructions were issued to have vaccination opposed with might and main by the Nationalists of the country, the number of vaccinations fell steadily until the year 1922.  In that year 22,000 vaccinations took place, or 38 per cent. of the births.  From 1922 there has been a steady rise.  In 1923 the number was 39,000; in 1924 it was 48,000; in 1925 it was 50,000; in 1926 it was 50,000, and the number in 1927 was approximately 53,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus, during the period in which Deputy O'Kelly says that the Department of Local Government was hardly serious about the matter, steps were taken to get the vaccination laws effectively enforced because of the medical foundation upon which the law was based, and the thorough belief of the Department that public health interests demanded that, and also because of the danger that lay at our doors owing to the epidemic in Great Britain.  The number of vaccinations that took place, as compared with births, rose from 38 per cent. in 1922 to 90 per cent. in 1927.  It is unfair, also, in dealing with the matter that a Deputy would attempt to prejudice the discussion by saying that the Department was not serious in the matter, whereas the facts, in so far as I give them, show that the efforts of the <Col N="305" /> Department to have the vaccination laws properly carried out have been very successful, and that we are getting back to the normal position.  I think that before Deputy O'Kelly made that suggestion he should have had the facts behind him.  In dealing generally with this matter we have not had any evidence put before us, good, bad, or indifferent. One Irish doctor has been mentioned, Dr. Russell.  I do not know anything about him, but you have been told that his advice is that the vaccination laws have been a failure here. We naturally ask on what grounds are they supposed to have been a failure? Is it because there is practically no small-pox here to be dealt with?  I submit that the fact that we have practically no small-pox in this country is very strong evidence upon which we can base reasonable arguments that the laws have been successfully carried out.  I certainly would like to hear the facts upon which the allegation is made that the vaccination laws have not been successful here.</P>
    <P>To argue whether the law has been successful or not, Deputy J.J. Byrne asks us to go to Brazil.  He asks: what has been the experience in countries where these laws have been enforced? We need not go as far as Brazil to study that matter in a systematic way. I have here a statement of the mortality from small-pox among the civil population in Prussia, and also among the military population there since 1825.  It is in chart form.  In the ten years from 1825 to 1834 the number of deaths per hundred thousand among the military population in Prussia from small-pox was greater in six years out of the ten than it was among the civil population.  When vaccination was introduced into the Prussian Army in 1834&mdash;it was not introduced in respect of the civil population until 1875&mdash;the deaths from small-pox among the military population fell to practically nothing. In the year 1831 there were 75 deaths per hundred thousand among the military population from small-pox. and the figure for the year 1832 was 66.7, and for 1833 it was 75.0.  For twenty-six years, from 1845 to 1870, the number of deaths from small-pox among the Prussian military population <Col N="306" /> was only on four occasions as high as 0.8 per hundred thousand.  The mortality amongst the civilian population would represent an average figure of 20, as against 0.8.  When, in 1874, vaccination was introduced in respect of the civil population in Prussia death from small-pox was practically wiped out among that population.  The deathrate in 1896 was 0.02; in 1897 it was 0.03; and in 1898 it was 0.04.  Among the military population, only on two occasions, between the years 1874 and 1901, was there a figure that was not 0.0.  I am told that people object very much to figures.  I did not intend to refer to the German position, except for the fact that we have been challenged to consider what has happened in countries where vaccination has been imposed.  I would rely on the facts as they reflected upon the true effects of any particular operation as disclosed over a long period of time among the Prussian people rather than take them from Brazil to-day.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that the experiences among the German population are much more to be relied upon than the experiences in Brazil, even if we had the systematic setting out of the position in regard to Brazil that we have in regard to Germany.  There has been an outbreak of small-pox lasting from 1917 up to date in Britain, and it is still increasing because it is not a fact, as Deputy Connolly suggested in one of his loose remarks, that the British people are able to deal with it, even after an expenditure of something like £10,000,000.  The epidemic is increasing almost weekly in Great Britain so that there is no sign at present even after that very lavish expenditure of money and after a number of deaths that they are succeeding in dealing with it.  We have the very striking fact that out of the great number of cases that have occurred in England, not one single vaccinated child under twelve years of age has contracted the disease, while in the case of children under fifteen years of age there have been only eight.  In the case of unvaccinated children, approximately out of 10,000 cases, 4,000 cases have been of children under fifteen years of age.  These are the real experiences occurring among people-highly <Col N="307" /> organised from a public health point of view.  They are highly organised for the purpose of collecting and estimating facts and we must be very much impressed by them.  With regard to the general medical opinion on vaccination and its effect on the prevention of small-pox, the matter was investigated for quite a number of years, from 1889 to 1896, by a Royal Commission in Great Britain.  I want to read its findings here.  They are not the findings of a commission consisting of medical people.  They are the findings of a general commission and most of the evidence given before it was by people who opposed vaccination.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission sat from 1889 to 1896 and reported, I presume, about 1896.  Its conclusions were:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We think:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.  That it diminishes the liability to be attacked by the disease.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  That it modifies the character of the disease, and renders it (a) less fatal, and (b) of a milder or less severe type.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.  That the protection it affords against attacks of the disease is greatest during the years immediately succeeding the operation of vaccination.  It is impossible to fix with precision the length of this period of highest protection.  Though not in all cases the same, if a period is to be fixed, it might, we think, fairly be said to cover in general a period of nine or ten years.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  That after the lapse of the period of highest protective potency the efficacy of vaccination to protect against attack rapdily diminishes, but that it is still considerable in the next quinquennium, and possibly never altogether ceases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;5.  That its power to modify the character of the disease is also greatest in the period in which its power to protect from attack is greatest, but that its power to modify the disease does not diminish as <Col N="308" /> rapidly as its protective influence against attacks, and its efficacy during the later periods of life to modify the disease is still very considerable.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;6.  That re-vaccination restores the protection which lapse of time has diminished, but the evidence shows that this protection again diminishes, and that, to ensure the highest degree of protection which vaccination can give, the operation should be at intervals repeated.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;7.  That the beneficial effects of vaccination are most experienced by those in whose case it has been most thorough.  We think it may fairly be concluded that where the vaccine matter is inserted in three or four places, it is more effectual than where introduced into one or two places only, and that if the vaccination marks are of an area of half a square inch, they indicate a better state of protection than if their area be at all considerably below this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the complete statement of their recommendations.  These are the findings on medical grounds that are the basis of our present Vaccination Acts.  I suggest that since the making of that report all our experience has been that the present Vaccination Acts are justified, and that such modification as there has been in England has brought upon England the really very disastrous situation in which they now find themselves.  Since 1917 approximately £10,000,000 has been expended, without talking of the dislocation to a certain extent of trade and family life that a visitation of this disease brings. It is argued here that children ought not to be vaccinated until they come to the use of reason, and that they then should be allowed to say whether they should be vaccinated or not.  Medical evidence is clear that small-pox, just as measles and whooping-cough, is a disease of childhood.  I am not competent to say definitely, but I do suggest that it is still in England at the present time a disease of childhood, and that the 4,000 odd unvaccinated children who contracted the disease out of 10,000 cases, in 1926, were the real spear-head of the disease amongst the British <Col N="309" /> population at the time.  We have endeavoured by the enforcement of the Vaccination Acts since we took control of the matter to cover the weak spot, that is, to cover the childhood position so that the childhood position in this country would not be the spear-head for the entry of small-pox here.</P>
    <P>We ought to realise the danger there is in Great Britain at the present moment and the danger there is to us, because it has been explained by medical speakers here.  I think it is absurd that Deputy Connolly should object to Deputies here speaking on the matter as doctors.  He wants to stifle the doctors.  Medical statistics have shown that the period of incubation of this disease is from eleven to fourteen days, and that a person may leave not only England but New York apparently perfectly free from the disease and the disease may show itself after his arrival here.  We have taken steps in the matter of old clothing coming into the country to see that small-pox is not brought in in that way, but there is no protection that we can devise that would prevent a person coming over from England here without any apparent signs of disease and developing the symptoms of the disease three or four days afterwards.  We are not able to raise any protection against it.  Our population is not as immune as we should like to see it in the event of the disease coming over here from Great Britain.  If we look at the figures from 1910 onwards we will see that we must have at present about a quarter of a million persons between six and eighteen years of age who are unvaccinated. I consider that we are in a dangerous condition from the point of view of public health if an outbreak did take place.  Only a very small percentage of the medical profession here have any experience of the disease.  We were very fortunate in connection with the last eleven cases that appeared here that the infection never spread from the house in which it showed itself, because of the vigorous medical steps taken.  But only a small percentage of the medical profession have had experience of small-pox, and a rapid outbreak might easily occur in <Col N="310" /> any area which we might find it difficult to cope with.</P>
    <P>We should not therefore discuss this matter in a light vein.  It is a very serious matter, and we ought not to allow ourselves to be carried away by the appeals of Deputies who claim that children suffer pain and hardship by being vaccinated.  I doubt very much if medical Deputies will bear that out. To hear people speaking like that one would imagine they never saw a child getting its face washed.  It is unreasonable to attempt to appeal to people's feelings by talking about the pain that children undergo.  There is, I am sure, no Deputy who, if his child was suffering from diphtheria, would not get it inoculated right away.  All the facts and all medical evidence go to show that vaccination can safeguard our people from the losses and disabilities that the people in Great Britain are suffering at present.  Then people say, &ldquo;What is the use of vaccination except you re-vaccinate later on?&rdquo; The child population of the country is the spear-head of the people from the point of view of small-pox and the present vaccination law, if effectively carried out. will safeguard that.  If it be found that that is not sufficient safeguard against the spread of small-pox, then we can deal with the question of re-vaccination. But the fact that we are free from small-pox is no reason why we should take down our guard now.</P>
    <P>A number of points have been raised about the making up of the lymph and the way in which dispensary doctors administer it.  The regulations so far as dispensary doctors are concerned are very explicit.  Except in so far as any immediate danger of small-pox may arise, dispensary doctors are to vaccinate only subjects who are in good health, and there are explicit things set out which are to be taken into consideration in deciding whether a person is in good health or not.  The vaccine is very carefully prepared.  It is not, so far as I know, tried on a cat or a dog.  It is subject to the tests that modern science suggests should provide effective tests for discovering the presence of micro-organisms.  It is always supplied in fresh condition, and dispensary doctors are ordered not to use <Col N="311" /> but to return, vaccine that they have for longer than seven days.  No complaint has been made with regard to the lymph supplied.  It is prepared under the closest possible supervision, and I doubt if vaccine lymph is prepared in any other country in the careful way in which it is prepared here.</P>
    <P>As to Deputy Briscoe's point. Deputy Sir James Craig, in his speech on the last day, stated that syphilis cannot be carried by calf lymph, because the calf is immune from it&mdash;it is not a bovine disease.  Talk of that kind is simply spread about in order to raise fears of one kind or another.  The Local Government Department, with full medical advice behind its attitude in the matter, is very earnestly opposed to the passing of this Bill, and I appeal to Deputies to recognise that a very serious responsibility from the point of view of public health rests upon them. and that they ought to oppose the Bill very vigorously.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government and Public Health referred to some remarks made by Deputy O'Kelly.  He said that there was a steady fall in the number of cases of vaccination up to 1922, but he did not say whether there was an increase in the number of cases of small-pox. I would be interested to know that.  Was there an increase in the number of cases of small-pox in these years?  He also said, towards the close of his speech, something that attracted me, and I am sure Deputy Sir James Craig also took notice of it.  That was that the doctors in this country had not very much experience of small-pox. I think he was quite right there, and that being the case, I think it might be <Col N="312" /> well if we referred to the countries that have had great experience of small-pox. There will be justification for going to countries with experience of small-pox to find out what the medical opinion on the subject is there, though I noticed that later on there was a disposition to criticise Deputies for going to Brazil and places like that.  The Minister went through many figures and quoted the case of Germany.  He came nearer home than Brazil.  I have a paper here called the &ldquo;Vaccination Inquirer.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No; not for a moment.  I do not believe anything in any paper.  I pick and choose for myself, as most people do.  I draw the Minister's attention to one thing: I think he will admit that Germany is one of the countries with the greatest development of vaccination in the world.  It is also a country that suits his particular type of mentality.  This paper is dated February 1, 1928. Deputy O'Dowd spoke about the immunity from small-pox and other diseases that soldiers enjoyed during the Great War.  Germany was not behind in vaccinating her troops.  This paper says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The most remarkable figures are those from 1916 to 1921, which revealed no less than 11,951 cases with 1,768 deaths.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not saying that these are facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to do that. These figures are in tabular form, same as the Minister for Local Government has them.  They are only taken from 1896 to 1926, but they are not the full figures for 1926.  The period I want to refer to is from 1916 to 1921.  Out of 685 cases of small-pox notified there <Col N="313" /> were 93 deaths, and the percentage of foreigners was 27.9, which is very high, I admit.  In the following year there were 3,028 cases notified, and of these there were 456 deaths, or 4.7 foreigners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOLAND Mr. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. During that time Germany was full of Russian prisoners who were vaccinated compulsorily, so that I do not think the Deputy is right.  In the next year we had a big drop, from 3,000 to 413, and of these 58 died.  Perhaps they died from other diseases such as tetanus. There were, as I said, over 3,000 notifications the previous year, which fell to 413 in the following year.  Of these 413, 58 died, and the percentage of foreigners is again high, for it amounted to 12.8 per cent.  The next year we have an enormous jump from 413 cases notified to 5,021, with 707 deaths, and the percentage of foreigners was only 3.6.  I will not weary the House with all these figures.  If anyone wants to prove a case by figures he can prove practically anything.  I shall now come to England&mdash;that is nearer home than Germany.  Dr. Garrow, Medical Officer of Health for Chesterfield, has made a report to which I want to refer.  I agree with the Minister that medical officers of health in England have more experience of small-pox than our most eminent men here.  Everyone will agree that medical men gain more knowledge from practical experience than from books, and everybody will agree that the medical officer at Chesterfield will have as good knowledge of small-pox as our medical authorities here.</P>

      <P>I submit that they were very small compared to what occurs in England.  Dr. Garrow confines his comparison to the age of 15 and over, for the simple reason, he says, that practically all the cases under 15 are among the unvaccinated&mdash;in view of the fact that the conscience clause was in operation in England for 15 years.  Of course I see the fly in the <Col N="314" /> ointment here because the seven years come in.  The figures he gives are these: up to 15 years of age there were 11,019 cases with 22 deaths, a mortality rate of .20, and amongst those of 15 years and upwards who were presumably vaccinated, 11,524 cases, with 39 deaths, a mortality rate of .33.  If the Minister would like plenty more figures I have them here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I have not. I will allow the Minister and his Department to do that.  I have an interest in this, and a very vital interest in it.  It occurs to me that we are vaccinating people in this country, which <Col N="315" /> unlike India, is a country in which small-pox is not endemic.  We are vaccinating against small-pox, but we must remember that there are other diseases, such as tuberculosis.  I am not going to say what Deputy Everett is alleged to have said, that there was no proper treatment given to tuberculosis. If there is a serum to prevent tuberculosis in after life, why is that not injected into the child?  Similarly, why is not tetanus serum injected?  In other words, why do you not inject all these things into the unfortunate infant?  I am perfectly serious about this.  I believe what Deputy J.J. Byrne said.  I do not often find myself in agreement with him, but I certainly believe what he has said about his own child.  I had an experience myself some time ago, not in the case of my own children&mdash;I am taking good care against that.  I happened to go to register a child some time ago, and I had to wait rather longer than I thought I would have.  But while waiting I was learning something. There happened to be a great number of mothers with children there, where, as I think Deputy Dr. White said, they were waiting as victims.  One Deputy. at any rate, used the word &ldquo;victims,&rdquo; and I think it was Deputy Dr. White.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. BOLAND Mr. G. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;victims&rdquo; was certainly used by one of the medical Deputies.  I saw some of these victims there, and I heard the stories that the mothers told of other victims.  They were all in fear and trembling that the same thing would happen to these victims, and were watching the operations in the case of others.  The one reason they gave for bringing their children there was that they were simply terrified by those people who go round brow-beating them.  Deputy Everett referred to the fact that there was unfair discrimination against the poor, as there is everywhere else.  You are told that you have the law courts.  You have indeed, but have you got the money to avail yourself of the law?  Poor people love their children just as much as the rich <Col N="316" /> do, and if they feel that something will happen to them they have no choice as to whether they will disobey the law and pay a fine, which, in the case of a man, might mean loss of employment. I think this is what was called &ldquo;Prussianism in excelsis.&rdquo; If the case for the conscientious clause has not been already made, I think it is going to be made.  I do not say that I am going to make a complete case, but I am living in hopes of doing a little towards that, and others will follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had to choose where an epidemic was threatened, I would be between the devil and the deep sea.  I would say that if my children were vaccinated there was a chance that they would get some vile disease from having this stuff pumped into them, but that if they were not vaccinated, there would be a chance of them getting this disease, and I might choose between the two.  But I fail to see why I should be called upon to take the risk, where there is not the slightest chance of it, owing to the great improvement in hygiene during the period dealt with by this chart, of having my child contract some loathsome disease.  I think parents should not be asked to do so. Some Deputy&mdash;I think it was Deputy Briscoe&mdash;referred to the possibility of a particular disease being contracted through vaccination.  I read another of these pamphlets, which I frankly admit maybe propagandist, but at the same time they, I submit, make a case which has got to be answered.  I am sorry that I cannot refer the Minister to it, because I burnt it when I was done with it, but I suppose we all got it.  If there happens to be a majority in the House who are naturally ill-informed on the subject, I do not think it would be fair to ask that majority of laymen to take a decision on this subject without first investigating the whole business.  I do not want to weary the House with a number of quotations, but I have a suggestion here that there should be inquiries into certain cases.  That was for England, and I suggest the least we should do would be to do the same thing here, because I think we will have to admit that the medical men have us more or less by the throat in a case like this, where another class of &ldquo;The Doctor's <Col N="317" /> Dilemma&rdquo; prevails&mdash;they do not all agree either.  I have often put the acid test to doctors; I have asked them if their own children were vaccinated. I got some of them to admit that they had been, but a good many of them said that they had not.  In other words, they are in favour of vaccination for other people's children.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is quite obvious that this is not a Party question, that we are all speaking on it as we think, and therefore I think that before a decision is taken there should be some investigation.  As I say, in England a number of people who have been vaccinated have got this disease. Every prisoner of war in Germany was re-vaccinated, and the Russian Army had the same provision, but an enormous number of men died.  Of course the number was not as great as would have been the case in other years, due to better camp hygiene, and that also applies to a remark of Deputy O'Dowd's, when he spoke of fatalities from other causes than bullet wounds. But we all admit that during the time between the Boer War and the Great War enormous advances have been made in that direction.  I am supporting this Bill, and I make the suggestion&mdash;I do not know whether it will be accepted by the proposer or not&mdash;not to turn it down without very careful consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>When moving the Second Reading of this measure, Deputy Everett said that circulars were sent out by the Dáil Department of Local Government in 1919 saying that the Act might not be enforced, and I think he said that there was a Dáil decree saying that we were not going to enforce the Vaccination Act. I have no recollection whatever of any such document being sent out under my authority at that time, or by the Department.  It is quite possible that, with many other pressing matters to deal with at that time, we may have advised against having prosecutions, <Col N="318" /> which is quite a different thing.  Certainly I can say that there was no Dáil decree on the matter.  I can also say that there was never a document sent out stating that the vaccination laws were not to be enforced.  Through the courtesy of Deputy Everett, I have read a pamphlet issued by the Anti-Vaccination League in England.  There is the customary intimation on the front page: &ldquo;Membership, 5/- per annum per member; life member, £5.&rdquo; There is a peculiar strain running through the whole of the references to the various individuals who have opposed vaccination&mdash;that Mr. So-and-so was converted on such a date; then we are presented with a picture of all those saved coming along to save others at the cost of 5/- per head or £5, which will secure, I suppose, ultimate salvation.  I am not altogether impressed with these various documents with a propagandist origin.  I am positively certain that by no stretch of the imagination, and by no use that could be made of official sources, would it be possible to find out how many people died from small-pox who had been vaccinated, or re-vaccinated, as against those who had not been.  On examination, I think Deputy Boland will agree with me there.  If a man from the Anti-Vaccination League called to a house where a person had died from small-pox and put the question: &ldquo;Was he vaccinated?&rdquo; he would probably be told to go about his business.</P>
