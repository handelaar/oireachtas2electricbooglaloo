      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether, in the case of applicants for old age pensions, who are being supported by charitable relatives of whatever degree of relationship or by charitable neighbours, such support is taken into consideration in the reckoning of means of such applicants; and whether, in the event of such support subsequently ceasing for any reason, the fact that it had hitherto been given would still be considered under the Old Age Pensions Acts.</P>

      <P>Under Section 2 (1) d of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1911, account must be taken in calculating the means of any person for old age pension purposes of &ldquo;the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by that person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Where, therefore, an applicant for old age pension is supported by relatives or neighbours, the annual value of the support is taken into account in estimating his means.</P>
      <P>In cases where support is given for a time and is subsequently withdrawn it is open to the person concerned to make fresh application for a pension or for an increase of pension in accordance with the decreased value of his means.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the National Teachers' salary agreement of 1920 contained a clause under which an annual bonus was to be paid to the &ldquo;old First of First Class&rdquo; teachers, provided the Commissioners of National Education were satisfied that these teachers had fulfilled certain educational qualifications; that, although the Commissioners expressed themselves as so satisfied and recommended the payment of this bonus, it was, in fact, never paid; whether representations have been made from time to time without avail on behalf of the very small body of teachers concerned, and whether the Minister is now prepared to reconsider the matter, with a view <Col N="1840" /> to allowing the terms of the salary agreement to operate in regard to these teachers.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the grant of bonus were put forward by the Commissioners of National Education prior to the change of Government but consideration was deferred by the British Treasury on financial grounds.  Since the transfer of functions similar proposals have on two occasions been put forward by the Department of Education which I have felt unable to entertain in view of the increasing demands for expenditure on educational services of a more essential kind which within the resources at our disposal must have preference.  I can see no prospect of my being in a position to take a more favourable view.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether any arrangement has been made with any British assurance company in respect to deductions from civil servants' salaries of premiums on insurance policies; if so, what the nature of the arrangement is, and whether similar facilities have been offered to Irish assurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>No new arrangement of the kind referred to by the Deputy has been made since the establishment of Saorstát Eireann, but an arrangement which was in being at the change of Government with the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company has been continued.  The arrangement provides for the taking out of life insurances with the company mentioned through a body called the Civil Service Insurance Society and quarterly deductions in respect of premiums are made from salary at the request of any civil servant insuring under this scheme and are paid direct to the company's head office.  The question of facilities for deduction of life insurance premiums from salary is one for civil servants themselves to <Col N="1841" /> raise.  I am not aware that there has been any request for an extension of the present arrangement from the representatives of the Civil Service staffs.</P>
      <P>Recently it was proposed by representatives of the Service that where civil servants effected insurances on their lives as security for loans for the purpose of building or purchasing houses for their own occupation arrangements should be made for the deduction quarterly of premiums from salary, and after consideration this proposal was agreed to.  The arrangement is applicable to insurances effected with any insurance company registered in Saorstát Eireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct that these men have been refused reinstatement in the Gárda Síochána.  I am not prepared to make any representations on the subject to the Chief Commissioner.  With regard to the third part of the question, the Deputy is, no doubt, aware that a time limit of three months, within which reinstatement might be effected, was fixed by Section 3 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923.  That limit has long since lapsed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I think these questions had better be addressed to the Minister for Justice.  I may say that Sheedy resigned voluntarily in July, 1918, and the reason he gave was that &ldquo;I consider the present rate of pay is insufficient to purchase the necessary requirements of life.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>But these two men, O'Neill and Sheedy, were dismissed from the D.M.P. in 1914.  They were afterwards reinstated and resigned in 1918.  As regards the reason given by Sheedy, as mentioned by the Minister, is it not a fact that both men took an active part in the subsequent struggle in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by me on <Col N="1856" /> 12th August last to a similar question by Deputy Baxter on this subject.</P>
      <P>The reply was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The funds voted for special live stock and other schemes for the statutory congested districts cannot be applied to County Cavan, which is not a scheduled congested area.  The live stock schemes in County Cavan are administered through the Co. Committee of Agriculture, and under these schemes developments have taken place in the last few years. For example, the number of premium bulls in the county in 1925 and 1926 were, respectively, 22 and 28, while this year the number is 36. The number of premium boars was similarly increased from 17 to 35, respectively, in 1925 and 1926 to 39 this season.  I understand that the Co. Committee of Agriculture are initiating a sheep-breeding scheme this year, and it is probable that a number of rams will be located in the poorer areas.  The needs of farmers in County Cavan can be adequately met by a further extension of the existing schemes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. SMITH Mr. SMITH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SMITH</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that the conditions in this area are of such a nature as demand more consideration from his Department, and will he be prepared to send an inspector to examine the conditions there, and compare them with the conditions in the areas that are referred to as congested?  I might add that the scheme of the County Cavan Co. Committee of Agriculture is not availed of in the area to which I refer as regards premium bulls, and cannot be availed of by these poor people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to draw the line and say that such is a congested district and that on the other side there is a different class of land and people from the point of view of prosperity.  It would be impossible to draw a line which would be satisfactory. The fact is that schemes are being availed of, as the figures show.  In the case of bulls the number has increased from 22 to 36 in three years.  I think they have increased further this year. That is as between 1925 and 1928. There was a big increase also between 1922 and 1925.  So that from 1922 the <Col N="1857" /> number of bulls in that district has been steadily increasing.  The same applies in a greater degree to the boars. So that obviously the present schemes are being taken full advantage of. There may be special districts where the people are extremely poor, but as regards the district mentioned they were offered two bulls on very easy terms and did not take them.</P>

I should like to say that there is a scheme in existence in Fermanagh, which is on the Border on one side of the area to which I refer, and in Leitrim on the other side, and I think these people are entitled to special consideration from the Department.</P>

There are thousands of such houses in Dublin city and the townships, and if a measure such as I propose, or some such measure, is not made law before June next the occupiers of these houses will be liable to be evicted or have their rents raised very considerably.

    <P>The special inspector, as described in the amendment and as authorised by this Bill, will have duties which will not be restricted in so far as area is concerned but they will be restricted in so far as he will have to attend at the verification and stamping of bottles.  It is agreed that for such duties a special certificate of general training necessary for qualification as an Inspector of Weights and Measures will not be required and that a more limited form of certificate will be sufficient.

I would like if the Minister would give an explanation as to why it is necessary to put in a section of that kind which leaves no option but makes it mandatory that every inspector shall be a member of the Gárda Síochána; whether he considers that he will be able to get a sufficient number of competent inspectors from the Gárda Síochána to do this work; and, further, whether he will be able to release them from their other duties to enable them to take up this duty?</P>

It will also be possible to arrange&mdash;if it be found that all the members of the Gárdaí cannot be released from police duties to do this work which will be intermittent, which will not last for a prolonged period and which will come in a rush&mdash;some method by which additional inspectors can be recruited from the Gárdaí.  It is considered exceptionally desirable that members of the Gárdaí should perform these duties instead of civilian inspectors. The work is intermittent and would not last long in the yearly period. In the normal course one would find if a civilian were appointed that the man appointed after getting some experience, <Col N="1876" /> would have found other work during his idle time and would not be available again when required, whereas the Gárda can return to his ordinary duties and can discharge these duties before being called upon a second time to do the work of a special inspector.</P>
      <P>It is also considered desirable that the people doing this work should not be civilians who would be known, or between whom there might be some associations with factories or with people who had bottles for stamping.  The Gárdaí can keep their distance inasmuch as there is a large number of them and they can be changed from place to place.  They are available when the work arises and on its conclusion they can return to their ordinary duties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> Amendments 2 and 3 go together.  I am bringing forward amendment No. 2, although I am not proposing to press it myself, but inasmuch as I stated on Second Reading that this suggestion had been made by members of the trade who were interested, I agreed that I would bring it forward for discussion here.  Shortly it enables this to be done: in the case of imported bottles those bottles may be verified and stamped at testing places, to be appointed, at the ports.  If it is agreeable to the House, and if they think that this should be done, this amendment will give power to have that done in cases where it seems desirable.  The other side of that is that, of course, the expense of such verification and testing at the ports will have to be met by the fees to be charged for that verification. As far as I can make out the fees that would be charged would be prohibitive, and it would mean very definitely that nobody would avail of the provision.  I do not think the provision would be of any use.  I may say in addition that it is within my power, within the Weights and Measures Act, to allow stamping and verification to be done on traders' premises, and once we get rid of the rush that there is at the moment with regard to stamping of these bottles, it will be possible to have that arranged for.  I do not think this provision will be of any benefit to traders.  I do not think it is even desirable that it should be given even if it were going to be of any benefit.  If traders insist that they are going to be inconvenienced, so far as the inconvenience is concerned, but not the cost, it can be lessened by enabling the duties to be carried out on traders' premises.  I said I would bring forward these amendments for discussion, but I do not support them myself.  I leave them to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is done at selected places.  The bottles can be stamped on the traders' premises.  It is hard to state what is the absolute practice.  The stamping of bottles has arisen under the Standard Bottles <Col N="1878" /> Order.  Since the Standard Bottles Order came out a very big proportion of the bottles in use in the country and a very big proportion of the wastage have been supplied by the glass bottles factory, where the bottles are stamped on the spot.  With regard to others, we are making special arrangements to cope with the number of bottles in use about which we had made special regulations.  One can hardly say that there is a definite practice.  Rather I can say that there is a practice, but one cannot say that that will continue for all time.  The matter will have to be regularised.  I have been asked to make arrangements to send hand-blast machines to certain traders' premises when stocks are coming in so that the bottles might be stamped there.  I will agree to that if certain things happen, but at the moment we are trying to cope with the big number of bottles not stamped or designated in any way. We are making arrangements to deal with the matter, but one can hardly say that there is a set practice.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that the proper place to stamp bottles, either imported or home-manufactured, would be on the traders' premises.  I think that would meet traders' wishes, and that every facility <Col N="1879" /> would be given by them to get these bottles stamped on the premises.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy realises that it is within my power to enable the stamping and verification to be done on the traders' premises, but there are certain conditions to be looked to.  I think the Deputy is right in assuming that the charges would be exorbitant for stamping at the ports, but the passing of the amendment does not ensure that testing places would be established at the ports.  It only gives the Minister power to have these established.  I think it may be assumed that there would be no testing places at the ports unless there was a guarantee of a reasonable supply of bottles coming in at certain intervals and an assurance that the fees charged would be made to meet the expense.  I do not think the amendment would do the least injury to the glass bottle factory, but I do not suggest that the House should pass it.</P>

Under that fund bonuses were paid.  It is now proposed to follow the same procedure in connection with the special inspectors employed on the testing of bottles in factories. Under the Bill it was previously suggested that these funds should be paid into the Exchequer.  It is now proposed that portion should be paid into the Gárda Síochána Fund <Col N="1881" /> with the object of enabling these inspectors who are in the factories to be paid small bonuses out of the reward fund for the work they do in connection with weights and measures.</P>

      <P>6.  Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where a measuring instrument which has been used for trade before the 1st day of January, 1928, is, by reason only of the material or principle of construction thereof, incapable of being stamped as required <Col N="1882" /> by this section the Minister may, if he thinks fit and subject to such (if any) alteration being made in the construction of such measuring instrument as he may think proper to require, grant and at any time revoke in respect of such measuring instrument a licence authorising the person named therein to use such measuring instrument for trade during such period and subject to such conditions as the Minister may think proper to specify in such licence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>7.  In sub-section (2), page 5, lines 18 and 19, to delete the words &ldquo;not stamped as required by this section&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;required by this section to be stamped which is not so stamped.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendments 5, 6 and 7 really go together.  No. 6 is the important one. I mentioned, on the second reading, that there were certain petrol pumps which, as they are in the country at the moment, could not be granted certificates and that it was proposed to advert to the fact that there is a very big number of this type of measuring instrument at the moment which was bought in good faith as the regulations allowed.  We propose to take powers to grant a licence to those who cannot either immediately get a certificate or whose machines cannot be so improved and adjusted as to enable them hereafter to get a certificate.  That is the aim of amendment 6.  The amendment, as Deputies will notice, allows for the granting of a licence if the Minister thinks fit and subject to such alterations being made in the construction of such measuring instruments as it may be thought proper to require, and a licence when granted may be revoked at any time.  The licence will have certain conditions attached and be revocable after a limited period.  I think it is a reasonable amendment in consideration of the number of instruments that have been bona fide brought into the country before the regulations were thought of. If the House considers the amendment should pass then amendment 5 is consequential because as it stands sub-section 1 of Section 11 reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every measuring instrument used for trade shall be verified and stamped.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the principle explained in the next <Col N="1883" /> amendment is admitted then one has to make a consequential amendment in this sub-section so that it will read: &ldquo;Every measuring instrument used for trade shall (unless it is the subject of a licence granted under this section and for the time being in force) be verified and stamped.&rdquo;  That is to fit in with the next amendment, but the substantial point is, is amendment 6 accepted? Amendment 5 is a minor point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree that a certain period should be allowed during which petrol pumps that cannot be stamped as required by this Act should be allowed to operate with a special licence, but we think that that period should not be of any great duration and that perhaps one year would be long enough to allow for it.  We would like to see in the amendment proposed by the Minister words to the effect that a licence authorising the person named therein to use such measuring instruments for trade during such period not being longer than one year, and certainly not being longer than two years at the most.  The fact is a number of these pumps are inaccurate and the principle of their construction is such that the customer can have no means of knowing that he is getting the full measure he is being offered.  We think that the hardship that would be inflicted upon the traders concerned is not likely to be very great.  The oil companies whose interests are affected are likely to see their traders are not impeded in selling their goods, and consequently we think that a definite period, not exceeding one year or in or about a year, should be the utmost limit during which these temporary licences should be granted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have a very big difficulty in accepting such a limitation as is suggested by the Deputy, namely, one year.  Incidental to his argument, he referred to the oil companies.  The big majority are not supplied by the companies to traders, who bought them bona fide believing that they would be accepted.  One must advert to that.  Supposing there is an instrument of this type, fairly costly, it may be easy to have such adjustments made.  I have been told at the moment <Col N="1884" /> the numbers are estimated at from 25 to 30.  There may be others one may give a licence to.  One must take into consideration the ordinary life of these measuring instruments.  Certainly a year would not see the end of the usefulness of any single type of measuring instrument I know of, and I think it is unfair to have such a limitation put. Remember, it is bound to get known that such instruments are working, and there will be an incentive to the trader to have a change made, because there will be a recognition in the public mind of a particular type of instrument which is certified as giving a proper measure and others that are licensed. People who are concerned want to get full value.  Traders may find that they are not getting the same custom from the instrument which is merely licensed as against those certified.  I think there is an incentive by reason of that fact to get rid of those machines which are merely licensed and substitute for them instruments enabled to get a certificate. At any rate, my Department has the duty of seeing that the public is protected in so far as this gives protection. As to the period, it has a duty to see that these instruments which are licensed shall not remain in use any longer than is absolutely necessary.  I would not recommend the House to accept any such limitation as a year.  A suggestion of this kind would require further examination, so that one could see what state these instruments are in, how many are new, what the average length of life would be, and so on.  I think that unless you have that examination made it would cost a great amount of trouble. It would be impossible to state an overriding period of years to which no exception could be taken.  I think it would be better to leave it to the Department to use its judgment as to when the licence should be revoked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the number examined at a particular period, I have made as exhaustive an inquiry as could be made.  There were 1,392 petrol pumps which were owned by traders. <Col N="1885" /> I am excepting altogether those on the premises of commercial firms and not in use for trade.  We have no need to go into those.  Between those which are covered by a certificate or which could be altered to conform to a certificate, the number would amount to 825.  There are a certain number outstanding, being examined for a certificate amounting to 44, and the remainder 523 is, as far as we could arrive at it at the moment, the number of those that could be used only under licence.  That is, 523 out of 1,392.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to these proprietary pumps, I think the Minister ought to make further inquiries. Probably 49 out of 50 of these are selling spirit; in many cases they are doing more trade than the public pump.  I think it will mean a great deal of work for the Gárda, if they are to watch these traders and see that they do not sell spirit, unless they have the new type of pump.  If the Minister thinks that these are merely for the purposes of the owner I think he is making a very big mistake.  He will find, if inquiries are made, that every one of them is selling spirit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In ordinary circumstances it is a matter of the use of them.  There is a definition of &ldquo;in use for trading purposes&rdquo;; there is a particular statement that has been interpreted in a particular way.  It is simply a matter of finding out the circumstances. There will be no difficulty in fitting the interpretation to the facts.  I am only giving the number of 400 as an estimate, because, naturally, <Col N="1886" /> as they do not come under authority and under investigation in the sense that these others do, it must be an estimate. There is no necessity for an amendment to the Act with regard to these.  There are statutory obligations with regard to pumps.  If the pumps are in use for trade, then they suffer from all the impact of the Weights and Measures code.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Selling to the public means that it is being used for trading purposes.  It is then a question of whether the instrument is covered by a certain code or is adjusted so as to be covered by a certificate, or whether it gets a licence.  If it does not come within any of these three heads, then it is illegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if a member of the Civic Guard detected a trader owning one of these pumps selling spirit to the public, his pump would immediately come within the Act.  He would have to get either a certificate or a licence, or the pump would be put out of use altogether.</P>

      <P>I would like that the Minister would state what would be the period during which he thinks a licence should extend in the case of a new pump, how long it should be allowed to operate, presuming the pump remains in fairly good order. One of the complaints we hear fairly frequently is that traders sell inferior spirit through the medium of these pumps, although charging the price of the best spirit.  It is one of the forms of fraud that we would like to see made as nearly as impossible as can be done by legislation.  If the making of inquiries prior to granting a certificate under this Act establishes the fact that that practice would continue, then we think that a special licence <Col N="1887" /> for pumps which cannot be brought under the Act should be for the shortest possible period.  I would like the Minister to state if an overriding period is suggested what period he would be prepared to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that question immediately.  At one time I had these pumps divided into particular types from which one might arrive at a judgment as to the maximum period to be allowed.  I have not the information here.  It would require a thorough-going examination before a statement could be made.  An amendment which would fix the maximum period of years would give too long a life to some of these pumps.  I think it is better to leave it to the officials of the Department from time to time to revoke licences as they think justice or equity has not been done to the people concerned.</P>
      <P>The quality of the spirit is not dealt with under this Bill; it is a matter for another type of legislation.  This Bill is only in regard to weights and measures, only in regard to getting proper weight or proper quantities. The question of quality would be made a matter for legislation to ensure that only particular types of spirit will be sold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how often an inspection of these pumps will be carried out?  As I understand the position, it will be the duty of the local authority, through its inspectors, to have these pumps inspected from time to time with regard to weights and measures.  I think there is a definite period within which these inspections must take place.  Would some such provision apply to pumps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  For the purpose of this amendment, really what would happen would be an original inspection to discriminate into the three classes&mdash;those to be granted certificates; those which may be adjusted so as to get certificates, and those which can be given licences. After they are either certificated or licensed, the system of inspection will be surprise visits from time to time to see if things are in order.  There is no <Col N="1888" /> obligation to make so many visits within a certain period of time.  It is far better to have surprise visits at irregular periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not yet convinced that you could not put in a definite period of time during which these licences are to operate.  The fact is that few traders own their pumps; they buy them from the oil companies and pay for them by instalments, very often by a small increase in the price of petrol.  But they are nominally the property of the oil companies.  I believe if a definite period were stated&mdash; one or two years at the end of which only pumps that could be approved would be allowed for the sale of spirits in this country&mdash;that the oil companies themselves would do as they have done in the past, facilitate traders in getting a new type of pump.  Then you would have a standardised type of pump that would insure to the ordinary customer that he was getting value for his money.  That would be no hardship whatsoever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Deputy that he should allow this amendment to pass and that he himself would draft an amendment for the Report Stage to fix a period.  It would give us something to discuss.  Meantime, I would have the particular case examined as to the maximum period of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>If the certificate in the first instance only gives that scale as a <Col N="1889" /> year, and that it must be re-examined after that period, why should we not have something the same applying to the pump?  That is to say, that the certificate would only apply for a certain period and that it must be retested before a further certificate would be issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a different point.  The idea of Deputy Lemass is that one should here establish by law that petrol pumps, not certificated, to be licensed, should not be allowed to remain in the country or operate under this for a longer period than he suggests&mdash;say one year.  He might say five years.  What Deputy Good is at is that scales have to be tested once a year.  As against the overriding maximum of five years such as Deputy Lemass wants to insist on, we have Deputy Good's idea that there should be a yearly inspection; they are two different ideas.  The amendment has nothing to do with the second.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HASLETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, suppose that a machine has been installed recently, a limit of a year would be a hardship in that case.  There are throughout the country small traders selling limited quantities of petrol, and they have installed these pumps.  There would be a lot of hardship inflicted on them by this section.  I think if the matter were left not quite so definite as that the period of the usefulness of a machine would be apparent to those who inspected it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 11, I want to say, arising out of Deputy Good's remarks re the periodic inspection of machines, that we have received complaints that the inspectors of <Col N="1890" /> weights and scales usually associate with themselves an individual who does the actual repairs or alterations that are necessary to the weights or scales so as to make them accurate. The complaint we receive is that this workman who accompanies the inspector generally charges much more than the traders consider fair, or more than he should actually charge.  That matter perhaps does not arise now, but I was wondering if some scale of charges could not be devised which would prevent traders being mulcted in this manner.  As a rule, there is only one person in the place capable of doing this work, and the trader whose weights and scales are being tested has no option but to employ this person, who charges whatever he likes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been one complaint made in five years as to overcharging for repairs of weights and scales.  That complaint was justified&mdash;there was only one single complaint in five years.  Traders have always their remedy: that they can get the adjustment made by somebody that they can hire themselves or they can do the work themselves.  Whatever little bit of metal is to be put on, the trader can hire anybody he likes to put it on so long as it is done in a way to satisfy the inspector.  The trader can get that done himself.  If the Deputy has any of those complaints I would like to have a note of them, because I would look into the question and see what could be done about them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterDeLoughry" hpid="Mr. DE LOUGHREY Mr. DE LOUGHREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE LOUGHREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with what Deputy Lemass has said. Complaints of the nature he has mentioned are very general, and I am very glad he has raised the point.  The inspector generally employs some local handymen who do the adjustments to the weights and scales.  I know that in most cases there is a protest against these exorbitant charges.  It is all very fine to say that there has been only one complaint from the traders in the course of five years.  That only means that the traders have not sent on their complaints to the Government.  I can assure the Minister that the complaint is general.  It would be necessary for the Minister or his Department to look <Col N="1891" /> into that question and see whether there could be a scale of charges drawn up, or it could be made quite clear to the traders that they would be quite free to get these adjustments done themselves.  Traders do not realise that they can get these repairs or adjustments made themselves.  The scales and weights are, generally, taken to the local depot, and they are adjusted, payment being demanded and an unreasonable bill produced for the work done.  Generally, the first the trader knows about the work being done is when he is presented with a bill.  Complaint on that matter is widespread.</P>

      <P>In Galway we have workmen quite competent to do that sort of work, but somehow or other it was managed that a gentleman was imported from Dublin to do it. Actually for the repairing of some machines in Galway a bill was sent in greater than the original cost of the machines.  There was a dispute between the Urban Council in Galway and a firm here in Dublin who did some repairs. The firm sent in a bill for £133 odd.  The Department of Local Government here recommended the Urban Council to pay £60 or £70 to the firm, but, in my opinion, the £60 or £70 is too much.  This work should be open to anyone who employs a fitter, or who has a man of his own able to do it, and the thing should not have been done as it was.  There has been an awful lot of robbery through the country in the matter of over-charging for repairs to weighbridges and these other machines.</P>

With reference to the suggestion made by the Minister, that the traders should employ their own man, I only know of one instance in my district where that has been done, but the person concerned is in a very big way.

It would be against the spirit and the principle suggested in the Food Prices Tribunal&mdash;that is, with regard to the licensing of traders, if there was to be no discrimination between them.  It would be rather an injustice.  At present a great number of people are making their living by the sale of motor spirit and motor accessories generally, and they have a big grievance against the people who have no premises and have a lorry and a pump installed.  These latter are competing against the regular trader.  I would like to know if there would be any discrimination between these two classes of people.  It is a new thing; it savours of what has been called monopoly up to the present.  According to the principle in the report of the Food Prices Tribunal there would be nothing wrong about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore has mentioned a new point.  I have not specially considered that.  The action he desires to have taken could be taken under the amendment, because the licence is granted &ldquo;on such terms as may be considered fit and proper.&rdquo;  I am not prepared to say that the point has been considered about discrimination being made.  Discrimination will have to be made, I think, by classes; you could not do it for one individual as against another.  The matter of discrimination between classes can be considered at a later time.  There seems to be a lot of complaints, according to what Deputies mention, but I cannot act on complaints that are all through the country with regard to what Deputy de Loughrey calls exorbitant charges.  I must have some details as to the charges that are considered exorbitant and, since they seem to be going round, I would like to have some of them placed in my office rather than have them lodged with people who are not able to take action with regard to remedying whatever is wrong.  I cannot see how the suggestion of a scale of charges is going to work out.  It will have to be a very elaborate scale to deal with the different types of repairs to <Col N="1893" /> machines.  Let us have a specific case of complaint; let this be examined and see how the thing works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>My object was to ensure that we would not be getting similar complaints in connection with alterations to petrol pumps to enable them to get a licence.  The fact is that it is not generally known that a trader can get alterations done by any person he wishes.  Usually the inspector sees that only his nominee will get the job. I agree that it would be very difficult to get a scale of charges to cover all possible repairs.  If it was generally known that traders could get these repairs done by any person they liked, or do the repairs themselves if the inspector was satisfied, it would have a good effect amongst the people who now complain. Perhaps an instruction could be sent to the inspectors so that when ordering repairs to be made they could convey the information to the shopkeeper that he could get the repairs done by anybody he likes.  Anyhow, now that this measure is coming into operation, provision will be made so that we will not have similar complaints with regard to petrol pumps.</P>

      <P>The Minister has referred to the desirability of having specific complaints made.  In order to make the matter more to the point, I will give the Minister an instance of what occurred in Galway.  I have it on the best of authority that the gentleman who accompanied the Guards recently when they were inspecting weights and measures was from Dublin &mdash;from W. and T. Averys.  There was wholesale condemnation of the scales in Galway, and orders were issued that new ones should be purchased.  The people expressed great surprise that <Col N="1894" /> these scales and weights should be condemned by the Guards while they were in such good repair some few years ago when the Royal Irish Constabulary inspected them.  The people seemed to think rather fishy things about the whole transaction, particularly when Averys' man came down and when there was such a lot of scales declared to be out of order and new ones were declared necessary.  By a remarkable coincidence the new ones were purchased from Averys.</P>

      <P>It seems that the trouble was that these machines should have been condemned three or four years before that; but then we had no inspection, and perhaps as the machines were not condemned before that the traders could very well afford to buy new ones.</P>

      <P>It is well to mention that machines now cost about three times what they did cost in pre-war days, and I suppose they put up the cost of repairing in proportion.  It is quite a simple matter to repair machines, and there are plenty of men who can do it.  As regards the ordinary weighing machines, it is quite a simple matter to put them in order.  In the country the people do not know what the cost should be, and they are salted properly.  I do not know whether the people in Galway were compelled to get new machines or not, but I know that in some cases they were obliged to get new scales.</P>

    <P>It was proposed in Section 19 to delete a certain portion of the Principal Act by taking out &ldquo;Justices of the Petty Sessions&rdquo; and inserting instead the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The old Act did appear to give dual control in certain cases, partly with the police and partly with the Justices of Petty Sessions.  I propose to remove &ldquo;Justices of Sessions&rdquo; as they no longer exist, and substitute them by myself.  It has been put to me that the transfer to myself of the direction of inspectors, as provided in the Bill in its amended form, might interfere with the disciplinary control of these particular members of the Gárdaí.  It is not intended that there should be any interference, and I am deleting Section 19 and amending it in a particular <Col N="1896" /> way.

I have to ask the House to take my word for it that the original section was practically worthless.  The old Justices of Petty Sessions no longer exist, and this power is no longer necessary.

      <P>Before Section 21 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In the definition of the expression &ldquo;county&rdquo; contained in the part of the Fourth Schedule to the Principal Act headed &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; the word &ldquo;riding&rdquo; shall be construed as referring only to a riding which is an administrative county and the said Schedule shall have effect accordingly.</P>

    <P>This is much worse than Section 19. In so far as amendment by reference <Col N="1897" /> goes, this is a very in-and-out and cross-type of reference indeed.  The point is a simple one.  The old Act comes to this: where you had two ridings in a county, but only one county council, that county council was bound to provide a set of local standards for each riding.  The only county actually affected&mdash;the only county that is going to be cleared up by this section&mdash;is Galway, where there are two ridings and only one county council.  In that case we consider it fair that there should be only one set of local standards provided.  Where in other cases there are two ridings and two county councils, then the local authority for each riding will have to provide a set of standards for each area.</P>

As well as removing a large number of small houses from the operations of the Bill, this amendment would increase the difficulty of finding the owners of a certain number of others.

      <P>This is for the purpose of making clear under the operation of the Bill the position with regard to houses affected by the Land Acts.  Under the Land Act of 1923 you have houses on holdings which fall into a certain number of classes.  In the first place, you may have land vested in the Land Commission and re-vested by the Land Commission in the tenants.  The position there is clear.  In the second place you may have land vested in the Land Commission, but held by the Land Commission without re-vesting pending rearrangement. It is necessary, in order to establish the ownership there, that this amendment be inserted.  In the third place, you may have land as to which an application has been made, either by the tenant or the landlord, to have it dealt with under the Land Act, but as to which the Land Commission has not taken any steps.  You may also have land to which the Land Act may apply, but as to which there might easily be a doubt.  The effect of the amendment will be that where it is clear that the land comes under the Land Act, the occupier will be responsible for the payment of the rates, and where it is not so clear, then the owner of the land will be responsible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, on the application of the council of a county or other borough by order extend the limit of valuation of small dwellings under this Act from six pounds to such greater sum not exceeding twelve pounds as he shall think fit and may, <Col N="1901" /> if he so thinks fit, on the application of such council by order at any time revoke such order.</P>
    <P>(2)  So long as an order under this section is in force in respect of a county or other borough the expression &ldquo;small dwelling&rdquo; in this Act shall mean in relation to such borough a hereditament or tenement separately valued under the Valuation Acts whereof the valuation under those Acts does not exceed the sum fixed in that behalf by such order and the whole or any part of which is actually used or is adapted for use as a dwelling.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every order made under this section shall be published forthwith in two newspapers circulating in the county or other borough to which such order relates or in two separate issues of one newspaper so circulating.</P>
    <P>This is the amendment which meets the point raised by Deputy Doyle.  There are certain local rates, like the borough rate in Dublin, and certain other rates, which fall on the owner, as distinct from the occupier.  In the case of Dublin, the borough rate falls on the owner of a house of £8 valuation and under.  If there was not power in connection with a borough, such as Dublin, to change the amount slightly, we would have this position in Dublin, that all rates on a house of £6 valuation and under would be paid by the owner, that the poor rate on a house between £6 and £8 valuation would be payable by the occupier, whereas the borough rate and some other local rates would be payable by the owner.  When it is taken into consideration that property in a borough is usually more highly valued, because of its position, than property in the country, the raising of the amount in a borough, in order to suit local circumstances and local legislation, does not involve any hardship on anyone.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <P>(2)  Whenever a rate is made by virtue of this section on the owner of a small dwelling and the name of such owner is not fully known or is not known at all to the rating authority by whom such rate is made, such owner may be described in such rate by the words &ldquo;the owner&rdquo; without any name or addition.</P>
    <P>(3)  A rate made by virtue of this section on the owner of a small dwelling shall not be invalidated by any error or defect in the statement of the name of such owner or by the use of the description &ldquo;the owner&rdquo; without any name or addition, and every such rate shall be recoverable from such owner notwithstanding such error or defect or the use of such description.</P>
    <P>(4)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other Act, every rate made by virtue of this section on the owner of a small dwelling shall be payable by such owner and on his default by any subsequent owner of such small dwelling from whom such rate is demanded and by no other person.</P>
    <P>(5)  Every rate made by virtue of this section on the owner of a small dwelling may be recovered from such owner or a subsequent owner liable to pay the same by all or any of the remedies (except distraint on the goods of a person other than such owner or subsequent owner) by which such rate could be recovered from the occupier or a subsequent occupier respectively of such dwelling if such rate had been made on such occupier and this Act had not been passed and, in the case of a rate which when made on an occupier is not recoverable from a subsequent occupier, may be recovered from a subsequent owner liable to pay the same by all or any of the remedies (except as before excepted) by which poor-rate made on an occupier is recoverable from a subsequent occupier.</P>
    <P>(6)  It shall not be lawful for a rating authority to commence any <Col N="1903" /> proceedings for the recovery from a subsequent owner of a rate made by virtue of this section on the owner of a small dwelling after the expiration of two years from the making of such rate.</P>

      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory and no words of mine are necessary to enforce its meaning.  If the owner is away, the owner cannot be got at. Then the tenant can pay the rates and deduct the amount from his rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is really unnecessary and it is undesirable in view of the intention of the Bill.  In the first place if Deputy O'Kelly will refer to Section 1 where the owner is defined he will see that the owner means either the person for the time being receiving whether on account as agent or trustee for another the rack rent of the small dwelling.  So that the agent acting for an absentee landlord is the owner within the term of this Bill as within the term of some of the other Public Health Acts so that in so far as there is a possibility that the owner may be inaccessible there is not that particular possibility and you have the ordinary machinery of the law to get at the agent or the owner.  The whole intention of the Bill is to remove from the occupier of the small house completely any responsibility for the payment of the rates and to saddle the owner completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion contained in the amendment came under discussion in connection with the original drafting of the Bill and it was made quite clear from very mature consideration that it gave an opening for prejudicing the whole intention of the Bill.  The owner <Col N="1904" /> is to be completely saddled with responsibility under this particular Bill and in so far as there is thought to be any danger of him evading it, the description of owner in Section 1 completely meets any danger that Deputy O'Kelly anticipates in the matter.</P>

      <P>I do not know that it is as clear as the Minister says from Section 1 or any other section that the occupying tenant could not be made, in certain circumstances, liable.  If that be definite and clear that in case the owner did not pay the occupier would not be liable or if he were liable that he should be free to deduct from his next rent the amount he paid in rates I would be quite satisfied to withdraw the amendment.  I have one case in my mind and I know that those who suggested this amendment to me had others where there is not an agent in the country and where the owner of the property lives abroad and would not be easily got at by any authority or by the Government for the payment of rates. It was in such a case as that to safeguard the interests of the tenants and occupiers that I suggested this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>On this particular point the Minister states that he is anxious to put the liability on the owner.  In introducing this Bill, I think he made it clear that he was only putting the liability upon the owner with the object of the convenience of the tenants. We quite understand that for the occupiers of those small houses it is very inconvenient in many cases to be called upon to pay what is, for them, a considerable sum at periods of, say, six months, and that it would be very much easier, from their point of view, to pay it in weekly payments.  Therefore we are conveniencing the tenants in putting this obligation upon the owners. But I want it to be made clear that in doing that we are not going to take from the tenant his liability to pay his proportion of the rates.  We want it kept separate and distinct from the amount of the rent.  The reason of that is this: That we want to get a proper civic spirit in this country.  We want to cast on every tenant, no matter how small the liability, the duty to pay his <Col N="1905" /> proportion of the particular rate either to the urban or the borough council in his particular area.  I am particularly anxious that these two things should be kept separate for that reason that we may have, what we have not up to the present and what we had not in the past, a proper civic spirit in this country.  I would press upon the Minister in going as far as he has done, in throwing this liability upon the landlord in order to convenience the tenant, that, at the same time, he should keep clear in this Bill the liability for rates as separate and distinct from the liability for rent.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Kelly, Section 3 (1) of the Bill says that: &ldquo;Every rate to which this Act applies made in respect of small dwellings shall be made on the owner of such dwelling, and save where the owner is also the occupier no such rate shall be made on the occupier of such dwelling.&rdquo;  That makes it quite clear that the Bill relieves the occupier of the legal responsibility of paying the rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a difficulty about finding the owner the ordinary legal proceedings are available.  The rent can be garnasheed in respect of the rates, so that the suggested difficulty does not arise at all.  In reply to Deputy Good, I think we made it quite clear that one of the principles we wanted to safeguard was that the ordinary individual would shoulder his burden for the rates and would not escape that burden, and under Section 4, sub-sections (1) and (3)  he is pinned down to the actual bearing of that burden, while the owner is made legally responsible for the paying of the rates.  But the owner cannot enter into a contract to shoulder the burden of these rates himself.  The Bill here makes any such contract null and void.  The owner is legally responsible for paying the rates, but he is legally responsible also for passing on, in the way of addition to the rent, the amount of the rates to the individual occupier.  I think it is well that it would be understood that this Act is not only for the purpose of conveniencing the tenants, but it is also for the purpose of the general convenience of both the public as a <Col N="1906" /> whole, and the public bodies, who will undoubtedly have a better rate collection.</P>

      <P>With reference to the point raised by Deputy Good, a case was put before me.  My informant said he never could collect more than 70 or 80 per cent. of his rent.  What is the position there?  The tenants are generally written off by the council as persons with no effects and that no rates can be collected from them, so that the occupying landlord will not only lose his rent but also his rates.  Is there any remedy for that?</P>

      <P>If there are landlords who, with the powers they already possess, are not able to collect their rents, I do not think we can deal with that under this particular Bill. The relative importance of the rates as compared with rents does not warrant that we would avoid dealing in the most systematic way possible with a definite public problem simply because there may be landlords who do not collect their rents.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy means that a person could occupy a house without paying rent.  If the house is occupied the sub-section does not operate.  The amendment is not acceptable, because the sub-section is intended to prevent the landlord getting a refund on rates where the house is not occupied but where he has actually been paid the rent.  If a landlord has a bad tenant who deserts his house and leaves it unoccupied, and at the same time does not pay the rent, we think that the landlord ought to be able to have his house regarded as unoccupied for that period.  Under the amendment he would still be held liable for rates.</P>

    <P>That for the purpose of carrying into effect any Act of the present Session making provision for the <Col N="1911" /> formulating and carrying out by County Councils of schemes of Arterial Drainage on a limited scale, it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas in respect of any such drainage scheme of such sum as shall not exceed whichever of the following amounts shall be the lesser:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  one-fourth of the total cost of carrying out such drainage scheme, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the sum of two hundred and fifty pounds.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember when this Bill was first introduced there was no provision in it for any grant out of public funds for the execution of minor drainage schemes.  The Bill was then withdrawn, and it was re-introduced with the provision giving grants of 20 per cent.  In the House, a number of Deputies from all parties suggested that the grant should be increased. What I propose in this resolution makes it possible to amend the Bill so as to increase the grant from 20 to 25 per cent. When the Bill was first being drafted it was thought that no provision for State grants should be made.  I believe that the attitude then taken up was quite justifiable, because these minor drainage schemes might be compared to the main drainage schemes just as works on some boreens would be compared to works on trunk roads.  Such schemes have no effect on public health, or the amenities of residence in any district. They are of benefit only to the occupiers of the land that will be improved. They will cost a limit of £1,000; the average cost will not probably be much more than £500, because the schemes that will be carried out under this Bill will generally cost only £100 or £200.  As I say, the average may be about £600.  The work will probably be carried out by and the wages paid to the owners, or their sons, of lands which will be benefited.  Having regard to the fact that nobody will get benefit out of the schemes except those whose lands will be drained, we should expect that in addition to the paid labour some of them should give a little unpaid labour if it is necessary to carry out schemes <Col N="1912" /> without the necessity of grants from either the State or local funds.  I would like to point out that smaller schemes are much cheaper per acre improved than large schemes.  Under the old Act a great number of schemes were carried out.</P>
    <P>I will give some figures in connection with it.  The Act is Vic. 5 and 6, Chapter 89.  There were five cases in which the expenditure was over £70,000 and in those cases the cost per acre improved was £8 7s. 10d.  There were 20 cases in which the expenditure was between £20,000 and £70,000, and the cost per acre improved was £7 16s. 9d. There were 31 cases in which the expenditure was over £5,000 and under £20,000 and the cost per acre improved was £5 4s. 8d.  There were 63 cases in which the expenditure was under £5,000, including 25 under £1,000.  In those 63 cases the cost per acre improved was £3 18s. 5d.  As the schemes decreased in size, they became progressively cheaper per acre improved.  The biggest cost was £8 7s. 10d. per acre improved. The next was £7 16s. 9d.; the next £5 4s. 8d. and the lowest was £3 18s. 5d. We and the Board of Works, who have experience of it, believe that a great number of these small cases will, even if there is no unpaid labour, be economic without a grant at all but we felt that we had to simplify the procedure under this Act.  We decided to dispense with the sending of plans to the Board of Works and a scrutiny by the Board of Works.  We decided to dispense with any inspection by the Board of Works engineers and we came to the conclusion that when a grant was necessary, as it appeared to be necessary to make the County Councils take action, and to induce people to go ahead with schemes, we would simply have to give a small flat grant.  We suggested 20 per cent. In some cases 20 per cent. would not be quite enough unless there was some unpaid labour, which there should be, but in a great many cases the 20 per cent. would be entirely unnecessary.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact, however, that under the 1924-5 Act and of the Drainage Maintenance Act of 1924, State grants are being given, we felt that people would not proceed under the Act if no grants were given.  Consequently <Col N="1913" /> we felt that some grant must be given or else the whole Act would be inoperative. On the other hand we do feel that this 25 per cent. which is now suggested in the resolution is the very maximum which we would be justified in giving. If the Dáil were not satisfied with the 25 per cent.  I think we would have no alternative to withdrawing the Bill and to reconsidering the whole matter, because as I say, even with the 20 or 25 per cent, we will be giving money to people who do not need it.  We will be draining their land and the improved value of the land will completely pay them for the cost of the work and no other grants will be necessary.  Some other cases may not be as favourable as that.  In any case it is desirable that we should do the economic, or the nearly economic, schemes first and that we should not undertake schemes that do not promise to be economic in any great number at the present time.  I believe that when we have some experience of this Act it will be found that those are the schemes that will, as it were, best repay doing.</P>
    <P>In regard to the bigger schemes the position is somewhat different.  The best of the schemes running up to £5,000 have been done under other Acts long ago, and what remains to be done are schemes doubtfully economic or altogether uneconomic.  There has been no simple machinery like this for doing the small schemes in the past, but I believe that it will be possible to do a great many of the small schemes under this Bill.  As a matter of fact, there are schemes which should be done under this Bill which could be done without any legal machinery at all if the people would co-operate, set to, and do the work themselves.  Deputies will realise, however, that in any country district where portion of a river requires to be drained, and where ten or fifteen people are likely to benefit, there will always be three or four who will decline to do anything. Their neighbours will refuse to go on with the work which would benefit these parties.  What is required is a simple and expeditious method of doing work of that kind, and I think a great deal of it will be done under this Bill.  A great deal of consideration has <Col N="1914" /> been given to this, and I think Deputies ought not to press for a bigger grant.</P>
    <P>If we are going to be asked to give bigger sums we will have to reconsider the matter, and even although it will entail delay and increased overhead charges, we will have to see that the schemes will be scrutinised in some way on behalf of the State, which will be contributing a large part of the expenditure.  I suggest that Deputies should agree to the amount now suggested, and that the Act should be given a trial so that the works which can be done under it may be done.  If a residue remains we can consider the problem of that residue of small works as a somewhat different problem, and we can consider whether, as measures of relief, further provision should not be made.  This Bill will cover the best schemes, the schemes that will pay, and I think more should not be pressed for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Ministry has seen fit to bring forward this motion increasing the amount to be offered for minor schemes under the new Arterial Drainage Act.  The county councils themselves are so burdened at present, their responsibilities are so great, and the economic conditions generally are so unsatisfactory, that, without offering them and also those who are likely to benefit some inducement of this kind of the substantial amount which I admit it is, I am afraid there would be little done in the way of work of this minor kind under the Arterial Drainage Act.  I have been speaking to a number of men who would be affected and whose lands are affected in such a way that they are very seriously considering the possibilities of undertaking schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They admit that it will be difficult to get the county council even when they get agreement amongst themselves. It is not too easy to secure, in a particular neighbourhood, unanimity amongst those likely to be affected, but even where they can secure a great measure of unanimity sufficient to carry the scheme, it will not be always easy to get the county councils and it will be a struggle to get a sufficient number of county councils whose interests will not be affected to agree to put the small <Col N="1915" /> amount of money necessary on the county council rate for this work, so that, unless a substantial inducement is offered, first of all, to the individuals likely to undertake the work and secondly to the county councils the Act is likely, in my opinion at least, to remain dormant.  Therefore I am glad an addition has been made to the sum offered to help the scheme, and I sincerely hope it will have the effect of inducing arterial drainage schemes of a minor kind to be undertaken all over the country.</P>
    <P>I agree too that it is only a proper thing in small schemes of that kind that there should be a good deal of free labour.  Unquestionably a number of small land owners in the country will be the ones chiefly affected and if they want to increase the value of their own holdings where part of their holdings is under water at present they can, for their own advantage, undertake these schemes with the assurance that the county council and the Government will come to their aid to the extent set out in the Bill.  I have heard others with whom I discussed this Bill, farmers and county councillors, whom I asked for an expression of opinion with regard to this Bill, say &ldquo;Have we not too much land already in the country?  We are unable to deal with what we have, but what we do till or make use of we are more out of pocket by it than making profit.&rdquo;  I think that is a fairly common attitude with a number of tenant farmers.  They say &ldquo;We would be throwing good money after bad and wasting money in improving our farms under present conditions.  We must make profitable use of the land.  We have cattle falling in price; we are losing on every crop we are raising.&rdquo; If you go to farmers or county councillors who are mostly members of the farming community, you will not find them enthusiastic in supporting any major or minor schemes under present conditions.  That is the attitude of mind we must now face.  We must induce those afflicted with it to get over that.  They will not improve their own or the country's condition as long as they are in such a pessimistic state of mind.  If this increased grant will help <Col N="1916" /> them to get over that and help them to get other schemes of this kind for their improvement and the country generally I would welcome it.</P>

      <P>That is to say this affects the financial aspect of the grant in the Bill.  Speaking for Cavan, I have definite instructions from the Cavan County Council to oppose this Bill unless the grant is increased 50 per cent.  Already under the 1925 Act, the Cavan County Council has presented 96 schemes. They went to a great deal of trouble and a great deal of expense in getting these 96 schemes prepared.  These are in the hands of the Board of Works, and it now appears that of those 96 some 58 are already in reserve as schemes that they will not allow the County Council to proceed with under the 1925 Act.  They are holding them over until this new Act, which gives a very much less grant, is to be brought into operation.  I may tell you that the feeling down there is that this minor drainage scheme Act is purely for the purpose of drawing a red herring across the 1925 Act and is practically in both cases inoperative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is the feeling.  If the 1925 Act is long in operation, so far as the County Cavan is concerned, not one penny has been spent on a drainage scheme under that Act, and some of the schemes have been in for months, if not for years.  The County Council have tested this question and find that the ratepayers will not stand for schemes which only, according to the Act, was one-fifth, now increased to one-fourth, where the 1925 Act gave something like 38? per cent., which is nearer to two-fifths. Even with that, they find it very difficult to finance the schemes.  There is no question about it.  It has been said that the smaller the schemes the less the <Col N="1917" /> expense, but the Minister for Finance was dealing with schemes beginning at £70,000 down to £20,000, then going to £5,000 and under £5,000.  We are now dealing with much smaller schemes. Take Cavan.  It is a county with small holdings.  You have average valuations under £10.  It is a poor county. It is, perhaps, the most waterlogged in Ireland.  That is not due to want of industry on behalf of the farmer.  Certain difficulties present themselves where you have a number of small holdings.  It is difficult to get agreement amongst neighbours as to who should do this side of the drain and who should do the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of drainage has been done under that Act.  The fact that there were 96 schemes for County Cavan shows that they have been energetic in the matter of promoting schemes.  Even for the purposes of the main drainage schemes it is necessary that the smaller watercourses be cleared up.  The main drainage schemes are of little use if the smaller arteries are not cleared.  There are difficulties in the way of the farmers of Cavan.  They are willing to pay the cost of the reclamation of this land through drainage, but they cannot bear the rate.  The difference, I calculate, between the cost of the 1925 Act and the cost of the proposed new Act would be relatively for every £100 7 per cent. In one case you get what is equivalent to £100, whereas you only get £70 under this Bill.  The county council found it difficult to get their schemes through when they were prepared to put some of the larger ones through.  They will not go on with some of the smaller schemes if they are all brought under this Act, when the grant will be only one-quarter.  I think the Minister should reconsider this question; he should withdraw this motion and leave the question of the grant to be discussed by the House when dealing with the Bill.  He could get opinions from representatives of the counties which will be affected by the Act, and I am perfectly certain, if those opinions are not already in the office of the Local Government Department or the Board of Works, that the general view in the country is that one-fifth, <Col N="1918" /> or even one-fourth, is not sufficient to warrant them going on with these schemes.  They would cause hardship to the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to a lot of these schemes being done by unpaid labour.  I think you may put that on one side.  There is no chance of getting a public scheme of any sort done by unpaid labour, even though part of the work is done on the lands of the farmers.  Who is going to supervise unpaid labour?  If the thing is going to be done at all, it should be done well.  I think to get drainage carried out by unpaid labour is only a waste of money.  You might get people who would be quite anxious to carry out a drainage scheme without supervision, but if you do not pay for it I am sure that you are not going to have the work done properly.  Besides, you have no means of compelling these people to do it.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw this motion and allow us to discuss this question of the grant later.  In the meantime, let representatives of the various counties who want drainage badly give their views as to what the grant should be.  I am satisfied that you will have no drainage done unless the grant is increased to 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>I think there would be a very big case, in these circumstances, for increasing the grant, because <Col N="1919" /> undoubtedly for the expenditure of comparatively small sums the labour in the procuring of peat could be greatly lessened.  In my opinion, every year this is becoming a more serious matter because of the terrible hardship attached to the work, and on that account more and more people are giving up the use of peat altogether and are going in for the use of coal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE (Parliamentary Secretary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to make a few remarks arising out of Deputy O'Hanlon's statement which led me to believe that he is under a complete misapprehension <Col N="1920" /> as to the respective merits of the 1925 Act and this Minor Schemes Act.  In one respect, of course, the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925 is much superior to this as regards finance, mainly in the respect that the Government can give grants up to practically any amount.  But there is a principle underlying the whole arterial drainage code, which is in operation, I suppose, for something like 85 years.  That principle is that the Government or local authorities should not subsidise these drainage schemes beyond amounts that are necessary to make them economic&mdash; that is, subsidise them to a greater extent than would make the annual charge for maintenance, consisting of interest and sinking fund, greater than the annual value of the land benefited. So that if a scheme is uneconomic without any Government grant, the principle has been for the Government not to give advances of even one per cent. in order to induce the people interested to go ahead with the scheme. That, to some extent, has been one of the causes why the 1925 Act has not been to any great extent availed of, because, owing to the present depression in agriculture, without some inducement of that kind farmers are not inclined to increase their overhead charges.  Under this Act, on the other hand, irrespective of whether the scheme is uneconomic without a grant or not, the Government are now prepared to come forward and give a grant up to 25 per cent.  So that to that extent the financing of this Act is very much better and would be much more acceptable to the local people than the Act of 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance has pointed out, it is not the intention of the Government to interfere directly in the working of this Act.  We do not want to increase the overhead charges of carrying out those schemes; we do not want to have any additional Governmental expenses entered into in carrying out this measure, and for that reason we are leaving it solely to the local authority.  If we are going to increase the grant up to 50 per cent., as Deputy O'Hanlon is now asking, it would mean that the Government of <Col N="1921" /> necessity, would have to exercise supervision over these schemes.  We must send down our engineers, we must send down our surveyors.  That will greatly increase the cost of carrying out these operations.  This is purely a local measure to benefit only the farmers whose lands have been drained. For that reason it stands on a very different footing from the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925, and, for that reason, I would ask Deputies on both sides of the House not to press the Government to increase this grant.  If they do I think the only effect it will have will be that it will cost the Government a great deal more to carry out the schemes, if, in fact, it has not the effect of making them withdraw the Bill altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinConlon" hpid="Mr. M. CONLON Mr. M. CONLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. CONLON</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have an amendment down, the object of which was to increase the amount of the free grant, I am very glad that the Minister has, to some extent, met the idea I had in my head.  I certainly think, notwithstanding what has been said by Deputy O'Hanlon, that the free grant of 25 per cent. is very reasonable, considering the resources of the country. At the same time, I am afraid, no matter what offer is made, the County Council of Cavan would not be likely to be satisfied.  As a matter of fact, there are other county councils in a similar position; for example, in the county that I represent.  I am aware that schemes under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925 were sent forward by the Roscommon County Council, and that in respect of a great many of these schemes a sum of 50 per cent. of the total cost was offered to the county council.  I was certainly very much interested in these schemes, and I regretted the county councils did not take up these schemes more wholeheartedly than they did.  In the County Council of Roscommon there were four schemes which were prepared by the Board of Works, who sent down their inspectors to go into them very fully. The total cost of these four schemes was £26,476.  Of that total, the Government grant was fixed at £11,818.  The sum which the County Council was asked to provide, in order to assist the schemes and make them economical to <Col N="1922" /> the holders of the land, would work out at £219 10s. 8d. per annum for 35 years. I do not know whether the County Council went into the matter thoroughly and clearly understood what they were refusing.  The total valuation of the County Roscommon is £306,000.  One penny in the £ on that sum would bring in £1,276.  The sum that was required to pay for these four schemes would amount to something less than one-sixth of a penny in the £. These four schemes covered a great area of the county.</P>
      <P>One scheme was in the extreme north of the county; two others were near the centre of the county, and the fourth was in the centre of the southern part of the county.  The four schemes would have drained a large area in Roscommon. These schemes were not approved of by the County Council.  I regretted that, and I was glad to hear the Minister for Finance the other day appealing to Deputies in this House to endeavour to get their county councils to adopt arterial drainage schemes.  I hope that appeal by the Minister will be successful and more benefit will accrue to the people of the country.  The spending of £26,476 in Roscommon would have had a great effect in providing employment. A great deal of a scramble took place over a sum of £2,500 that was given as a relief grant.  A great deal of noise was made about that grant, and every district was endeavouring to get what they could out of it.  But here was an offer of a sum of nearly £12,000 out of a total expenditure of £26,476.  The Co. Roscommon could have the benefit of that large expenditure at the cost of a contribution of one-sixth of a penny in the £.  If other schemes were put forward later the whole liability on the county rate would not cost more than one halfpenny in the £.  However, as far as I am concerned, I am satisfied with the action of the Minister in meeting us to such an extent as to increase the grant from one-fifth to one-fourth of the cost under this scheme.  I knew that the county I represent would not be satisfied with a contribution of one-fifth and I am glad that the grant has been increased to one-fourth.  I am pleased that the Minister has met us in this way, and I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am sure it is gratifying to most of us to find the Minister for Finance in a more or less generous mood and with having made an endeavour to meet us.  Personally, I would be better pleased if the Minister could have seen his way to increase the grant to one-third, which would be my suggestion.  The Minister has made reference to voluntary labour in the district being the cheapest.  I quite agree with him there.  I know something about local drainage.  I was responsible for some of the smaller schemes.  We found that when we had gone a certain length that our work was made of very little value, because in front of us, as we went along with the drainage, we found a bar of rock which would have needed a good deal of extra money to have taken out of the way.  For that reason much of the money we had spent was more or less useless.  I welcome this Bill, because it will give the local authority power to move obstructions like that out of the way and improve the land of the country.  I do not quite agree with the Minister when he says that it is only the owner that is benefiting by the land that has been drained.  Every acre of land that we improve in the State is an increased asset to the State and is over and above the present value of the land.  Deputy O'Kelly said that some people said they had too much land and that it was useless draining any more of it.  No matter what acreage of land a man occupies he has got to pay something for it.  I would rather far to pay for productive land, or land made productive by drainage, than to pay for land that was waste and covered with rushes.  I approve of the idea the Minister has put forward that the initial cost in connection with drainage schemes and in their preparation is being cut down, and that it will not be necessary for the Board of Works to be sending down their inspectors, but that the inspection will be done locally.  In that way there will be a substantial saving in the cost. I welcome the advance that the Minister has made in the proportion of the grant he is giving from the State towards the carrying through of these schemes.  As regards voluntary labour and as far as that is concerned I would <Col N="1924" /> say that, except we had some such Act as the Corn Production Act, whereby each man would be made liable to clean part of the drains which adjoin his land, voluntary labour is useless.  I say that because, except a man's own lands are flooded with water, he will not feel inclined to clean the drains. The result is that the flow of the water is obstructed.  I would have much preferred if the Minister could have seen his way to make the contribution one-third instead of one-fourth.  However, I welcome the length he has gone to meet us.</P>

      <P>We all quite agree that drainage cannot be undertaken economically by the owners of land at present and that it is the duty of the State, as the State has an asset in the land, to come forward with substantial help and afford the people facilities for drainage.  I think if the Minister could see his way to give even a greater grant the Bill would be more beneficial to the country.  I say that because the farmers who have to contribute the other portion of the drainage are in a very bad way at present and are not able to contribute their share.  I think if the Minister could see his way to increase the grant to one-third, as a northern Deputy suggested, that it would be very welcome indeed and it would be very well expended money.</P>

      <P>To a great extent I am in agreement with Deputy O'Hanlon. I have before me the case of a drainage scheme in Waterford.  The farmers are dissatisfied with the cost of it, and now the County Council are faced with the difficulty of collecting the special rate levied on the farms. The farmers hold that the benefit derived is nothing at all commensurate with the charge made on them.  I am afraid the County Council for many years to come will have serious trouble in endeavouring to collect the rate. Apart from that, I believe it is not good to encourage the people to expect the State to do too much for them in connection with this matter.  The Minister referred to voluntary labour.  My view is that the men who actually own the farms will be paid a great amount of the cost, and in that way they will get a certain amount of benefit, apart from the improved value of the land.  If you want to improve the value of a man's property, it is only fair that you should expect him to bear a proportion of the cost.  It is not good policy to be constantly holding up to the people's eyes the idea that you are always going to do things for them, irrespective of the benefit conferred.  It would be better if the principle of self-help was driven more home.  I must say that the small increase in the grant to be allowed is certainly to the good; even this small increase will be appreciated.</P>

      <P>I happen to be in the same position as Deputy O'Hanlon. The Leitrim County Council, of which I am a member, did not take advantage of the 1925 Act under which they were getting a grant of 50 per cent.  The <Col N="1926" /> County Council was in very poor circumstances, and they were unable to afford any money on schemes under the 1925 Act.  They were living in expectations thinking they would have a still greater grant under this Act, but they will be sadly disappointed when they see it reduced to half the former grant. There are a few things I would like to bring under the notice of the Minister. There are existing drainage schemes in Leitrim and I would like to know if they will get the same amount of free grant as new schemes under this measure. Under the old Acts there was some provision that prohibited the persons running a scheme from taking rocks out of the bed of the river.  Will this new Bill enable them to remove the rocks?  If a grant is given for the existing schemes on the same basis as the grant to be given on proposed new schemes, it will mean a lot; it would, at least, help 2,000 land owners in that area.  There are two big schemes in my constituency, and I want to know will they get the same free grant as under this new measure.</P>

      <P>I do not think the grant is anything like sufficient.  I think 25 per cent. is not sufficient to induce people to put forward drainage schemes at the present time.  I was rather surprised when I heard Deputy Conlon saying that in the county he represents £26,000 was going to be spent and of that amount £12,000 would be a grant.  He said the County Council did not take advantage of that scheme. Does he realise that they will get only £6,500 now?  I think this grant will not induce any County Council to start a drainage scheme.  The County Councils at present have too much to do in collecting the rates.  I think the Minister should at least give one-third.  If he gave 50 per cent. he would not be going out of his way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon has been replied to to some extent by the Parliamentary Secretary, who pointed out that under the existing legislation no grant at all is being given, unless it is necessary to reduce the annual charges arising out of the work to a sum not greater than the improved annual value of the land.  This Bill does not propose to limit the grant to any particular class of scheme.  All schemes will get the 25 per cent. grant. The general provisions of the Bill certainly are not compatible with the giving of a big grant.  The Bill was drawn up when it was not intended to give any grant.  The Government has no control over the expenditure.  It <Col N="1928" /> has nothing to say in regard to what scheme shall or shall not be carried out.  Its whole task in connection with this is to pay up when the work has been done.</P>
      <P>That being the case, I do not think we could possibly go beyond the 25 per cent. without taking the whole Bill back, going into it again, and providing some of the supervisory machinery which we have so far decided to leave out. Of the schemes that have been submitted from County Cavan, Deputy O'Hanlon has said that 28 have been set aside to be dealt with under this Bill. In my view, under the existing Act very few, if any, of these schemes could be dealt with for a long time, for the reason that the present machinery is too top-heavy for small schemes; it involves too much overhead expenditure.  Consequently, the Office of Public Works will, even if we make no change in the law, prefer to deal with the bigger schemes, because this machinery is much more suitable for them.  Of the schemes that will be carried out under this Bill, a very large number will be substantially under £1,000.  A thousand pounds is only the maximum limit, and I venture to say that £600 will turn out to be the average, and a £600 scheme can be carried out much more cheaply, per acre improved, than a £3,000 scheme. It would be difficult, in a scheme costing £3,000, to get any voluntary labour, because the work to be done might be a very great distance from the lands to be improved.  In most of the small schemes the work to be done will be quite close to the lands that are to be improved, and I think it would be reasonable to expect that the people who are going to benefit should either work at a special rate of wages, if that was the only way to manage it, or that they should come along and give some contribution by way of unpaid labour.  Deputy Reynolds asked whether new works could be done under the Bill in an existing drainage district.  They can, with the consent of the existing Drainage Board, but I presume that consent would not be withheld. In other cases they would have to be done by the Public Works Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have asked that we should <Col N="1929" /> reconsider the 25 per cent.  We have given a great deal of care to this, and we feel that we must look for the cooperation of the people who are going to be benefited and that we ought to give this very much simplified system a fair chance; that the Dáil should not insist upon grants which would make it incumbent on the State to carry out a system of inspection and supervision which is not contemplated at present. If this Bill does not work, then the matter can be considered anew, but it certainly ought to be given a chance. Any contributions that have to be made come from the taxpayer, and the taxpayer who is not going to be benefitted by drainage may reasonably ask why he should give a very large contribution for the individual benefit, practically, of a man whose land is going to be drained.</P>
    <P>I should like to say again that one of these minor schemes is very different from a big scheme like the Barrow drainage, which affects the health of the district, and the amenities of residence of all the people over a considerable distance around.  These small schemes are almost private matters, and in reality, a fairly generous contribution is being given by giving 25 per cent.  If there are schemes that can be carried out&mdash;and I am quite confident there is a large number of schemes that can be carried out with a 25 per cent. grant&mdash;then when the schemes we are able to carry out with that grant&mdash;to say no more than that&mdash; have been carried out, when we have done all that can be done, we have a new problem, and we can face up to that, but I think these particular schemes should be allowed to go through.  I am quite confident that this will not hold up any scheme, because these very small schemes would not have been dealt with under existing legislation for a very long time.  Under existing legislation, the normal grant is not in excess of 33? per cent., and nothing in excess of that will be given unless there is a county council contribution. As matters stand at present, so far as I can see, very few county councils will give any contribution.  I think one or two have agreed to give a contribution, but, in the main, they have absolutely refused.  So that the <Col N="1930" /> position as it stands is that for schemes that may run up to any amount&mdash;many of them will certainly run up to £7,000, £8,000 and £10,000&mdash; the maximum contribution is 33?.  I think that if we are giving 33? for £6,000 and £7,000 schemes, 25 per cent. is a very generous contribution for a £600 scheme.</P>

      <P>I should like to say on this section that Deputy Goulding raised a point on that part of the section which says that the word &ldquo;county&rdquo; does not include county borough, and spoke of a joint drainage scheme that existed between the Waterford County Borough and the Waterford County Council.  I suggested that the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925 would probably be found to meet his case.  But, in fact, I am advised that that Act refers only to county councils and does not include county boroughs. There is no proposal to change that, as far as the minor schemes are concerned. The Bill is drafted entirely from an extra-borough point of view.  In any case the particular drainage problem the Deputy refers to would not by any chance fall under the description of minor schemes.  If there is a drainage problem in connection with any borough, the matter must be taken up separately by that borough.  It is not proposed to bring boroughs under this Bill, for the reason that a borough scheme would be a very big scheme that would certainly not come in under £1,000, and the additional reason, that this Bill is the trimmings of the Act of 1925, which does not refer to county boroughs.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will probably see the section is quite fair and all right as it stands.  There may be a person who has, let us say, a holding of £200 valuation.  He may be involved in a scheme with two people, one of £30 and another of £25 valuation. It is not the extent of the complete holding that is involved, but the extent of the valuation of the land to be benefited. If a person with land expecting to be benefited under a drainage scheme, the valuation of which is, say £50, is involved with persons whose land to be benefited is, say, of a valuation of £10, and another of £20, there is running through the whole Bill the intention that the person or persons who have more than 50 per cent. of the valuation of the land proposed to be benefited are being given a deciding say as to whether their land should be interfered with for the purposes of improvement or not.</P>

      <P>Yes, they have. Whenever a scheme is reported on and it is proposed to be considered by the county council, there is deposited the plans, which are open to inspection by everyone concerned.  There are public notices of the scheme, and persons feeling that they are aggrieved or likely to be aggrieved in any way can make representations to the county council, and can be heard personally or through their agents before the county council when it assembles to ratify the scheme.</P>

      <P>The reason I had in putting this down is that I thought considerable cost would be involved by having to go into the District Court.  I submit the Minister should have an inspection made of the place or the area where the county council enters the land and where the parties concerned are not satisfied with the amount of the compensation. The next section says: &ldquo;The Minister may hold or cause to be held such inquiries as he considers necessary or expedient for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;  That being so, I think it would be better if the matter was left to the decision of the Minister in the case of small disputes so as to avoid the extra cost to the parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 32 of the Local Government Act of 1925 gives the right to local authorities responsible for road-making of entering upon lands to take away road material, and in any dispute as to compensation the District Court has the jurisdiction in the matter and of assessing the compensation. This seems to be on all fours with that.  The cost and inconvenience, and perhaps want of satisfaction, would be much greater, I think, if the matters had to come before the Minister for determination as to what would be just compensation. The District Court is certainly the most <Col N="1938" /> suitable body to do it.  Section 24 simply gives the Minister power not so much to hold an inquiry, as if circumstances drive him to hold an inquiry of any particular kind he can recover the costs.  We do not desire or expect it will be necessary to hold an inquiry arising out of the Bill.  We cannot really foresee that normally there would be any necessity to institute an inquiry, but in case it should be necessary it is desirable to have the power to recover costs.  I do not think that the fact that we have Section 24 should induce us to depart from the District Court as the body with jurisdiction as to compensation.</P>
      <P>I think it will be realised that this is on all fours with the work that has already gone to the District Court in connection with disputes arising out of the taking of road material.  There ought, moreover, to be very few cases arising out of this matter in which there would not be agreement.  I do not accept the Deputy's suggestion that the District Court is an expensive way of arriving at a decision if there is no agreement.  It might be more expensive if the Minister were brought in.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I am guided by the fact that people would probably be dissatisfied with the District Justice's decision.  There is a certain amount of dissatisfaction in cases where District Courts have decided in regard to road work.  There may be appeals from the District to the Circuit Court and then to the High Court, and people may be involved in heavy law costs, owing to the feeling which prevails in the country of people believing that they are right, and not <Col N="1939" /> giving way, so that the costs would grow to a large amount.  It is to prevent this unpleasantness that I suggest we should have recourse to arbitration. Some of us have had experience of Arbitration Courts and we know the respect which was always entertained towards them.  If you resort to arbitration and have representatives of the Local Government Department, the County Council, and the owner of the land there would be very little costs, if any.  A pledge might be submitted to all parties to abide by the decision of the Arbitration Court so that the disputes would be finally settled.</P>

      <P>I have seen some District Courts working, and I must say that they are full of the spirit of arbitration.  A District Justice would be as useful an arbitrator in these matters as anyone representing the Minister. The amount involved in a District Court must, of necessity, be small. Even the costs of the District Court, small as they are, would be sufficient to force people to arbitrate amongst themselves.  The best suggestion I can make is that the District Court be left in the section.  I would not be prepared to accept the amendment putting the Minister in the position of having to arbitrate in such cases because the District Court has the machinery for doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a second time.  The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill may be said to have had its origin in the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission.  That Commission gave its opinion that a special Commission responsible for the preservation of the Gaeltacht was necessary.  It recommended the setting up of such a Commission charged with the duty of seeing that all Departments carry out in detail the Government's policy with regard to the language in the Gaeltacht. It was suggested that the Commission should be appointed by and be directly responsible to the President, that it should be vested with authority from the Executive Council to enter into direct communication in an advisory and co-ordinating capacity with the various Departments in so far as their administration affects the Gaeltacht.  It was to be required to consider in what way improvements could be made in the arrangements for dealing with the special economic wants of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two of the members of the Gaeltacht Commission made reservations regarding the scope and functions of the proposed Commission, one proposing to give it an active and directive voice in the work of the Departments functioning in the Gaeltacht empowering it to <Col N="1941" /> set up industries, open up markets and so on, with moneys to be provided by the Dáil&mdash;the other contemplating an annual grant-in-aid to be expended on industrial development and applicable to recouping to the Departments of State the cost of special schemes undertaken by them with the approval and under the aegis of the special Commission. It is clear from the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission that that Commission felt that the economic situation in those areas where the Irish language has remained a living speech was such as to require special attention. The Government accept this view; they have given very careful thought to the proposals submitted by the Commission dealing with the machinery through which this special attention can be directed to those areas. It must be clear to anyone who studies the matter that the economic problem in those districts cannot be dealt with solely in relation to Irish speakers; it must take into account the whole of the population.</P>
    <P>It resolves itself into a number of divisions, principal among which are the provision of economic holdings, the development of the fishing industry and the utilisation of raw material for rural industries.  There are, of course, other subsidiary matters, but the big problems are these I have mentioned. These problems at the time of the Com mission's report were engaging the attention of two separate Ministers. The Minister for Lands and Agriculture was charged with the provision of economic holdings, the Minister for Fisheries was in charge of fishing and rural industries.  It appeared to us that the best way to secure that the activities in these directions would be satisfactorily and efficiently co-ordinated was to bring them under the control of a single parliamentary head. This was done by an order of the Executive Council entitled the Irish Land Commission (Re-distribution of Public Services) Order, 1927, made on the 20th July last, which transferred the Land Commission from the Minister for Lands and Agriculture to the Minister for Fisheries.  The present Bill is complementary to that order: it may be described as entirely a machinery Bill.  It amends the Ministers <Col N="1942" /> and Secretaries Act, 1924, by bringing it up to date with the position created by the order, and it makes the consequent adjustment in the styles and titles of the Ministers concerned. Incidentally it provides a definition of the word &ldquo;agriculture,&rdquo; and confers upon the Executive Council the power, when in exercise of the powers already held under Section 12 of the 1924 Act, it so distributes services amongst the Ministers and Departments of State that it is desirable to alter the titles of Ministers, to make the necessary alterations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahy has tabled a motion which will give us a debate on all the aspects of the Gaeltacht Commission Report; consequently I do not propose to go into the matter on the present occasion save in so far as it is necessary to explain the genesis of this measure.  The arrangements which are being made to supplement this measure by a scheme of co-operation with the various departments responsible for education, agricultural instruction, housing, etc., do not fall to be discussed here.  They will, I presume, arise in the discussion of Deputy Fahy's motion.  But it will perhaps be proper to explain in general terms why the Government do not view with favour the setting up of a separate Board or Commission as recommended by the Gaeltacht Report. In the first place the problem of land purchase and distribution cannot effectively be divided into two parts, one dealing solely with Gaeltacht areas and the other with the rest of the country.  If there is to be migration on any scale it is clear that suitable lands in the non-Irish-speaking districts must be utilised for settling congests from the Irish-speaking districts.</P>
    <P>This process would certainly not be facilitated by any arrangement which would provide that the settlement lands were under an authority independent of that operating in the lands from which migrants were being taken. Quite the contrary.  Clearly, therefore, if there were to be a special board it would have to function in the greater part through the medium of the existing Departments.  A board with purely advisory functions, without executive <Col N="1943" /> power or authority and unburthened by responsibility for finances, would be rendered largely ineffective by friction which would be bound to arise regarding details and policies between such a body and the different Departments upon which responsibility for the various schemes would fall.  A semi-independent board, vested with authority and provided with funds, operating in a field already covered by the activities of the various Departments, would be calculated to lead to wasteful overlapping and to divided control.  The Executive Council sees no reason why the co-ordinated effort necessary to give effect to those proposals of the Gaeltacht Commission, which are feasible and financially possible, cannot be provided through the machinery of the existing Departments. Their policy is to secure co-ordinated effort along these lines, and this measure is one of the steps towards the development of that co-ordinated effort.  I move that it be now read a second time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not anticipate that this Bill would come up for discussion to-day, but as it has, it is necessary that we should make the viewpoint of our Party clear on it.  It seems to us that it is a Bill to legalise action which already has been taken.  In Section 4 of the Bill a bad principle is, in our opinion, established.  It appears from the somewhat extraordinary wording of the section that there have been doubts in the minds of some persons as to the legality of the act already taken by the Executive Council in transferring to the Department of Fisheries the services of the Irish Land Commission.  I think that the President, when introducing the Bill, should have given us some explanation as to the wording of that section.  In whose mind did these doubts arise?  Have these doubts in any way reflected upon action taken in the courts or in any other manner by the present Department of Lands and Fisheries?  It is unusual, I think, to have a section in that form introduced in a Bill of this nature, and in view of its unusualness we think that a fuller explanation should be given to the House than the mere wording of the Bill gives us.  We would like to know <Col N="1944" /> what exactly these doubts were, how they arose, and why it is necessary to take a step of this nature in order to remove them, and if, in fact, the step that is being taken does remove them.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes, as I said, to legalise an action taken by the Executive Council in transferring the services of the Irish Land Commission to the Department of Fisheries.  The President, in introducing the Bill, stated that this was an attempt to improve upon recommendations made by the Gaeltacht Commission, recommendations in favour of putting certain services affecting the Gaeltacht under the control of one permanent Commission, or advisory body. We are not satisfied that a better system of administration could not be secured, not by transferring the Land Commission to the Fisheries Department, but by transferring the Fisheries Department to the Department of Agriculture, and by amalgamating the three services under one head to secure effective co-ordination of effort, and, at the same time, a fairly considerable economy.  It will be stated, of course, that the responsibility placed upon one Minister by that step would be very considerable.  We do not deny it.  It has been fairly generally admitted that the Department of Agriculture is an active Department and that the Minister in charge of it has possibly more work to do than any other single individual Minister.  That is, no doubt, the case, but we do not think that the additional duties which he would have if the Department of Fisheries were under his control would necessarily interfere with his work in other directions.  I was nearly going to add that by giving him plenty of work to do, we might prevent him starting civil wars whenever he feels inclined that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential thing, however, is to secure that not merely in respect of the Gaeltacht, but in respect of the country generally, there will be effective co-ordination between the Department of Fisheries, the Department of Agriculture and the Land Commission. We think that the Minister for Agriculture, with the assistance of a Parliamentary Secretary, should be able to do the work of all three Departments. On another occasion we hope to point out that the present Department of <Col N="1945" /> Fisheries is not doing its work properly. I think we will be able to establish that the efficiency of that Department is not all that could be desired, and that there would possibly be an improvement in the service, and possibly a considerable benefit conferred upon Irish fishermen, by transferring the services to another Minister.  Generally speaking, we would like to have a much more convincing statement than that which has been made by the President in favour of this Bill.  The whole question of the Gaeltacht does, of course, involve other matters besides the Land Commission, fisheries and agriculture.  It concerns not merely the Department of Education, but also the Department of Industry and Commerce. The fact that the Land Commission was transferred to the Fisheries Department, or even the fact that the Land Commission and the Fisheries Department were transferred to the Department of Agriculture, would not result in machinery being established that would enable the economic problem of the Gaeltacht to be effectively considered and dealt with.  As the President said, this problem has more than a direct relationship to the preservation of the Irish language.  It is an economic problem mainly, and it will require effective co-ordination between all the Departments and probably every Department of the Government concerned. Because, of course, the Department of Finance cannot be left out of any considerations that are brought forward for implementation.  Then, as I said, the particular wording of Section 4 requires elucidation.  We hope, before the Bill is put to the Dáil, for sanction or otherwise, that we will get that statement I asked for as to the doubts mentioned there.  We would also like to know why the step I have suggested of transferring the Department of Fisheries to the Department of Agriculture, instead of transferring the Land Commission to Fisheries, was not taken.  It would undoubtedly result in an economy, and we do not think it would result in any lessening of the efficiency of any of the Departments concerned.  In fact, we believe it would result in an increase of efficiency in the Fisheries Department <Col N="1946" /> itself.  For these reasons I think we should be slow to give our consent to this Bill until we have a much fuller statement from the Ministerial Benches.</P>

      <P>The principal Act states in Section 12, sub-section (1)&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the Executive Council from time to time by Order to prescribe the organisation of all or any of the said Departments of State and of the business and administration thereof in any manner which may seem to the Executive Council to be expedient or proper in the public interests and in particular to create units of administration to be called offices (divisions or branches) and so on down along.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To remove doubts it is hereby declared and enacted that the powers conferred on the Executive Council by sub-section 2 of Section 12 of the principal Act extend and always have extended to public services established by or under Acts of the Oireachtas passed after the passing (whether before or after the commencement) of the principal Act as well as to public services established.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And so on.  It is really a question of interpretation to remove as to the interpretation any doubt as to the legality of making the Order of the 20th July last.  There is no doubt about the legality of that, but it is to remove doubts as to interpretation.  It is open, I think, to question as to whether or not the wording of the principal Act was quite clear, and it was to make it clear and to enact that the powers conferred on the Executive Council by that Act extended and always have extended to public services that this particular clause was put in, but it had no reference whatever to the legality of the action taken on the 20th July last.</P>

I think it arose in connection with whether it would be within the competence of the Executive Council to change the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture by an Order.  It was not found possible to do that, and it was found within the competence of the Executive Council to dispose of one of the departments of it.  Take, for example, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is not a very good example, but if one were to desire that telegraphs might be put in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Lemass pointed out, the Gaeltacht services are manifold.  There is agriculture, education, finance, fisheries, housing.  Finance, of course, includes the Board of Works and land reclamation, etc., as well as the acquisition of lands.  All these are Gaeltacht services which must get special attention in the Gaeltacht.  I take it that is what the Gaeltacht problem means, that so far as all these services are concerned, in view of the conditions in a certain area known as the congested districts, all these must get special attention&mdash;more attention and a different kind of services in this respect from the rest of the country.  Deputy Lemass pointed out that it was important to the Gaeltacht that services such as Agriculture, Land Commission and Fisheries should be co-ordinated, and he used that as an argument for merging the three under one Ministry. But to be quite logical you will have to go further.  You would have to merge education with them.  Of course it is a debatable point, but certainly it could be argued, and it certainly is my opinion, that the most important service you can do for the Gaeltacht is to educate it.  You should add education as well.  And undoubtedly, as <Col N="1948" /> he pointed out himself, you should add Finance.  If you want to reduce the thing to absurdity, as the Deputy has tried to do, why not go ahead and include Finance, Agriculture, Land Commission, Fisheries and Education in one Ministry and call it any name you like, because that is really in essence what the Deputy's contention amounted to? It was an endeavour to reduce to absurdity the proposal which we make here now.  We think, and anybody who knows the West will agree, that the three most important services, putting it that way, which must affect the day to day lives of the people in the West are: Number 1, the service that deals with the acquisition of land; number 2, the service that deals with fisheries, and number 3, a certain uneconomic service if you wish, connected with drainage&mdash;special concessions in connection with drainage and special concessions in connection with housing; special concessions in connection with rural industries&mdash;more or less uneconomic services that have to be subsidised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have to do housing in a different way.  You have to attend to industries in a different way in the Gaeltacht; you have to subsidise and give them State assistance.  It is not stated by anyone, even the most enthusiastic Socialist on the Fianna Fáil Benches, that you must subsidise all the industries in the rest of the country, but it is admitted, so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned; so far as rural industries are concerned, and other services of that kind are concerned, that they have to get special concessions from the taxpayers of the rest of the country.  The same applies to the housing that is done by the Land Commission in the Congested Districts.  All those, what I call, for want of a better word, uneconomic services which have to be heavily subsidised in a different way from the same services in the rest of the country are to be merged under one Ministry, the Ministry of Lands and Fisheries or whatever the new title is to be.  Anybody can make a case against that, just as you can make a case against any compromise.  Anybody can reduce it to absurdity by pointing out how services that other Ministries have to deal with could be <Col N="1949" /> put under one Ministry.  Deputy Lemass has done it effectively.  But that does not get you any further.  You really could not put finance, education, agriculture, Land Commission and fisheries under one Ministry, and if you were to aim at Deputy Lemass's ideal that is what you have got to do. You do not carry the discussion any further by merely stating that in the opinion of certain Deputies any one averagely good man could look after these services.  I am surprised that these arguments come from these Benches, because I understand that Deputies on those Benches were in favour of the re-establishment of the Congested Districts Board, or something approximating to it.  This motion does not re-establish the Congested Districts Board, but it gives a body which is more effective for its purposes than the old Congested Districts Board was. When I say that I do not mean to suggest that the old Congested Districts Board was an inefficient body.  It was not, but it had not sufficient powers; it had only powers to deal with land within the Gaeltacht.  Land purchase, of course, is an extremely important service so far as the congested districts are concerned, but that Board could only buy land within the congested districts, and it was quite powerless to make an impression upon the congestion problem in the congested districts. Here you have the Land Commission, who can buy land in Dublin, Meath or anywhere else in the Saorstát, and they can migrate people from the congested districts in order to make room for others.  The Congested Districts Board could not deal effectively with the problem we have now, for the reason that they could not go outside the congested districts to buy land.  The Land Commission can do that, and I think it is evident on the face of it that a body with powers to purchase land when the land is available outside the congested districts in order to migrate congests there and land owners in the congested districts so as to make room for tenants who have very small holdings and who need relief, is far more effective in dealing with the problem than was the old Congested Districts Board.  The Department of Fisheries has charge at <Col N="1950" /> present, and it can co-ordinate all the services of the Congested Districts Board&mdash;the fisheries, rural industries, and so on.  It has all the powers of the old Congested Districts Board, plus the Land Commission, to deal with the land problem in the congested districts.  So that those who consider that something in the nature of the re-establishment of a special Board on the lines of the Congested Districts Board to deal with the Gaeltacht problem was the right way to approach the problem have got that now in the Department of Fisheries, which includes fisheries, those other services, and finally land purchase. I do not want to say anything on this question suggesting that agriculture might be lumped in.  As I said before, the same thing might be said about education and finance.  I think it would be bad business from a number of points of view.  I think, with great respect to anybody on the opposite Benches, agriculture is an industry that is quite sufficient for any one man, no matter who he is.  He will find quite sufficient to do, and the better he is the more he will do.</P>
    <P>Further, I think it is desirable to keep agriculture a separate Ministry, attending to the normal agriculture of the country.  I do not think it is right that the Ministry of Agriculture can be looked upon as a body which in its spare time has to deal out a certain amount of philanthropy, a certain amount of loose money for relief, and so on.  That idea, I think, owing to historical circumstances, got deep root in this country, but we are getting away from these historical causes.  For instance, there is a big amount of land divided now; 11,000,000 out of 15,000,000 acres have been divided under the Land Acts.  That is done and finished with.  The owners have their land; they have economic holdings to a great extent on that 11,000,000 acres of land.  Land purchase, so far as a very big area of the Free State is concerned, is complete.  Farmers should be required to tackle down to their problems and should get all sorts of assistance in the way of education; they should get away from the idea that the ordinary farmer, living on a good holding in normal times, has to be helped by the way of doles, grants <Col N="1951" /> and so on.  For that reason I would rather see agriculture, and I think anybody who thinks over it will agree, regarded as a Ministry that is engaged in promoting services which are normal, economic, and which require development rather than philanthropy, doles, subsidies, and so on.  I do not want to suggest that there is any problem in the Gaeltacht which, by reason of the fact that it is to some extent uneconomic, should not be attended to. It should be attended to.  We have to recognise the fact that, so far as a big proportion of the land of the country is concerned, it is economic, and farmers should be expected to work their land economically.  On the other side, you should recognise the problem that there is a big proportion of farmers living under uneconomic conditions and that it is the duty of somebody, as a special problem, to look after them.  That is a special problem.  These two problems should not be mixed up.  It is not good for either one or the other, apart altogether from the fact that it is absurd to say that one Minister should be capable of looking after and dealing adequately with all these services.  It is unsound in the long run, even if one Minister could do it.  It is wrong to mix two problems that should be kept apart.  The Department of Agriculture are carrying on all these normal services in the Gaeltacht in the same way as in the rest of the country&mdash;the same with Education and Finance.  But there is no doubt that there is a special problem and that that special problem is essentially one for the Department that deals with fisheries, rural industries and the acquisition and division of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. RUTTLEDGE</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask an explanation from the Minister for Finance as to what exactly is the meaning of the statement he made here on the last day.  This is the statement: &ldquo;As I said, I do not want to humiliate men.  For instance, if it could be made known that the men would be openly at their homes henceforth, instead of simply staying out and trying it on, it might lead to some understanding.  I do not want men necessarily to go and knock at the door of the local police barracks, but if it was known that from Monday next, from a particular date, the men would be openly about their homes so that they would be available, it would be different.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does the Minister mean by that, that, say from a certain date, a date that might be fixed in this House, these men who are on the run would be allowed to return peaceably to their homes without being molested or interfered with afterwards?  Would he state, as an elaboration of that, what is the policy of the Government regarding political prisoners in jail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>What I stated, I think, earlier in the day was that the first thing that should be done in this matter was that these men should submit to arrest.  Somebody asked me whether they are expected to return, knock at the doors of Mountjoy, or, as somebody else said, at the doors of the local police barracks, and I said no, that they would not be expected to do that, but that they might all together and by arrangement return to their homes, that they would there be arrested.  What I indicated was that if they did submit to arrest in this way that we would deal with them in the most generous spirit possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I pointed out that when the rescue from jail took place in 1925, it was a very long time after the &ldquo;Cease Fire&rdquo; order.  There must be an end to jail rescues, and we could not, in respect <Col N="1953" /> of the rescue which occurred at that time, allow men simply to go free, but we would recognise that the liberty out of the prison which they had has not been an enjoyable time to them. Perhaps it has been to some of them, or to many of them, a period of punishment, and if they close this chapter of rescue of prisoners by submitting in this form to arrest, then that we would meet them.  There must be some sort of an indication that there is a change of policy.  I tried to labour this all through my remarks, that if the people who have hitherto tried to work a certain policy successfully by force of arms, are prepared to make that policy successful by persuasion, by getting the majority vote, then that we want to get rid of prosecutions and pursuits and all these things that are necessary.</P>
    <P>But events of that type occurred very long after the &ldquo;Cease Fire&rdquo; order, and consequently we must have some sort of clear evidence that the men are not going to be released simply to feel that they were freer and safer in carrying on activities which, I would like to put it as almost indisputable, ought to be at this stage abandoned. That was really with reference to the prisoners who were out of jail.  If we get that far with the prisoners out of jail, I would certainly be prepared to say that even with those who are in jail the Executive Council could recognise that we had passed into a new period, and that we ought to consider what we will do.  There was a time when we allowed the law to operate against offenders no matter in what circumstances these offences against the law were committed.  Then there came a time when we said we are now in more peaceful conditions, and we passed the amnesty resolution of the Executive Council which prevented large numbers of people from being pursued and arrested.</P>
    <P>If there is an indication that the people who are in prison, and those people who were in prison, are adopting an entirely new attitude, I do not want to take up an entirely ungenerous standard and to be too stiff on technicalities.  But we cannot get away from the facts that what was done in 1923, or what was done immediately after the cessation of hostilities, when <Col N="1954" /> blood was very hot and all that, is rather different from acts committed a considerable time after that, because where they were done there is the presumption that these men are set and fixed in a certain policy, and that they would proceed with that policy, and any leniency shown to them is not prima facie calculated to produce the result of inducing them to take a new view.  In 1923 the position was different. If we want to close that chapter I would say for the Government that they would not allow any sort of feel ings of pride or any desire to humiliate anybody to stand in the way.</P>
    <P>I said, for instance, that I would not expect men to come and surrender themselves at the police barracks, because I believe that those men would regard that as a personal humiliation. Even some of them, who have no idea or no notion at all of going any further with any policy of violence, would stick at going up to the police barracks and offering themselves to be taken away.  I said I would make it as easy as possible for them.  The real thing is, there has to be an acceptance of the law, and there has to be the policy of amending the law by the ordinary democratic method.  If there is this submission to the law, this indication that people are prepared to carry on a new policy, and that they do not want either to defeat or upset the law by violence, then we would meet them. We would be prepared to do our part. We could not make a bargain that men would get off, because there must be a definite reversal of the sort of prison rescue policy.  On the other hand, if men feel that the time has come for a change and they do submit to arrest, then, without making a bargain, we can promise that they will be dealt with, as I have said, in a very generous spirit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has said that this thing can be ended without a bargain being arranged.  In my own case, a matter which is quite similar was ended without any bargain whatsoever being made.  I want to ask the Minister now if the men on the run go back openly, as I came back openly, say, if they go back on this day week, will the Minister close the chapter without a bargain? <Col N="1955" /> When I was speaking I told the Minister that we recognised that the Government have enough military force to enforce the Treason Act, and that they can, if they wish to, enforce it, but that it is not wise to do so. But we appeal to them now to do what we consider is the right thing for the nation, that is, to close the chapter. If these men go back this day week, in the same way as I came back, I hope that the Government will close the chapter.  I would ask the Minister to close the chapter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not precisely the same thing.  We will close the chapter of jail rescues in this way, that these men having escaped would go back to jail.  If they come home we would arrest every man who had escaped, but we would take into account the fact that they had submitted to arrest, that they had allowed themselves to be taken when they could not have been captured. We would take into account that during the period out of jail they have been on the run and have suffered perhaps, some of them, greater hardships and punishment and discomforts than they would have suffered in the jail.  We would take all this into account.  We would take into account that this was a gesture for a new position and we would meet them.  Probably there would be men who would go out at once again.  Of course I am talking now all the time about men who were really political.  There were other men who went out of jail at the time who were not political.  I am leaving them out.  Some of them who had little against them might go straight out. They might be kept for varying lengths of time but we would deal with them in such a way that it would be better for them to do whatever term they might have to do than to continue on the run. Anyway if that happened we could feel sure that there would not be a jail rescue period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to get on to another point, but if the Deputy would look at the Treasonable Offences Act and try to detach himself from it at the moment, I think he would agree that the Treasonable Offences Act is a proper Act and an Act which ought to be on the Statute Book and which ought to <Col N="1956" /> be administered.  Any objection to it really arises to-day because we are emerging from a peculiar situation in which men who would not ordinarily be liable to any charges under that Act might be liable.  What I am driving at is, that if we are really doing anything we want to make as sure as we can that by doing that we are not going to let any man think that, for instance, a new period has arisen in which dangers of carrying on a certain line of action are less than they were before or that there is to be&mdash;I do not want to be offensive to anybody&mdash;easy glory got by pursuing a certain line.  We do not, on the other hand, want to embitter anybody by being severe.  We are trying to pursue a middle course and secure a complete departure from certain methods of resolving disputes and making changes that are unnecessary, because settlement can be effected through the machinery of the ballot box.</P>
    <P>I pointed out before that it is not enough simply to ask for these men's release and say some of the things that have been said.  I do not know what precise significance should be given to them, but there were some things which Deputy Lemass said and perhaps if he explained those things they were figures of speech to some extent and might not be really objectionable.  On the other hand, they may indicate a defence of the policy of altering a policy here and altering laws by force.  If they be that, and any man asks for the release of prisoners while professing those things, we could only say &ldquo;No release of prisoners; we stand fast.&rdquo;  If there is not any abandonment of the policy of using force and if there is not an adoption of the principle that changes must be effected by persuasion and by getting the majority vote&mdash;if there is still a reliance on force then any plea for the release of prisoners whose offences were connected with the support of that policy of force, or with preparations to use force, must be met with the reply that the prisoners must stay in.  We really want to get down to fundamentals and see where we are going.  Sometimes you can be generous with men, simply believing that generosity in itself will affect them without having any particular ground to go on.  That is particularly the case <Col N="1957" /> after the conflict&mdash;immediately after it. That argument would be very powerful indeed in the later part of 1923 or in 1924; but, of course, some of the prisoners having committed certain acts in very recent times, they must be very fixed in their policy and if there is any one of these men in jail who firmly believes that he ought to use force and that it is right to prepare to use force to get changes here, then he is a danger and he ought to be kept in jail.  It may be awkward for many people, but really there is nothing much to be done by letting him free to pursue his particular activities or to persuade other people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that a resumption of the debate would not have been necessary, because on Friday the Minister, when he spoke, seemed to recognise the peculiar characteristics of this problem&mdash;to be anxious to attack it, not as a politician, but as a statesman.  Several times he approached it in a statesmanlike way, but I suppose, backed by the fact that he had to maintain the conventional official attitude, he began to surround himself with reservations and conditions which made the overtures he appeared to be willing to make, useless. I submit that the enforcement of a penalty, the maintenance of an official attitude, the justification of things that have been done in the past on either side, are very secondary things in this matter.  What we are out to secure, if we possibly can, is the restoration of a feeling of friendship &mdash;it need not be political friendship&mdash; corporate friendship, and good fellowship between all the people and every section of the community in the State. That is what is necessary in order that the humble individuals among us may be able to earn their daily bread in peace and security, and the only justification for any measure, punitive or merciful, is that it should bring about those conditions.  I would ask the Minister for once to override the official convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the crime for which these men are suffering, if it is a crime&mdash; there may be doubts about it?  We will admit, at any rate, that in the ordinary eyes of the law, in the strict sense of the word, it is an offence to <Col N="1958" /> escape from prison.  But, after all, I think that is an offence that none of us would be certain that, if we were similarly situated, we would not commit. If any of the Ministers or Deputies who have ever been in prison were placed in a similar situation with the prison doors thrown open, would they not have walked out in exactly the same way as these men?  And if they had been hunted with all the persistence of the law; if they had been hunted for three years, would they not think, at the end of that time, that they had sufficiently expiated whatever offences they had been originally imprisoned for?  That is the case I want to put to the Minister.  If there is a punishment, one of the purposes of it is that it should be a deterrent, and the other purpose is, I suppose, that it should be commensurate with the offence.</P>
    <P>Some of the men who escaped on this occasion were involved in very minor charges indeed.  One was an old man bordering on seventy years of age.  He had been questioned by the Civic Guard in connection with the use that had been made of his motorcar. The Guards refused to believe him and he lost his temper and may have made some hasty answers to the Guards, which gave them the excuse for arresting him.  That man has been harried and harassed for over three years, and I think if you begin to consider, you will find that in the case of every person involved his offence is a very simple one.</P>
    <P>The sufferings that these men have endured in the past three years, I submit, have served the practical end of justice, and the only thing that remains to be done is that the Government, recognising that fact, should act upon it and should say, without more ado, that those men, if they have committed crime, have been punished, have purged their wrong-doing, and let them go home.  Let them go home, and let them place themselves, if you like, at your disposal when they go home.  They will do that.  But surely it is not necessary that you should go further, all the time having at the back of your mind that when you have gone further by arresting them, you <Col N="1959" /> do not propose again to imprison them. Do not go further with the empty formality, if you like, of arresting these men and hauling them to prison, simply, as it were, to humiliate them and then to release them.  Surely the law, if it is the law you are seeking to vindicate, will be much better served by you, who have the power of exercising the quality of mercy, if you like, and of charity and toleration which are at your disposal.  I think that that is very much the better way of dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>Any man who has been on the run for three years, who has the responsibility of a household, who is the father of a family, or the support of a mother or father, who gets an opportunity of going back again to pursue his ordinary daily business, is not going lightly to jeopardise the feeling of security that for the first time in three years will be his.  The man who can for the first time in three years sleep easily in his bed at night, who can walk freely through the streets in the daytime, is not going to abuse this toleration, if you extend it to him now.  When you have that consideration before you, and the fact that, as I said before, whatever offence there has been has been expiated in suffering and in anxiety; when you have the fact that your toleration, if you extend it, will not be abused, and when you have, above all, the changed circumstances of these times, I submit that instead of trying to solve this matter by the method of legal logic-chopping, you ought to make this gesture, make it for once, and if it is abused, you at least will have the justification that you have made it.  Make it for once; let these men all go back; do not ask from them any formal retraction of the things they said in the past; do not ask them to humiliate themselves in any formal way; depend rather more upon, as I said before, the changed circumstances of the time, on the fact that 1928 is not 1925; on the fact that men who thought there was no other way can see opening before them another way, can see in the gradual accession of strength to the Party which we represent the possibility that they will be able to achieve their ends and their <Col N="1960" /> ideals without recourse to arms&mdash;depend upon that to give and to restore to this State that peace which is so vital to its welfare.</P>

      <P>I should be sorry to throw any discord into this debate, but the Deputy who has just spoken talked about assurances we have had.  So far I have not noticed any assurance.  I would suggest that one assurance would be this: Deputy Boland, I think it was, speaking the other day, indicated or implied that he had a fair amount of knowledge of the doings, if I may say so, of law-breakers and other people.  In this country last year happened one of the most dastardly crimes that has happened in the world for a long time&mdash;the dastardly murder of the Minister for Justice.  One of the assurances we might have from Deputy Boland and the others who are urging this gesture on our part is that they should give any information they may have now, or may get as time goes on, that is likely to be of assistance to the police in bringing these murderers to justice, or any information they think might conceivably be of use to the police in bringing these murderers to justice.  Deputy Boland talks about assurances that we have.  I think that would be a very important and useful assurance at present.</P>

      <P>Another Deputy will possibly be able to speak for the Deputy.  I was not seeing the papers during that period, but, so far as I know, we have had no assurance from the Fianna Fáil Party that each individual member of that Party and, as far as their influence goes, all the people they control will, or will be urged to put all the information that they may from time to time acquire, that they think may possibly, or may under any circumstances, conceivably, be of use to the police in tracking down these murderers, before the authorities.  That is an assurance which I think will be very useful at present to this country as well as to the Fianna Fáil Party. There has been a lot of loose talk in this discussion, and just one point <Col N="1961" /> interests me personally&mdash;that about the political offenders.  We brought in an amnesty here which, on the one hand, gave liberty to a very large number of men who were opposed to the Government&mdash;some of them for the crime of waging war simply, and others for individual acts which might conceivably be associated with that general term.  On the other hand, there were men who had taken the side of the State on that occasion and who, in spite of that, had certain criminal tendencies, and who actually benefited by the amnesty, because the amnesty said that it should amnesty those who had waged war against the State, or acts arising or purporting to arise out of that, and acts arising or purporting to arise out of the action of the State in putting down that rebellion.  Reference has been made to a man named McPeake.  This person joined the National Army, took the pay of a man in the National Army.  Nothing is going to make me recognise or pretend to recognise as a political offender a man taking the pay of the National Army whose gun, when he was a gunner in an armoured car when General Michael Collins was shot, mysteriously refused to fire and General Collins was murdered. This man a couple of weeks after was in charge of that same gun in that same car when a road was barricaded and rifle and machine-gun fire was played upon a military party. The General and another officer&mdash;possibly several&mdash;were out of the car, and this man's gun again mysteriously refused to fire.  Later on this man stole the car, took it over to the enemies of the State, and within a short time used that car and the gun in it, which had mysteriously refused to fire when it was in the service of the Army, against members of the National Army, with the result that eighteen men serving this State were either murdered&mdash;that is to say, were shot dead&mdash;or were wounded.  In no State at any time of a country's history would it be urged that&mdash;if I may use the phrase&mdash;the enemies on one side should demand that the traitors on the other&mdash;the men who had accepted the pay of the other side, and had stolen property and had been a party to the murder or wounding of eighteen men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am quite clear it cannot be done.  I consider I have displayed a certain amount of intelligence in not trying to do it.  At the same time, what Deputy O'Kelly proposes is, I think, manifestly an impossible proposition. Unless we have all a certain amount of patience we cannot get forward.  Our very presence here implies that we are prepared to debate even difficult subjects.  There are plenty of difficult subjects to be debated, but we must all be prepared to debate them upon some reasonable basis.  I was going to suggest, when the debate was resumed to-day, that interchanges across the floor are not a method of eliciting information as to the real position, and that by that method we could hardly get any solution of the question here at issue; if a solution is possible.

      <P>I rather regret I used the word murder.  The moral law, which is not of to-day or to-morrow but from all time, remains, and the consciences of the people can supply whatever epithet they like to any given act.  I have no doubt what the word should be.  The point is, I was giving some slight history of the mysterious failure of this gun to shoot.  Finally that car was taken by a man in the National Army, drawing the pay of the National Army.  Deputy Boland says that my reference to this is a very <Col N="1964" /> dangerous precedent.  It may be, God between us and harm, that the Fianna Fáil Party may come into power.  Does the Deputy think it is a dangerous precedent to lay down that the Army, acting under the orders of whatever Government the Irish people put in power, shall maintain discipline and that a man who acts as this person did shall do six years in prison?  I think the Deputy might say it is a dangerous precedent for the Party opposite when they come into power, and run the Army, to find that a man has only got six years for such an act.  This is a question of the internal discipline of the National Army.  It is a very serious and important national matter.  I do not see how any man is going to turn round and say that a man of the National Army who is a traitor, if I may use that word&mdash;and I do not think there is any other word to apply&mdash; should not be obliged to undergo the very minimum, I might almost say the ridiculously lenient sentence of six years' imprisonment.  I object to the application of the term political prisoner to a man like that.  His name was brought in frequently in this debate. The other side during the period of civil disturbances were on one side. We recognise that there was an organisation there and we said so far as that is concerned it is wiped out. We have not dictated and said that a man of theirs who was a commandant and might have been a traitor to them&mdash;the word does not apply in that case&mdash;must remain a commandant.  I do not see how they can come along at this time of the day and say that they are to decide exactly for themselves what should happen as to the people who were on our side and acted as traitors in these circumstances; although a great deal is said about good feeling and about the people outside and what they think, still I am very difficult to persuade that the Irish people will think that a man whose actions were such as I have set forth, suffered any grave injustice or that anything was done that should not have been done by that man doing a sentence of six years.  A great many of us have been in jail and on the run and we are not much impressed by these pathetic references.  We have <Col N="1965" /> been through it, and we know, of course, it is uncomfortable.  What I object to is the application of the term political prisoner in cases where the application of that term is definitely subversive of good order and good morality amongst the Irish people who do need to have some standard set up in 1928.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence has laboured the case of McPeake.  Now, McPeake was charged in court with, I think, the larceny of an armoured motor car.  He was not charged with being an accomplice in the death of General Michael Collins.  He was not charged with purposely jamming his machine gun.  If the Government at that time had any evidence whatever to show they could prove a case of that sort against McPeake, they certainly would have taken that action and made it the basis of their charge against him.  That was not the charge against him.  The jamming of a machine gun is not an unusual occurrence, as everyone knows, and there was not sufficient evidence to show that McPeake at that time was committing any act of foul play.  He was charged and condemned purely and simply on the grounds that he came over to the Republican side, that he was, technically speaking, during the war a deserter, and that when he came over he brought with him an armoured motor car.  As already pointed out, many people have been amnestied who committed almost exactly the same offence.  It is highly improper to go back on that decision and to bring up suspicions which are not grounded on proper evidence and to use these in this House to prejudice the minds of the public and the people here in a case which obviously arose directly out of the war.  It was an act of war, and the doer of that act should be amnestied now that we are trying to get back to an atmosphere of peace.  After all, if we are going to continue to close our minds like rat-traps and regard Republicans and extremists as criminals, we are not going to get peace in this country.  That is not going to solve anything. It is going to create an atmosphere where neither the Government nor the Opposition will have any control <Col N="1966" /> whatever over certain elements in the country.  It is absurd to say to any Party that they are to act as if they were officers of the police of the Government.</P>
      <P>We do not stand for the acts of criminals. We are here purposely and deliberately in order to get back to an atmosphere of peace, but anybody with any sense of vision and knowledge of Irish history must know that the way to get back is not by trying to impose red-tape restrictions or by trying to humiliate a certain section of the people.</P>
      <P>No matter how severe you are on these men, no matter how you try to keep them on the run, is that going to prevent the elements who stand for the use of violence from carrying on as they have been doing in the past?  Is it not rather going to foster an atmosphere in which the enemies of Ireland will take advantage of the situation and will use certain elements in this country against you, against us, and against the country as a whole?  After all, you and we have, or ought to have, a common interest.  We ought to take a steady view of this question, and not have imposed on you or on us any responsibility for things that have occurred, or that may occur, in the sense that we ought not to say that such a thing is your fault, and that, if such a thing happens, it is going to be our fault.  That mood is not going to get us into a state of peace.  We should consider the matter on common grounds.  There are many members on the opposite benches who understand the separatist mind, the type of mind represented by the Invincibles. The Minister for Finance was schooled in that line of thought. Other Ministers also understand it and know how difficult it is to get men with that mood on them away from it.  You are not going to do that except by the largest possible measure of leniency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember on one occasion I was in a law action, and a very distinguished counsel was advising.  A question of coming to a compromise arose and Mr. Timothy Healy, who was the counsel and whose advice, perhaps, may be taken by members opposite to-day, said: &ldquo;If you are going to do something generous, do it <Col N="1967" /> well, do it in a big way.&rdquo;  That is just where the Government at the moment is missing the bus.  What they are doing they are doing in a small way, in a half-hearted kind of way.  It takes as much courage to make peace as it takes to make war at times.  It takes even more courage.  It will, I admit, take a good deal of courage, and it is difficult.  I can understand the attitude of the Government, with its difficulties and grave responsibilities, as to whether one step will lead to another, whether if they do the generous thing it is not likely to be abused.  How can we answer that? We can only co-operate in trying to see peace brought to the country, and we think there should be a feeling of common citizenship and common interest based on a real act of generosity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOURKE Mr. BOURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Deputies who are responsible for putting down the resolution did not give very careful consideration to their proposal.  It seems to me that even if the Government were inclined to give sympathetic consideration to this proposal, the machinery proposed is probably the least satisfactory that could be proposed for the purpose.  I do not believe that any committee would be competent to deal with this matter.  If you are going to set up a committee to deal with it, it should be a judicial committee, a committee consisting of people trained in the taking of evidence and with the sanction of judicial experience behind them.  Apart from the fact that Deputies would not have that experience of taking evidence and would not have that sanction to which I refer it would be an invidious position in which to place them.  It would be open to the objection that they were acting from political or personal motives.  It is a question of public policy about which the Government alone has sufficient facts and knowledge of the conditions of the country to enable it to come to a proper decision. At the same time, I believe that Deputies opposite could give the Government considerable help in coming to that decision.  Deputy Boland gave a lead in that direction, but it was not followed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1968" /> If Deputies opposite gave a frank and clear statement of policy of their attitude towards insurrectionary movements in this country and towards organisations seeking to achieve their objective by other than constitutional means&mdash;if they gave that frank declaration once and for all&mdash;I believe it would be very helpful to the present Government.  One of the greatest difficulties with which the Government is confronted is that there are such a large number of people in this country who do not appear to care as to where politics ends and where crime begins.  In every civilised country there must be some line of demarcation between crime and politics, and if political parties refuse or neglect to draw that line the Government must draw it.  In doing so, it must take care that if it errs at all, it errs on the side of the safety of the State.  If the Fianna Fáil Deputies were in a position to control the policy of the Government they would be in exactly the same position, and they could not afford to take chances.</P>
    <P>While that is the state of affairs in the country all this talk during this debate and in previous debates about partisan administration, partisan police force and vindictive administration is unnecessary, if not actually dishonest. The Government gave an earnest of its sincerity in declaring for impartial administration and democratic control of our institutions in the attitude it adopted during the Army trouble of 1924.  As a result of its firm attitude on that occasion it can say to-day that we have as impartial administration, as impartial judiciary, and as impartial police force as are to be found in any country in the world.  However, when you have several organisations in the country all aiming at the same objective, one seeking to achieve it by constitutional measures with reservations &mdash;and, so far as I can gather, that is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; when you have another organisation seeking to achieve exactly the same ends by different measures; when you have an organisation resorting to such measures as the attacks on Civic Guards' barracks eighteen months or so ago, followed by the assassination of the late Minister for Justice, can we be <Col N="1969" /> surprised if the protective forces of the State feel themselves in duty bound to regard all organisations with that objective in view with a certain amount of suspicion?  Can we be surprised if the Government of the day hesitates to release prisoners who have been duly convicted, some of them for very serious crimes, and the less honourable of whom, we may take it for granted, will be inclined to regard that act as an indication of weakness and be encouraged by it to perhaps still more extreme measures?</P>
    <P>I was glad to learn that Deputy Aiken was anxious to find a common basis upon which all Parties could work for the peace and prosperity of the people.  Here again let us have clear ideas.  Economists may differ as to how far a policy of protection or a policy of free trade should be pursued, or how far a policy with an agricultural bias or an industrial bias should be pursued in order to increase prosperity in this country.  So far as I know, no economist has ever any doubt that you cannot have prosperity in a country which is a victim of intermittent revolution.  You cannot have prosperity without security, and you can no more have security in a country the soil of which is sown with dumps than you can have in a country which is sown with the proverbial dragon's teeth, particularly if one of the most influential Parties in the country is an accessory before and after the fact of the concealment of those dumps.  If we were in a position, as we should be in a position, to take it for granted that every Party in this Dáil, irrespective of what their ultimate aim might be, were, without any mental reservation, committed to development along constitutional lines, then we would have travelled a long road towards that unity and that peace for which all Parties are anxious, as far towards it, perhaps, as it would be healthy to travel in many democratic States.</P>
    <P>If we had that assurance, the Government would be sufficiently strengthened to take a more sympathetic view of this question of the release of the prisoners than they can be expected to take at the present moment, but while there is a doubt left in the minds of the Government as to <Col N="1970" /> what is the attitude of Parties in this Dáil, can they be blamed if they consider that any step of this kind should be regarded as unduly foolhardy?  As I say, we are all anxious for peace and for unity, and I hope that some Deputy on the opposite Benches will get up and follow the lines of Deputy Boland's speech, and be perhaps a little more specific.  If that ideal is going to be achieved, a beginning will have to made somewhere and somehow. In my opinion, the proper place to make a beginning is here and now. Until our own house is set in order we cannot expect that people outside the Dáil are going to pay very much attention to our advice on this or similar matters.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I am going to get into the cross-fire.  Candidly, I had hoped half an hour ago that I would not have an opportunity of speaking at all.  I think this debate should have closed half an hour ago.  I would rather remember the statements made by the President and Deputy Boland, far rather remember them, and what was in them, than the statements made by the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Defence.  I do not think that I can add much to what has been said in the matter of argument about the setting up of this Committee, or for the setting up of some Committee that would consider the pros and cons of the position of the men who are at present in jail. We have, I think, on all sides of the House a perfect understanding in our minds that there is a set of men in jail who did things not for any personal advantage they might gain from the doing of those things, or from any personal advantage that might accrue to them, but simply because they believed in the circumstances that operated at the time they were doing their duty, simply because they understood at the time that they were endeavouring to secure a political advantage, and to make use of that political advantage for their Party.  Each one of us knows that a certain set of these people are in prison clearly under these circumstances, because these actions should not be considered isolated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These actions should be considered <Col N="1971" /> in connection with the special circumstances which surrounded the doing of these actions.  We see that there is a certain set of moral laws operating throughout the whole world, which I might liken to Standing Orders of conduct for the whole population of the world, but these things are suspended occasionally, and in abnormal circumstances these actions are to be considered rather as acts of heroism than as offences against the law.  I think if abnormal circumstances had not prevailed at certain times some members who are sitting on the Government Benches to-day might find themselves charged with offences that, only for the abnormal circumstances that prevailed, would not have been considered acts of heroism but offences against the law.</P>
    <P>I would also like to say to both sides that they are perhaps pressing each other too far.  I think the President and the Minister for Finance made a very generous gesture in this matter. I think that Deputy Boland and, possibly Deputy MacEntee, on the other side, also made generous statements, but trying to force from each other in this Dáil statements which clearly no Party will make, or endeavouring to force statements from each Party which neither will make, is surely not the way to get the matter settled.  The men we are anxious about are the men who have been convicted and who had political motives. Clearly, there is nobody else in the minds of the people who are advocating this Committee but men who did acts for political advantage and for nothing else.  I have some difficulty in speaking on this matter.  I do not want to say anything that will create anything but an atmosphere that will bring about what is very desirable&mdash; that will not alone make it possible to set up this Committee, but that will render it possible for that Committee to work, and for the men who are at present on the run and in jail to fall into line with whatever we decide here.</P>
    <P>Statements have been made regarding amnesty.  I want to put this to the Government as strongly as I may.  The Government, in its Amnesty Resolution, <Col N="1972" /> did relieve from responsibilities, or from punishment, people on their own side as well as people on the other side who were in arms against them.  I put it to the Government that this is a time when they are not asked to relieve from punishment any persons on their own side.  I would say to them: &ldquo;Here is a time when you are asked to be generous towards your opponents; when you are asked to advance one step further and to give to your opponents something that you are not extending to your own supporters. Here is a time for generosity.  Here is a time when you can show that you have a big and wide outlook and that you are not prejudiced against those who took part against you, who were anxious to unseat you and who possibly did their best to bring that about.  Here is a time for your generosity, for full consideration, for clearness of vision and for generosity of outlook and of action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are men in jail who are suffering a great deal.  Some suffering is imposed upon them which I feel is not necessary.  Some time before Christmas the father of a boy who is at present in jail for what I know was a political offence approached me and stated that for some two months he had not heard from this boy.  We can imagine the anxiety of a father for a boy whom he has not heard from for a couple of months, from whom there are no messages or letters, and who cannot receive visitors.  I interested myself in the matter, both by interview and letter. On the 15th December I received a letter stating:</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Justice to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant regarding the case of&mdash;&mdash;.  In reply, I am to state that the necessary inquiry will be made into the case and a decision come to.  The decision will be communicated to you in due course.</P>
    <P>That was on the 15th December, 1927. I have not heard the decision yet, and the father of the boy has not heard the decision.  I understand that no correspondence of any kind is permitted, and that he is not allowed to have interviews or to receive papers.  No <Col N="1973" /> intercourse is permitted between that boy and his family.</P>
    <P>This is a matter in which the Government cannot be accused of having personal feelings towards their own followers.  This is a matter in which other people are concerned.  I put it to the Government that they would show real statesmanship and generosity by setting up this Committee and making it possible for the Committee to work and to arrive at a decision which, as well as being impartial, will bring benefit to the nation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Little informed us to-night of a phrase used by a distinguished lawyer who was recently a very honoured citizen of this State.  He said that if you are going to effect a compromise it is best to do the generous and the big thing.  There are two sides to this matter.  There is something to be expected of the two sides.  We want to see the generosity and the big things that are going to be done by those who can speak, or who think they can speak, for the people under discussion at the moment.  I have very little hope that Deputy Little will do anything very big or generous, considering his reaction to what was urged by the Minister for Defence here.  The Minister for Defence said that one thing might, at least, ease the situation&mdash;if an assurance could be got that if any Deputy on the other side, or any of the people with whom they have influence, came into possession of information which might lead to the tracking down of the murderers of the late Kevin O'Higgins they would hand that information over. What is Deputy Little's reaction to that?  To do that, he says, would be to make oneself more or less an agent of the police&mdash;a thing that is enjoined on every man in this House.</P>

      <P>My answer to that was that to undertake to do that&mdash; there might be circumstances when one could undertake to do a thing like that &mdash;would put one into a position of odium altogether.  It is really a matter for one's personal conscience as a citizen as to what he would do if circumstances like those arose.  But it is <Col N="1974" /> very unfair to try to put a whole Party in a position in which they are required to give a certain undertaking. It would be unfair to impose that on the Labour Party, for instance.  What the individual conscience would do on a question like that would be quite a different matter.</P>

      <P>Here we have a very distinguished member of this House and a very distinguished citizen of the State murdered in a way that drew down the condemnation of pretty well everybody who spoke.  We ask here: Can we get an assurance that if Deputies on the other side&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;; there is no implication&mdash; come into possession of information which would lead to the arrest of the murderers of the late Minister for Justice, they will pass that information on?  In reply to that, we have the remark of Deputy Cooney about a man becoming an informer.  That is a state of mind which it is impossible to deal with.  One cannot be generous with that type of person.  Is there anybody here who, after the remark of Deputy Cooney, would ask us to be generous in this matter of political prisoners? If the reaction is that of Deputy Cooney to the demand made by the Minister for Defence, it is nothing more than to say that people by concealment do not become accessories to the crime of the murder of the late Minister for Justice.  I do not say that Deputy Little has anything like the mentality of Deputy Cooney.  Deputy Little has made a statement which I <Col N="1976" /> cannot understand.  He, apparently, thinks that there may be a set of circumstances in which a man could bind himself ahead, but he cannot say what those circumstances would be.  The thing is so clear&mdash;the murder was so foul&mdash;that I cannot possibly see how anybody obtaining information could possibly refuse to give it.  That is the reaction in this House towards the request made by the Minister for Defence. That is not a matter affecting compromise or concession, but it is a simple matter of people doing their duty.</P>

      <P>I hope there is nobody other than Deputy Cooney who thinks it is not his duty to give evidence in such a case if evidence comes into his possession.  That is the response. We have heard a lot of talk about people who have escaped from Mountjoy.  Quite a clever attempt has been made to create sympathy with people who are now out of jail, having escaped&mdash;having walked out when the doors were open, as we have been told. It is put to Deputies here: Would anybody refuse to do likewise if he was in a similar position?  An attempt is made to get sympathy for these people on that statement of the position.  Surely it is pertinent to inquire&mdash;this does not cut across any terms or agreements that may hereafter be come to with regard to people who may really and legitimately be called political prisoners&mdash; with regard to some of these men who are now walking about, having escaped from Mountjoy, why they were previously in Mountjoy?  I take the case of four men who escaped from Mountjoy Prison in November, 1925&mdash;Fitzgerald, Murphy and two persons called McCabe.  One of these men has since been recaptured.  The two McCabes and Fitzgerald are at large.  What were they in Mountjoy for?  They kidnapped a particular man because he was bankrupt&mdash;kidnapped him by force of arms &mdash;and held him in their possession for a considerable period.  Their treatment was such that he had to go into hospital when released from their hands.  That all happened in 1924.  This man, Manly, was detained in various places in the <Col N="1977" /> Counties of Westmeath, Longford, Meath and Cavan until November, 1924. Part of the statement of this man as to his treatment when in possession of these men who were convicted by judge and jury for being concerned in this kidnapping, was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Two men came in.  One asked, &ldquo;Is this the prisoner?&rdquo; and another said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; One man, purporting to be a doctor, examined me and said I was sound and fit for a lot of abuse.  The blindfold was then taken off me and I was left there until 4 p.m. on the following evening.  About 4 p.m. the next evening, the little fellow came in and blindfolded me again.  Soon after two other men came in and asked had I my beads.  I said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Take it in your hands,&rdquo; and I did.  He then said, &ldquo;Take this in your other hand,&rdquo; handing me a revolver.  He then opened my shirt, took the revolver out of my hand, placed the muzzle against my breast, and said, &ldquo;You are to answer all questions truthfully.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was subjected to that type of treatment two or three times.  In 1924, people with arms arrest a man because he is a bankrupt and because, by kidnapping him, they think they can bring pressure to bear upon his brother to pay his debts.  They hold him and bring him backward and forward through the country for several months. He is finally found and these people are convicted by judge and jury and sentenced. Where is the political taint or the political flavour about that case?</P>

      <P>Deputies on the other side have spoken as if all those prisoners could be described as political. Here are four of them.  They kidnapped an old man, rushed him and harried him around the country and put him, finally, in such a state that he had to be removed to hospital when discovered.  This man was kidnapped in order to put pressure on his brother to pay his debts.  We are told that this is to be regarded as a political matter, that this was politics.  How can this be described as politics?  Deputy Ryan has doubts as to whether this is a political case or not, but Deputy Ruttledge has none, and neither has Deputy Allen.  They have mentioned the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another of these prisoners who is still at large is a gentleman called Lee.  A certain film came to this town which Mr. Lee did not like&mdash;the Ypres film. He stole it.  He committed larceny to the extent of £120 and he was convicted by a jury and sentenced to imprisonment for a certain period. Does that mean that for all time we are going to have established a condition here that anybody who objects to a <Col N="1980" /> picture, even though it may have some title that relates to the Great War, is entitled to steal it&mdash;is entitled to run away with other people's property and destroy that property?  When such a man is sentenced to imprisonment and escapes from jail, is the crime for which he was sent to jail going to be covered by a resolution of this kind because he happens to be in the category of &ldquo;escaped prisoners,&rdquo; or because it is claimed that he is a political prisoner on the run?  I do not know whether the case referred to as that of &ldquo;the old man with the car&rdquo; has reference to the man who helped him with a motorcar. A man with a car assisted in that particular larceny.  Are these men to be covered by this resolution?  They are brought in by those who talk about &ldquo;escaped prisoners.&rdquo;  There was no discrimination made as between the escaped prisoners.  The November escape was apparently planned to release prisoners, regarded by those who planned the escape as political.  There are two more of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to a man called Carolan.  Carolan was convicted and sentenced for the organisation of an illegal force.  Carolan's is a case that might be described as political. The Minister for Finance said that if one were to judge from Deputy Aiken's statement, Carolan, if released, would immediately set out upon his old career again.  Have we any indication that he will not?  When that indication comes, certainly a new attitude should be taken and will be taken towards Carolan.  If we are asked to do the big thing and be generous, is Carolan prepared to do the big thing and be generous?  Are the people who think they can speak for Carolan prepared to do the big thing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Better not answer it now.  I am sure that he is not going to approach me.  If Carolan is prepared to adopt another type of life when he comes out, let that be stated on authority.  Carolan is one of the men in Mountjoy towards whom another attitude may be taken, but one would have to get something more than a mere statement by Deputy Boland as to what he believes.  There will have to be some reason shown for it.  That can be done.  Carolan can be treated in a different way.  We come now to the case of Seán McGuinness.  He was arrested for assaulting the Civic Guards.  He assaulted them under arms in April, 1924.  He escaped from Mountjoy, is at large, and he was one of the men whom this resolution was proposed to cover.  We have seen in the last day or two how that gentleman has written to the papers to repudiate certain things stated by Deputy Lemass in this House.  If we can believe that McGuinness is converted to any other type of life, if we can believe that McGuinness is going to abandon force of arms against any Government that comes into operation in this country under present conditions good and well; if not, is there any reason why every effort should not be made to keep McGuinness and put him back into Mountjoy and make him serve every day of whatever sentence was <Col N="1982" /> imposed upon him?  If McGuinness had not written to the papers, he would have been one of the people whom this resolution certainly would have been taken as covering.  He would have been taken to be one whom the remarks of Deputy Boland would cover and that one could look for a different attitude from.  It is now quite evident that he is recalcitrant at this moment, and that being the case he cannot be included in any list of people who are going to be treated in a different way, the consideration on the prisoners' side being that they are going to adopt some new, some less aggressive attitude, some passive attitude, towards the State.</P>
      <P>Other people who were in Mountjoy and took part in the escape are O'Hara and O'Byrne.  They were arrested, tried and convicted for much the same offence as Carolan&mdash;the organisation of illegal forces and for possession of documents relating to them.  That was much later than when Carolan was arrested. Perhaps it might be about the same time as Carolan was arrested in July, 1925.  These people were convicted and these are all judge and jury convictions; the sentences are all sentences of a judge after the jury had found. These people escaped and it is not right or proper that we should have these people clouded over by the simple statement that they are men on the run because they, as naturally anyone would do, walked out of the jail gates. One must go back and see what are the offences for which they were arrested. The offences must be looked at.  The same remarks would apply to O'Hara and O'Byrne as to Carolan.  Any new attitude, any passive attitude towards the State, would be followed by some different type of treatment.  Is there anybody in this House who wants any big or generous gesture towards people who are incapable of making a big or generous gesture themselves in return?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two others.  There is a man called Patrick Ryan who committed an armed attack on Guards at Enniscorthy in June, 1925, and the man who rescued Ryan afterwards. Are we going to have it alleged here that it is a political matter to assault the Guards with arms at such a date as 1925?  If that is going to be considered <Col N="1983" /> politics, when is that type of political offence to end?  When are we to get away from the sporadic raids on Gardaí barracks?  Is there any indication when that happens in 1925 that there is any appreciation of a State having been founded, a Government having been instituted, that Government being the authority to control the forces of law and order?  The Minister for Finance put it quite clearly that if one could find that there was an appreciation of that fact&mdash;of the establishment of the State and the position of any Government in the State, of any type of Government&mdash;that then there was obviously the follow-on from that, that there was no necessity for these secret or semi-secret military organisations, and the further follow-on is that there is no necessity for people to be playing around with documents which deal with these military organisations.</P>
    <P>Sporadic outbreaks and attacks on Guards can be closely connected with documents that were found.  A man who makes an attack on the Guards has only gone a little bit further on the road following instructions contained in the documents dealing with organisation and preparations.  These documents are given to him from time to time and the two types of offences are very similar.  One man takes part in the open attack and the other man has the documents containing instructions for the open attack.  Until we get some situation in which these people are going definitely to say&mdash;it does not matter where they say it&mdash;that they are not going to attack the State in any unconstitutional way&mdash;until that point is reached, there can be no big or generous gesture towards people of that type.  I do not see how any claim for political prisoners can be made to include the three or four men who were engaged in the kidnapping of Manly, the men who stole films and the man whose motor car was associated with the larceny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KILLILEA</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this question on the adjournment, I want to point out, first of all, that I have not got any satisfactory answer to any part of the question I asked the Parliamentary Secretary this morning. My question was to ask the Minister for Fisheries if he will state whether there are any men employed as gangers in County Galway under the Irish Land Commission, who own farms of twenty acres of land or more, and if so, if he will state the number.  Now he has absolutely refused to do either <Col N="1985" /> of these two things in the reply he gave to me.  I further asked him in view of the present position of unemployment in that county, if he will consider the advisability of employing men on such work, who have no land or other means of livelihood other than such work, and his reply was: &ldquo;In the interest of the efficient supervision of the men engaged in improvement works, it is essential for the Land Commission to secure men of experience and reliability as gangers.  It occasionally happens that some gangers temporarily employed are small farmers, but their employment is generally necessary owing to their experience and their satisfactory record.&rdquo; Now, I did not ask anything at all in regard to that answer, and there is no part of that answer a reply to the question that I asked.  As I pointed out a few seconds ago, I asked for the number of the men who own land of twenty acres and more.  There was no reply given to that.  I hold that there is great injustice being done to men all over the County Galway, and I suppose all other counties, if I could speak for outside of Galway.  The men who are unemployed and who have no hope of employment, and men I hold who are capable of doing this work just as efficiently as the men who are employed. should be given that work.  First of all, I do not know what their experience is, or where these gangers got their experience when they started off. Secondly, I know men who were appointed as gangers, and the only qualification they had at the time was that they had served in the National Army.  That is the qualification they had.  I am not going to say whether the men who were in the National Army should, or should not, get the position.  I hold, and I think the House or the Deputies who are present will agree with me, that the men who are capable of doing the work should be the only men who should get the positions.  Well, first of all, I know men who are employed as gangers who own fifty acres of land or more.  Every Deputy listening to me knows that there are men capable of doing the work that these men are doing, and these men are walking about with no work, and they have nothing at all for <Col N="1986" /> a living.  On a job of this kind there is such a thing as a supervising ganger. There is a ganger in charge of three or four roads, and his duty is to see that these men working under him make the road according to specification.</P>
      <P>I do not see where the question of experience comes in there.  There were men working for the Irish Land Commission and for the old Congested Districts Board who had no land, nothing but their jobs a few years ago.  That would be up to six or eight years ago. Later on these men were given farms of land.  The Parliamentary Secretary may get up in a moment or two and tell me that they had holdings previously, and that they got an increase of land out of the lands that were divided.  But here, and now, I want to state that I can name the people who had no holdings of land at all, and had no qualifications at all, but at the present time when there is an election on, they probably get out and do canvassing or other work necessary for the Cumann na nGaedheal candidates in the county.  Those are about the only qualifications some of those men have. We had a debate here some time ago on the matter of unemployment, about men who were unemployed throughout Ireland.  We fought on that matter, and we heard it repeated over and over again here, and men on the opposite benches told us that it was the duty of the Government to find employment for all men willing and able to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, taking a farmer and giving him a position like this is finding work for the unemployed, I wonder where we are, and I wonder what we are doing here.  I wonder why we do not get out. The other day there was a debate on these benches and Deputy Maguire gave the details of the qualifications of ganger, and he told us he knew a man who, a week before the election, came out and went into a village and said: &ldquo;This road is going to be done.  I have got a certain amount of money for it.&rdquo;  That man would be President of a Cumann na nGaedheal Branch.  He said that he had got a certain amount of money for that road, and he said: &ldquo;I am going to be the ganger.&rdquo;  His son would be the supervising ganger. That man was qualified for work and <Col N="1987" /> capable to carry on the work because he was President of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation.  If this is the way that we are going to look after unemployment, then I say God help the unemployed.  I have not very much further to add.  There is no need for me to go any further into details.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary when he is making such appointments in future not to take into consideration whether this man belongs to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or the Fianna Fáil Party or the National League or any other organisation.  I would simply ask him to find out what the qualifications of the man are, and then appoint the man who is suitable.  I am not asking him to put any man who is incapable of doing his work into one of these positions.  But there are plenty of men walking about with their hands in their pockets not able to earn a halfpenny, and these men are able to do this work, and I hope that they will be considered in the future when gangers are being appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrSeanTubridy" hpid="Dr. TUBRIDY Dr. TUBRIDY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. TUBRIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words about this matter in reference to the way the money has been spent on the relief works and on the appointment of the gangers down the country. This is important to every member of this House who does not belong to the Government Party, but it is much more important to members who come from the Gaeltacht, where the people are illiterate and vote illiterate.  I do not want to take in the whole of the Gaeltacht and I do not want to take in Connemara, but I will give a few examples as to how these appointments were made in my own district.  I will give nine or ten instances within a radius of a few miles of my house.  It was said that the qualification necessary for a ganger was experience.  There were ten works started within five miles of my house.  The nearest one was on a road.  The man appointed was Patrick Flaherty.  His only qualification was that he was an ex-C.I.D. man.  I do not know whether he is entitled to the &ldquo;ex-&rdquo; or not.  His father is a publican and he is also a steward over a fishery.  The man is well off.  He has a publichouse and is <Col N="1988" /> a steward to a fishery, and the only qualification the son had was that he was a C.I.D. man.  He was appointed as one of the gangers.  My next case is that of a road started on the unemployment grant.  The man in charge of that road was Sergeant Connolly of the R.I.C.  He may have gained experience of some sort of ganger's work in the R.I.C.  He has a pension of about £200 a year, and he is the only man in the place with £200 a year, or even £100 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might as well say that every one of the men I mentioned were personating agents for Cumann na nGaedheal at the last election.  My third case is that of a man named Derann, an ex-soldier of the National Army, who served eighteen months for killing an old woman over seventy years of age.  His only qualification was that he acted as a personating agent at the last election. Some of these people, I admit, had a little experience on the preelection roads, but that was all.  The next case is that of Bartley Flaherty, who was dismissed for inefficiency as a ganger by the county council, but he proved so efficient as a personating agent that he was appointed by the Land Commission in charge of a gang working on a scheme at Cluas.  In the Island of Gorumna there were two other gangers appointed.  Festy McDonagh and another McDonagh, two personating agents for Cumann na nGaedheal.  In Carraroe the two personating agents for Cumann na nGaedheal, Myles MacDonagh and Pat MacHale, were also appointed gangers. MacDonagh is the only man I know there who has a banking account.  He is so well off that he had to get a man to work on his farm while he was employed as a ganger.  Rumour has it, but I cannot vouch for it, that the man working in his place should have been working on the gang.  I have mentioned nine cases.  The tenth is Coleman Mannion, another supporter.  I am not sure about him, but I know that the other nine men who got these jobs as gangers were personating agents, and that that was their only qualification. I went to the engineer and asked him why they were picked out as gangers, and he said he was not <Col N="1989" /> allowed to appoint the gangers.  That may or may not have been correct.  I think that evidence is sufficient.  I am not referring to all of the Gaeltacht, but only to ten roads started within five miles of my own home.</P>

      <P>Deputy Killilea and myself are agreed upon this, namely, that it is only capable and competent men who should be appointed as gangers and put in charge of these works.  I am quite satisfied that the men appointed were all capable and competent men.  They were practically in all cases experienced men and men who had been working for the Congested Districts Board for many years, and some of them have been working for the Land Commission for three or four years past.  If you are to spend relief money to the best advantage, and if you are to give immediate relief, and relief to the maximum amount of the expenditure allowed, the only people to appoint over the works are competent and experienced men.  We know to our cost that relief money has been squandered because incompetent gangers were appointed who did not know how to control the men and spend the money to the best advantage.  We have had to dispense with the services of men of this kind.  I instructed the Land Commission engineers this year to appoint none but efficient and competent men as gangers, and I am perfectly satisfied, as a result of the reports I received, that the men appointed have given ample and complete satisfaction.  It seems to me that <Col N="1994" /> the point is this.  It is not a question, from the limited material at our disposal, as to who the men we appointed were, but whether these men were competent and reliable.  It seems to me that that is the real point.  You can not base a charge against the Land Commission administration of the relief grant on any other ground. Deputy Killilea said it was only men who were unemployed that should be engaged as gangers.  As a matter of fact, it is the usual practice in Galway, and in every other county in the Free State, to employ as gangers men who have no other means of livelihood, and those are the men who are kept employed constantly, practically all the year round.  These are the men engaged by us constantly on improvement works over the twenty-six counties. We find it necessary to shift some of them from one county to another because of their experience.  We have recently shifted an exceedingly experienced and competent ganger from Mayo to Kerry to carry out difficult works there.  In addition, we did employ a few men with twenty-acre holdings in Galway.  After all, I know some farmers in Galway who have twenty acre holdings, and the valuations do not amount to 5/-.  It is not a question of the size of the holding; it is a question of the valuation that decides the question whether a man is entitled to employment or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>They were men who got holdings from the Land Commission recently.  An estate has been recently divided by the Land Commission. One of them, as a matter of fact, is a very old and experienced official of the Land Commission, was working with the C.D.B. originally, and has been working with the Land Commission since the C.D.B. was transferred to the Land Commission.  As to the other man I do not know the circumstances so very well.  A point I want to make is that the men employed on these works in Galway, Mayo, Sligo and in every county where relief moneys are spent are all small farmers. Very often it happens that a man with a holding of 20 acres is very much more in need of employment than a man with probably only two or three acres of land.  It depends entirely on the valuation.</P>

      <P>&mdash;In parts of Galway, yes.  At all events the money has undoubtedly been spent to the very best advantage.  The men who were put in charge of the relief works generally have given complete satisfaction. Deputies must remember the difficulties under which we had to undertake the expenditure of the money.  First of all, the money was not made available for expenditure until about the beginning of the year.  Then engineers had to prepare the schemes on which the money was to be spent.  Gangers were then appointed at once, in order that the work might be completed before 31st March.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>In nearly every instance they were old gangers, all men of experience, and they were the <Col N="1996" /> only men to be appointed.  There is no use taking a man from a town or a city and putting him in charge of these works.  He might squander £200 on a work that could be completed for £50. If you are going to spread money around to the best possible extent and to give the maximum employment you must appoint men of experience to take control of the works and to see that the money is spent to the best advantage.  There is no use in appointing young inexperienced men.  You must appoint a man who is capable of controlling the men under him.  He must have a little bit of personality, and must be a degree above the men working under him if you are going to have the works carried out efficiently. You must take all these factors into consideration.  The gangers employed throughout the country on improvement works all the year round are very efficient men who have been selected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In this case an appeal was decided on the 22nd of October, 1927.  It was determined that the claimant was not entitled to any pension, as it was not clear on the evidence submitted that she had attained the statutory age.  Her name was not found in a search covering the years 1843 to 1867 in the Baptismal Register. The only members of her family whose names were found were Mary, baptised 15th September, 1844, and Francis, baptised 28th July, 1850.  The years 1845, 1846, 1847, and part of 1848, are, however, missing from the Register.</P>
      <P>While the appeal was under consideration special attention was given to the investigation of age, but the claimant was apparently unable to get anyone to vouch for her age except her relatives, and the two relatives who made declarations were not much more than 60 years of age.</P>
      <P>The case can only be revived by the making of a fresh claim in the usual way, if further evidence is now available. It should, however, be noted that while every assistance is given to claimants the onus of proof of qualification lies on them.</P>

      <P>An appeal was decided on the 18th of January, 1928, in this case.

      <P>An appeal was decided on the 7th of December, 1927, in this case.  It was determined that the claimant was not entitled to any pension, as it was not clear on the evidence submitted that his means, as calculated under the Old Age Pensions Acts, were within the statutory limit (of £39 5s. a year) for the receipt of a pension.</P>

      <P>This pensioner was originally in receipt of an old age pension of 6/- a week, the value of his maintenance being estimated at 14/- a week.  Under the review which took place in accordance with the provisions of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1924, the pension was, therefore, reduced to 2/- a week.</P>
      <P>A question raised by the pensioner for an increase was disallowed by the Lisselton Pension Sub-Committee on the 25th of May, 1925, and their decision was confirmed on appeal on the 14th of July, 1925.</P>
      <P>A further question by the pensioner was also disallowed on appeal on the 24th of February, 1927, as he failed to show that his means had in any way decreased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is maintained on a farm of 39 acres (Poor Law Valuation, £12 10s.) which he assigned to his son on the <Col N="1870" /> 19th of February, 1924, on the occasion of the latter's marriage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he is aware that landing facilities are needed for small fishing-boats at Mullaghduff, County Donegal; whether he has received a report thereupon; and whether he can arrange for the speedy erection of a slip.</P>

      <P>After a careful survey of the site of the suggested landing place at Mullaghduff, County Donegal, I have come to the conclusion that the cost of providing such a slip would be much heavier than the amount of fishing carried on there would warrant. There is ample accommodation for large and small boats at Gortnasate, which is within 1½ miles from Mullaghduff.</P>
