      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state the number of applications he has received for new telephones in the Rathmines township for the six months ending the 31st March last; also the number of new subscribers added during <Col N="138" /> this period, and the number still awaiting connections in this area on the date mentioned.</P>

      <P>The telephone area served by the Rathmines Exchange comprises practically the whole of the Rathmines urban district. The number of waiting applicants for exchange lines in that area on the 1st October, 1927, was 53, and the number of additional applications received during the next six months was 89, making a total of 142.  In that period of six months, 82 subscribers' agreements were accepted, 71 of whom have been provided with service, and 11 lines are in course of erection.  The number of outstanding applications on the 31st of March last was, therefore, 60.  There is difficulty at present in providing lines for new subscribers in the Rathmines area owing to the want of spare wires in the underground cables and to the facts that the spare equipment in the Exchange is very limited and that the existing building does not afford room for extension. Proposals are under consideration for the erection of a new Exchange and steps have been taken for the laying down of additional cables.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there have been expressions of dissatisfaction, but I accept the Deputy's word that that is the case. The number of telephones is restricted by the exigencies of the accommodation at the Rathmines Exchange. Plans are ready for the extension of that Exchange.  Until the Exchange is extended, it will not be possible for us to meet fully the claims of the inhabitants of the Rathmines district.  We will proceed with the utmost expedition in order to meet their requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advising the Executive Council to adopt the recommendations in favour of legislation dealing with short weight and measure and am considering whether the recommendations in favour of marking certain imported articles of food with their country of origin can be incorporated in Merchandise Marks legislation.  As to the main recommendation of the Tribunal in favour of the establishment of a Permanent Prices Board, I agree with that part of the Report which says that such a board should not entail any large expenditure of funds but not with the part which indicates that the Board proposed would involve only a small cost.  I am further of opinion that the composition proposed for the Board would not be the most effective for its intended functions and that its essential requirement would be persons of some experience in trade costings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> Having regard to past experience, I am not prepared to advise the setting up of a board to investigate prices otherwise than on a prima facie case being established by representative consumers that unreasonable prices are being charged.  The expense of a permanent board pursuing continuous inquiries on behalf of the public would be out of all proportion to the interest which the public has hitherto shown in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether or not it is proposed to take any action with regard to the recommendation that the dealers in certain classes of goods should be compelled to exhibit the prices of those articles in their shops?  Has that come under consideration at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole matter is still under consideration in the sense that it is still before the Executive Council.  No definite decision has been come to.  On that point, I was prepared to make a recommendation also, but not so far-reaching as that which the Report contains.  It seems to me that owing to the number of articles that a trader might have to mark there would be an undue burden put upon him in return for any benefit that might accrue to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>

      <P>On the 30th March, the final day of the last session.  I made certain personal charges against the Minister for Industry and Commerce which, upon investigation, I found to be untrue.

I desire also to say that I recognise that, ordinarily, a member's word should be accepted regarding his own conduct, and that I should have taken that course on that occasion in deference to the ordinary parliamentary forms.

      <P>&ldquo;As you are aware, it was I who signalled to you to pull up your car, which you did.  Obviously, therefore, these statements are assumed to have been made by me.

Surely it is not that Deputy Shaw would insinuate in deference to so many members on his own benches that a change of thought from one Party to another was a disqualifying asset.  The only other possible idea which he could have had was that association with Cumann na nGaedheal was a discreditable thing.  If that be the motive, I am in a position to clear his mind of any doubt on the matter. I was not a member of Cumann na nGaedheal a year or a year and a half ago, or at any time since its inception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, I referred to the manner in which the Land Commission had distributed public funds and I made reference to some instances that I considered, and that I am sure the House will consider, very glaring and unjust. I shall just mention another one which refers to relief works undertaken at Killabuggy.  Last year application was made to a farmer in that district for permission to carry a relief road over his land.  He gave permission on the understanding that certain men, who on previous occasions had been refused work because of their political views, should on this occasion be accepted as workers on the roads.  That agreement was sanctioned by the road ganger and also by the supervising ganger.  The road was undertaken last year, and in order to continue it this year a further grant was made, but the road having gone over this man's land, no longer was the contract observed, with the result that these men, who had been deprived of work on previous occasions, <Col N="148" /> were dismissed this year and others taken on in their place.</P>
    <P>Last December I had occasion, owing to representations made to me, to bring before the notice of the Land Commission or the Inspector responsible that certain irregularities were taking place in certain districts.  On that occasion I was accompanied by two other Deputies, and also by a clergyman.  We interviewed the head of the Department responsible and I stated the grievance. He undertook to have the matter investigated.  The grievance was that supervising gangers in this area were men of a political caste, and had consistently on previous occasions refused to engage on these works men who did not belong to a particular organisation. The officer in charge stated that he held the opinion that no person violently associated with any political party should be engaged in the capacity of a road ganger or a supervising ganger. In this particular case the supervising ganger was a man who in the June election had violently opposed my holding a meeting in his own Chapel area. I had been a witness of this myself, and I was informed later that he had actually assaulted supporters of ours after leaving the meeting.  The same thing occurred in September.  I mentioned these facts to the Inspector, and he promised to investigate the matter. On his own assertion, that no man violently associated with any political party should be employed by his Department as a ganger or supervising ganger, I asked him to investigate these statements, but nothing has resulted from it.  These statements are very serious, and I do not make them on the spur of the moment.  I have striven since I came to occupy the position of Deputy to get the Land Commission to investigate these cases and bring about justice, but I have failed.  I can understand how easy it is to make a statement here and to put a Minister into an awkward position in making a reply. That is not my motive.  But I do feel that where public money is being spent it should be spent in such a manner as would not give rise to the feeling that public money was being used for the purpose of bolstering up one political party as against another.  All I ask in <Col N="149" /> this case is that a public inquiry be held, and if I am not able to substantiate every statement I made to-day&mdash; and I regard these statements as very serious&mdash;before any just court, then I am prepared to make object apology.</P>

      <P>My charge is not against the Deputy on the opposite side of the House.  My charge is that public moneys have been used by a public department in this State for the purpose of bolstering up one political organisation against another.  I say that is unfair and unjust and not in accordance with honesty.  It is for the purpose of having honest and fair administration of public funds made possible that I bring forward the charge.  If Ministers or Deputies on the other side feel that it applies to themselves and that they like this sort of thing to continue, or if they feel they have a hand in it, and do not want a public investigation into the matter, that is not my affair, it is their own.  I ask for a public inquiry, and if I am not able to substantiate the statements before a sworn inquiry, then I am prepared to make an object apology to any Deputy opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not personal grievances, but matters of public importance.  There are public funds involved in this Vote to the extent of three-quarters of a million and portion of that money is spent in the way I outlined.  How do we know that all the money is not spent in similar shady circumstances?  I referred yesterday to the manner in which land had been hastily purchased at exorbitant prices, and I insinuated, as I had just ground for insinuating, that the haste and the high prices were due to pressure on the part of landlords who were in tight <Col N="150" /> corners on the Land Commission to take them out of a predicament. I instanced one case which is only typical of many.  That was a case in which a man had applied in the ordinary way to the Land Court for a judicial tenancy and the fixing of a fair rent.  While that case was being heard in the court the Land Commission had bought over the estate.  The reduction made in this tenant's favour was of such a character that the Land Commission refused to give him any benefit from it when they had completed the purchase, on the ground that the award he had got as a judicial applicant before the courts was too great.  If there is any justification for that, surely it cannot be claimed that the Land Commission were operating with any sense of fair play towards the tenant.  The only inference that can be drawn is that the Land Commission acted hastily with the object of securing an unreasonable price in favour of the landlord.  If the Land Commission held back a little while, as one would expect them to do in the ordinary way, and allowed him to receive that reduction in his rent which he was awarded, and gave him the benefit of that in his purchase, and if that were applied to all the other tenants on the estate how much would their annuities be reduced proportionately to-day?</P>

      <P>May I ask a question for the purpose of information? Before the Deputy leaves that point, may I ask him if he is referring to operations under the 1923 Act, because under the 1923 Act the Fair Rent Courts were abolished, and no tenant could apply to have a fair rent fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister quite understands me.  I am not referring entirely to the 1923 Act. The 1923 Act was the culminating point in this man's destruction.  It was in 1911 that this contract was entered into for the purchase of the estate originally, and the tenant refused, and apparently had a right to do so, under the Act of 1903, to sign the consent, because he was not being fairly treated.  It was the 1923 Act that compelled him to become a tenant of the Land Commission; whether he <Col N="151" /> consented or not, he was forced to become a tenant of the Land Commission without any benefit accruing from doing so.  That was due to the haste of the Land Commission in purchasing, and these consequences followed to the tenants.</P>
      <P>In the case of the distribution of land, we have several complaints from all parts of the country.  Here is a complaint which reached me and all the T.D.'s in my area, and was sent on to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Land Commission.  The document containing that complaint reached me some months ago.  I should like to ask if anything has been done in consequence of this report made to the various T.D.'s in the document to which I have referred.  Nothing.  This estate was taken over by the Land Commission several years ago, and here is a protest signed by upwards of 19 persons who are tenants on the estate protesting against the way the untenanted lands were divided.  &ldquo;We protest,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;against giving land to persons who are neither congests nor evicted tenants while uneconomic holders were not supplied. Tenants with 32 acres of land got an additional 22 acres.  We also protest against the bringing in of new tenants until the old tenants were supplied; and we also protest against the inconvenient way in which the lands were divided&mdash;namely, where persons living two miles away got land beside the old tenants' dwelling and the old tenants have to go a mile away to their land. We also protest against the giving of land to English and Scotch planters, game-keepers, and such people, and also English Army officers.&rdquo; That was signed by 19 persons, and it was sent to the Land Commission, to the Parliamentary Secretary, to the Minister for Fisheries, and to the Leitrim T.D.'s.  So much for the distribution of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Promises were made by the Land Commission and hopes were held out that when they had secured the land from the landlords the Land Commission would be in a position to do something for the uneconomic holder.  I live in a congested area and I am in a position to say that in no instance out of an <Col N="152" /> area of at least twelve square miles was an attempt made to do anything for the congests there.  They are living in a state of endemic poverty and their only salvation is emigration.  They lived in hope in the past.  They were promised that when Home Rule came, or some other form of native government, something would be done for them.  But native government has done nothing for them except to increase the terrorism in compelling them to pay up their annuities, with the result that they are flying from the country.  And that is the only way in which relief is being given to the congested areas.  I referred yesterday to what is a more glaring instance of injustice to those people: that is with regard to the period in which interest in lieu of rent has to be paid.  The Minister replied to me by pointing out what would become of the interest on the money.  In other words, he held that the persons paying interest in lieu of rent, in the ordinary way if the estate was not purchased would be paying their original rent or paying the old rent.  The Minister evidently forgot the fact that at the period when the contract was made for the purchase of these estates there was a Plan of Campaign in existence and that the tenants were then denying the claim of the landlords to be the owners of the soil.  As a result, the landlords in many instances in this area were not able to collect one year's rent in every three years, and I am quite satisfied that had the Land Commission stood out and allowed the fight to continue the amount the tenants would be paying, by way of land annuities, during the last 17 years, would have been infinitely smaller than the amount collected by way of interest in lieu of rent by the Land Commission.  They were deprived of that right by promises which were not kept.  If they were allowed to fight out the battle with the landlord and to secure refuge every fifteen years in the courts for the purpose of periodic reductions in their rents, they would be paying to-day a sum much smaller in rent than they are forced to pay now by way of interest in lieu of rent and they would be also far more forward on the road to becoming owners of their holdings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> Again, there is this important fact to be borne in mind: that a contract was entered into seventeen years ago in respect of this particular estate by which the tenants were led to believe that by the payment of certain annuities for the specified time of 68½ years they would become owners of the land.  Seventeen years have passed and, although they have had to pay interest in lieu of rent or annuities, not one penny has been deducted from the original purchase money, so that they have not advanced one day nearer to the day when they shall be entitled to become owners of their own holdings. There is a grave cause of injustice there.  The tenants do not know much about legal forms and about legality. They are easily got at.  When an inspector comes forward and tells them that a definite contract is entered into, these people assume that there is no fear of any sleight of hand to deprive them of their rights and, relying on the plain facts placed before them, they readily sign their names to the contract. On that head, the Land Commission are culpable by defrauding the tenant farmers of the country to the extent of many millions.  We are now asked to give a vote in favour of three-quarters of a million or more for the carrying on of the work of the Irish Land Commission.  I think it is not fair.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Irish Land Commission are worthy, from the taxpayers' point of view, of any consideration. They have had nothing from them; they have merely made promises and led the people into a position which is false and ruinous to their best interests.  They are not entitled to ask this House for three-quarters of a million or for any money to carry on their nefarious work.  I say that if the Land Commission work is to be carried on it should be carried on on strictly business lines.  This Party, fortunately, has come to the conclusion that the Land Commission is not an institution that this State should be responsible for; that it is an institution belonging to England and that the charges belonging to that institution should be borne by England and not by the taxpayers whom we represent.  If the Land Commission would examine more strictly the titles to the property they <Col N="154" /> purchase, and purchase it only when they are satisfied that the title is fair and legally satisfactory, they would make far fewer mistakes.  I am quite satisfied that if they would strictly examine the title to many of the properties they buy they would find a difficulty in paying a reasonable price for these properties.  I am quite satisfied that the only interest many of the landowners can claim to many of the properties they are selling to the farmers is merely the interest they could claim for improvements that they made, if any were made during their term of occupation.  These were properties that were confiscated in years gone by, so that the title to these properties should be fully examined before the Land Commission pass them as satisfactory.  If a Land Commission is required, as I suppose it is in some form or other, I do not think that this big centralised body that we have in Dublin, which was formed by landlords and manned by landlords and their class in the past, can ever be satisfactory as far as the farmers are concerned. It must be got rid of, and all the work that a Department of that sort would have to do could be done better if it was divided up into provinces and small Departments set up to deal with each province on the lines of county councils, with a body of officials that would be quite capable of doing all the work that the Land Commission is required to do in regard to each province.  I should say also that there might be and probably would be some necessity for co-ordinating the work of the various Departments in each province, but that would be a small thing.</P>
    <P>This much I am quite satisfied about, and that is that until the present old Chambers over there are broken up there can never be any hope of honest administration or any hope of reform for the betterment of the farmers. They have made up their minds that they can never look to these old rusty buildings over there, filled up as they are by old files and old processes of every sort, to do the business satisfactorily. They look forward to the day when a clearance will be made. and that clearance.  I hope, will not be the farmers from the land as the Land <Col N="155" /> Commission are endeavouring to secure, but a big clearance of those old rusty Chambers over there that have brought more ruin and destruction on the farmers than the landlords ever did.  I was listening one day down the country to a description given by an old farmer of long experience of the landlord type and of the newer institution, the Irish Land Commission.  He said: &ldquo;The Irish Land Commission is the greatest institution&rdquo;&mdash;he did not describe it as a benefactor&mdash;&ldquo;ever inflicted on this unfortunate country.&rdquo; I could hardly find a better description than that given by that old man of the Land Commission as it is regarded by the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to be in a position to stand up here and adopt an entirely different attitude from most Deputies as regards the Land Commission's good work, which I believe is neither properly known nor fully appreciated.  I purpose giving some details with regard to the work done in County Westmeath by the Land Commission.  I do not intend to mention Longford, as I will leave that to the Deputies who come from that county and who are more conversant with the work done there. While large sums of money have been spent by the Land Commission on some estates, there are others which urgently require their attention, and as Westmeath received nothing out of the £60,000 allocated to the Land Commission from the £150,000 relief grant which I understand the Land Commission received for the congested areas, I hope that that will be borne in mind when the moneys to be voted now are being allocated, as there are many estates in the county which have been divided, and which require drainage, fencing and proper roads.  Perhaps I may particularly mention the drainage of bogs, the present condition of which is a great hardship on the occupying tenants.  Many thousands of pounds have been spent on the following estates during the past year or two in making new roads, drainage works, drainage of bogs, fencing and the building of houses:&mdash;Gray and Irwin, Ardnagragh; Harris-Temple estate, <Col N="156" /> Waterstown; Robert McKenna estate, Garteen; Levings state, Enniscoffey; Adelaide Hospital estate, Rattan; Annie Hall estate, Ballymore; Robert Smith estate, Gaulstown; late Colonel J.R. Malone's estate, Shinglass; J.J. Daniel's estate, Newforest; J.F.D. Meares' estates, Skeagh; E.F. Batty's estate, Ballyhealy, and various smaller sums in other places.  Schemes are in progress at the present time on the estate of Lord Castlemaine, at Moydrum, of some 1,200 acres, and on the Batty estate at Ballyhealy.  A large amount of work has been done there, and considerable employment given, which is a great benefit to the unemployed, in addition to the benefit of the reconstruction work.  Schemes are being prepared and large sums will shortly be expended on the Kilcleagh estate, Boggagh, and the Lowerwood and Creeve estates, County Westmeath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said in my opening remarks, the good work the Land Commission is doing is neither sufficiently appreciated nor understood.  With regard to land distribution, I will now give some figures with regard to untenanted land in County Westmeath. There were 10,670 acres vested in the Land Commission up to the 29th February, 1928.  A price has been fixed or agreed upon for 2,339 acres.  A price has been offered, or the lands gazetted, for 3,053 acres.  The lands inspected comprise 11,445 acres.  Lands the subject of inquiries which are being made comprise 33,948 acres.  The lands actually divided comprise 8,803 acres. I may say with regard to dividing lands that the division has given satisfaction to the vast majority of the people.  The economic holders living near the lands have received allotments, regardless of their political, religious or any other opinions, and I may say that I am in complete agreement with that.  If a man is living near the land on a small holding, he is certainly entitled to get some of the land.  Speaking for the county that I understand and that I represent here, I can say that the land has been divided absolutely impartially and that there are very few complaints. Of course I know that you cannot please everybody; some people will find fault no matter what is done. <Col N="157" /> For some time past land distribution in Westmeath has been slower than it was previously, but activity will soon be resumed, as the Judge has now ordered that the Land Commission's price for Sir Morgan Tuite's estate of 638 acres at Sonna is to be accepted.  The division of these lands will supply land to a large number of persons in the district, in addition to giving much-needed employment. Delays are taking place in the distribution of other places, such as Higginstown, owing to Colonel Purdon Winter's death, Turbranagh, Multyfarnham, Reynells, Balrath, and Mrs. Taylor, Jigginstown, which I understand are pending, and many other lands included in the list I have already given details of.  With regard to taking over land purchased by committees under the 1927 Act, I wish to urge on the Land Commission to speed up as far as possible the taking over of the various lands under this heading, lands such as Clonyn and Gaulstown. In the case of Clonyn, the particulars were furnished a considerable time ago.  I hope that an inspector will be sent to visit those lands at a very early date, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make a special note and have this carried out.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter I would like to mention, and that is that I hope the Land Commission will be as reasonable as possible with land annuitants before incurring costs, as to my own personal knowledge there are very many cases of genuine hardship where, owing to adverse circumstances, honest persons find it almost impossible to earn the annuities, the principal reason being want of capital. Banks will not advance money to them, and they are now debarred under the Agricultural Credit Corporation's regulations from receiving advances if they are backward with their land annuities. They cannot let the lands, because anyone putting stock on them runs the risk of having it seized, and these persons appear to be in an almost hopeless position. This is a matter that requires immediate attention.  I am very pleased to be able to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Minister for Agriculture, the Land Commission, the Minister for <Col N="158" /> Fisheries, and the Parliamentary Secretary for the many great schemes they have developed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think it is very bad taste for that remark to come from that side of the House, considering that 90 per cent. of you read your speeches, including the last Deputy who spoke.  Many great works of public utility are being carried out by the Land Commission, and I hope that they will speed up such schemes and works, which will be such a benefit to the agricultural community and the unemployed.  With regard to the question which I asked Deputy Maguire last night, if my information was incorrect, and as he has denied it publicly here, it gives me the greatest pleasure to accept his words.  I do that without any quibble, and I hope the example I have given will be followed by other Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to find myself in agreement with Deputy Maguire on one point, and that is with regard to the delay in vesting estates. The delay in vesting estates does inflict great hardship on the tenant, but it also inflicts great hardship on the landlord. I was more fortunate than Deputy Maguire; I did not have to wait seventeen years for an estate to be vested; but I had to wait twelve or thirteen years, and during that time I was getting three and a half per cent, when I could have invested money at four and a half per cent. at least.  The landlord gets no interest on the bonus during that time, so that the delay in vesting is a hardship on both sides.  But I do not think it is fair to attribute the delay entirely to the Land Commission. It is due in the main to restrictions imposed on them by the British Treasury. Eleven of Deputy Maguire's seventeen years' delay were caused by the British Treasury, and it is not entirely a matter of blame to a smallState <Col N="159" /> with limited resources if it has not been able to catch up on the work of the British Treasury. I think it would be reasonable for the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister for Fisheries to approach the British Government and ask them to finish the job.  I would be at one with Deputy Maguire in urging that he would, but there is no use in asking the British Government to finish the job and to enable estates sold under the 1903 and the 1909 Acts to be vested if at the same time a responsible Party is declaring its intention to repudiate liability.  The British Government is sometimes foolish, but it is not so foolish as all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point to which Deputy Maguire referred is the excessive prices that the Land Commission are giving, and I assume that when he was referring to the excessive prices given for land he meant land that the Land Commission are purchasing under the 1923 Act. because obviously the burden of his complaint must be, not against the past action of the Land Commission under a different régime, but against the Land Commission now. Are these prices excessive?  The 1903 and the 1909 Acts were voluntary Acts &mdash;there was, I admit, a limited element of compulsion in the 1909 Act.  There was no compulsion in the 1903 Act. But the 1923 Act absolutely empowers the Land Commission to go to any landowner and take any land that they require.  Well, it is common experience&mdash;I am sure Deputy Ruttledge knows, and probably Deputy Lemass knows&mdash;that land that is taken by compulsion is more expensive than land that is the subject of voluntary sale and free barter.  If Deputy Maguire were proposing to make a railway from Glenfarne to Drumkerin and if he obtained powers of compulsory purchase from the Oireachtas by a Private Bill he would find that the price, fixed by an arbitrator, of the land that he proposed to build the railway on would cost him more than the price he would give for the same acreage if he bought it at an ordinary public sale.  Land taken compulsorily for any public purpose always costs more than land that is purchased after <Col N="160" /> free negotiation.  Of course I am taking a purely hypothetical case; I am sure Deputy Maguire would be too intelligent to make a railway between Glenfarne and Drumkerin; he would only have to put a bus on the road to achieve his point.</P>
    <P>Compulsory sale is more expensive as a rule than voluntary sale.  But if the Deputy is suggesting that the bargain under the 1903 Act is a satisfactory bargain for the landlord, then I say that he is entirely wrong and entirely mistaken. The object of the 1903 Act, with the bonus, was to enable the land to be sold at a price that the tenant could afford to pay, and at a price that would bring the landlord in his existing income, invested in trust securities. Generally speaking&mdash;there would be one or two peculiar cases&mdash;under the 1923 Act the landlord forfeits 25 per cent. of his income, and it was only due to the circumstances in the country at the time when the 1923 Act was introduced&mdash;I was not a member of the Dáil at the time&mdash;that it was accepted by the landlords.  I think that there would have been a strong agitation by the landlords against that Act if it was not for the fact that the country was still struggling&mdash;I do not want to be offensive&mdash;against a storm, shall I say, and it was felt that it would be unpatriotic to take a decisive line in defence of private interests.  It is not a satisfactory Act to the landlords; the prices given are not satisfactory to the landlords.  They involve certain sacrifices.  The only suggestion, I think, that Deputy Maguire made was that the landlords obtained greater security because in County Leitrim tenants would only pay their rents one year in three.  Why they would pay one year in three I cannot imagine.  I cannot see why they would not go the whole hog.  I know that tenants sometimes asked me for a slight abatement in their rents, owing to the bad times. or when there was a bad harvest, and I am glad to say that practically all my tenants were extremely honest men who recognised that by going before the Land Commission Court and having their rents fixed they entered into a bargain and they complied with that bargain most honourably.  I do not <Col N="161" /> think I have better security now&mdash; except perhaps for what Deputy Maguire might do&mdash;than I had when we were free negotiators.  Of course if Deputy Maguire preached a campaign of one year's rent in three it would probably have been reduced to one year's rent in six, and I might have suffered.</P>

I thought Deputy Corry had enough to attend to in Cork, but perhaps he is coming up to me to get away from that police barrack that he told us about.  If so, I will be very glad to see him.  I have attempted so far to reply to Deputy Maguire, and I must not attempt any further reply to Deputy Corry.  I want to call attention to an aspect of this Vote that has hardly been touched on, except by Deputy Fahy, and that is the aspect from the point of view of the economiser. This is an expensive Department, a Department that has no parallel in any other European country, a Department whose responsibilities have increased very substantially during the years since the Saorstát was set up.  In 1923 the net Estimate of the Department was&mdash;I would ask Deputy Cooney to allow me to read these figures, because otherwise I might quote them wrongly&mdash;£436,159, and in the current Estimates it is £719,577.</P>
      <P>In other words, the cost of the Department increased by a sum of over fifty per cent.  Under the heading of Improvements of Estates, the sum voted for that purpose in 1923 was £149,702, and this year the sum in the Estimates is £323,200.  In other words, it is more than doubled.  I agree with Deputy Davin that it is for a very excellent and worthy purpose.</P>

      <P>I have the Estimates here, but I am afraid I cannot get the figure at the moment.  I can give the figure for 1924, when the <Col N="162" /> Congested Districts Board had been brought in.  In 1924, when the Congested Districts Board had been brought in, the sum voted for the improvement of estates was £190,000, as against £323,000 odd in this year's Estimates.  That is not quite double the amount, but it represents an increase of more than seventy per cent. As I was saying, Deputy Davin approved of that, and said that the money was used for a very worthy and necessary purpose if it was all spent.  The experience that I have gained from the Appropriation Accounts is this: that the Land Commission have always asked for a good deal more money than they were able to spend for this purpose.  I find from the Appropriation Accounts that were issued to Deputies about three weeks ago, that out of the sum of £300,000 that was voted to the Land Commission for the improvement of the estates, they were obliged to return the sum of £100,000.  That is to say, they were not able to spend that sum of £100,000.  I would like to have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that all this money that is voted for the improvement of estates will be spent on that work, because it is a bad principle to vote money that is not actually required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fahy's economic suggestion was that we should relieve this Vote by handing over the investigation of titles to the Land Registry Office, and the collection of annuities, in lieu of rent, to the Department of Finance. I think Deputy Fahy, when he made that suggestion, must have meant the Revenue Commissioners, because the Department of Finance will not themselves collect this money.  The people who collect the taxes in this State are the Revenue Commissioners, and presumably they would be suitable people.  But, may I point out to Deputy Fahy that there is no real economy in transferring functions from one Department to another, because it only means transferring a staff to do it.  Is there any reason to believe that either the Land Registry or the Revenue Commissioners could do this work with their present staffs?  I know nothing about the Land Registry Office, <Col N="163" /> but I do know a little about the Revenue Commissioners.  There has been a continuous expansion of the staff in the Revenue Commissioners' Department, due to the policy of the Dáil four years ago in imposing tariffs.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners in the Saorstát have already had to expand their staff very substantially in order to deal with the collection of tariffs that were imposed by the Dáil.  Four years ago, the chief inspector of customs and excise employed 995 people.  The estimate this year shows that he is going to employ 1,118.  There you have an increase of more than one hundred in one Department.  I think, if Deputy Fahy made an investigation, he would find increases in the staffs of other Departments as well, except, I think, the Estate Duty Office.  If we are going to impose an entirely new function which, obviously, will involve a great deal of clerical work on the Revenue Commissioners, you will have to give the Revenue Commissioners a larger staff, and so there would be no substantial economy.  What would happen would be that you would be only paying the same money under another head, and it would make no difference to the general taxpayer.  By decentralising the work of collection and having more of it done locally than there is at present, it might be possible to reduce expenditure under that head. I do not know, but that is a point that the Parliamentary Secretary could answer better than I could.  It would not, at all events, I think, mean any substantial economy.  But where is the pet-economy of Fianna Fáil?  Here is a large and expensive Department, and we have one suggestion made, I am sure by Deputy Fahy in all good faith, but where is the pet-economy?  There are four salaries in this Estimate&mdash;not including <Col N="164" /> the Judicial Commissioner&mdash;of over £1,000 a year, and there is not a motion from the Fianna Fáil Benches to reduce one of them.  Salaries of £1,000 a year are posted up on blank walls and used on platforms, but are not dealt with here in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>It would really be better if Deputy Corry and other Deputies would refrain from interrupting.  Certain kinds of interruptions are quite reasonable.  We had an example of them this evening when Deputy Clery asked Deputy Cooper to quote certain figures with regard to the Congested Districts Board.  That seemed to be quite relevant to the argument going on.  Then we had Deputy Derrig's interruption a moment ago when he pointed out that yesterday he was precluded from dealing with the question of salaries.  That was also a quite relevant and reasonable interruption, but this throwing of words across the House is futile and does not enable us to carry on our business.  When it is of the type that Deputy Corry has given us it is bringing our proceedings too low.  In this case I assume that Deputy Corry does not really mean to convey that Deputy Cooper has improperly made a profit out of something. But there is a certain type of interruption to which we must put a stop and, if necessary, we can do so in a drastic fashion.</P>

I was suggesting that the Fianna Fáil Party should put down an amendment to reduce this Vote by £1,400, but I would <Col N="166" /> not support that amendment.  A Deputy below the gangway attacked me because I believe the officials who receive £1,500 a year salary are giving good value.  I do not believe in putting in second class men to do first class work, and I do not believe it is sound economy.  If you pay a first class man £1,500 a year he will do more valuable work than three men each receiving £500 a year or two men at £1,000 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not touch on it further.  I will conclude by saying that this increase in the cost of the Land Commission is not due to any fault on the part of the Government, but to the fact that from every quarter in the Dáil and outside the Government have been asked to speed up this division of land.  Every Deputy who has been here four or five years knows that has been urged from every quarter of the House, and the Order Paper is generally full of questions dealing with the same point&mdash;asking when an inspection will be made of such-and-such land, when it will be divided, and so on.  If the Land Commission is a more expensive Department than it was four or five years ago, that is entirely due to the fact that the people themselves and those who represent the people insist on having this work of land distribution carried out more quickly.  You cannot get that done effectually without increasing your staff and putting more men on to the work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMatthews" hpid="Mr. MATTHEWS Mr. MATTHEWS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MATTHEWS</NameTxt>
      <P>If all the charges brought against the Land Commission during this debate were true, it would be a very bad boy indeed.  I wish to refute the argument that the Land Commission has been acting with undue severity in the collection of annuities.  The position is that when the annuities become due after four or five months the matter is put in the hands of the State Solicitor.  There will necessarily be individual cases of hardship <Col N="167" /> owing to the State Solicitor pressing for the payment of annuities.  Deputies, however, should remember that the annuities are a first charge on estate and licence duties which are paid over to the county councils in relief of the local rates.  The Land Commission annuities under present legislation are a first charge on the grant-in-aid of local rates.  The consequence is that if there are defalcations the ratepayers suffer and become liable for the unpaid annuities.  In other words, the thrifty man who meets his annuities and pays his rates has to pay for his neighbour, who is in default?  It should be recognised that the only hope of collecting these annuities is by pressing for them.  I do not really know what the procedure is, but I take it that if the Land Commission annuities become due in May and the State Solicitor does not get them until the following November, there would then be a year's annuities due, and he would not issue a civil bill until then.  If arrears of annuities were allowed to accumulate tenants would get into a hopeless position, and if the rates are not collected punctually the county councils suffer owing to the annuities which have not been paid being stopped out of the grants-in-aid.</P>

      <P>In speaking on this subject I would first like to pay a tribute to the courtesy of the Land Commission officials with whom I have come in contact.  I found them endeavouring to do their best to give satisfaction, but I would not be doing my duty here if I did not comment on this enormous sum of £670,000 which is being paid for the Land Commission Department.  I regret we cannot find out here how much of this £670,000 is spent in collecting the annuities which are being handed over directly to the British Government.  I fail to see by what law the Irish taxpayers are compelled to pay for the collection of the annuities that are handed over to another Government.  I think it would be good enough for the British Government if they want their money to come over and take it.  I do not see why the Irish taxpayers should have to pay for the bum-bailiff who drags the last cow from the unfortunate farmer.</P>

I found as a result of an answer which I asked here some time ago that the amount due on land annuities was £568,000, £40,000 of which was due in Cork county alone.  I think the Dáil would be very well occupied in trying to find a way out of the present position. Farmers do not want to get out of their responsibilities, and I would like to make that clear, but one thing they will not stand for is the handing over of this money to the British Government. I think the Dáil will realise that in a very short time.  I think the time of the House would be well occupied in finding some means by which the Land Commission annuities could be reduced by at least 50 per cent., and an extension of time given to the tenants to pay.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with the delay in vesting under the 1923 Act and other Land Acts.  We had Deputy Maguire's statement on that point.  I know of several cases of the same delay in my own constituency.  The tenants will find it hard enough to pay the annuities without having a lot of other things tacked on to them, and they will be long enough paying without <Col N="169" /> being compelled to pay a lot in interest added and no shortening the period of payment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper alluded, a short time ago, to the salaries of the two Commissioners who are drawing £1,500 a year each, but he forgot to add that they were each getting an addition of £212 war bonus.  That, perhaps, is what gives the Commissioners such a rosy view when they go around the country and when they buy estates at five times their value and look for the money afterwards from the tenants, money which the tenants are not able to pay.  Take the case of the Condonstown estate.  The rent paid in that case is 15/- an acre while the people surrounding that estate within a radius of three miles are not paying a higher annuity than 9/- an acre.  When this estate was being divided or distributed all the guarantees that were given to the unfortunate wounded soldiers of the land war&mdash;all the guarantees to the evicted tenants that they were going to be reinstated were forgotten.  Not one evicted tenant was reinstated on that estate though there were several evicted tenants within a three miles' radius of it.  These people now find that they cannot pay 15/- an acre for this land. The land is not worth it, but of course these two Commissioners who sailed down there were drawing £1,500 a year each and £212 each war bonus, and they were in the happy position that they were able to take a rosy view of things.  They took Deputy Cooper's view of things.  The landlord's view was all that troubled them.  We had the same state of affairs practically in the majority of estates purchased under the 1923 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A while ago Deputy Cooper stated that only for the troubled conditions that then obtained the landlords would not accept the 1923 Act.  I had dealings with several landlords in my district immediately after the truce and I found in every case that they were very glad to accept a reduction of 35 per cent. and they were very happy to be able to get it.  On those estates that 35 per cent. reduction was given for three years until the present Government came in with their benevolent attitude to the landlords and compelled those unfortunate tenants to purchase, and to <Col N="170" /> pay an increase of 10 per cent. on their rent, thus accepting a 25 per cent. reduction instead of the 35 per cent. that the landlords were voluntarily giving them.  I consider that the 1923 Act was a benevolent institution for the landlords in this country.  It was that and nothing else.</P>
    <P>We have another estate down there. the Gubbins Estate.  That estate was purchased under the 1909 Act.  It was bought out and divided up.  The rent or annuity that was put on in the case of that estate is an annuity that is quite impossible to pay.  The tenants amongst whom the estate was divided were brought in from outside districts.  They did not know the value of the land they were getting. They were delighted to get any land. They got into that land, and during the war years they raised four or five crops of oats in succession out of that land and then cleared out quietly.  The unfortunate people in these lands at present are absolutely unable to pay the annuities.  Something has got to be done in these cases, because the land is not value for the money they are being called on to pay.  Those Commissioners who went down there went with a bloated idea of the value of land.  In practically every case the tenants amongst whom these estates were divided up are paying anything from 8/- to 15/- per acre more for the land than the adjoining tenants are paying for their holdings.   Deputy Cooper suggested that the Land Commissioners were doing their best to catch up with the delay in vesting.  I do not like to make any harsh suggestion, but I do suggest that they are not doing their best to catch up with the delay in vesting.  Of course, the Land Commission are getting more out of the land now than if it were vested.  I think the present advisers and the present administration of the Land Commission are only anxious that the landlords should draw extra interest out of the lands until they are vested.  At any rate, I see very little hope at all at present in the position of the ordinary farmer.  I have very little hope for him.  His rates are increased, and he is absolutely unable to pay the present annuity.  Something has got to be done in his case.</P>

      <P>It would be no harm to ask why the Curry lands have not been divided; it would be no harm to ask why the Bradwell estate has not been dealt with.  That estate is in the hands of the Land Commission since 1923.  The lands at Higginstown run into nearly 2,000 acres, and they have not been dealt with either.  The lands of Billistown, outside Delvin, have not been divided.  The Maher lands at Moyvoughley have not been dealt with. These are items that the Parliamentary Secretary should deal with.  Deputy Shaw referred to the impartiality in the distribution of lands.  He spoke of the impartiality exercised by the Land Commission.  Deputy Shaw will find that one of the most difficult tasks is to know what a countryman's politics are. He will be Fianna Fáil to me and he will be Cumann na nGaedheal to Deputy Shaw in order to acquire the land.  I do not think that there is such a glowing tribute due to the Land Commission on the grounds of impartiality. In the allocation of parcels of land on the Kilmore estate, in the parish of Boherquill in Westmeath, it is something more, I think, than a coincidence that two prominent officials of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation were brought up from Edgeworthstown, in Longford, and given two farms there in the present month.  That is something more than a coincidence. Another matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary is with reference to the building of a house on a farm for one, Michael Brown, in Skeagh, in the <Col N="172" /> County Westmeath.  That building has been directly under the control of the Land Commission, and none of the men employed in the building of that house is a tradesman.  The man who got the painting of that house last week was employed by the man in charge at 5s. a day, and that man was never a painter by trade or by anything else.  I do not know as to the accuracy of the allegations going about, whether they are true or not, but these allegations are that certain scales of pay are allowed and that the man superintending the work is making a bit out of it.  Whether that is true or not I do not know, but certainly when the Land Commission undertakes to build a house they should see that the thing is properly done.  I do not know whether it is the Land Commission or the Board of Works is building this house.</P>

In answering a criticism on that point on the Supplementary Vote, the Parliamentary Secretary gave certain figures.  It is very funny that land divided and acquired in or about 1923 or 1924 has a much larger annuity per acre than land the other side of the ditch.  It strikes me that the Parliamentary Secretary based his figures over a period of years and took a mean figure.  There was an inflated price paid on the Bradwell Estate&mdash;the portion that was divided&mdash;and it was so much inflated that a number of tenants have given up their holdings; they cannot make them pay.  Certainly, legislation is needed to deal with these particular farms which were bought at an inflated price in 1923, 1924 and 1925.  Of course, land is now being paid for at current land prices, but that has not been so as regards the land paid for in 1924 and 1925.</P>

I hope the time will never come when this House will not be found capable of criticising each and every Government department.  I do not think the Land Commission have any reason to compain this evening of the fact that they have not been sufficiently criticised.  One Deputy went so far as to suggest that the heads of the Land Commission were old fossils.  I do not know whether it was to our respected Minister or to our equally respected Parliamentary Secretary that the Deputy referred, but the reference was one that we all greeted with enthusiasm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain Deputies have referred to individual cases and in one instance we heard reference made to the case of Michael Brown.  We heard of several other individual cases, but I want to tell you about one individual case which I have in mind against the Land Commission.  I am an annuitant of the <Col N="174" /> Land Commission.  I hold a very large holding.  I will not tell you what the payment in lieu of rent is.  I will tell you, however, that there is leading to my backdoor a boreen and the Land Commission have utterly and entirely failed to look after it.  When there were four out of the five Deputies coming from my own constituency speaking about individual boreens and holdings, all four of them agreed with one common purpose that nobody would refer to my boreen.  I think that was wrong and I think that at least the Land Commission should have attended to it.</P>
    <P>But, let us take another outlook. Before this year closes I hope I will be in a position to say&mdash;God willing, and if I am alive on the 2nd December next &mdash;that I have had something like forty years' experience of the Irish Land Commission.  I think I have appeared for more tenants in the County Cork than any other living advocate, and perhaps I could say the same of the landlords in the County Cork.  Certainly, so far as tenants are concerned, I can say it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As I was saying, I have appeared in many land purchase cases and I have experience of every branch of the Irish Land Commission; hence I would naturally be inclined to criticise them.  Everybody would, and it is purely a natural instinct.  But when criticising, let us be fair.  Heaven forbid that I would stand up and defend any Government Department; nothing would be further from my intention: but in common fairness, we must be fair in our criticisms. Let us go back to twenty years ago and consider the Land Commission then and let us compare it with the Land Commission as it is to-day.  I am <Col N="175" /> bound in common fairness to tell you&mdash; and I ought to know if I have any intelligence and if I know what I am speaking about&mdash;that nothing is more marked in any branch of our Free State service than the great advance that has taken place in the Irish Land Commission Office.  To-day they are overwhelmed with work; the Land Act of 1923 and the amalgamation of different boards have overwhelmed them with work.</P>
      <P>We should always be prepared to criticise them, but we must not criticise them unfairly.  Before we leave this discussion I think the members of the House generally ought to agree, and ought to tell the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister, how greatly pleased and how very proud Deputies who know what they speak about feel at the great advance in the way in which the work of the Land Commission is carried out since 1923 and the great improvement in the Office.  Anybody who has had experience, as most Deputies have had, of going to the Office from time to time and communicating with the Land Commission in regard to individual cases, will admit that there is extreme courtesy and exceeding ability on the part of the staff and Deputies must pay tribute to the facilities that are afforded them in the Land Commission Office.  I think there is no Department of this Government that need feel prouder of the great improvement that has been brought about under our own laws than the Department of the Irish Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wolfe stated that the Land Commission had no reason to complain this evening, as they got a fair amount of criticism.  I think they have no reason to complain that, on the other side, they have also got a fair amount of unity also.  In asking us to vote for a sum amounting <Col N="176" /> to practically three-quarters of a million, it is only right that Deputies on all sides should see that we get for that money the greatest possible efficiency and value.  Deputy Maguire mentioned cases in County Leitrim of people who at present find that they are unable to pay the amount of annuities for which they are liable.  The same applies even more strongly in the case of County Roscommon.  In that county, in Castleplunkett, Rathcroghan and around Ballingar there are many new holdings.  These tenants have already addressed memorials to the Land Commission asking for reduction. The valuation of these holdings is far in excess of that of the holdings of their neighbours, who are in a similar position.   There is an ordinary valuation on these holdings of from £20 to £30, whereas neighbours with the same amount of land and equally good houses have a valuation of only £10 or £12, and, in addition to imposing an extra burden on them in that way by way of increased rates, these people&mdash;it is a very serious thing for them&mdash;because of their valuation, are also debarred, when reaching the age of seventy, from receiving an old age pension because they are too well off. In this particular district people are leaving their holdings.  When people leave their holdings there must be something wrong.  When people leave holdings of 25 acres there is something wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing which I can see is wrong is that the Land Commission have paid too much for them, and having done so, have to try and get their money back.  It is not good business for any concern to buy at too high a price, because they cannot retail the goods they buy.  If the Land Commission pays too much for the land they will not be able, so to speak, to retail it at an economic price.  In that district this question has become acute, and something will have to be done.  I have here a letter from a prominent parish priest in County Roscommon who is not a supporter of Fianna Fáil.  In a letter which I can show to the Parliamentary Secretary he said that he can challenge the Minister to find any parties to take any holdings with new houses at present prices in the parish <Col N="177" /> of Elphin.  That letter sets out the case more eloquently than I could.  Deputy Kennedy mentioned the cases of houses not being properly built and fitted.  I had occasion to write to the Land Commission about the house of Patrick Ryan, of Lisadrea, on the Popham estate.  I will not attempt to describe the condition of that house, but if the Land Commission, knowing when a shower of rain is coming, sent an inspector there with a bucket he can collect the evidence.  In a Vote of this kind, where such an amount of money is going to be expended, we should get the greatest possible value and we should have efficiency.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have been going on about the Kilmacrumsey estate, near Elphin, for nearly three years.  Everything, I understand, was in order to apportion that land six months ago, and I got an assurance that it would be divided before the 1st March.  I am not blaming anyone about the delay, but the farmers who were promised portions on that estate could not put down crops because they had not possession. Some farmers were to give up other portions of land in exchange, but they could not put in their crops as they did not know if they were to be left in possession.  I cannot see why there is delay in dividing up the land and allotting portions to those who are to receive them on that particular estate.  On the O'Connor estate at Elphin there is great dissatisfaction over the proposed division of the land. Numerous representations have been made to me from time to time, but I do not suppose there is very much good in interfering.  I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that in the division of that estate, though inspectors visited the town in which I live at least forty or fifty times, they did not think it worth while, even out of common courtesy, to consult me in any way, though I have written to them to do so.  I am making no charge, but there are other people in the town who do not live a hundred yards from my door who were consulted four and five times a week about the division of that land. I do not expect that the Land Commission officials would come to me and ask to whom they are to give the land, but <Col N="178" /> as an elected and responsible Deputy I think I have as much right to claim that the Land Commission inspectors would consult me as quickly as anyone else in the parish when they come to see about the division of the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that I agree with Deputy Wolfe that there has been a considerable improvement in the Land Commission since 1923. Perhaps I might say that I think that that is due to the very intelligent criticism which was levelled against that particular Department by the Labour Party during the years 1923-1927.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan says &ldquo;The Farmers' Party.&rdquo; I had forgotten that we had such a thing as a Farmers' Party.  The Deputy will understand that my omission of the Farmers' Party was not intentional. I do not think that the Land Commission have any reason to grumble at the criticism of the Department so far as it has gone.  I think there was more criticism levelled against the Land Commission in any of the years since 1923 than there has been this year so far, and perhaps I will be pardoned if I say that more intelligent criticism was previously directed to certain faults in the Department, and that any criticism that was put forward and any charges that were made could be substantiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as County Tipperary is concerned, I must say that, generally speaking, the Land Commission have done their work very well.  I will come to the exceptions very soon, but personally I think I can say and I am sure most of my colleagues in this House who represent that county will agree, that the outdoor staff working in the county are conscientious men who are doing their work to the best of their ability, and who are, I think, doing it very efficiently; but I have a grievance&mdash;a grievance which I only discovered while I was listening to this debate.  On one side of the House we were told that it is only supporters of Cumann na nGaedheal who are getting the lands that are being divided, while <Col N="179" /> the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies tell us that it is only supporters of Fianna Fáil who get land.  Where do the supporters of the Labour Party come in if all that is true?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, may I say that there were 120 labourers' cottages taken over at the last meeting of the Board of Health in Westmeath, because the tenants of these cottages got allotments of lands in County Westmeath, so that the labourers have not been forgotten?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from Deputy Shaw that all the land in Westmeath was being given to Fianna Fáil supporters.  As far as I am concerned, I do not care what the politics of the man who gets land may be, provided he is an uneconomic holder, a landless man, an evicted tenant or the direct descendant of an evicted tenant.  I must pay the tribute to the Land Commission, that so far as the work in Tipperary is concerned, and so far as I know of it, the officials there have divided land without any reference whatever to the political beliefs, the political outlook or the political affiliations of those who are looking for the land.  There are, however, at least two Estates in Tipperary with which we feel the Land Commission have not been dealing in the way they should be dealt with.  I want to raise again the question I raised on the Supplementary Estimate, because the Parliamentary Secretary did not reply then to my questions, and did not give any information to this House as to why the Land Commission had come to a decision to acquire only 186 acres of land from a gentleman who holds, according to my information, roughly 1,200 acres.  That is the case of what is commonly known as the Lattin land. The other case I want to refer to is the Trant Estate, outside Templemore.  A <Col N="180" /> gentleman there holds a very large estate, and the Land Commission, for some reason which we cannot understand, are proposing to acquire only about one-fifth of that estate, notwithstanding the fact that there is considerable congestion in that particular area, and that there are many uneconomic holders and many very suitable landless men who are anxious to get parcels of land there to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give some information to this House as to why the Land Commission in certain cases will only acquire a hundred or a couple of hundred acres of land out of an estate of a thousand or fifteen hundred acres.  The Minister for Agriculture, when in charge of the Land Commission, was continually telling the House that if we were to meet all the claims that were being made for land we would have to get a bigger country.  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is unfair, except in very special circumstances, and I cannot imagine such circumstances in this case, that any person in this country should have a thousand or twelve hundred acres of land, particularly if that land is not being developed or if it is not being used to produce foodstuffs. In one of the cases which I have mentioned, the case of the Lattin lands, you have this gentleman holding 600 acres of land at Dundrum, where he resides, and he has also 550 acres of the best land in County Tipperary at the village of Lattin, which is used purely for grazing purposes.  In that village there are twenty families who have not a perch of ground attached to their houses.  Notwithstanding that, the Land Commission have refused to acquire any of this 550 acres, although this gentleman holds 600 acres of land with his residence at Dundrum.  There may be some good reason for that, but if there is let us have it.  If the Minister is able to convince me that the reasons given by his Department are good and sufficient I will not raise the question of the Lattin lands again in this House. While I pay the tribute to the Land Commission that, generally speaking, their work in Tipperary has been very good, and while I have no fault to find with it, I have the feeling, and the people affected in the village of Lattin <Col N="181" /> have the feeling, that there is something underhand in connection with the Lattin land.  There is something which is not above board.  The same feeling exists around Templemore in connection with the Trant land there.  It is in order to remove that feeling that I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with these lands and to give the reasons for the inaction of the Land Commission in regard to these two estates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOLT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard members on the opposite benches state that when land was being divided, members of the Fianna Fáil organisation got most of it.  That is not the experience of those who live down in the West and I have here a document which will prove what I say.  This document was issued by the secretary of a local Cumann na nGaedheal Branch in the County Roscommon. It is headed &ldquo;Irish Land Commission: Division of Farms of Cashel, Garristown and Deerpark.&rdquo; It states: &ldquo;Regarding the division of above land all claimants to participation in bog are requested to furnish in writing to me before the 1st June, 1925, full particulars on which they base their claims together with their present valuation and acreage for transmission, by order of the Land Commission&mdash; John J. Costello.&rdquo; John J. Costello is not a Land Commissioner.  He is not a resident Commissioner.  He is not an inspector.  John J. Costello is Secretary of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation at Drumlion, County Roscommon. It is the Cumann na nGeadheal organisation that divides land.  We here are asked to pass an estimate for three quarters of a million when we have the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation prepared in County Roscommon at any rate to divide the land.</P>
      <P>They pay all these inspectors.  I will send this over to the Parliamentary Secretary.  This is a matter for you&mdash;it is for you to answer whether that is true or not.  This is an accusation I make against you and your Department.  Are you going to answer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOLT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same thing since 1925&mdash;it is the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation that divides the land.  In that particular case one of the applicants was the grandson of an evicted tenant.  He had an interview with one of your Inspectors at the hotel in Carrick-on-Shannon, and he was told that his claim was the best claim that had come before the Inspector&mdash;that it was a first-class claim.  But he got none of that land.  Why did he not get it? Because he refused to become a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal in Drumlion. Two months ago I took up his case and wrote to your Department, and from that day to this I have not had the courtesy of a reply as to why that man's application was turned down, because you cannot reply.  You have got no reply to give to this document, or to that application from that young man, the grandson of an evicted tenant.</P>
      <P>I notice an item of £38,540 for salaries for 74 Inspectors.  That is something like three Inspectors for each county, and that sum does not include bonus.  There is also paid to 75 surveyors, engineers and draughtsmen £15,978, not including bonus.  I do not see why we should pay all these salaries when we have men like Mr. Costello to divide up the lands for the Land Commission. Then we have five Commissioners costing £4,000.  The bonus is not included in that sum either.  Then we have a huge army of officials, 732 all told, getting between them £243,901 in salaries, and in travelling expenses another £34,000.  These sums also do not include bonus.  These sums are altogether out of proportion to what the people can pay.  Why this expenditure of three-quarters of a million to collect the land annuities and send them across to England?  In the Six Counties the annuities are retained in Belfast, while we pay £791,000 a year for the purpose of collecting the annuities. When they are collected, by sending out the sheriff and the bailiff and taking the last cow, there is not one penny-piece deducted for the cost of that collection, which costs us something like £791,000.  That is a grave injustice to the people of the Twenty-six Counties and cannot be allowed to continue.  The people will refuse to pay these annuities, and justly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> Deputy Cooper said this evening that the landlords got no bonus.  In 1909 and 1913 there were special Acts of Parliament passed to give them excess stock and excess bonus.  There is in the Appropriation Accounts for last year a sum of £162,000 for this excess stock and excess bonus and that was paid over to the landlords.  We have in this Estimate before us this year a sum of £134,000 contribution towards the charge for excess stock.  That also goes into the pockets of the landlords.  Then we have here for improvement of estates, £323,200.  We in Leitrim understand what that money is being used for.  Deputy Roddy sailed in here upon an expenditure in Co. Leitrim of something like £30,000 which was spent by his Party to get him returned to this Dáil in 1925.  It is a dear price to ask the people of Leitrim to pay.  That does not include the sum that was also spent that year in County Sligo.  And the Dáil is asked to pass these payments year after year! That money is being utilised by the Cumann na nGaedheal at election times to get their candidates returned.</P>
    <P>I agree with every single word Deputy Maguire said.  I have known of cases myself.  Within the past fortnight a case occurred to my own knowledge where the amount of an annuity was sent away by the tenant and returned by the Land Commission.  The man to whom it was returned asked me to forward it.  I did so, and I hope it will not come back.  There was also enclosed with the communication from the Land Commission a letter from the State Solicitor asking for 8/- costs. Since that time I understand a process has been issued.  Do Deputies know the reason for the issue of all these processes? I have found it out.  The State Solicitor, along with being paid £500 a year out of Government funds, gets all the fees for every process that he sends out.  All that money goes into the pockets of the State Solicitors, and that is the main reason why we have so many processes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. STEPHEN JORDAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a little to the criticisms which have been made upon the Land Commission, because I do not believe it has been sufficiently criticised yet. <Col N="184" /> I have a few cases in the County Galway which I believe should be brought to the notice of the House in order that Deputies may know the inefficiency, if I may say so, of the Land Commission in the County Galway and the unfair treatment meted out to certain tenants in Galway.  The first case I have is that of a man who expected land in an area where it was being divided.  The Land Commission inspector who attended there said his was a just case for some of the land that was going.  Later on he got information that he had no claim to land inasmuch as he was not a tenant on the property.  I hold a receipt from the Irish Land Commission issued to a tenant named Martin Nally, Junior, C.D.B., No. 132, for the lands of Abbey, and yet he is denied any land on the ground that he is not a tenant on the particular estate. There were 19 others with him, and it may be only a coincidence&mdash;we were told by Deputy Wolfe that the Land Commission were dividing land irrespective of politics&mdash;but it is a remarkable coincidence that this man was the only Fianna Fáil man out of twenty. and he got no land.  I hold his receivable order draft, and I say that he was a tenant on this land that was divided and yet he got no land.</P>
      <P>The next case to which I wish to call attention is that of Cloonoran.  Moylough, Co. Galway, and it concerns the case of a man named Martin Mitchell, who was an applicant for land that was being distributed down there.  He says: &ldquo;I petitioned the Land Commission for an enlargement of my holding.  An official came to investigate my circumstances as he did with all the other applicants, and he expressed himself most satisfied that I was a desirable case for attention.  In the meantime, however, the land was all meted out to others that he had mentioned.&rdquo; I shall not use the words which he uses to describe those people, because it might be considered to be to their prejudice, but he goes on to say: &ldquo;Amongst those who got land there were two old maids, sisters, with no matrimonial prospects, but they were allotted a portion of land. He referred the case to Deputies Hogan and Broderick after the occurrence and they both promised, especially Mr. Hogan.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Quite right.  They stated they would interview the Commissioners on the matter, but since then all has been quiet.  Nothing occurred. He did not get any of the land.  I would ask Deputies to listen to this very carefully, lest it might be thought I am pleading for a follower of Fianna Fáil.  &ldquo;I would have forwarded this through your Cumann were it not that I am in no organisation whatsoever.&rdquo; So I am not merely applying for land for a Fianna Fáil supporter.  He may be a member of the Labour Party, but he does not belong to either side in politics.</P>
      <P>I have a letter here from Gort, which states that &ldquo;the lands of Coolepark, Gort, Gregory Estate, have been acquired by the Estates Commissioners and are being handed over to the Department of Agriculture for afforestation purposes.  In face of the fact that a large number of landless men and congests have applied for holdings thereon, and that this estate or the portion of it that is being sold comprises at least 200 acres of arable land, and to us all it seems that to plant this portion of it at least is so much waste, while thousands of acres suitable only for planting are allowed to remain waste.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second portion of the letter refers to &ldquo;Pollough Bog on the Gough Estate, divided last April by the Estates Commissioners.  It was to be drained and roads made by them to enable the tenants to get supplies of fuel for the year.  Since then nothing has been done either in drainage or road making.&rdquo; These are genuine complaints and honest criticism.  I have the documents here.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to see them I shall give them to him at any time. There is another case which is a complaint about the division of land at Ballinlass.  The document states: &ldquo;31 men agreed to buy a man's interest in the lands of Ballinlass for the sum of £4,250, of which sum we paid £2,062 10s.  Being unable to pay the balance. <Col N="186" /> the Commissioners came to our assistance and took over the lands.  When it came to the division they went to several people, and told them to meet them on the land.  Four of us never got a preference of Ballinlass, and never got any portion of the money paid for the purchase.&rdquo; They got no land whatever on the estate.  Neither did they get their share of the £2,062 they paid, so that they got neither land nor money ever since.  But I shall finish the letter: &ldquo;We were offered the waste lands at Longford, while those that never paid one shilling for Ballinlass got all the arable land, though some of them had valuations of £10 and over, and some of our valuations are as low as £3 15s.  We think, in justice, we ought to get the refund of our money when we got no land.&rdquo; This is signed Pat Kean, Michael Galvin, Bernard Delaney, John Quinn, Pat Kelly, Mrs. Delaney, Mrs. Doyle.</P>
    <P>Then, convenient to Athenry, acting on the instructions of the Land Commission, 14 tenants bought a farm, Castle Campbell, from Mrs. ShawTaylor in 1921.  It was bought through the Land Bank and divided by Mr. Commissioner Quinn.  That land is not taken over yet from the tenants, and they are paying interest in lieu of rent since 1921, although repeated application was made to the Land Commission to take over the land.  As a matter of fact, these applications are practically ignored in the Land Commission, although they sanctioned the purchase and were quite satisfied with the price and sent a Commissioner down to divide, and by a miracle the Commissioner pleased all the tenants and there was no grumbling.  The only complaint is that for seven years they are paying interest in lieu of rent to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I have a few other cases, one where the owner is Johnson of the Hampstead Estate.  A Committee of six persons purchased this estate in 1920 for £4,000. They made several applications to the Land Commission to take up this land for distribution purposes but they got no information from them.  I have other cases but I do not propose to delay the Committee by citing them. Perhaps I may be as fortunate as some of the Deputies in my inquiries at the Land Commission.  They went there <Col N="187" /> they told us, and were courteously received.  Perhaps I may be able to say the same at some future date with regard to the Land Commission officials and I may be able to endorse what others have said about them.</P>
    <P>I shall quote one other particular case, which is that of the O'Rourke estate in Tuam.  Some time ago I asked a question as to why the land known as the Racecourse Farm of 107 acres taken up by the Land Commission for distribution was afterwards handed back to Mr. O'Rourke.  I got a reply stating that there was no congestion in the area and that the land was afterwards sold back to Mr. O'Rourke and that it was only reasonable that the land should go back to him; that he was already after selling 900 acres and that these were the only lands he had attached to his house.  I discovered since I got that answer that the same gentleman had just on the other side of the road 80 Irish acres of land set on the 11 months system to a gentleman named Strahan, of Tuam, and Mr. Strahan, by a remarkable coincidence, is a man whom the people in Tuam area are agitating against for the distribution of his land. I asked the Parliamentary Secretary some time ago for the result of the Land Commission's report on the Strahan estate in Tuam.  I was told the report was receiving the consideration of the Land Commission and the result would be given at some future date.  It is two years since the inspector's report went into the Land Commission and there is no result of it yet. That I consider is inefficiency.  It is one of the points which I wish to stress that the Land Commission, no matter what other people may say, are not doing their work as it should be done, and these delays are causing dissatisfaction amongst people who are anxious to get these lands.  The grievances that I have dealt with where tenants have been treated in the manner I have shown should get consideration by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I have also a letter of complaint from tenants in Ballyglunin area.  They say they have purchased their land since 1921 and that they are not yet vested.  There are several other farms <Col N="188" /> in County Galway which were divided and, to say the least of it, an unsatisfactory distribution was made.  There is one case in Kiltulla, outside Athenry, where an unsatisfactory distribution of land has caused trouble.  Land was also divided on the Redington estate, near Tuam.  I asked why some congested tenants did not get a share of it when it was going, and I was informed here that the tenants were not congested at all.  That may be true, or it may not, but it was a remarkable coincidence, as in Deputy Kennedy's case, that one gentleman got 70 acres and the residence, and that that gentleman happened, by a remarkable coincidence, to be an ex-officer of the National Army.  It may be only a coincidence.  Probably he deserved it, and I wish him luck.  I am very glad to see you in the Chair, Sir, and I take this opportunity of forcibly reminding you of a matter that was raised on the adjournment just before the House adjourned for Easter.  Deputy Hogan got away with a little of his own then for the time being, and owing to the limited time that you told me I had I could not answer him, inasmuch as the Parliamentary Secretary should get ten minutes to reply.  Deputy Hogan, when defending the Land Commission from an attack made on it by Deputies Killilea and Tubridy, brought all the Galway Deputies into it.  He stated that the Galway Deputies were doing nothing prior to the September election but dividing land; promising land at all the election meetings, and that it was such promises&mdash;he was more or less annoyed probably&mdash;accounted for the presence of some of us here.  Deputy Hogan did not exactly put it that way, but I take it that that is what he meant. The Deputy was asked to name the Deputies who were guilty of this offence, and he hedged for a few moments until he was pinned to it.  When we insisted on getting the names, by way of getting ahead with the attack, he carelessly said: &ldquo;Deputies Jordan, Tubridy and Killilea.&rdquo; I suppose Deputies Tubridy and Killilea will get a chance of replying to him.  I avail of this opportunity at any rate to do so.  I am sorry he is not in the House, because I would tell him a little more than is exactly <Col N="189" /> relevant to what he said.  You can keep me within bounds.  I refute that statement. Deputy Hogan stated a deliberate falsehood in this House when he accused me of promising land at any of the meetings I addressed prior to the elections in September.  I never made any such statement.  Deputy Hogan knows in his heart and soul that I did not.</P>

The age of miracles is past; it was then ten minutes to nine and I had no time.  When Deputy Hogan, with other Deputies, and with some who aspired to come here with the Cumann na nGaedheal Party but failed, were addressing election meetings in Galway they boosted up all the Land Commission had done for the people, all that the 1923 Land Act had done, and all that it did not do.  Deputy Hogan and other Deputies made great capital out of the good work the Land Commission had done and all that the Government had done.  Deputy Hogan went further when addressing meetings and said that not only would the people derive more benefit from the Land Commission if his Party were returned to power, but that the land that was not divided would be divided.  I think that was promising land.  I did not promise any, as I could not do so.  I have no land to give away, and we have not got the reins of office yet.  When we do we will divide it.  Deputy Hogan <Col N="190" /> made no secret of it anyhow, nor did any of the other Deputies.  He went a little further and told the farmers of Co. Galway that they would get loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation at 3 per cent. or 3½ per cent.  Now we find they cannot get them at less than 5½ per cent.</P>

I have gone further and have stated that he, with other members of the Cumann na nGaedheal.

      <P>The debate on these Estimates has proceeded very much on the same lines as the debate on the recent Supplementary Estimate.  I am frankly disappointed at the criticism of these Estimates.  I thought that some practical, constructive proposals would come from some of the economists in the House as to how we could reduce the expenditure on the Land Commission and how we could render <Col N="191" /> the Land Commission more efficient. Deputy Morrissey was perfectly right, and his statement was perfectly justified, that the criticisms of these Estimates in other years were far more intelligent than the criticism of this one has been.  Many Deputies seem to be unable to distinguish between tenanted land and untenanted land. Other Deputies seemed to be unable to distinguish between annuities and the price paid for land to landlords.  Other Deputies kept harping back to the wonderful progress made in distributing land during the former régime. I have given figures already showing quite clearly that we are acquiring and distributing land at least three times as fast to-day as it was acquired and distributed under the former régime.  Perhaps on this occasion I could supplement these figures somewhat and give them in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures which I propose to give are a comparison of the rate of progress prior to and subsequent to the 31st March, 1923, the date on which the Land Commission was transferred to the Free State Government.  First I will give the figures relating to the vesting of holdings in purchasers under the 1903 and 1909 Acts.  During the twenty years from 1903 to 1923 the Land Commission and the Estates Commissioners vested 5,590,582 acres in 152,771, purchasing tenants in respect of direct sales between landlord and tenant, say an average per annum of 280,000 acres and of 7,640 holdings.  In respect of the re-sale of estates under the same Acts purchased by the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board during the same twenty years' period, the Land Commission vested 1,406,705 acres in 43,821 purchasers, say an average per annum of 70,335 acres and 2,190 purchasers.  In comparison with these figures, in respect of direct sales alone since 1923. the present Land Commission has vested nearly all the holdings&mdash;I am speaking now of direct sales only&mdash; amounting to 14,255 in respect of which purchase agreements were lodged and pending under the Land Acts of 1903 and 1909 in the Free State, comprising an area of over 431,000 acres, the average rate of vesting <Col N="192" /> per annum during the three years 1923-26, in which the bulk of the holdings were vested, having been over 125,000 acres and 4,100 holdings.  Most of these pending cases were residues of estates held over on account of exceptional difficulties, difficulties which I indicated in my concluding statement on the Supplementary Estimate, difficulties relating to occupancy, difficulties relating to boundary disputes, to turbary, to drainage maintenance rates, and difficulties of various other kinds.  These were the types of estates that we had to deal with between the years 1923 and 1926, and, as I say, we have succeeded in surmounting our difficulties in connection with these estates and vesting nearly all the holdings&mdash;14,225&mdash; in respect of which purchase agreements had been signed.  Considering the extraordinary difficulties which some of these estates presented&mdash;legal difficulties mainly&mdash;I think that the rate of progress in that respect alone has been considerably greater than the rate of progress during any period under the former régime.</P>
    <P>In respect of re-sale since 1923 of estates purchased by the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board under the 1903 and 1909 Acts, the present Land Commission vested in the Free State over 510,000 acres in 14,600 purchasers&mdash;that is, an average per annum of 102,000 acres and 2,920 purchasers.  That is considerably above the average of the years from 1903 to 1923&mdash;it is practically double the average of that period.  So much for the rate at which vesting has been carried on.  I will now give some detailed figures regarding the division of untenanted land, leaving out of account altogether the division of untenanted land on the Congested Districts Board's estates, both before and after the year 1923, and comparing the division of untenanted land by the Estates Commissioners with the present Land Commission.  The total area of untenanted land divided by the Estates Commissioners during the years from 1903 to 1923 was 336,359 acres amongst 14,958 allottees; say an average per annum of 16,818 acres and 750 allottees.  In addition to dividing 22,000 acres since 1923 on estates purchased <Col N="193" /> by the Estates Commissioners under the Land Act of 1903, the Land Commission have divided over 141,000 acres of untenanted land amongst 6,490 allottees.  Considering that the Land Commission only began this distribution of land in the year 1925, the average per annum under the 1923 Act alone works out at over 45,000 acres and 2,100 allottees, as compared with 16,000 acres and 750 allottees for the earlier period.  In fact, during the past year the Land Commission have divided over 60,000 acres acquired under the 1923 Act alone, which is considerably more than the Estates Commissioners divided in any one year.</P>
    <P>As regards untenanted land on the Congested Districts Board's estates, as Deputies, particularly those from Western constituencies, know, the Congested Districts Board was very active, especially after the passing of the 1909 Act, in acquiring land in the congested areas.  As regards untenanted land on the Congested Districts Board's estates, up to the transfer of the Board to the Land Commission in 1923, they had divided 413,894 acres in a period of over thirty years.  You must recollect that the Board first acquired land in 1891 out of their own funds.  This was an average annual distribution of 14,000 acres.  Since 1923 the Land Commission have divided 106,000 acres of untenanted land on these Congested Districts Board's estates; say an average annual division of 21,000 acres, showing clearly that the rate of progress has been very much greater since the transfer of the Congested Districts Board to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I think that these figures should convince Deputies that land acquisition and land distribution is proceeding much more rapidly to-day than it proceeded under the former régime.  I stated in the discussion on the Supplementary Estimate that land acquisition and land distribution is proceeding at least three times faster to-day than it proceeded under the former régime, and I can reiterate that statement on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Another grievance that many Deputies seem to be labouring under was with regard to the delay in the vesting <Col N="194" /> of estates, not only the vesting of estates acquired under the 1923 Act, but some Deputies also laboured the fact that there was also delay in the vesting of estates acquired under earlier Acts&mdash;the Acts of 1903 and 1909.  As regards the delay in vesting holdings in tenant purchasers, Deputies should remember that vesting is, after all, a legal operation and that legal requirements have to be complied with before such vesting can be completed. These legal difficulties are very elaborate and intricate, and they inevitably take time.  Matters pertaining to rights of way, to drainage rates, to title and occupancy, to turbary rights and to the innumerable other things that are inseparable from the acquisition of land, have got to be settled and disposed of according to certain legal processes before the holdings can be finally vested in the tenants.  All these matters inevitably take time and inevitably cause delay.</P>
    <P>In connection with certain estates acquired by the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners, the vesting of holdings was delayed until the Congested Districts Board, or the Estates Commissioners, as the case might be, might have an opportunity of acquiring additional land for the purpose of carrying out a scheme of re-arrangement and consolidation for whole townlands.  Many estates were held over by the Congested Districts Board in order that they might have an opportunity later of acquiring additional land so that such a scheme of consolidation and re-arrangement might be carried out.  In other cases tenants refused to sign the final purchase agreements, and Deputies who were in the Dáil at the passing of the 1927 Act will remember that a special section had to be introduced into that Act in order that that difficulty might be got over&mdash; Section 53, I think.  That section provides that even if these tenants have not actually signed purchase agreements the holdings will be still vested in them, according to the legal procedure laid down in that section.</P>
    <P>I stated yesterday, in introducing this Estimate, that no less than 15,000 of these holdings&mdash;that is, holdings under the 1903 and the 1909 Acts, representing in purchase money over <Col N="195" /> £3,000,000&mdash;have been vested on re-sale since the Land Commission was transferred to the Free State Government, and, in addition to that, 14,250 holdings were also vested in that period in respect of direct sales pending under the Acts of 1903 and 1909 at the date of such transfer.  Great care must be exercised in seeing that the vestings are accurately completed. Otherwise the possibilities of future litigation might be vested with the lands.  If vesting is not carried out satisfactorily, if certain legal difficulties are overlooked, no matter how trifling they may be, it might lead to endless litigation and have the effect of piling a tremendous amount of costs on the unfortunate tenants.  I think we can claim that in this country we have probably as perfect a system of land registration as there is to be found in any other country in the world.  After all, even assuming that slight delays have occurred, even assuming that tenants have been deprived for a few years of that little additional relief which they will get when the holdings are vested in them, they are compensated in the end by the knowledge of the fact that when the holdings are finally vested in them their title is indisputable, that it can never be questioned at any time subsequently. On account of the delicate nature of the legal processes involved in this matter, it is not a wise or a sound policy to hasten this work unduly. You must allow the legal men to proceed cautiously and carefully, while striving to attain, at the same time, as great a degree of celerity as possible in carrying the business through.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been made from time to time of the delay on the question of vesting.  Perhaps I had better explain briefly the different stages that have to be gone through before land is finally vested in tenants, under the Land Act of 1923.  Before the appointed day, or the vesting date&mdash;I am dealing now with the 1923 Act&mdash;can be fixed the following are the steps that have to be taken: First of all, there is the statutory obligation on the landlord, or the owner of land, to lodge what is legally called the schedule of <Col N="196" /> particulars of the holdings, with maps and other necessary documents.  The lands are then subsequently visited by a surveyor to check boundaries and to deal with questions of occupancy, turbary, drainage maintenance rates, and innumerable other things.  When the surveyor's report is received, it has got to be examined, and any difficulties, or any queries arising from the examination of that report, have got to be submitted to the owner's solicitors.  The next step is the publication of a provisional list of lands, notifying the public in general that these lands are about to be acquired and will be vested in the Land Commission on the appointed day.  The provisional list, of course, is served on all interested parties.  Then a certain statutory period is allowed for the lodgment of objections.  Subsequently, if such objections are lodged, they have got to be considered and disposed of in a judicial way by the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Subsequently the estate has to be visited by an inspector and his attention directed to the various matters on which he is to report.  He has to value the land for the purpose of fixing the standard annuities, to report on the particular holdings that have to be retained, the number of sub-tenancies on the estate, joint tenancies, turbaries, sea-weed, grazing rights mineral and mining rights, etc.  The inspector has to report on all these matters.  When his report is submitted it is examined, and it usually happens that matters arising out of it have to be notified to the owners and the solicitors concerned. Matters requiring the Commissioners' ruling have to be submitted for their attention.  The next stage is that certain statutory notices prescribed by the Act have to be served on interested parties, in the case of retained holdings for the fixation of standard purchase annuities, and, in the case of nonjudicial holdings, of joint tenancies, sub-tenancies and so on.</P>
    <P>Then offers in respect of any fisheries have to be prepared.  The reservation of any ancient monuments that may exist on an estate have to be considered. In cases of that kind, the Land Commission have to communicate with the Board of Works, and sometimes with the county councils, as well as to serve <Col N="197" /> notices on the other parties concerned. I there are any foreshore matters involved, the Land Commission have to get into communication with the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is responsible for looking after such rights. The next stage is that when portion of the money is retained in the form of a fund for the future upkeep of sea or tidal embankments, the examiners of title have to be notified, so that matters of that kind may come before the Judicial Commissioner in Court who will then deal with the distribution of the purchase money.  He will see that a certain sum of money out of the purchase price is set aside for the purpose of maintaining embankments.  These are matters that have to be determined in a judicial way.</P>
    <P>The last stage is the preparation of the final list.  It has to be drafted and calculations made as to the purchase money, including any compounded arrears of rent.  Deputies will see, therefore, that before a holding can be finally vested in a tenant it has to go through several stages.  I have indicated briefly in this memorandum the stages which a holding on an estate has to go through before a vesting can take place under the 1923 Act.  I submit that all these stages are absolutely essential and necessary.  No matter how minute the examination of a stage may be, you cannot possibly afford to neglect one of them.  Most of them are statutory, and if you want to give a tenant a safe and secure title in his holding no simple detail can possibly be overlooked.</P>
    <P>When the Supplementary Estimate was under discussion I stated that the price at which we were acquiring land to-day was smaller than the price paid for land under either the 1903 or 1909 Acts.  I gave the figures in my concluding statement on that occasion, but notwithstanding that, many Deputies in the course of this debate yesterday and to-day have alluded to the fact that we are paying a higher price for land to-day than was paid under the earlier Acts.  I propose to repeat the figures I gave when the Supplementary Estimate was under discussion.  Under the 1903 Act the average price paid per acre was 11.4 pounds; under the 1909 Act the price was 16.2 pounds <Col N="198" /> and under the 1923 Act the average price paid per acre was 10.3 pounds These figures show conclusively that we are buying land to-day cheaper than it was bought under any of the earlier Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary what opportunity the House will have of comparing the different qualities of land purchased under the different Land Acts?  For example, are the bogs in Mayo to be put in the same category as the rich lands in Tipperary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>Land was bought in Mayo as well as in Tipperary under the earlier Acts as it was under the 1923 Act.  I do not see any point in that.  I believe there was a considerably higher proportion bought under the 1909 and 1903 Acts than under the 1923 Act.  A comparison of this kind if instituted, and if the Deputies here were judges of land, and the majority are not, would be in favour of the 1923 Act.  What Deputies mean is that annuities are higher under the 1923 Act than under the earlier Acts.  Under the 1903 Act interest and sinking fund amounted to 3¼ per cent.; under the 1909 Act it amounted to 3½ per cent., and under the 1923 Act to 4¾ per cent.  But money was dearer in 1923 and consequently you had to pay a higher rate of interest for it.  That is the explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, that you had to pay more as money was dearer, the basis of land purchase, as I understand it, was to give the landlord 75 per cent. of his rent, or to make the tenant pay 75 per cent. of what had been paid to the landlord. If you can borrow money and that money realises for the landlord an interest of 4¾ per cent., whereas before it realised only 3¼ per cent., does it not stand to reason that it should take a less amount of money to give the same return to the landlord?</P>

It is bought at a valuation.  You cannot say that untenanted land shall be bought at a price which will give the landlord 75 per cent. of his rent out of it, for it was never subject to a rent. We are discussing untenanted land, and that is bought with reference to its value.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, it was bought under the 1903 Act at £11.4; £16.2 under the 1909 Act, and under the 1923 Act, £10.3. These were the average prices per acre.</P>

      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary is quoting figures in relation to prices paid under the 1903, the 1909 and the 1923 Acts, has he before his mind the fact that since 1923 onwards there is more unoccupied land in the Free State than at any period for 50 years before?  Is he also aware that the market price for land had never been lower than during that period and does he consider, in face of that, that the price paid to the landlord within recent years is a fair proportion of the face or market value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point arising out of the 1923 Act which possibly explains the difficulties that some Deputies are in.  Under the 1923 Act the Land Commission have power compulsorily to acquire tenanted land. They have power to acquire not only untenanted land which is fee simple, but tenanted land and also land held subject to a land purchase annuity.  But there was a provision inserted by the Dáil, and rightly insisted on, that where the Land Commission was acquiring tenanted land subject to a rent it would have to give a resumption price, and resumption price can be roughly described as market value.  You cannot have it both ways.  You can buy tenanted land compulsorily and divide it, but if you do the allottees will have to pay a much higher annuity.  If you do not like that, then insert a provision in an Act to the effect that tenanted land can be acquired by the Land Commission at the same price as untenanted land.  In other words, repeal the 1881 Act which gives fixity of tenure.  At the time the 1923 Act was going through, Deputies considered that the 1881 Act should not be repealed and they considered it advisable to allow the Land Commission to take land subject to the rights of tenure under the 1881 Act.  They decided to allow the Land Commission to take tenanted land, in cases where it was essential, at the resumption price. <Col N="202" /> It is for Deputies now to say whether that should be repealed, and whether they stand for taking land from tenants at £10 an acre instead of at its market value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the Land Commission take land and pay the tenant cash they never compensate him by giving him land elsewhere.  The only case in which they give land elsewhere is where they take land not tenanted but subject to a land purchase annuity. In that case they give the man land elsewhere and possibly a grant for a house.  They are not going to take land from a man, a purchased tenant. and give him 200 acres elsewhere and leave him without a house.  He had a house on his original holding and in that case they would give him a grant.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan asked a question in regard to the staff of the Land Commission, and in subsequent remarks he seemed to imply that the Land Commission was working to-day with a considerably larger staff than was engaged on the acquisition and distribution of land under the earlier Boards.  I find, on examination of the figures relating to earlier years, that in the year 1910/11 there was a staff of 799 engaged on land work both under the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board.  I am now dealing with the Twenty-six Counties. Deputy Derrig will be interested in these figures.  In the year 1911/12 there was a staff of 808 working under both bodies, engaged on land operations in the Twenty-six Counties.  In 1912/13 the staff amounted to 821, and in 1913/14 the staff was 823.  To-day our total staff on the Land Commission, notwithstanding the fact that our activities are three times greater, is 704.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is making a point at my expense. I would like to say that what I am interested in is whether the Land Commission at present is giving the same amount of employment in the improvement of estates as at that period. We can then discuss the officials.  Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary said that the general purposes scheme for the improvement of the congested districts had been wiped out of the Land Commission Vote.  If that work was wiped out, why include the officials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the Deputy yesterday that last year £100 was included under the heading of Special Schemes.  That £100 will in future be paid out of the Improvements Vote.  That £100 was put into the Estimates <Col N="204" /> for the purpose of carrying out certain repairs to certain nurses' cottages in Northern and Western districts, some in Mayo, some in Galway, and others in Donegal.  The amount is really very small.  The Deputy, I know, is interested in these figures, because he referred to the matter in the discussion on the Supplementary Estimates, and he mentioned the figures for 1911 and 1912.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. CLERY Mr. CLERY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CLERY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only giving the numbers of the staff on the land portion of the work.  I know that portion of the staff of the Congested Districts Board was engaged on fishery development, cottage industries, and things of that kind.  But this is relatively a very small part of the whole.  I am only giving the corresponding numbers actually engaged at land work in these particular years.  Deputy Ryan complained that the figures I supplied then were not as complete as he would like them to be.  I think the Deputy will realise that it is always difficult to give, in reply to a Parliamentary question, figures in such a form as will be absolutely clear and intelligible.  However, if the Deputy has any grievance on that score, and if he wants more detailed figures, I will be only too glad to give them to him later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point that I would like to refer to in connection with the Deputy's remarks.  He mentioned, I think, that according to his calculation, presumably based on figures which I gave him in reply to his question, there was still four million odd acres of land to be dealt with by the Commission.  In that connection, lest there should be any misunderstanding in Deputies' minds as to the actual position with regard to the available balance of land, I propose to give the approximate figures.  The total area of land in the Free State is 17,019,155 acres.  From this is to be deducted water, roads, fences, town building ground, amounting to 892,533 acres, leaving a total of 16,126,622 acres which might be regarded as agricultural land.  Approximately <Col N="205" /> 10 million acres have been vested in the purchasers under the Acts prior to the Act of 1923.  This leaves us an approximate 6,126,622 acres outstanding. Of this latter figure, 1,305,000 acres have been acquired by the Land Commission, but are not yet actually vested in the purchasers on re-sale. Deducting these 1,305,000 acres from the 6,126,622 acres, there remains a possible available acreage of 4,821,000 acres to be dealt with under the Act of 1923.  Of these, probably three million acres are tenanted land of which schedules and particulars, maps, etc., have already been prepared for 2,767,000 acres.   The remaining 1,821,000 acres is untenanted land.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of this untenanted land consists of demesnes, glebes, residential holdings, home farms, parks, roads, plantations, waste lands and barren mountains.  It is probable that not more than 1,000,000 acres will be found suitable for acquisition for distribution amongst uneconomic holders and the other classes of persons mentioned as qualified under the Act.  These correspond with the figures which I gave in my final statement on the Supplementary Estimate. Under the Act of 1923 the Land Commission have already acquired 220,000 acres of untenanted land, and they have fixed a price or are negotiating for the purchase of 180,000 acres which, together, make up 400,000 acres of the 1,000,000 acres of untenanted land likely to be suitable for acquisition. That leaves approximately 600,000 or 700,000 acres of land still available for acquisition and distribution.  These figures represent approximately the present position with regard to the operations under the Act of 1923, and indicate fairly approximately the amount of untenanted land which is still available for acquisition under that Act.  The Deputy also asked what duties were performed by the surveyors. The salaries and duties were criticised, I think, by Deputy Fahy.  He wanted to know what duties were performed by the surveyors.  I think, if the Deputy looks at the Estimate, he will see that the surveying staff are certainly not paid high salaries.  The surveyors on improvement works are <Col N="206" /> paid a salary of £250; that is a beginning salary.  The other surveyors are paid salaries ranging from £130 to £200 a year, and some of them are paid even smaller salaries than that.  These men are engaged in fairly difficult work.  In addition to that, quite a number of these men are qualified engineers.  Some of these men have engineering degrees, and I think the Deputy will agree that a salary of £240 to £300 a year is not an exorbitant salary to a man with a university degree.  These men are primarily engaged in checking boundaries of estates, the schedules and particulars of which have been furnished by the landlords.  They are engaged in mapping areas of turbary and preparing maps in connection with the subdivision of estates.  Some of them are engaged and are being paid by the Land Registry in reconstructing maps destroyed in the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked how the inspectorate staff of the Land Commission staff was recruited.  Since the transfer of the Land Commission to the Saorstát Government, on the 31st March, 1923, the inspectorial staff of the Land Commission has been recruited solely through the Civil Service Commission.  A Selection Board is set up and the men selected are men who have the special qualifications for the work on which they are about to be engaged.  Practically all these men are graduates either of Trinity College or the National University.  They all hold engineering degrees, and some of them hold other degrees as well.  I think Deputies will agree that a salary of £400 or £500 a year is not an exorbitant salary for a highly qualified man of that type. These men are working continuously from morning till night.  The ordinary civil servant has seven and a half to eight hours work a day.  The inspectors often have to work 12 to 14 hours a day, particularly since the intensive operations under the Act of 1923 began.</P>

The majority of the inspectors were originally employed by the Congested Districts Board.  Most of these men passed the Civil Service examination and secured positions through the ordinary channels of the Civil Service, as we understand it, under a former regime.

      <P>I think that Deputy Cooper's suggestion is probably a more sensible one.  It might be considered more properly by the Economy Committee. I should like to explain the intimate association that exists between the staff engaged in the Purchase Branch and those engaged in the Collection Branch.  In connection with the consolidation of estates and sub-division, amongst other things, there is naturally the very closest contact between the Collection Branch and the Purchase Branch, because the annuities have to be adjusted.  Where consolidation takes place the annuity has to be increased, and if a holding is subdivided there is natuarlly a reduction. There is intimate association between the work of the Collection Branch and the work of the Purchase Branch.  There is a question of the identification of estates.  Very often the Collection Branch is exceedingly helpful in that respect, and, conversely, the Purchase Branch is helpful to the Collection Branch.</P>

      <P>On the face of it, I would say &ldquo;No.&rdquo; As the Deputy will understand, I have not had an opportunity of giving deep consideration to these proposals.  It facilitates the work of land acquisition and distribution to have the Registry under the control of the Land Commission.  The men in the Land Registry have to be consulted frequently in connection with various stages of the negotiations for the acquisition of estates, and it is necessary to have them under the control of the Land Commission.  I indicated a moment ago in reply to Deputy Boland my reasons for saying that it would be false economy and bad administration to separate the Collection Branch from <Col N="210" /> the Land Commission.  That is my own personal view.  As Deputy Cooper suggested, that is primarily a matter for consideration by the Economy Commission which was set up by the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary states that the cause of delay in the period from the purchase of estates until the vesting is mainly determined by legal difficulties in securing what I presume to be proper legal title, will he not consider that the responsibility for showing title to the estate rests with the landlord, and, if undue delay is caused by the landlord failing to produce legal title, the landlord should stand the responsibility for the loss of interest on the purchase money for the period during which he is responsible for the delay, and that that should not be left to the tenant?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the question was in relation to the period that the <Col N="212" /> Parliamentary Secretary considers normal from the time the estate is purchased until it is vested.  If anything beyond the normal period elapses from the taking over of an estate until it is vested owing to the difficulty of acquiring a title or of there not being a proper title, I claim that the responsibility for showing title rests upon the vendor, who is the landlord in this case.  If he does not show title within the normal period, then it would be due to him to take responsibility for any lack of payment of interest on the purchase money instead of putting it on to the tenant, which seems to be the present procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>To begin with, I think I have made the position in connection with the vesting of estates fairly clear. At least I thought I had.  Probably more of these holdings would have been vested were it not for the demands made by Deputies and people generally in the country that land should be acquired for distribution under the 1923 Act.  Possibly another cause for delay in the vesting of estates was that during the war years the Land Commission staff was considerably depleted, and naturally the work suffered in consequence.  I think I gave figures yesterday to show that at the present time the vesting of estates has been considerably accelerated.  I gave figures showing that in the last six months 1,880 holdings, comprising 80,000 acres, have been dealt with, as against 191 holdings, comprising 8,600 acres, in the previous six months.  That shows conclusively that we have increased considerably the rate at which vesting is being carried out.  Even yet we have not reached the maximum of our activities under Section 2 of the Act of 1927. Probably in six months time we will experience the maximum activity under that particular Act.  In addition to that, other steps are being taken for the purpose of expediting vesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would give a direct answer to the question I put.  I did not ask the figures as to the rate of procedure or the speed of vesting for the last six months.  I said that in cases where undue delay from the <Col N="213" /> period of taking over an estate until the vesting was due to legal difficulties, these legal difficulties and the responsibility for showing legal title rests on the landlord.  I pointed out that where undue delay has occurred the landlord should bear the responsibility for the loss of interest on the purchase price instead of the tenant having to do so, as at present.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary taken into consideration the number of cases of that kind, and will he take precautions to see that the loss is taken over by the responsible parties, the landowners, instead of the tenants?</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he is aware that the landlord suffers just as much, if not more, by the delay than the tenant?  He is only getting 3½ per cent., instead of 5 per cent., on the purchase price.  He is not getting any interest on the bonus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied that my question has been answered by Deputy Cooper's statement that the landlord suffers because he is only receiving 3½ per cent. instead of 5 per cent.  The Land Purchase Acts of 1903 or 1909, in which I am interested, gave the landlord a specific price.  Whether he receives 2½ or 3½ per cent., or 5 per cent., is quite immaterial to me.  The question I want answered is whether tenants who have purchased under the 1903 Act, whose land has not yet been vested, and who have been at considerable loss in consequence, are to be held responsible because the landlord failed to show proper title to the Land Commission for his property?</P>

      <P>As far as these estates are concerned, the landlord's title has been shown long since.  The delay in <Col N="216" /> the vesting of lands, as I tried to indicate on the Supplementary Estimate and on this occasion, is due to a variety of other causes.  Some of the staff of the Land Commission have been taken out for the purpose of engaging on other work.  We have had intensive operations at the request of a number of Deputies and members of the public under the Land Act of 1923.  Then there was the delay with regard to compounded arrears, the difficulty in connection with which was resolved by the 1927 Act.  Now we are in a position to go ahead at a considerably faster pace, and I hope, as time goes on, we will be able to go still faster.</P>

      <P>Most of the details of the Vote are statutory, arising out of the Railways Act, and I do not intend to go into very much detail with regard to them.  Sub-head A &mdash;&ldquo; Annual Payment to Great Southern Railways Company under the Railway Act, 1924, Section 63 (1) &rdquo;&mdash; is a liability which arises under that section, and in connection with that payment I refer Deputies to the Appropriations-in-Aid at the end, which show that the State recovers £30,000 out of this £48,000, and that the net demand is somewhere in the region of £18,000. The second item is &ldquo;Repayment to County Councils,&rdquo; which arises under the two old Acts mentioned.  Previously there had been quite a number of payments under these Acts which have been substituted by Section 63 (1) of the Railways Act, 1924.  The only payment now is in the case of the Dublin and Blessington Tramway, and the contribution there is, as stated in the last column, limited to an amount not exceeding two per cent. on the guaranteed capital.  Item C is not statutory.  It is the best estimate that can be made at this stage of losses that will arise in working the three colliery railways mentioned&mdash; Castlecomer, Wolfhill and the Arigna extension.  It was stated in the debates on the Railway Act, and there is provision for it in the Act, that these colliery railways most likely would be absorbed by the Great Southern Railways Company. That absorption has not yet <Col N="219" /> taken place.  A case is being prepared with regard to these railways.  But on the basis that the railways will not be absorbed this year, and that losses in working will occur, the money has to be voted.</P>
      <P>The fourth item is the repayment year by year, in the form of annuities, of advances that were previously made for the construction of certain railways and for certain piers and harbours.  It will be noticed that this is terminating year by year, and that in about three years more the sum will have been reduced by £16,000.  With regard to E, this is an item which has appeared year by year on the Estimates, and certain small payments have in the different years been made, but never up to the full amount of the money voted.  The item occurs by reason of the fact that when the land over which the colliery railways were to run was acquired, title could not be proved by certain people who claimed to be the owners, and it is only by degrees that they are proving their title.  The full amount required to compensate those outstanding is estimated at this £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I have, I think, on previous occasions said that it was expected that this item would disappear, I cannot yet say that it will, in other words that the people claiming to be owners will, in the course of the year, prove their title to the lands and receive the payment due to them.  The money, however, must be voted again now in the event of their being able to prove title in the financial year.  There are two steamer services mentioned in the next item. That item looks as if it were an increase. That is not in fact so, because the second item, the subsidy to the Galway-Arran steamer service, previously was borne on the Estimate of the Minister for Fisheries and was for the same amount last year as is here set out.  It will be noticed that there is a reduction of £500 with regard to the money voted to make good the deficit on the working of the Sligo-Belmullet steamer service. In three years careful attention to the running of this service has brought the cost of it down.  In 1925 the loss was over £1,100.  That was brought down <Col N="220" /> the year after to £668, and in 1927 the actual loss was £417.  We are providing a possible £500, but the payment will be made on the basis of the actual loss, and we supervise as far as we can the carrying on of that service.  It is hoped that the loss of even £417 of last year will not be repeated and that the service will be brought much nearer to paying its own way.  For the second service&mdash;the Galway-Arran steamer service&mdash;an estimate for £1,000 is being presented to the Dáil this year.  It is in the same position as the Belmullet-Sligo steamer service and is supervised by my Department. The loss in three years has also shown a decrease but not as big as in the case of the other service.  In this case the actual loss in working in 1925 was £902, which was reduced the year after to £815, and last year to a sum of £609. There are, of course, other charges to be met which bring the sums in 1925 to £1,699, to £1,287 in 1926 and to £1,015 last year.  One thousand pounds is being put down this year but negotiations have been going on with those interested in the company and it has been pointed out to them that the money, even if voted, will only be granted on certain conditions, which have been put to them, one being an investigation as to whether a smaller steamer could not do the work as efficiently, and with less cost.  The Appropriations-in-Aid are statutory. They are brought in under Section 63 of the Railways Act of 1924.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would give us some idea of the present position of the Dublin and Blessington Tramway Company, what are the prospects of continuing it, and whether he has any proposals for meeting the position that exists in connection with that undertaking.  He is aware, no doubt, that the ratepayers in both County Dublin and County Wicklow are under a very great disadvantage, and are suffering a serious hardship by having to contribute to the upkeep of the <Col N="221" /> undertaking.  I think some statement should be forthcoming as to the procedure that will be adopted as to the prospects of keeping the concern alive or of raising it to such a state of prosperity that it will not be a charge on either the central Government or the local authorities.  If the Minister has any remarks to make I would like to hear them now.</P>

That can surely be raised on the Minister's main Estimate; it is one of the Departments for which the Minister is responsible, so that I think on the salaries of the main Estimate&mdash;No. 56&mdash;that question might be raised rather than here.

      <P>I have been asked a question with regard to the Dublin and Blessington Tramway.  I think that Deputy Moore asked me what suggestions I had to offer by which the burden of this tramway on the counties or on the public funds might be lessened.  It is not my function to make suggestions with regard to the manner in which the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tram should be run.  As a matter of fact, my Department has been in close touch with the county surveyors who operated the tramways at one period, and with the committee of management at the moment.  But it is not my function to intervene in a matter of that sort and endeavour to teach these people their business.  If they apply for it the Department will give them any advice it can, and if we believe that there are certain economies that could be made and are not made we possibly have the right to come in, inasmuch as we are bound to make a payment, provided the working results are not sufficient to enable these charges to be met.  There is a committee of management interesting themselves in this tramway, consisting of thirteen ratepayers of Dublin and Wicklow.  They are investigating the question of economies and are trying to find out what can be done to make the system more nearly self-supporting. There is no question of closing the line at the moment; that is not in contemplation. The situation of the guaranteeing baronies might not be improved by merely closing down the line.  There is the question of guaranteeing the running under certain conditions, which would not be met at all simply by deciding that the line should not run.  In connection with this matter, the only question of liability for the Department at the moment is: Is the Department saddled with the payment of the ordinary liability under the old Act of an amount up to 3 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot say that it is possible to have that line so reconstructed or to have such changes either in the management or running of the line that it will cease to be a burden on the baronies and the counties concerned.  That will depend entirely on the amount of traffic that happens to be given to it for carriage. It may be that the line will not <Col N="224" /> pay and that it will have to face losses year by year on account of the competition of road vehicles.  That is a matter upon which no one can give any very definite judgment.  One would have to see what traffic the line will make itself suitable to handle, and how far it will get that traffic in opposition to other forms.  But, at the moment no case has been made for closing the line or saying that there is unfair competition as against the line.  Up to date there have been certain things attended to in the way of economies and management of the line.  These have been looked to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the idea that the Minister has no responsibility with regard to the prosperity of the line.  When the Government finds a situation such as this, where you have a certain number of people in a particular area burdened with liabilities that they have no responsibility for&mdash;no one, I think, can hold that a responsibility that was incurred during the grand jury days is one that the people of the present time should be burdened with&mdash; I do not agree that the Government has no responsibility to try and relieve that position.  The people in that area are suffering a great hardship.   I think that at the present moment the contribution from the rates to meet the charge made against the people in the County Wicklow amounts to about 2/3 in the £.  When the 1924 Act was being debated here, it was admitted by the President that the division of the liability as between the County Wicklow and the County Dublin was most unjust. He said it could not be defended. There is the further point that the Government has allowed competition to arise which is simply ruining the prospects of that tramway, and yet the Minister states that there is no unfair competition.  I am aware that there are at least two bus services in competition with that particular tramway line.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite unfairly in competition, taking the circumstance into <Col N="225" /> account that the area is burdened with a liability which the Government holds it is responsible for and is going to insist that it will bear.  I say it is unfair competition to allow the building up of roads there, practically to encourage bus traffic to compete with that tramway line, and still make the people of that particular area bear the present liability.  Nothing has been done, and apparently it is not proposed to do anything, to reapportion that liability, although, as I have already stated, the President admitted when the 1924 Act was under debate that the liability was unfairly divided.  I do not know what expert knowledge is being brought to bear on the question now, but there is this contribution of £800 from public funds, and the further contribution from the local ratepayers in respect of that undertaking.  In face of that, I think it is up to the Government to review the whole situation and endeavour to redeem it.  It cannot go on for ever.  As long as it is allowed to go on, it will rankle as an injustice in the minds of the people who have to pay the heavy rates levied on them to meet this liability.  In my opinion the situation is one that calls for action on the part of the Government, and they should take steps to relieve it.  At the present time it is a matter of the greatest anxiety and worry to those concerned in the counties Wicklow and Dublin, particularly those in County Wicklow.</P>

      <P>On the point of unfair competition, Deputy Moore says that it is unfair to allow any other method of transport into this area where certain ratepayers are burdened with certain payments.  If the ratepayers think that, the remedy is in their own hands.  They need not use these other methods of transport, and if the county council think there is unfair competition, they are the only people who have power to close the road against certain types of traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me get back to Deputy Moore's point.  The county councils have power to close a road against certain types of traffic.  If they think that the 'buses running on the road are unfair competition, they being the people burdened with big payments in connection with this rather uneconomic concern, then let them close the roads; let the ratepayers have a certain amount of appreciation that their services are running and use them.  It only requires to give a certain amount of traffic to the Blessington line to make it pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any case of unfairness could be made.  Is the position to be this, and is this the principle that Deputies want accepted: that people in certain areas are to be deprived of certain cheaper forms of transport simply because-certain <Col N="227" /> people in these areas are paying a contribution that was fastened on them in the old days for the upkeep of a particular type of line?  I do not think that there is any unfairness in this at all.  I think that if there was it would be for the county councils to move in the matter, apart from moving in the sense of stopping up the traffic.  Let them make some motion in the matter. Let them put forward proposals, and let us have their views.  As to the disproportion of the amounts borne by Wicklow and by Dublin, the considered views of the Joint Committee of Management composed of people from Wicklow and Dublin could be given on that.  Let them say that the proportion is unduly severe on Wicklow as opposed to Dublin.  If the Joint Committee of Management made such a recommendation it would have to be borne in mind, though I do not say it would be acted on.  But let that Joint Committee of Management bring forward a recommendation that the burden is unduly oppressive on Wicklow and should be shifted.  I think I know what Deputy Moore is driving at, but I desire to say this to him, that there is going to be no shifting of that burden on to public funds.</P>

      <P>It will not be stopped from going on for ever simply by transferring it to the public.  If certain people have put up money, and if certain guarantees have been given to them that they will be repaid, then the repayments will have to go on. You are only cloaking the thing if you shift the burden from the local ratepayers to the general taxpayers.  You are not doing away with the burden by transferring it to the taxpayer, and that, I think, was the tendency of Deputy Moore's argument, and that is what I object to.  There has been no case made for it.</P>

      <P>The Blessington tramway.  The people in the Wicklow area do not use the tram, and yet they are liable for a rate of 1/3 in the £ in connection with the concern.  The area in the County Wicklow that has to bear this rate is very small as regards valuation in comparison with County Dublin. Therefore, the rate does not press as heavily on the people in County Dublin as it does on the County Wicklow. The people from other counties are using that tramway, while the people in West Wicklow who have not any use for its service are made liable for the payment of this additional rate. The Minister suggested that the county council could have the road closed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that a county council has the power to close up a main or a trunk road against any other traffic.  What I say is that they ought to have the power to prevent competition from a large number of buses using the road.  I may say that the Wicklow County Council asked for special powers in connection with that matter.  I agree with Deputy Moore in the appeal that he has made to the Government.  The President is familiar with this whole matter.  As far back as 1920, when the President was Minister for Local Government, a deputation from the Wicklow County Council waited on him.  The President then gave an undertaking that if the ratepayers in the guaranteeing area would pay the rates in that year, he would make some arrangement for a Government contribution to help to relieve the people of that area.  On the promise that we received from the President on that occasion, I appealed to the ratepayers to pay the rates in that year.  Unfortunately that promise has not been fulfilled.  I think the Minister should make some arrangement to relieve the burden on these poor people.  Whether the tramway is running or not, this is a gilt-edged security for the people who have shares in it, the position being that the ratepayers <Col N="229" /> in the guaranteeing area are liable for the payment of this rate of 1/3 in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question that arises here is whether this sum of £800 should be voted from Government money.  The question as to what proportion of the rate should be paid by the County Wicklow as opposed to the County Dublin does not arise on this Estimate, and I do not intend to go into that.  I am not sure that I have overstated the position as to the powers of county councils with regard to roads.  I know they have powers with regard to certain roads.  It may be, as Deputy Everett says, that these powers do not extend to main roads. That would answer a certain part of the argument I put up.  As to the question of unfairness.  I was only answering Deputy Moore when I referred to that, because I do not think any unfairness arises at all.  All that I am concerned with here is the voting of this sum of £800, and if the tramway stopped immediately the guaranteeing areas would still have to pay their guaranteed amount of the charge.  The £800 from the Government would cease if the tramways were closed down.  If the tramway closes down and the people who use it are deprived of that method of transport, and if the people of the guaranteeing areas have still to pay their share of the guaranteed money, I do not see that the position will be very much better.</P>

The officials in my Department have been engaged on this for some time.  One can see considerations that might arise which the Department would raise either before the tribunal or the Great Southern Railways.  For instance, the question of closing the lines altogether.</P>
      <P>It may be a case might be made to the tribunal that there is no necessity for the line.  There may be the question of a line never paying, and the possibility that the tribunal might be coerced by that argument to force the Great Southern Railways Company to take over the line on terms that would enable the Great Southern Railways immediately to close it down.

      <P>The Minister said last year that the case for the absorption of these lines would be considered in the autumn of last year.  Now he states that a case is being prepared and that it may be considered this year.  I would like to know what difficulty has arisen, why it was not possible to bring the case before the tribunal last year, and why the State has to pay £2,000 again this year to defray the cost of working the line.  I would also like to know whether the Minister will tell us whether any provision is made in the case that will be presented to the tribunal to ensure that the lines will be kept working.  These lines were built at considerable cost for the purpose of developing the colliery industry in the districts concerned.  They have undoubtedly been worked at a loss since. The loss each year, except in 1926, was considerable.  The decrease in the loss in 1926 was due to the fact that there was a coal strike in England, and the quantity of coal carried over the lines increased to a very great extent.  The lines will undoubtedly continue to be worked at a loss unless the colliery industry <Col N="231" /> is developed.  The State owns the lines, and if it treats the matter as a business man would and say: &ldquo;Here is an asset we possess, and which is now working at a loss because of facts that are only indirectly under our control,&rdquo; a business man in these circumstances would endeavour to see how far he could influence the facts that were not directly under his control to ensure that the loss on the working of the lines would be diminished. The State itself is a large purchaser of coal.  By purchasing more coal from these Irish collieries they could reduce the loss on the working of the railway lines by ensuring that a larger volume of coal would be carried over them.  I do not know whether the Minister was contemplating in the case he proposes to put before the tribunal to compensate the railway company for taking over the lines.  I hope not.</P>

I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that the amalgamated company will not close down the lines, that they will be worked with the fullest possible advantage to the collieries there, and that as an incentive to the railway company to work them economically they be paid nothing by way of compensation in taking over the lines.  Something like £350,000 was spent in the construction of these lines. <Col N="232" /> Even if they were scrapped at the moment the scrap iron and the value of the land over which the lines are built is considerable, and the railway company would be given an asset in these lines.  We should see that the lines would be worked in the best interests of the country, which would be the development of the collieries they serve. We will have the transport policy before us on the general vote for the Minister's Department.  We can discuss it in relation to this particular line.  If it is the opinion of the Minister the lines are uneconomic it is essential to get rid of them as quickly as possible to remove the liability and hand them over to anyone who will take them, and perhaps pay them for taking them. That is one matter.  If it is the opinion of the Minister that these lines were built for the purpose of enabling collieries to be developed&mdash;and if it has been shown in 1926 that the loss in working could be reduced considerably and possibly eliminated altogether&mdash; more drastic steps should be taken to ensure that the fullest possible service to the collieries will be maintained and that they will be given every chance to develop.  One way in which that could be done would be by the State purchasing a larger quantity of coal than it does at the moment.</P>

      <P>I am surprised to hear Deputy Lemass saying that this dud railway would be an asset to any business or railway company under existing circumstances.  Deputy Lemass, I know, is aware that the Wolfhill colliery is closed down and that the affairs of that colliery are in the hands of a receiver for a year or so, and will be in his hands as long as he thinks he will receive anything from anybody in connection with it.  The colliery machinery has been scrapped.  If the gentleman who scrapped that machinery scrapped the railway material he would do it for the same purpose, that is, making money out of it.  This Estimate, as is stated in the heading, is to make good deficits in certain lines, including Wolfhill.  I am not aware that it has been working for the past couple of years.  Who is to receive this £200?  Is it the receiver, the gentleman who closed down the Wolfhill collieries and <Col N="233" /> threw out the 200 men who had been employed there for a considerable time? The same gentleman has been following up the ordinary shareholders for the recovery of the amounts they guaranteed in years gone by to the Wolfhill Colliery Company, Limited.  I am surprised that Deputy Hennessy is not here to say something on this question, because he has been pestering me in the lobby in the interests of his constituents who invested a few pounds in the colliery and who want it back again, while this gentleman is following them up for the amounts they have not paid. Does the receiver get this £200?</P>

      <P>That is satisfactory so far.  I do not wish to prejudice the tribunal, and I know anything I say will not prejudice its decision.  No Deputy who knows the circumstances under which this railway is carried on, and which is serving no useful purpose, would say that it should be taken over by any business concern.  It would be a dead weight in this case.  The suggestion that the Wolfhill railway should be passed on to the Great Southern Railways Company is, I think, a very valuable one, if there was any hope of re-opening the collieries. There is no use in suggesting that the Great Southern Railways Company should take over the Wolfhill railway until there is some hope of re-opening the colliery there.  It would serve no purpose of any kind under existing circumstances, and will not unless the Government or some body of business men will agree to put sufficient money into the colliery to enable it to re-start.  It has not been stated who is to get the £200 which it is estimated may be required to make good the deficit on these lines.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with anything the Deputy said about the history of the railways&mdash;when they were founded, the circumstances under which they were founded, the possibility of their being made an economic success by certain Government action, the details he entered into regarding the amount of traffic required, and, I think, the possibility of securing it at a certain period to make a success of the line that is working.  I think we had better leave this over to be argued before the tribunal.  As to the delay, the Railways Act, 1924 (Section 2. subsection 2), states that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this Act the Arigna Colliery Extension Railway, the Athy-Wolfhill Colliery Railway, and the Castlecomer Railway shall on the 1st day of January, 1925, or such earlier or later date as the Railway Tribunal after consultation with the Minister may fix, be absorbed by the amalgamated company on terms to be agreed with the owners of those railways or, in default of such agreement, on terms to be decided by the Railway Tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been endeavouring to get an agreement as to the basis on which these railways should be taken over. If we fail it is a question that has to be put to the Railway Tribunal.  The matter is sub judice.  I would prefer not to go into the details.  Deputy Davin says that the Wolfhill line is not working. A section of it is working, but a case will be put before the Railway Tribunal, and in the meantime we are <Col N="235" /> simply making this provision in the event of the railways being liable for this financial year, or a considerable portion of it, for losses that have to be met.  I would not like it to be taken as an order from this House&mdash;if it is going to appear in that light we will have to go into the merits of the whole case&mdash;I would not like it to be an order that there is to be no question of any terms being arranged which meant compensation to the railway company.</P>
    <P>The whole merits of the case will have to be considered and it will be for the tribunal to decide what should be the proper terms.  The Deputy has touched on one danger in the whole situation and that is that the matter is more likely to be treated simply as a business proposition when it comes before the Railway Tribunal.  My Department will have certain arguments to offer but the matter is likely to be treated almost entirely as a business proposition.  The question is can this line be made economical in its working or must the Southern Railways be forced to take it over without having been given anything in exchange for doing so?  It may be argued that the whole question of railway amalgamation should be reconsidered. I should like to have something definite on that question but I do not think anybody's hands should be tied in this matter.  We have certain duties to perform under this Act.  We tried to get it by agreement but now we have to go before the Railway Tribunal. Unless the House wants to have the details argued out and the merits discussed&mdash;unless some good reason is shown for that&mdash;I would prefer that it should be left over until the argument proceeds before the Railway Tribunal.</P>

      <P>Under sub-head D I observe that during the financial year 1927-28 there was a Supplementary Estimate of £6,500 made for an advance to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company.  I notice under the Estimates this year no mention is made of a subsidy or advance towards this railway.  As the Minister knows, this is one of the railways that was not brought into the amalgamation although approximately 99 per cent. of the line is situate in the Saorstát and only <Col N="236" /> two miles run in the Six Counties.  This line has to meet unfair competition in the way of motor buses in the Six Counties, the owners of which motor services employ sweated labour and ask their employees to work long hours. The result is that this particular company's employees are working at a ten per cent. reduction as compared with the amalgamated companies' employees. The railway company is up against unfair competition.  I would like to know from the Minister if it is his intention later on to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in order to give an advance to this company.  I would like to have a statement from the Minister with regard to the future management of this particular line as rumour has it that it is about to be taken over by a cross-Channel firm.  Perhaps the Minister would say something about this rumour and the Government's policy towards it.</P>

But there is nothing in the Estimates which will enable this matter to be raised.  There was an Estimate last year and the fact that there is no Estimate this year rules out a discussion of this matter.

      <P>Sub-head D is an item for £27,360 for annuities to repay advances by the National Debt Commissioners under the Railways (Ireland) Acts. 1896, and the Marine Works (Ireland) Act, 1902.  I move that the Vote be reduced in respect of this item by the entire amount of it&mdash; £27,360.  I think this amount should not be paid, and I would like to give the Dáil some arguments to justify the amendment.  The Parliament of the old political unit known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, passed the Railway Act of 1896 and the Marine Works Act of 1902; the former for the purpose of facilitating railway construction in poorer areas, and the latter for facilitating the construction of marine works, etc., in connection with industries in congested areas.  At the time the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland borrowed money from the Treasury through the National Debt Commissioners for the purpose of making advances under these Acts, they drew from the Treasury of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland money which was held there in respect of savings banks and similar institutions situated both in Great Britain and in Ireland.  The money advanced was repayable in instalments through the Treasury of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When considering this Vote I would ask the Deputies to bear that fact in mind&mdash;that the advances were made by the Government of Great Britain and Ireland out of money secured from Great Britain and from Ireland and that this money was repayable to the Treasury of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1921 when the political division between the two countries came, it was obvious that some adjustment in connection with this and similar items would have to be made.  It is clear, I hope, that the money was not due to Great Britain; that money was not advanced by Great Britain.  Neither was it advanced by Ireland, nor was it due to Ireland.  It was advanced from the funds common to the two countries and by the Government which claimed at the time to legislate for both countries. With the division of the political <Col N="238" /> partnership there should have come a division of the assets and liabilities of the old United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  On a fair division the Saorstát would have secured a just proportion of the assets and it also should have been saddled with its just proportion of the liabilities.  Unless the old United Kingdom was a bankrupt concern the assets exceeded the liabilities and consequently we should be receiving a payment under that head. If there was no agreement in that respect, it is obvious that the money which was repayable under these Acts was certainly not repayable into the British Treasury, not all of it.  These annuities, in the event of no agreement being arrived at, would have been paid in part to England and in part to Ireland.  They were an asset of the old United Kingdom and we were entitled to our share of those assets.  They were part of the public debt of the old United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>Whatever views Deputies may hold of the political division that took place there can be no doubt whatever that the entire amount of this sum is not due to the Treasury of the British Government. It is not due under any head whatsoever to that Treasury.  The Government claims that they have secured immunity from any liability in respect of the public debt of Great Britain by conceding their agreement to the permanent partition of the country, and consequently none of this sum is due to England nor to the British Treasury.  If this sum has been paid in the past it has been paid illegally.  There have been no statutes, no Acts of this House authorising its payment.  In fact, in the statement concerning Ireland's commitments under the Ultimate Financial Settlement made by the Minister for Finance in this House no reference to this payment was made.  We are entitled to ask why not?  If this House agreed to pass this sum, they are giving away the money of the Irish people.  They are giving it away without any authority or without any necessity.  Even if the Saorstát is responsible for a portion of the public debt of the old United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland the entire amount of this sum should <Col N="239" /> not be paid.  I would remind you again that the money was not advanced by Great Britain.  It was not secured by the Governmental Department concerned out of moneys provided by Great Britain.  It was not repayable to Great Britain.  It was repayable to the common fund of the two countries. As I said, our liability in respect to that public debt of which this is part was stated to have been repealed or to have been wiped out by the Boundary Settlement.  Therefore we owe none of this money, and therefore I say that the Dáil should not pass this Vote, and should not compel the Irish people to pay money which they are not legally bound to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with two or three points.  As to this payment having been illegal in any year prior to this, the only answer is a definite denial.  No payment is illegal that is made under the authority of this House.  These payments were brought forward year after year in the Estimates and were taken up in the Appropriation Act, and were sanctioned by this House.  There is no case whatever for saying that these payments were illegal.  It is a misuse of language, or else it indicates a misunderstanding of the position.  As to these payments being part of the public debt which is referred to in Article 5, they are not.  The public debt there is what is known as the dead-weight debt, the debt against which there were no specific assets.  If that interpretation were to hold, it would cover such things as the Telephone Capital Account and moneys expended in this country, raised in particular ways, and the assets left in this country.  Similarly, we would have to consider the Public Buildings Sites Act and moneys expended under it. We would have to consider where there were definite buildings here into which we came for the purposes of use and enjoyment and which we now have. Never by any stretch of imagination could this payment be brought within the ambit of what the Deputy described as a public debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy talked of payments which should have been made to the <Col N="240" /> consolidated Exchequer of the late United Kingdom.  If that is going to be raised, this single item cannot be discussed alone.  This forms one item in a series of items which were before the Government when a bargain had to be made with regard to the distribution of the assets and the distribution of the liabilities of the late United Kingdom. If one is to segregate any item which finally came for settlement, this stands against one item, and that is a claim by the British that this country ought to refund a payment made by them under the Railways Act of £1,085,000. I would prefer not to re-open that matter; I would prefer not to re-open a subject in which there was a claim for £1,085,000 against us, a claim out of which we might get in consideration for a repayment of £27,000.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly it did. There are £5,000,000 over there which the British Government are using. Undoubtedly in the possession of the National Debt Commissioners there was money which came from Ireland.  We must consider that Ireland contributed her due proportion in relation to the advances made in respect of these works.  Therefore the Free State area was entitled to get back that proportion of the amount they advanced.  It is entitled to a proportion&mdash;I cannot say what the proportion is&mdash;of this sum in consequence.  It is obvious we are not claiming that proportion of this, sum to which the State is legitimately entitled.  Therefore we must assume that some asset has been given to the State in exchange, or else we are being defrauded or are unduly generous.  It is said that we have no responsibility <Col N="244" /> for the public debt of Great Britain.  I do not accept the Minister's interpretation of what the public debt of Great Britain is.  It is probably one that is concocted for his own purposes.  It is not the interpretation of the term &ldquo;public debt&rdquo; to be taken from the 1920 Act, for example.  The point I want to make clear is that if we have no responsibility for the public debt of Great Britain, and that if this is part of the public debt, it should not be paid. If it is part of the public debt the whole of it should not be paid beyond there.  We want to see that the Dáil will have fuller information and will know exactly what the bargain was in relation to this particular item, and what reasons the Ministry have to advance to justify the House in passing this sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with sub-head E, when I saw this sub-head on the Estimate I went to the Official Records of previous years to find out what I could about it.  I find that in 1924 the Minister for Industry and Commerce informed the House that it was anticipated that the outstanding claims in this connection would be disposed of in that financial year, and that the provision then made was certainly ample to cover the liability.  In 1925 he informed the House that it was expected that negotiations concerning the acquisition of the lands referred to would be completed in that financial year, and that the sum of £6,800 would be sufficient to discharge the liability. In 1926 he came to the House and stated that it was estimated then that £5,000 would clear the debt, and that it would be disposed of in that financial year.  Again in 1927 he came to the House with the same sub-head, and said that this item next year would disappear from the Estimate.  This year &mdash;1928&mdash;the item is still here, as large as life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite as large, but the sub-head is certainly there.  The negotiations in this connection appear to have been going on for many years, and each year from 1924 the Minister has come solemnly to the House and assured them that that was the last year the sub-head would appear.  This year he started to say that, but corrected himself, and merely said he hoped it would disappear from the Estimates this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible the Minister knows as little about it as I do, and is just repeating the information he is given by the heads of his Department. Perhaps the House can be informed why there has been such extraordinary delay in clearing up the matter of the acquisition of these lands.</P>

      <P>I feel as if I were interfering in a debate on land purchase.  The reason is that certain people cannot prove title, but I have every hope that they will prove title this year and that the item will disappear from the Estimates.  It is to be noticed that we did not expend in any year the moneys voted, that there has been no accumulation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that it <Col N="144" /> is stated that a large number of men from other counties are given employment on the Barrow Drainage Scheme in Athy district in preference to local men, and whether, in view of the large numbers of unemployed in the area, he will give instructions to employ local men where possible.</P>

      <P>The question appears to be based on a misapprehension. The labourers employed on the Barrow Drainage Works generally are all local men, i.e., men who live within a short bicycle ride of their work.  The gangers are designedly not local men, as it is the settled policy of the Commissioners of Public Works not to employ men as gangers in the districts in which they usually reside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Bridget Kilkelly was granted an old age pension of 8s. a week by decision of the Local Government Board dated 3rd January, 1921.</P>
      <P>The rate of pension was reduced by the Pension Officer to 5s. a week on review under the provisions of Section 4 of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1924. The pensioner appealed against this reduction to the Local Pension Committee who upheld the ruling of the Pension Officer.  As the pensioner did not appeal against the Pension Committee's decision it is final and conclusive.</P>
