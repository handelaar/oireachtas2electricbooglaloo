      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that large quantities <Col N="902" /> of Chinese and other foreign brands of bacon are being imported into the Saorstát; that these imports are not branded or marked with the name of the country of origin or production; whether he will have early investigation made regarding these imports; and whether, as these imports into the Saorstát are wholly unnecessary and are, further, a danger to the public health, he will issue an order prohibiting all such imports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The imports of foreign bacon into the Saorstát have declined substantially during the last few years.  There is no information available to me as to what proportions of these imports were Chinese or other foreign bacon.  Under existing legislation it is not obligatory that such imports should be branded or marked with the name of the country of origin or production unless they, in fact, bear a brand suggestive of Irish production or origin.</P>
      <P>I have no power to prevent the importation of bacon from any country, but it is probable that imports will continue to fall as a result of a recent order of the Department of Local Government and Public Health forbidding the importation or sale of foodstuffs containing preservatives.  The question whether legislation should be introduced to require the branding of food and other imports with their country of origin is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. CASSIDY Mr. CASSIDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CASSIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that some considerable time ago the Minister for Agriculture made a statement that he intended to introduce legislation which would make it compulsory on all those people who import foreign bacon to brand on the bacon the name of the country of origin?  As the Minister knows, a good deal of foreign bacon imported into the country is sent down to certain curing factories in Ireland, and after undergoing a certain process of smoking there is sent on to the shopkeepers and retailed in the shops as Irish bacon.  The consumers are under the impression that it is Irish bacon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all a series of statements on which I have no <Col N="903" /> information.  The Minister for Agriculture could not promise, and never promised, to introduce such legislation. It would not be his business to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephHenness" hpid="Mr. HENNESSY Mr. HENNESSY">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 1st instant my Department addressed letters to the secretary of the Cork Employers' Federation and to the secretary of the Cork branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, indicating that the Department was prepared to summon a joint conference with a view to promoting a settlement of this dispute. The replies received indicated that the proposal for a conference was not acceptable to both parties.  I understand that some local conference was held recently to discuss the matter, but that a settlement of the dispute did not result.  Both parties are aware that the services of my Department are still at their disposal.</P>

      <P>Is it not possible for the Minister for Agriculture to make some arrangement with Messrs.

People in my constituency are hard hit as a result of the barley market being more or less restricted; their barley is at present being sold at very unremunerative prices.</P>

      <P>The prescribed schedules and maps have been lodged by the owners for the tenanted portion of the Stewart-Bam estate, which comprises over 500 holdings, and it is expected that at an early date the preliminary checking in the office will be completed and the lands will then be surveyed preparatory to the gazetting of the provisional list of the lands to be vested under the Land Act, 1923.  An offer has been made to the owner for the purchase of Ards demesne and other untenanted lands on the estate, and the negotiations are at an advanced stage, but are not yet completed.</P>
      <P>As regards the Adair estate, portion of the tenanted lands had to be resurveyed and a substituted provisional list was gazetted on the 28th ultimo of the tenanted lands to be vested.

      <NameTxt>Mr. CASSIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that for the tidal electoral area of the Ballyshannon district not even one nominee of the fishermen was elected; furthermore, that there are serious allegations made that no proper notice was given in regard to the election; that licences were taken out by certain people who voted on the 30th September, which is in the close season; that it is alleged the election took place before the hour at which it was advertised; that people took licences in order to defeat the legitimate fishermen, and that people voted who never knew anything about fishing and who never fished in their lives?  Should not the Minister's Department, which should be concerned in the matter, in the interests of the fishermen, have a sworn inquiry into the question and, if it be proved after investigation that there were irregularities, order that a new election take place?  The Minister says that he has no power to order an inquiry, but I think it is the duty of his Department, seeing that it should be interested in the fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one of the difficulties we have in discussing estimates is that all the attack, if I might put it that way, is made first, and then the Minister speaks and closes the discussion. Very often in the material given in the Minister's reply matter for a really valuable discussion arises.  Under the existing procedure we are limited apparently to a sort of cross-fire of short questions at the end.  I suggest that the Minister who is responsible for the Department should answer the whole of the criticisms in general, and then would come the time at which fruitful discussion might take place. In Committee, I understand, Deputies are entitled to speak more than once. I suggest that what has been customarily <Col N="911" /> regarded as the closing speech of the Minister should not in future be regarded in any sense as a closing speech, but merely as a preliminary contribution to the debate.  In other words, I am asking that at the end of the Minister's statement we should have very much more latitude to discuss matters than we now have.  It might tend to shorten the preliminary discussion.  We could put, in the form of very short speeches, questions which we want answered, and then deal with the satisfactory nature or otherwise of the answers which we have received.</P>

      <P>In this particular instance a great many speeches have been made on education, and all the Chair has to go upon is the opinions expressed to it by Deputies who seem to be particularly interested in this Vote on behalf of their own Parties.  Yesterday they appeared to be satisfied that the Minister should conclude.  Of course there is no Standing Order by which the debate would be closed when the Minister has concluded; it is really a matter of an understanding.  If, as the Deputy suggests, a discussion were first allowed on Estimates, then the Minister were to reply and the discussion were then resumed, that would be a rather lengthy process.  However, the Minister for Education is concluding now on Vote 45 and after that we will see what happens.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of cutting out Deputy Good, least of all on technical education.  I suggest that, if a number of long speeches having been made, the discussion is only to begin when the Minister sums up, we are in for a week's debate on each Estimate. There is not on my part the slightest desire to stand between Deputy Good and any statement he desires to make on technical education.  I think we were discussing last night the allegation that education is not as satisfactory as it was thirty years ago.  If it is any comfort, it is well to remember that it never was.  Certainly any person who has reached middle age knows that it never was as satisfactory as it was thirty years previously &mdash;at any period.  I am not claiming that any one of our particular branches of education is perfectly satisfactory&mdash;far from it.  There is a great deal of advance still to be made. I think it is the business of everybody interested in education&mdash;teachers and others&mdash;to make every effort not to stay where we are, or to hold what we have, but to advance.  I do not suggest that in any particular branch the system of education which we have in this country is as satisfactory as that in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I do deprecate, however, is the all-too-easy statement, based so far as I know on the most slender evidence, that any particular branch of education&mdash;the statement, for instance, made by Deputy J.J. Byrne about primary education and that by Deputy O'Connell about post-primary education&mdash;in this country, primary education, for instance, is altogether behind the times and compares badly with education across the Channel.  If anyone has studied the problems which they have to face across the Channel he would be convinced that that is not so.  They are not satisfied&mdash;at least they were not up to recently&mdash;that there is a satisfactory education given over there in the primary schools after the age of eleven and a half or twelve years.  So much were they dissatisfied on that <Col N="913" /> point that they are now making an attempt, the success of which we cannot judge, to remodel their whole system.  In so far as that particular problem is concerned, we are in a somewhat better position, because in our primary system we have subjects such as a particular kind of mathematics, and also a second language which differentiates it from that on the other side of the water.  They complain that after the age of twelve there is nothing for a pupil to do up to the age of fourteen except repetition work, whereas I do not think that that holds in the case of our programme.</P>
    <P>I admit that there may have been a decline in the actual results turned out from the primary schools following the abolition of the results system.  I am not saying that because I believe that the results system should not have been abolished or because I think it should be restored.  I ask you to look at the situation and remember in dealing with education you more often have in mind the results of a quarter of a century following the abolition of the results system than you have in mind more recent results.  I am not advocating the restoration of the results system, but you had a sudden plunge from complete regimentation to an entirely different system.  With that sudden change it was conceivable that there might be a falling-off during those years, but again that is a matter that is hard to judge.  It would be no justification for the suggestion sometimes made to restore the results system. There may have been criticism at the time to the effect that the change was imposed too hurriedly and that it should be gradually brought about, but the idea of returning to the system now has generally been abandoned, because it is condemned by practically most of the countries of which are in advance on educational matters.  For that return I see no justification, even in the remarks I have made.</P>
    <P>When I spoke against the danger of exaggeration, I did so not because I could give an affirmative answer to Deputy J.J. Byrne that I was completely satisfied&mdash;that would be absurd &mdash;but really to act as a corrective and not by any means to act as an inducement <Col N="914" /> for anyone interested in education to rest on his oars.  The reason I felt it necessary to deal with it was because I also felt, no matter how exaggerated the language of Deputy Byrne was, that he was voicing an opinion which had been voiced here before and which we hear expressed in different parts of the country.  A great deal remains to be done.  There is a very important trust undoubtedly imposed by the nation on the teachers and, taking them as a whole, I feel perfectly convinced that they will be able to justify that trust.  Remember that it is in doing their utmost for the nation that that very justification exists.</P>
    <P>Now, let me examine the criticism that we are not getting value for the money spent on primary education. What is the suggestion?  We are spending four and a half millions, roughly speaking, on education as a whole, apart from the universities.  Is the suggestion that four and a half millions could be better spent in other spheres than in education?  As I pointed out already, nobody can suggest that four and a half millions is an exorbitant amount to ask for education. Perhaps the suggestion is that it should be better distributed between the different branches of education than that we should, for instance, give three and a half million to primary education, seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds to secondary education, one hundred and fifty thousand pounds to technical education, one hundred and twenty thousand pounds to reformatories and industrial schools, and so on.  As against that&mdash;if that was in the Deputy's mind&mdash;I would recall to his attention his own quotation from a very celebrated writer on pedagogy in which the extreme importance of primary education is pointed out. There would not, I think, be justification for criticism along that particular line.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made&mdash;I do not think it was made by Deputy Fahy though he was reported in the newspapers in that way&mdash;that we are not getting value for the money we are spending on primary education.  Remember that the great bulk of that money goes in one particular form of <Col N="915" /> expenditure and, in fairness to the people criticised, it is well to bear in mind that for many years that particular body and those who are doing this particular type of work had to be content with miserable salaries, and that the bulk of the present body of teachers was recruited under these circumstances.  People come to me sometimes and say, &ldquo;Compare the teachers' salaries now,&rdquo;&mdash;the allegation sometimes being that they are the best paid people in the country, an allegation with which I do not agree&mdash;&ldquo;with what they were pre-war or thirty years ago.  We see no sudden change in education.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a criticism that everybody has heard.  I ask the House to examine it for a moment.  Is there any justification for it.  Is it reasonable to think that if you introduce a proper scale of salaries you will have a change in the whole teaching profession in a couple of years.  If it is to work in the direction of getting better material, it can only do so gradually, and I think it is doing so gradually.  Remember when I speak about getting better material, I realise that under the old unsatisfactory conditions the bulk of the teachers of this country were doing their work under very depressing circumstances very often.  They were doing it splendidly on the whole, but I must say, with the different preparations we are making to take up the future teacher at a lower age, to begin his training at a lower age, I do look forward to a better trained type of teacher and a more efficient type in the future.  That is to be expected, because more trouble, time, and money are now being spent on them.  I think that we are taking steps through our preparatory colleges, through the pupil teacherships that are now in existence, and I hope also through certain reforms or certain advances that we are making in the type of instruction to be given in the training colleges to have a remarkably good body of primary teachers.  As I say, I find it has been extremely difficult to attach a precise value to comparisons between the educational system in this country and the educational systems in other countries. I have myself looked into several of <Col N="916" /> these systems and I questioned very closely the educational authorities, in one country especially, and I found that they have to face and are trying to solve the very same difficulties in many respects that we have to solve here.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the various demands that are made on me, and, through me, on the Government and on the Minister for Finance, to undertake new obligations and new expenditure. We are already involved in increased expenditure on educational matters owing to the operation of the Compulsory Attendance Act.  We have had to allow more for that in our Estimates for the present year, and we find that as a result of the operation of the Act our Estimates in that respect have been below the mark. Our estimate in that respect has been exceeded.  Surely, therefore, we may look upon it as certain&mdash;remember, this is a thing that will accumulate for five or six or seven years; this Compulsory Attendance Act will be felt in the case of children from the age of six to fourteen&mdash;that the numbers attending schools will increase, and that this type of expense must also increase. That is one type of expenditure for which money must be found in the future.  Then the Government is also committed to premiums for a certain type of teachers&mdash;teachers in the Gaeltacht.  That will in itself amount to a considerable sum.</P>
    <P>Then, there are pensions asked for about eight or nine different classes.  It may be said that for each one there is only a small amount involved, but if you take the demands that are being made in this House, and occasionally outside the House too, I should say that a million a year would not cover them. I doubt very much if it would.  It is exceedingly difficult to form an exact estimate.  We have been asked for pensions for lay teachers in convent schools.  Deputy O'Connell suggested yesterday that that surely does not await the result of the actuarial investigation. So far as that is concerned, I may say that the actuarial investigation is practically complete, and I may say that the general result of that investigation is that the fund is certainly in a very serious condition, that it is <Col N="917" /> not solvent&mdash;very far from solvent.  In that situation, without further examination to suggest that partly out of that fund a pension may be paid to a further class of people, without any investigations as to how that fund is to meet these charges, is a very serious proposition.  The Deputy suggests that I was not serious in saying that there was a connection between the two.  I think he is not altogether serious in saying that there is no connection, as he seemed to suggest yesterday.  I suggest that he is also doing what is quite frequent, namely, that when he is putting forward a proposition which he gravely doubts will be accepted, he makes an assumption and says: &ldquo;Surely this will not be contradicted.&rdquo;  If pensions are to be paid to these particular bodies, and if these are to be charged on a particular fund, I suggest that it is a matter of grave concern whether that fund is already solvent and able to meet the charges that are already on it.  The secondary teachers will be dealt with, but that involves additional expenditure even from the point of view of the State.</P>
    <P>Pensions have also been asked for industrial school teachers.  A number of statements have been made to the effect that I said&mdash;I think this was circulated to all Deputies&mdash;this particular type of teacher was excluded from the Bill that is now passing through.  I do not see how that statement could be made.  I am not promising that a scheme of pensions for them will be drawn up, but there is no foundation for the suggestion&mdash;I cannot remember having made it.  I do not say that I did not, because I have a strong objection to reading my own speeches&mdash;or no truth in the suggestion that they are deliberately excluded from that particular Bill.  They are not, but I would ask people to consider the position of these schools, especially industrial schools, because they are more numerous than reformatories.  We have only one reformatory now.  If you look at the Children's Act, under which these industrial schools operate, I think it will be quite clear that the primary burden of these schools is put on the local authority.  It is also true that in these industrial schools you have practically as many pupils as there are in <Col N="918" /> the whole of the industrial schools of England.  I do not mean in proportion; the actual numbers are almost the same.  It is also true that the great bulk of the pupils in these industrial schools are there, whatever the form of charge may be, because their parents for one reason or another want them there, or because they would not be able to support them.</P>
    <P>In fact, a great deal of that charge is essentially a poor rate charge when you come to think of it.  It is a charge that ought normally to be borne by the local body.  We give a certain contribution to the industrial schools, and I will say this for it, that it is sufficient, and more than sufficient, to meet the educational charges which reasonably might also be borne by the local authorities.  We have increased what we give, so that actually we are giving more for each person from the age of six onwards.  We give more in every case than the local authority, and there are a few local authorities who have refused altogether to subscribe. Therefore, the thing is not quite as simple as Deputies think.  It is primarily not, I suggest, a question for the central authority, this proper financing of the industrial schools, but for the local authorities who have been relieved in this way of a burden that would otherwise fall upon them.</P>
    <P>It will be possible under the new Bill to deal with the question of national teachers who become inspectors; at least, it will be possible under that to draw up a scheme.  Certain rules can be made about those who become inspectors. As to the teachers in training colleges, I hope when we get in touch with the training collegs, which are essentially private institutions, that the training colleges may be induced to do something in that respect as regards pensions.  There have also been suggestions made by Deputies&mdash; suggestions I have heard outside the House&mdash;that the pensions for technical teachers under the Local Government Act should be partially or wholly transferred from the local to the central body.  Most people are modest enough to start off with the suggestion that the transfer should be partial. That in itself would raise the whole question of the incidence, that I will <Col N="919" /> have to refer to again, of the charge for education.  I have referred to it repeatedly, but I think it is necessary to emphasise it on every occasion, because it is apparently easily dropped from view.  I know no country&mdash;certainly it is not amongst the most advanced countries in Europe that you will find a country in which there is anything like the same proportion of the educational burden borne by the central authority as is borne in this country. We bear practically the whole burden, with a very slight exception which I will return to afterwards, of primary education.  I ask Deputies to find any other country in Europe where anything like it occurs; not merely across the channel.  Take Denmark, France or Germany.  Take the biggest State in Germany, Prussia&mdash;there are different systems in different States&mdash;but there practically the whole charge of education is a local charge.  The State interferes and very successfully, but not in the way of contributing very much to the upkeep and maintenance of education.  Here is the one charge in educational matters which the local councils are asked to bear, that is technical education.  Even in that matter of technical education the State bears altogether an undue proportion of the charge.  The advances in recent years in the expenditure on technical education have come out of the Exchequer not from the local bodies, and the suggestion is made that because the State bears so much of that charge, therefore it should bear practically two-thirds of the pensions.  If the question is raised that pensions for that particular class should be borne by the State, it inevitably raises the question that must be raised anyway, namely, the comparative charges to be borne by the central authority and the local authorities for continuation and technical education.  Undoubtedly also the State may have to face, as a result of the Technical Commission's Report, as a result of the necessity rather of dealing with the present position of continuation and technical education, a demand for money in that respect. How far it will be able to meet it in the next couple of years is another matter, but the problem must be faced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> It is an educational charge that the country will have to face as soon as it is able to face it, and to the extent that it is able to face it.  However, I will return to that matter of continuation education later.</P>
    <P>We have been asked not merely to give pensions to teachers in industrial schools, but also asked for increased grants for the running of the schools themselves.  It has been rightly pointed out that were it not that a number of religious orders were running these institutions they would cost very much more.  But again, because money is required for running certain institutions, why is it immediately assumed that it is the State that is to foot the Bill? Why is there never a suggestion that the local authorities ought to face their obligations in that respect?  Is not the reason, as I already indicated on a previous occasion, that when you demand money from a local authority, and the local authority has to meet it, and not merely get it from the Government, there is a very keen sense of the connection, even on the part of people demanding the money, between the expense on the one hand and the necessity of finding the money on the other. I suggest that the experience of most Deputies will bear me out that there is not the same realisation when it comes to demanding money from the central authority.</P>

      <P>An excellent reason, perhaps, for changing the whole system of government&mdash;local government especially.  That is involved in it.  A demand has also been made&mdash;I have received deputations on the matter&mdash;that we should give a capitation grant for preparatory branches of secondary schools.  Secondary school heads have come along and said to me: &ldquo;You give us a capitation grant for people between certain ages but these are only a portion of the people we teach; we would be much better off if we got, and we think we deserve that we should get, a capitation grant also for those up to the age of twelve.&rdquo;  Demands were also made during the debate for an <Col N="921" /> extended system of scholarships.  The matter was raised by Deputy Mullins and by Deputy Fahy and then there was last night's speech by Deputy O'Connell.  Deputy O'Connell referred to a statement, I think, of my predecessor, on that particular matter.  I wonder was it made before the Local Government Act came into operation. It is quite possible.  The answer is quite correct so far as scholarships from secondary schools to universities are concerned.  These cannot be enjoyed in the training colleges, they can only be enjoyed in the universities or a recognised university college.  But there is another type of scholarship&mdash; a much more numerous one&mdash;I think there are anything up to 800 scholarships under the other system.  These are the provisions of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act. 1923: County Councils are empowered by Section 17 (1) of that Act, as continued, to provide from the rates scholarships or bursaries for students in an approved school; and sub-section (2) of the same section states that an approved school shall be a school for the giving of secondary education or the giving of training in agriculture, forestry, trade, commerce, domestic economy teaching, or any other subject of a vocational character as may be approved by order of the Minister for Education.  Not only are these scholarships not confined by the Act or by my Department to secondary schools but certain councils have proposed and exercise the right to give these scholarships to technical schools. There are at least two councils that do that.  Whether more do it or not, rests with the councils and there certainly will be no obstacle put in their way as far as I am concerned.</P>

If the county councils want to make them available for technical schools, they can do so. If there is difficulty about the regulations, I am prepared to look into the matter.</P>

      <P>We are providing, as far as secondary education is concerned, for the teaching profession, and allowing them to go afterwards for training.  And, remember, so far as training is concerned, the great bulk of the expenditure is borne by the State.  But I shall refer to that subsequently.  Now we are asked also to provide better facilities for training. I shall deal with that subsequently. We are asked, especially, to provide&mdash; and this is where a considerable amount of money might or might not be involved&mdash;the full university course for teachers.  However, I shall postpone that until I am dealing with the question of training.  We are asked to speed up the building programme and suggestions were made that the voluntary system should go.  I promised to deal with that; it is such an important subject, striking at the root as I believe of the whole system of education, that I shall have to deal with it separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various other demands&mdash; equipment, school books for all, or school books for the poor.  As to what precisely would be the difference in cost between providing school books for all and only for a certain portion, it is extremely difficult to estimate.  I am told that in some schools here in the city, where there is a committee or body giving meals, over 75 per <Col N="923" /> cent. of the children get meals. Whether you can say these are all necessitous cases or not, I do not know, but I can easily see that if you introduce the custom of giving books by the State or providing meals by the State, it will be exceedingly difficult to draw the line.  So far as meals are concerned in the country, I say it would be practically impossible to draw the line.  A provision therefore for meals at school would practically mean a demand that meals should be found for all.  The cost of that would be half a million.  Playing fields were also demanded.  That also would be extremely costly, however desirable. I doubt, even if the State were able to afford them, it would be desirable that the State should do all these things. But that is a different question.  Two Deputies spoke on the question of school meals.  They were careful to suggest that they did not contend that the State should meet that obligation. Deputy Thrift made it clear that he had doubts even whether a public authority was the proper body to deal with the question of meals for school children.  I think I am not misinterpreting him there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tierney also raised a question, even if the State could afford it, whether it should not be a local charge.  If it is to be by a public authority, it would seem from its nature to be properly a local charge.  It is precisely in line with the other matter I dealt with, namely industrial schools, in so far as being primarily a question for those who look after the poor rate if urged on necessitous grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these reforms may be desirable but I doubt whether it is a proper conception of education or of the State to urge that the State should even aim at satisfying all these demands.  I am dealing with all these matters just to convince Deputies, by the mere enumeration of the demands, of the magnitude of the task that they are asking the Ministry and the Government to undertake.  There are a great many implications in the demand that the State ought to undertake these matters. <Col N="924" /> I wonder whether Deputies are conscious of some of the implications involved in that particular demand.  Some are quite conscious of it but whether all are conscious of it is another matter.  As to many of these demands, there is this to be said about them. They may be excellent and splendid from the point of view of human feeling, from the point of view of the care of the poor and so on, but I suggest that some of them are hardly strictly educational.  If I were given a million of money per year, and asked to make the best educational use of it, I doubt if the particular items of expenditure mentioned in this list would be the ones that would first need to be attacked. If you are merely looking at it from a purely educational and technical point of view, merely with a view of getting good results educationally, I doubt that money would be best expended even if available upon the lines as suggested.  However, what I am really anxious about is that Deputies should realise the magnitude and extent of the demands they are making in both cases.</P>
    <P>I have had again and again here appeals made that we should cut our coat according to our cloth. An excellent demand, good advice, but it should be followed from all quarters of the House as well as given to those who occupy these benches.  Either one thing or another. If these demands are to be made it means further taxation or economies. There is a continual demand made here, as every Deputy knows, for increased expenditure, and I suggest the few places where it was suggested considerable economies could be made are already mortgaged, over mortgaged and triply mortgaged.  I doubt if they can stand any further charges for education, nor are there any economies possible on the Education Vote itself. Personally, I must say that I cannot see where economies can reasonably, and in the long run with good effect, be made to meet these new charges that we are now asked to meet.  Perhaps those who believe in the value of an educational council might suggest that I could refer that to them, tell them there are four and a half millions and ask them what is the best way of spending <Col N="925" /> it.  I doubt if it would be very much help to me and certainly it would not relieve me or my successor of any responsibility for spending every penny of the money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahy made a suggestion yesterday as to how certain economies could be effected.  I think it was in connection with the suggestion that he happened to be not quite correctly reported in the English translation of his speech in to-day's papers.  If he said anything at all he suggested that there were a certain number of years in the school in which we were not getting value for the money spent.  Am I correct?</P>

      <P>I said judging by an answer given by the Minister to me some time ago with reference to the number of children under six years attending schools that the annual cost would be proportionately £300,000.  I said at a modest estimate perhaps it would be £200,000 taking that in definite children's schools or kindergarten schools good work was done.  One hundred and fifty thousand pounds of that would be money for which we are not getting a return and if the age limit were fixed so that children under six years were not on the roll there may be a gradual saving of £150,000 which could be put into school buildings.</P>

      <P>Not precisely for the same reason as Deputy O'Connell says &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;  There may be different approaches to that particular question.  I know Deputy O'Connell will say precisely the view I am giving out is what is in his mind, but there may be another objection <Col N="926" /> which Deputy O'Connell may have.  Is the suggestion roughly this: We should prohibit&mdash;because that is what it comes to&mdash;children attending national schools under the age of six?</P>

      <P>Therefore, practically it comes to this, that in most cases we will have really to exclude them from attendance.  This is what I said to the Deputy, and I will say in a moment why I specially singled him out, not merely because he made the remark, but I am more surprised that it came from him than from some of the other Deputies.  If that proposition came to me from some of the speakers in yesterday's debate in Private Members' time I should not be surprised, but we hold, rightly or wrongly, that the best time&mdash;I will not say for learning&mdash;for absorbing a language is between the years of four and eight.  If we are serious with that particular part of our programme I do not know a harder blow we could give to the language than that suggested by Deputy Fahy.  I think if he thinks it over from that particular point of view he will not persist with the proposal that we can at least save there so as to put it into buildings.  These are the best years&mdash;I do not say for teaching a child, because that is a different thing; teaching is, perhaps, too definite a word&mdash;but they are the best years to get children to school to absorb one, two or three languages, which can be done quite easily during these formative years from four to eight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third big question that was raised, and it is I think in a way the most serious of the lot, was the statement that the voluntary system as we know it in this country has broken down, and I presume the charge is that it has permanently broken down.  That ought to be the meaning of many demands <Col N="927" /> made here.  It certainly was the meaning of Deputy O'Connell's speech yesterday.  He made use of my figures and drew conclusions from them which I do not think were altogether quite justified.  I pointed out there were 350 new schools.  In the speech Deputy Fahy made he misunderstood me in this respect.  The new schools are not new in the ordinary sense of new schools. They are very often old schools which have been replaced.  He misunderstood me in that respect.  I thought Deputy O'Connell implied as a result of my figures that one-third of the schools were unfit.  I do not think he said that but the unwary might gather that out of his speech.  In that number there were included 900 schools, that is more than half that, nine hundred schools that required merely minor alterations. To suggest that because they required minor alterations that therefore they are condemned as schools, is I suggest to the Deputy in another way imitating his antagonist, Deputy Byrne, in another matter.</P>

      <P>I want to get it quite clear.  There is no suggestion that one-third of the schools are unfit or anything like it.  About 300 would require to be replaced, others to be enlarged.  That is a different matter again.  Remember lumping that together and making an assumption of one-third out of that would be quite misleading.  I am quite sure that the Deputy did not mean to mislead anybody. One thing I specially regretted in his speech and that was his &ldquo;scoff&rdquo; at the Board of Works.  He suggested that I was not dealing with this serious problem in a serious way.  I suggest that to scoff at the Board of Works is not a very serious manner of dealing with this particular problem. He suggests practically that the Board of Works should take over the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no avoidable delay, certainly no undue delay so far as that Department is concerned.  Anybody connected with buildings, even connected <Col N="928" /> with the building, for instance, of Civic Guard barracks, will know the extreme difficulty of hastening matters where buildings are concerned.  The question of sites has to be considered. In Donegal, at the present moment, we find it extremely difficult to get a site with a clear title for a school.  There are all sorts of other delays that frequently occur.  The Deputy may be aware of them.  There is the question of the rights of existing teachers.</P>

    <P>and the present year £100,000.  That is a half-million since we came in.  It is not altogether as the Deputy seemed to suggest yesterday that we are trifling with the subject.  We may desire to advance more quickly.  I admit there are schools in a bad state of sanitation, but exaggeration has also taken place.  I am not saying that there was exaggeration in the extracts read by the Deputy.  For instance, in one case the principal reason why the doctor condemned a school in the Clare area was because of the height of the wall between the boys' and the girls' closets.  He objected on the grounds of decency.  I am not at all denying that there are certain cases that are bad, but whenever we hear of these we immediately get into touch with the manager and the right steps are taken.  Very often it is not the arrangements that are bad.  In the few cases mentioned by Deputy Fahy the arrangements were bad, but where <Col N="929" /> things are bad we bring them to the notice of the manager, and they are remedied very often.  In most of the cases referred to remedies have already been effected, but a number of these cases are for the Public Health Authorities and they should be brought to their notice.</P>
    <P>However, all that is leading up to a much more fundamental question.  I would ask not merely the House but the country to consider seriously whether they want to embark on an entirely new policy as regards education in this country.  Deputy O'Connell may say that he is asking nothing of the kind.  I am afraid he is.  It is there we differ.  We have heard of what is known as the voluntary system. It is a system that has drawbacks, but it has worked remarkably well.  It is a system, as I pointed out, in my real opening, not my concluding opening speech, that has enabled us to avoid some of what, I think, the futile, sterile, and from the educational point of view, devastating conflicts that have occurred in other countries.  We are asked to believe that that system has broken down.  The system is, as the Deputy explained yesterday, that the State is willing to contribute a certain amount to the building of the school and a certain amount also to the heating and cleaning of schools.  In fact, as many people interested in this particular system of education in this country confessed to me, the State makes a very generous offer.  It is a thing that has been found exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, in most other countries.  It is an effort to solve what are often rightly or wrongly described as the conflicting claims of the Church and the State in education.  As a result of that system, we have avoided a great deal of controversy.  I feel, speaking for myself, that it would be a disaster not merely from a higher point of view than mere secular education, but a disaster even from the purely secular point of view, if we lightly made up our minds to abandon that system or knock down the outworks of what some people might consider the centre of that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all inclined to slur over that question. I have already hinted the lines I intended to follow, so far as my own personal belief is concerned, and it is a belief that is shared by many of the highest authorities in the Church in this country.  I speak of the Catholic Church, because they are the big bulk of the country, and they are the people principally interested in this question. It is that interest that is particularly affected.  I think they share certain fears that I have.  From the parenthesis that I interjected the Deputy will understand the line I am taking. I said that if that system is attacked, even on the outworks, I fear that what some people consider the centre of that system may not be so easily maintained, or that there will be difficulty in time of crisis in maintaining it.  I do not believe either that the system has permanently broken down, and I certainly do not believe, after mature consideration such as I have been able to give, that the central position will remain unscathed if the outworks are taken.  A few years ago, I might have been more ready to suggest that the outworks were not important.  The more I consider the matter, however, the more I am convinced that what I say now is the truth.  Even if there is a certain number of managers that find it difficult, even if there are a few managers that are unwilling to make the necessary effort&mdash;some managers find it difficult to find the necessary capital or money&mdash;a few possibly are unwilling and unable to make the necessary effort, I still hold that the country should require a great deal more evidence than is available at present before it abandons the system that is now in operation.  I am quite aware that a number of managers themselves would like to be relieved of this burden.  I am not denying it.  Deputy O'Connell, I think, quoted a resolution from the Managers' Association.  If he looked <Col N="931" /> at their later resolutions in that respect he would find that he would not be quite safe in suggesting that the Managers' Association are still of the same mind.  At a meeting held in the summer of this year in Dublin of the Managers' Association of Leinster, one of the resolutions they adopted was: &ldquo;That we request the meeting (that is, the general meeting of managers) of the Central Council to rescind the resolution passed by them last year in favour of the principle that the Government should assume responsibility for all the expenses connected with the building, repairs and maintenance of National Schools.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am telling the Deputy that they adopted a different resolution, in which they did not suggest that the burden should be borne altogether by the State, and not only that, but I would remind the Deputy of this, that when we are dealing with this matter, involving such a vital issue and one that is fraught with such consequences to the country, I would like, even from that point of view, a more authoritative statement even than that which could come from the managers.  I think if there is a suggestion of that kind it should come from even a greater authority than the managers.  My own view is this&mdash;and it is a view, I know, shared by a good many people who have this matter at heart&mdash;that if certain rights are enjoyed by any class, that is because there are certain obligations.  The Church claims&mdash;and, as I have always said, what I claim for my own Church I am quite willing to admit to other Churches&mdash;that it has the duty and the right to educate.  I put it, even to those who at present find it difficult to make the necessary effort to supply the local <Col N="932" /> contributions, that it will be very difficult for them&mdash;if the only thing that remains to them is the appointment of the teacher&mdash;if a crisis comes, to retain that particular right.  I hope the crisis will not come, but the two things are much more closely connected&mdash;human nature being what it is&mdash;than is sometimes suggested.  I do not say that the consequences would follow immediately or directly, but certainly I do fear that these consequences would follow.  In other places I see great efforts made by the clergy to deal with this question, and I think the clergy of this country will also be willing, if they think there is danger ahead, to make the effort.  I think the working compromise come to here as to the control of education might be in danger of being successfully attacked in the future if what some people call the trappings, the unpleasant duty of providing schools and looking after the minutes, is lightly given up.  I think if there is a change in that matter as is indicated in this resolution, it is because that particular line of thought has also suggested itself to other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Maguire, I think, suggested that the State should not demand one-third in necessitous areas.  Of course it does not.  Our practice is within certain limits to remit a portion, or even all of the one-third.  That is the exception, and the suggestion that seemed to be made by Deputy O'Connell yesterday was that because we do so in exceptional cases therefore we could scrap the whole system, that it would endanger no principle.  That is a conclusion I am unable to follow or accept. There are rights and duties of different people, rights of the parents, duties of parents, not merely as tax-payers but apart from that.  I remember that a question was asked in connection with the committal to an industrial school by a district justice, and it seemed to be implied that that was interference with the rights of parents.  That is a matter we will have an opportunity of discussing soon again in connection with the Bill now before this House from the Seanad.  I give that as an illustration to show that there are a number of people convinced that parents have rights and duties that <Col N="933" /> should not be lightly interfered with by the State, but a great deal of the demands made here are a light treatment of the obligations and duties of parents and other people.  The problem is by no means a simple one.  Apart from the financial considerations which must be taken into account the question of revenue must be taken into account as well.  Let me again insist on, what I have on more than one occasion insisted, the incidence of the charge for education.  Here is a small parish, or portion of a parish, asked to subscribe its special contribution, only a very small portion of the whole charge, for that particular school.  All the rest, the provision of the teachers, the provision of most of the charge for the building is found by the State as a whole, and the only extra effort required from those who will enjoy the school is this one-third, for the building of the school and a contribution for maintenance, lighting and heating.  I was asked about the report of the Technical Commission, but perhaps I should wait until Deputy Good has spoken before making any remark about that.  I think that might develop, and I would then be in a position to deal with the matter in my concluding reply.</P>

      <P>A number of other questions have been raised.  I have dealt with the question of scholarships. Deputy Thrift asked a question about the working of the Compulsory Education Act in the cities.  It is hard to get material to answer that question fully.  I can give figures for the City of Dublin, and, as I am on that, I will deal with the more general question raised yesterday by Deputy O'Connell. So far as the action of the District Justices is concerned, I do not know whether the complaints raised by the Deputy are well founded or not, and he will realise that neither I have nor has the Minister for Justice, or Executive Council, the slightest authority to interfere; that it would be absolutely unconstitutional and wrong to interfere in the slightest with the administration of justice.  It may be said that there was a bit of slackness there, but it would be absolutely out of the question for us to interfere.  I think the <Col N="934" /> Deputy will see that, and I think he saw it yesterday.  I have no figures at my command to check the statement made by the Deputy as to the alleged falling off in attendance.  Our figures, so far as we have them to date, are for a period before the six months referred to by the Deputy.  The charges in our Department, however, are going up so far as primary education is concerned. It is extremely hard to check the figures.  I had a similar complaint so far as the City of Dublin is concerned, and I think it was these complaints that induced Deputy Thrift to ask this question. I can give him the actual figures so far as Dublin is concerned.  The House will easily understand that it would be impossible for me to obtain similar figures so far as the country as a whole is concerned.  The average percentage attendance to the average number on the rolls of pupils from the ages of six to fourteen for the year ended 14th June, 1928, was:&mdash; Dublin City, 90.8 per cent.; Blackrock Urban, 84.2 per cent.; Dun Laoghaire,, 84.9 per cent.; Pembroke, 87.9 per cent.; Rathmines and Rathgar, 86.5 per cent., with an average for the whole of the Dublin area of 90 per cent.  That does not suggest that the complaints, at least in the exaggerated form they were made, were justified, I am not in a position to give the percentages before this Act was passed, because those figures related, not to children between the ages of six and fourteen, but to all school-going children that were on the rolls, children of from three and four up to fifteen.  But the 1926 average in the City of Dublin was 84, and in 1927 85.4.  In the County Dublin area that I have mentioned, the figures were 81.1 and 82.4.  I do not want the Deputy to attach any remarkable importance to that comparison.  I have carefully limited it because, as I say, these last figures not only deal with what I might call the compulsory pupils but all pupils between three and fourteen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions were raised separately, and I think I have dealt with most of them in dealing with the general questions that have been raised.  I tried to bring them in as illustrations of what I was saying.  Deputy Fahy, in his opening speech, <Col N="935" /> stated that it was not right that teachers unable to teach Irish should be asked to teach it.  I fully agree that it is not right, and so far as the Department is concerned they do nothing to encourage it.  But remember again, if there are complaints in that respect the Minister cannot deal with them unless he hears them, and definite complaints ought to be made if officials of the Department go beyond their instructions in that particular matter.  But unless things are brought before us, it is not possible for us to deal with them.  It was suggested that I should take up propaganda for Irish manufactures, in fact I have been very strongly urged to circulate to teachers a certain pamphlet dealing with that matter.  I am quite willing to send teachers a circular asking them to refer to and deal with this matter in certain lessons where they can easily do so.</P>
    <P>A point about the teaching of local history was raised by Deputy O'Reilly, by Deputy Buckley, in reference to Maynooth, by Deputy Mullins, and others.  It is quite true that there are no text-books on the subject, but I suggest that it would not be a bad thing if the teachers busied themselves on the matter.  I quite admit that it is not in their prescribed duties, but certainly it would be excellent earnest of the interest they take in their work if they were able to do work of that type.  I think they are the people who should specially deal with that particular aspect of the matter.  I hope that Deputy O'Connell will be able to persuade the teachers to take it up in large numbers. A certain number of local histories are being prepared, and some have been published, and in the training colleges at present we do train the teachers on those lines and insist on them dealing with these matters. They are encouraged to write essays on local objects of historical and antiquarian interest and local history, the object being that when they go out to the schools they will continue that practice.  We are quite willing and ready to encourage that.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell complained that <Col N="936" /> we have spent a long time drawing up the Report on Training.  We got the officials that we thought most suitable, and they have drawn up the Report. It is complained that they have taken a long time to do so.  I ask the House to remember that these officials, some of them especially in their ordinary work, were, I know well, over-worked &mdash;I know that from my personal experience&mdash;and they were asked to take on this duty in addition to their ordinary work.  I quite admit, for instance, that six months ought to be enough to prepare the rules, as Deputy O'Connell said.  So it would be if the officials had nothing else to do. But continuously problem after problem is coming up, and in the very nature of affairs there cannot be any continuing work on anything of that kind.  If we tried to adopt such a thing, if we tried to speed up the building, it would mean a large increase in our officials.</P>

      <P>On the question of training, Deputy Fahy asked if I believed that in twenty years the existing training colleges would be Gaelicised.  I do not think it will require anything like twenty years.  I read the report on that matter, and the report, which is by people who are well able to judge, says that considerable progress has been made in our colleges.  Some of them were splendid, some not as good as others, but very satisfactory progress has been made in all the colleges.  On the question of training as a whole, we <Col N="937" /> hope, as a result of the efforts we are making to ensure that those entering a training college will have a good foundation of secondary education, that it will be inevitable that we should change the existing curriculum in the training colleges, making it more professional. The other question raised by Deputy O'Connell is not quite so easy of solution.  I hope, in a short time, to be in a position to put proposals in connection with university education before the bodies concerned&mdash;the teachers and the universities.  There may be others.  But remember what I have already had to call attention to&mdash; the extreme necessity at the present time of being very careful about any new expenditure.  And remember this too: Deputy O'Connell spoke of the teaching profession.  Let me remind him that I know of no other profession in which, from the age of fourteen, in the case of many of its members, up to the time they get their profession, so much is done by the State in the way of assistance.  I am not saying that it ought not to be done.  So much do we think that that ought to be so that it is only quite recently that we undertook new obligations in that respect. Apart altogether from the question of providing a good faculty of Irish teachers, I think we have done good work in seeing that the future teacher will have a good foundation of secondary education when he goes to the training college.  It is a question for grave consideration how, without increasing existing expenses for training, and whether a scheme can be evolved to provide what some people, namely, the teachers, wish for, a university course.</P>

    <P>There were a few very minor questions raised.  I think I have dealt with practically all the important questions so far as my Vote is concerned.  I have tried to give what I consider a dispassionate and fair view of the situation as it appears to me.  I cannot pretend &mdash;in fact there would be no use in this Dáil existing if I could pretend&mdash;that I have done everything, or perhaps much, to satisfy a lot of Deputies.  I know if there is a demand involving the expenditure of money it will receive <Col N="938" /> almost unanimous approval from the House.</P>

      <P>There were one or two questions put to him which the Minister did not answer.  I recognise, of course, that he could not get them all, but there was one that I asked and I consider it of some importance.  It deals with the position of Irish in secondary schools.</P>

      <P>That question was put yesterday, and so far as that is concerned we are following out the requirements and suggestions of the programme of the First Dáil. We are making Irish compulsory so far as the Intermediate Certificate examinations are concerned.  The Deputy may want me to go faster, but I would remind him that it is extremely difficult, even for the colleges that want them, to find Irish teachers. Even where they are willing to do it, it is extremely difficult to find teachers of any kind, and especially Irish teachers, at the present time.  I believe the position so far as Irish is concerned is secure.  We have been accused of going too fast or going too slow.  We are going ahead anyway, and we are advancing in the direction suggested; there is no turning back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not yet quite satisfied, because I have two specific questions to put.  One is, is it possible for an intermediate school among the largest schools in this State to get the full intermediate grant without presenting ten per cent. of its students in Irish as a subject for a certificate, whether an intermediate or a leaving certificate; and the second is, are the programmes of such schools subject to inspection?  If so, does the Department insist that Irish be a subject on the ordinary time-table at a suitable hour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The programmes are all submitted to us. The question of the grant will depend not on what happens in one year, but what happens in two or three years. We never do deal with the schools in that way.  If, over a period of two or three years, there is in any programme a decided attempt made to ignore Irish, then we would have to consider <Col N="939" /> the partial or total withdrawal of that particular grant.  That is quite inevitable. There is power under the rules to withdraw the grants by tenths until the total amount is withdrawn.  It is a matter that we have pushed forward strongly, and the Deputy knows we have not been deterred by criticism. We think we are going as fast as circumstances demand.  We have pushed that matter forward; we have not hesitated and we do not think it is necessary to be unduly unreasonable or to be unreasonable at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not pressing the point.  Even if the number is any way near as great, it is a very remarkable statement to have made.  The suggestion that it is due to the fact that the parents want the children to be there, where they cannot afford to keep them, is also very remarkable.  The Minister said, and I am not criticising the statement at all, that a good deal of what is nominally educational expenditure is poor relief.  I am suggesting to him that either now or at a later time he should tell us what, in his opinion, is the amount of money which is supposed to be segregated to education, but which is really poor relief.</P>

      <P>I think, in almost every Estimate of this House&mdash;I might say in every Estimate put before the House&mdash; there is hidden poor relief of one kind or another.  What I am anxious to do is to get more accurate segregation of accounts so that we will know.  I agree entirely with what the Minister said as to whether or not it is educationally desirable that children should be fed in schools in order that they might be able to take advantage of education; that is the case that is put forward, but if this charge for feeding children is not an educational expenditure it should be clearly set forward as poor relief and as part of the figures which we would have to analyse in trying to understand the actual fiscal, industrial and economic position of the people in the country.  The Minister also suggested that the education Estimates did not in other ways cover the whole education expenditure.  There, undoubtedly, is local expenditure either in maintenance of schools by the local authorities by subscriptions obtained by the management, and so on.  What I am asking is that we get to know <Col N="941" /> what we have to add to what is set out in the Estimates under the heading of &ldquo;Education,&rdquo; so that, in the way of total contributions through other sources we should know what the total cost of education is.  The Minister told us that the cost of education in this country in certain institutions was low, due to the fact that these institutions were run by religious, and that if they had to be run by lay people the actual cost of carrying on that portion of the education system would be much higher.  I should like if, now or at some other time&mdash;I am not suggesting that the Minister should give us the figures at the moment&mdash;to get what the actual relative cost of education in those religious-controlled bodies would be, compared with what the cost would be if controlled by a purely secular lay system.  I want to know what is the amount of the actual cost of education that we have to add to the nominal cost. I want to find how much money directly and indirectly contained in the Education Estimate should be really under Poor Relief.</P>

      <P>It is rather a curious coincidence that the matter to which Deputy O'Connell last night and the Minister for Education this afternoon devoted a good deal of time, that is, the question of the standard of primary education in the Free State, is the subject that has been troubling technical education authorities for a great number of years.  Any of those who have glanced through the Report of the recent Commission will find that the Commissioners had a good deal to say on the question of primary education.  In view of what has been said, I do not want to take up the time of the House referring to it at any great length.  But I am sure the <Col N="944" /> House will agree with me when I say that we have very great regard for the opinion of the Minister on this matter. I would also like to say that we have quite a regard for Deputy O'Connell's opinion as to the standard of primary education.  But I do not think any of us would look upon either of those two as impartial witnesses on this important subject.  The Minister on the one side, naturally, would support the views of his Department.  Deputy O'Connell, on the other side, would support and lay stress on the importance of the work done by the teachers.  It is possible to get from information that reaches us a more or less impartial view of the particular standard of primary education as we find it to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That may satisfy you. The Deputy will find the figures I am now going to refer to in that Report. In the City of Dublin, those leaving the primary schools register, if they have not got employment, in the juvenile Department of the Labour Exchange. Amongst the large number of registrations there, an example was taken of 115 boys and 94 girls in order to get at the standard of education.  I am reading again from the Report of the Commission.  These were applicants who applied to the Labour Exchange for employment between June and September of last year.  Of those 115 boys, 60 per cent. had only reached the 5th standard; 9 per cent. had not gone beyond the third <Col N="945" /> standard, and of the girls 47 per cent. had only reached the fifth standard. The importance of that is this, namely, in order to take advantage of the work in our technical schools a boy or girl must at least have reached the sixth standard before he or she can make any progress whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; from the Deputy.  Thus the matter is of vital importance to those engaged in the work of technical education, and we should get at least a sixth standard amongst those leaving our primary schools, but we are only getting that, as these figures will show, in a much smaller percentage than we would like to see amongst those leaving our primary schools.  A fairly high educational standard from the point of view of employment is very important. This matter was inquired into quite recently by the London County Council and they found that amongst the unemployed juveniles 95.5 per cent. of the males and 92.5 of the females had left the primary schools before reaching fifteen years of age.  I mention that to show the important connection there is between education and employment.  It is hardly necessary for me to point out that all education is training and equipping for after careers.  Notwithstanding what was said by Deputy O'Connell last night as to the condition of our school buildings being one of the greatest blots on our educational system, to my mind the greatest blot upon it is the fact there is practically no connection between education and industry in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens?  We educate our boys and girls, spend a good deal of money on them up to the age of fourteen when they leave our primary schools and, in the great majority of cases, the State takes no further interest in them.  To my mind, the period after they leave school is the most critical period of their lives, yet our State takes no interest in these boys and girls at that most critical time. That, to my mind, is the greatest blot on our educational system as we know it in the Free State to-day.  It is true <Col N="946" /> to say that in connection with another Department of our Ministry we have what is known as an Advisory Committee on Juvenile Employment which operates under the Labour Exchange. It is administered by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  As I said before, all boys and girls leaving primary schools have to register under the 1926 Act at the Juvenile Department of the Labour Exchange.  That Advisory Committee interviews the parents and sees most of the pupils, boys and girls, and does its best to try and guide them into different departments of employment but, owing to the difficulty of there being no roads between education on the one hand and industry on the other, it finds the greatest difficulty in finding useful employment for them with the result that not ten per cent. of the boys and girls registering at this Department of the Labour Exchange find employment through that medium.  That is a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>In our city alone each year over 6,000 boys and girls leave primary schools and register at the Exchange, but less than 1,000 of them find employment through that source. The question is: What becomes of the remaining 5,000?  A number of them, doubtless, who are able to wield interest and get their friends to work for them find employment in various capacities, but I am quite satisfied that, at least, a moiety of those making applications do not succeed in finding any employment and are to be found at the street corners and elsewhere. All of them have been educated by the State; many of them are boys and girls of more than ordinary ability, but they get no opportunity of using that ability.  Again I say that that is one of the worst blots on our educational system.  If our State goes to the trouble and expense of educating these young people, the least it might do is to see that they get an opportunity of using that education and applying their talents properly.  They get no opportunity of doing so.  That is one of the problems that confront the Commission which recently inquired into and made recommendations in connection with technical education in our country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of <Col N="947" /> the House discussing these problems, though they are all vital matters to the State, but I just want to ask the Minister one question.  The report of the Commission is dated 5th October, 1927. It may, of course, have been some little time subsequently before it reached the Minister.  I do not know what delays there may have been, and perhaps that is the date on which the report was signed.  The recommendations in that report, in view of what I have said, are of great importance to a great number of people.  Every month over 600 boys and girls leave our primary schools. Are they to get no opportunity of making useful citizens in this or any other country?  Is no help to be afforded them by the State in order that the talents they possess may be properly used?  These are matters that have been dealt with in considerable detail by that Commission, and I am anxious to know from the Minister what steps his Department proposes to take in connection with the Commission's report.</P>
    <P>I know, as the Minister has already pointed out, that to put these recommendations into operation would mean the expenditure of a considerable sum of money.  All Departments are agreed at the moment that this State is sufficiently heavily taxed.  I quite agree, and for that reason I do not want to press the Minister to put in an elaborate and expensive scheme, such as putting the whole report into immediate operation would be.  I think, however, that we might take steps whereby the different recommendations in the report would be gradually brought into operation.  Even that cannot be done without involving some expenditure, but I do not think, if done in that particular way that the expenditure would be unduly heavy, and, as I have said, this report has been some time in the hands of the Minister, and one would be glad to know, as a result of the consideration which I am sure both he and his Department have given to it, what their views are on these recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to submit to the House that Deputy Good has made wrong deductions from the statistics <Col N="948" /> which were made available to him and which he has attempted to digest.  I can only compare his state to that of the chronic dyspeptic who seeks to cure his complaint by a course of cheese and chestnuts.  Deputy Good has given us some figures as to the number of boys registering at the Labour Exchange. He quotes the figure of, I think, 94 per cent. of boys whose educational qualifications are of a very low order.  Has Deputy Good taken into consideration the thousands of boys who leave school and go into the ordinary commercial and industrial occupations in this country without ever having registered at a Labour Exchange?  These are the false deductions to which Deputy Good has fallen a prey on this occasion.</P>
      <P>It is not the first occasion that the Deputy has followed the maxim of reductio ad absurdum in matters such as this.  He speaks for those poor children for whom he pretends to have so much solicitude and sympathy, but I would like to point out to Deputy Good, and to those who think like him, that it is only the sheerest necessity that drives these boys from school at an early age when they have to get on to the labour market.  We ought not forget that were it not that the parents of these children are under-paid in many cases or are unemployed, these children would not have to register at the Labour Exchange or enter upon the blind-alley occupations which are such a source of infinite trouble in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not require to be educated in the history of technical instruction in this country.  I have a fairly long experience of the working of the Technical Instruction Act.  My experience is that we frequently find boys who, under the circumstances I have referred to, had to leave school at an early age and who, when entering on a course of technical instruction were found so backward in elementary subjects such as arithmetic and mathematics generally, that they were not able to assimilate the education which we provided for them in the technical branch.  The result was that we had to establish a class known as the &ldquo;Junior Tech.,&rdquo; in other words a junior technical instruction course through which <Col N="949" /> these boys had to pass.  That delayed the whole technological course for at least twelve months.  I know that that has been a very serious drawback to the technical education of our youth and the only remedy I see for it is that which Deputy O'Connell touched upon &mdash;namely, the raising of the school-leaving age.  I think that would meet many of Deputy Good's objections in that connection.</P>
    <P>Quite recently a series of meetings were held in Cork city and in some of the adjacent counties, I understand.  I think it will prove acceptable to the House and possibly will be a headline to Dublin, when I tell you that the capital of the South&mdash;namely, Cork&mdash;has been able to reach an agreement on this subject of technical instruction, at any rate.  When I tell you that people with such varied points of view and such a gulf between them as the President of the Chamber of Commerce and myself were found proposing and seconding a resolution and that we found a basis of common agreement I think you will regard that as very desirable.  I am only sorry that the Minister for Local Government is not here.  He would I am sure be enlightened by the attitude of intelligent Corkmen and he would not be dealing with the quidnuncs he met when careering around the south on his war-horse.  One of the parties to the resolution was the ex-President of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of the Irish Free State. That is a very high sounding title and I hope that it will carry some weight, even with Deputy Good.  I am sure it is very dear to his heart, this Association of Chambers of Commerce.  The resolution was seconded by Mr. R. Anthony, T.D., and supported by the Vice-Chairman of the Cork County Borough Technical Instruction Committee. The resolution was adopted but I am not going to give the wording because we are wonderful people for wording resolutions.  It stated &ldquo;That this public meeting of the citizens&rdquo;&mdash; by citizens I mean people of the type of Deputy Good&mdash;&ldquo;fully endorse the findings of the Commission on technical education in the Saorstát and strongly urge that steps be immediately taken to pass the necessary legislation to allow <Col N="950" /> the recommendations of the Commission to be put in force and in the meantime that the recommendations not requiring legislation be given effect to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Good has given half-hearted support to the findings of the Technical Commission.  I cannot quite square his attitude with some of the other things he said.  First of all, he found fault with the low standard of education of some of the boys registered at the Labour Exchanges.  In the next breath, while giving credit to the Technical Commission, and accepting its findings, he suggested that only some of them should be put into operation, and these gradually because of the expense.  Does Deputy Good not realise, as we all should as people of ordinary intelligence, that this money will be well spent?  It is bound to be reflected in industry and commerce. Employees and apprentices will, in turn, if the recommendations are put into effect, give better and more remunerative service to the people whom Deputy Good represents.  They are really standing in their own light by not instructing Deputy Good to give the greatest possible support to the recommendations of the Commission.  I suggest that if the recommendations are put into effect the money expended will not be lost.  We must incur certain expenditure.  When we appoint a commission every Deputy knows that something will evolve out of it which will entail further expenditure.  I know, of course, that the usual suggestion is, if you ask for improved local social services, that you will have to foot the bill.  I agree.  The recommendations of this Commission, if put into operation, would mean spending money with one hand which we would get back with the other.</P>
    <P>I ask the House, in dealing with this Vote, not to make it a party matter. This is not the only Vote upon which I have had to make that remark.  I take very strong exception to making party matters of and glorifying into big national questions matters of social reform.  I also suggest that even if there should be an adverse vote on this, the Executive Council should not consider it as a vote of no confidence. That kind of thing does not appeal to <Col N="951" /> me, and I am sure to many level-headed people on the other side.  There are a few level-headed people on the other side.  We should be able to get rid of this party question altogether in a matter of this kind.  It is really questionable whether the party system is good for the country.  There are some things at least on which we can unite.  It is certainly noteworthy that Deputy Good and I can see eye to eye in asking the Government to accept the recommendations of the Commission. That is all that we ask.  We have the Chambers of Commerce on the one hand and representatives of the Labour Party on the other, asking that that should be done, and that should commend itself to the Government.</P>

      <P>Approved by the Minister.  I will deal with letters to the Minister's Department which will show that I am in order.  These letters were sent to the Technical Committee in connection with the appointment. The vacancy was created by the resignation of the Principal, and the Technical Committee unanimously agreed to allow the appointment to be made by the Local Appointments Commissioners. They filled in the forms sent down by the Commissioners and agreed to the Commissioners' recommendation that applicants should not be over 40 years of age.  After a lapse of two or three months a further letter was sent to the Committee asking them to agree to increasing the age to 45.  The Committee, realising that the Principal appointed would have to travel over a very difficult country, was of opinion that he should not be over 40 years of age and refused to agree to increasing the age.  The Committee notified the Department of their refusal.  Notwithstanding that, the Appointments Commissioners inserted a second advertisement and sent down for appointment the name of a man of 45 years of age.</P>

I am not attacking either the Commission or the Minister; I am criticising the Selection Board which made the selection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department then sent a letter notifying the Committee that if they did not agree to the appointment all grants would be stopped.  When that failed, the Department sent a letter to the Parish Priest, as Chairman of the Committee, ordering him to call a special meeting and to put the Department's view before the Committee as to the serious loss which would be entailed if they refused to appoint this particular person.  The Committee have notified the Department that they would not appoint this particular person, and up to the present I am not aware that they have received a reply.  They refused on the ground that he has not the necessary qualifications and that the Department have exceeded their powers by appointing a person of 45 years of age, when the Committee and the Appointments Commissioners had agreed that the age should be not exceeding 40.  They also held that, as they were spending over £1,000 a year on Irish teachers, the principal appointed should have a knowledge of Irish.  They pointed out that the person whom they were asked to appoint had no knowledge of Irish.  This was the man who was to look after the seven or eight Irish teachers in the county.  The Minister's Department notified the Committee that all grants <Col N="953" /> would cease if he were not appointed. We are not going to worry about that, because the Minister cannot prevent us under the 1899 Act from raising a rate of a penny in the £ for technical education purposes, and we will probably be able to carry out a scheme that will give more satisfaction to the people than the scheme approved by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I notice that even some Labour Deputies are anxious that the man whose name was sent down for appointment should be transferred to Wicklow.  If he is such a wonderful man in his own area, why not retain him there?  We have no local man in view for the position. We are not attacking the Government, like other Deputies, because a local man was not appointed.  We do not care where the man comes from, what he is, or what his political opinions are, if he has the qualifications that the Committee ask for.  We are only asking for justice.  We ask that the man should not be over 40 years of age, should have a knowledge of Irish and be able to look after the Irish teachers in the county.  The Minister, through his Department, has refused. If the Minister states that there were no candidates forthcoming at the first examination with the necessary qualifications, I am going to insist that the names of the candidates at that examination be placed upon the Table.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">

      <P>The Minister is justifying the action of the Commissioners by approving of a man who does not meet the requirements of the local committee.  He intervened through the Department and withdrew the grant simply because the Committee are standing by their first advertisement. The man appointed has not the qualifications to act as principal in the County Wicklow.  First of all, he is over the age, and secondly, he has no knowledge whatever of the Irish language. There is £1,000 spent in the teaching of Irish, and here we are asked to appoint a principal to look after the Irish teachers who has no knowledge of the Irish language whatsoever.  A letter was sent to the parish priest asking him to summon a meeting because he was Chairman of the Committee.  The Department refused even to recognise the assistant to the Technical Committee. Up to the present the parish priest has refused to be a party or a servant of the Government.  He pointed out that there were men well paid in the Department to carry out this work.  We attended a meeting of the Technical Committee, and up to the present I am not aware of any further communication sent by the Department.  The Minister is responsible, I say, with all due respect.  He has approved of the appointment of this man.  I ask the Minister now is it a fact that two of his inspectors were visiting this man previous to his appointment?  The Minister may not be aware of that, but I could give the names of the inspectors.</P>

      <P>It is very unfair to civil servants, who are absolutely unable to defend themselves, that the Deputy should raise this question without notice.  He has given me no notice.  He suggested in one portion of his speech that he did not wish to criticise myself or the Department, and that he only wanted to get in a blow at the Selection Board.  Now he comes and makes insinuations against inspectors that they were practically guilty of corruption. If I understand the charge he <Col N="955" /> is going to make, it is nothing less.  To do that without giving any notice of raising a question, the details of which I could not answer without notice, is most unfair.</P>

      <P>I do not suggest corruption, but I say it is a strange coincidence that two inspectors of the Department should visit this gentleman previous to the appointment.  Is the Minister prepared, if responsible people are ready to give him the names and dates, to hold an inquiry?  If the names are submitted of the two inspectors alleged to have visited this gentleman previous to his appointment will the Minister hold an inquiry as to what their business was on these particular dates and why they visited this man previous to this appointment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Dáil that this is an exceedingly important matter.  Wicklow has a very large urban population and technical instruction was making great headway there.  I think it would be a very strange reflection on the Department of Education if now, when they have obviously blundered, rather than retreat from their position, they are prepared to allow the whole machinery that has been created there, the whole spirit that has been created during the past few years by real enthusiasm for technical instruction, to disappear rather than sacrifice a little of their pride and admit that they were at fault in the matter.  It is quite obvious, I think, that the county committee have a very strong case inasmuch as they were prepared to allow the Appointments Commissioners to make the appointment. They had no axe to grind in regard to any particular person. They agreed entirely as to the terms of the appointment, and it was only when the Local Appointments Commissioners, for reasons not satisfactorily explained, wanted these terms changed that the trouble started.  It should not, and it need not be emphasised that there is something very anomalous about the appointment of a man as Principal for technical education when that system of education includes Irish classes all over the county and involves the expenditure of a thousand pounds <Col N="956" /> out of local rates on classes for Irish, to appoint a man who does not know a word of Irish to superintend and organise these classes.  That is one of the peculiar features of it which I think will take a lot of explaining from the Minister.</P>
      <P>Further, after the dispute had actually developed we find this extraordinary unusual thing that instead of writing to the Secretary of the Committee of Technical Instruction, the Department wrote to the Chairman of the Committee who never conducted any correspondence with the Department, and who as he stated publicly was not prepared to undertake the task of correspondence.  He himself regarded it as discourteous and in my opinion justly so to the officer who was there to receive letters and to reply to them.  But it looks as if the Department had something very peculiar to explain in this matter and I hope the Minister is not going to say, as one might expect him to say from the remarks he made a while ago, that he is not prepared on this matter and that he should have been given notice that it was to be raised.  If he is not prepared to state the position on an important matter such as that when the Vote for Technical Instruction comes on it would look as if he was not very familiar with the working of his Department. There is a very strong feeling in the County Wicklow with regard to the matter, and it is to be hoped that the Minister will be able to say that they are prepared to compromise a little, and meet the Committee and settle a thing that is not a credit to the Department and for which the local committee is not responsible.</P>

      <P>As regards that matter this is one of the numerous disputes that go on through the country in the different sections of my Department. I suggest it is absolutely absurd for the Deputy to think that I would have all the details of a matter of this kind without any notice so as to answer charges made by the Deputies.  I had no inkling that a matter of the kind would be brought up.  I knew that there was a dispute on this particular matter between the Department and the local committee, but as to the details, <Col N="957" /> and it is a question of detail, I am not certainly prepared to speak now.  I gather even by the <i>ex parte</i> statements made by the Deputies that the Committee claim to have the right to suggest the terms of the appointment. Generally speaking, I deny that.  That is not the right of the Committee.  That is the right of the Appointments Commission after consultation with the Minister, but even apart from that a name was sent to me by the Local Appointments Commission.  I suggest there was nothing for me to do under the circumstances but to appoint that man.  Deputy Everett meant to make an attack on the Board.  The Deputy objected I understood to the Selection Board, and to their selection.</P>
      <P>We give preference to Irish.  I understand the Selection Board always does, but there cannot be such a difference between the various candidates that the Irish preference will be unable to breach it over, as apparently was so in this case.  I certainly, at a moment's notice, cannot deal with the details raised by the Deputy, much less with the mere suggestion of Deputy Everett that two members of my Department visited the house of one of the candidates, and therefore I am to conclude that the honour of these two is sufficiently impugned to hold an inquiry into it on a frivolous pretext of that kind, and also the honour of the Selection Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot hold an inquiry on what practically amounts to corruption on what the Deputy calls peculiar coincidence. There have been a few points raised by Deputy Good and Deputy Anthony.  I trust Deputy Anthony will not think that he will ever convince Deputy Good of the danger of dealing with figures. I have failed for a couple of years in this House to make any impression on <Col N="958" /> Deputy Good in that respect, and I do not think that Deputy Anthony will be anything more successful.  On the other hand, I do not think Deputy Anthony was quite fair to Deputy Good when he described Deputy Good's attitude towards the Technical Report as a half-hearted support of that. Really, I suggest to Deputy Good that to take the special type of boy or girl that comes into the Labour Exchange with whom he comes into touch in his Technical Advisory Committee as a class on whom you can base an average deduction, for all the people who leave the primary schools may be very correct, but may be very incorrect as well. It is certainly a most unscientific and very dangerous conclusion to draw.  I will admit that there ought to be a closer connection between education and industry in this country, but I suggest that neither the schools nor the State nor the local authorities are altogether to blame if there is not a closer connection.  We found it extremely difficult to get business men, employers and manufacturers, to give any preference very often to the products of some of our technical schools, and Deputy Good.  I think, knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had occasion, I think, sometimes to refer to the lack of respect there is for education among the various classes in this country.  In the Compulsory Attendance Bill we found it necessary to pass a law to compel some parents to realise the importance of education.  I always felt that there was some excuse for the poor, uneducated parent in the slum or in the country who took up an attitude of that kind when I saw a similar attitude in practice adopted by the better off and more educated people.  I have often seen the same contempt for training shown by leaders of industry and big businessmen as is shown by the poor parent who refuses to send his or her child to school.  Again, it is an exaggeration to say that there is a complete neglect, and that even up to the present there has been a complete neglect of the pupils between the ages of fourteen and sixteen.  That is not so. It is an exaggeration at the very best. I should say that practically one-third of the number are in attendance at <Col N="959" /> school.  I think, as well as I can remember, that the attendance at primary and secondary schools between fourteen and sixteen is about 40,000. That does not at all get rid of the very serious problem that Deputy Good described, and which the Technical Commission had to deal with.  It is, if you like, a commentary on the neglect of this matter for twenty-five years.  I will quite admit that.  But while admitting that I am not accepting responsibility for all that particular neglect. I claim that the Technical Commission which was set up had a difficult problem to deal with, that they produced a most valuable report, and that they did make a number of extremely valuable suggestions.  I refer to Deputy Good because he was on the Commission, and because he is familiar with every detail of the report.  I ask the other Deputies who, I hope, have given this report the attention it deserves, to consider that report again, and ask themselves what are the necessary steps to take in an exceedingly difficult report to digest properly&mdash;that is, how you are to start if you do not make a mistake.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony referred to the necessity of putting it all into force at once.  If there were no question of money in the matter, and remember money must be taken into account, whether it is a question of spending a small or a big amount this year or the year after, the State must scrutinise its finances very carefully before it spends it.  I am not saying that if it is necessary an effort should not be made to find it.  I think nothing could be more unfair to this report than to think that you can put it all into force at once, as Deputy Anthony suggests.  I think the Commission realise that.  Running through this report you will find the suggestion, here is a programme you will realise only in the course of ten or fifteen years.  I think that is a perfectly fair summing up of the attitude of the Commission themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked, I think last night, why not make a start at once in a particular place.  If Deputy O'Connell will turn to page 136 of the Commission's report he will notice an extraordinary <Col N="960" /> thing.  Twice in the report they have indulged in the luxury of printing things in large capitals, drawing special and careful attention to them.  I will read out what they have printed in the second of these instances, and I presume they were doing it because they felt not merely the necessity of warning but that a lacuna existed as well.  This is the quotation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Schemes of continuing education must be preceded by intensive training of teachers.  It would be fatal to embark on new educational ventures with untrained and insufficient teaching staffs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, I quite admit, late in the report but, from the point of view of administering it, it is certainly one of the first steps we would have to take, that is the training of teachers.  It is an extremely difficult and complicated report, difficult and complicated in the sense of knowing precisely where and how you are to start.  Some portions of it, for instance, require legislation; others only require administrative action.  But legislation is extremely difficult.  We have no code to which we can simply tack this on as an amendment of the old code.  For technical and continuation education we will have to draw up a new code, and that will be difficult.  I will take one instance.  So far as the mere words go &mdash;I, of course, realise fully that they were not put down by the members of this Commission without the fullest consideration&mdash;after looking at the matter from every angle they put down a recommendation for proper continuation education.  Suppose we grant that there should be compulsory continuation education part time or whole time, when you begin to work out the details of a little thing like that you are up against all sorts of consequences that follow from it, namely, the excuses that will be reasonable why persons should not attend.  You can only have schools of this kind at certain centres and there will be the question of distance and the attitude of the employers.  You require, at any rate, legislation to carry out a simple recommendation of that kind and the legislation will require a great deal of consideration.</P>
    <P>Supposing at present we were in a <Col N="961" /> position to adopt these proposals.  If we were told in the morning that the carrying out of the recommendations would cost over a quarter of a million, and that the State would find no difficulty in providing the money, I think it would be a waste of money to attempt to put it into force immediately.  I think there is that to be said for Deputy Good's point of view, as against Deputy Anthony's, namely, that you can only do this gradually.  Supposing next year you were able to start a scheme of continuation education in the city of Dublin, how is it to be paid for?  I am not saying now that the money would not be there, that is not what I mean by the question.  As the members of the Commission realised, and as the Deputies who have read this report must realise, the question of the contribution of the local authority comes in.  If these recommendations of the Commission are to be carried out, as everybody knows who has read the report, it means a bigger contribution from the local authority than they have given up to the present.  There is a suggestion of a minimum rate.  If you start a scheme of that kind in one part of the country without the proper rate from the local authority you will have great difficulty in getting away from that example in the rest of the country.  I want to be quite clear.  I am urging the question of expense not as an objection to the adoption of the recommendation, I urge only that it requires careful scrutiny of expenditure so far as these schemes are concerned, and that it is only very gradually, with the best will in the world, that we can try to put this report into effect, and that is the sense of the whole report.  Now, I hope it will be possible to consider whether certain steps cannot be taken, if the financial condition allows it even in the present year to at least make a beginning, to set the scheme in motion at all events.  What I have done is this: I have got this report very carefully taken to pieces, if I may use the word, to show exactly what is involved in it and what are the first steps that ought to be taken, so that we should know thoroughly what is <Col N="962" /> the precise system of education we are aiming at.  I have asked that model programmes on the new lines should be drawn up.  As I have said before, it will require that steps be taken before the scheme can be fully realised.</P>

I do not know whether the building operations that are going on in the neighbourhood will directly or indirectly <Col N="963" /> benefit the Museum.  I realise that they do want space at the present moment, and they are likely to want more space in the immediate future if they are to grow at all.  With the principal notion that guides the re-arrangement I am in complete sympathy&mdash;that is, giving the central position in the Museum to the Irish collection.  That is right and proper, and certainly it is the greatest treasure of the Museum.  I do not think there is such a wonderful prehistoric collection anywhere in the world, but I would be sorry if the re-arrangement of the contents of the Museum were to force us to exhibit very inadequately and in an uninstructive manner the other objects we have got there.  There was a rumour&mdash;I do not know how much lies underneath it &mdash;of the contemplated scrapping of casts in the Museum.</P>
      <P>I would suggest, as it seems likely that in the immediate future the Custom House, the Post Office and the Four Courts will be restored, and as some public buildings will be at the disposal of the Executive, that we should start a supplementary museum and perhaps devote one of these building to a casts museum and a historic arts and crafts museum, and into such a building many of the very valuable objects in the present Museum might go.  I would also like to ask the Minister if he has taken any steps to recruit special officers for the staff of the Museum as, owing to deaths, resignations and other causes, the present staff has been very largely depleted. I think it is very difficult to get these officers.  They are specialists of a very special character, and I am sure the Minister realises the importance of obtaining such men at an early date.  I would be glad if the Minister could give some information on these points, as it would be of interest to all of us, and relate to matters that are distinctly of national importance.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that rather interesting finds were made in County Waterford recently? I understand British scientists have been excavating there and have discovered very interesting prehistoric <Col N="964" /> remains, which have been sent to England.  I would like to know if steps will be taken to ensure that these objects, if they are of a genuine character, will be retained in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several items in this Vote, and I presume we can discuss them together.  In the first place, I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the very inadequate remuneration which is given to the staff of the National Library.  Most Deputies are probably aware that the National Library here is one of the best run, and the most efficient, and it is certainly conducted with more courtesy than any other public library that I have ever been in.  It is definitely a national asset in its present condition, particularly to the people of Dublin.  I understand that the staff is not strictly under the complete control of the Government, and is not completely under Civil Service regulations. The National Library I think is governed by some board, in the selection of which the Royal Dublin Society has a say.  Certainly, looking at the remuneration given the assistant-librarians and the assistants, it will be noticed that their salaries are very much below the scale that one would expect in the Civil Service.  We find salaries of £60 and £120 yearly and so on.  I understand that one of the results of paying these poor salaries is that many young men who are brought into the Library as assistants as soon as they have obtained training as librarians, because of these salaries, get positions elsewhere.  If there was a more equitable scale of salaries introduced for the National Library, I think we might retain some of the assistants who have been trained inside the Library itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to draw the attention of the Minister to what I believe to be the inadequate sum allowed for the purchase of books.  It is wonderful what the present librarian has been able to do with the limited means at his disposal.  During recent years I am afraid very many valuable books and documents of national interest, that should have been retained, have been unfortunately taken away.  The country has suffered more from the loss of <Col N="965" /> historical materials and valuable books within the last ten years than anything else, not only by the destruction and burning of the Four Courts but also during the troubled time. Many valuable private collections of books and documents throughout the country, which had been collected in the larger houses of the land-owning classes during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were destroyed by fire, while an almost equal number of these large houses have been sold by auction, and their contents bought by English and American dealers.  During recent years, had the National Library more means at its disposal much of this could have been avoided.  A certain sum, I understand, must be always spent out of the grant in order to keep the Library up to date, in what may be described as technical books for students of the various schools and universities, and only a portion is available for increasing the Irish collection in the National Library.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would do well if he could persuade the Department of Finance that the National Library has a right to buy at least one copy of every book relating to Ireland that has ever been printed in any part of the world, and that if such books, particularly ancient books, come into the market, even if the Minister should have to come and ask for a small Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year, it would be right to establish the principle that the National Library has the right to have a complete collection of every book ever published connected with the cultural, religious, political or economic life and history of the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the School of Art, I would remind the House that some years ago a sum was voted for a special Commission or Committee to investigate the working of that school, and the expenses of certain distinguished foreign experts were paid for this Committee.  Since then nothing has been heard of the Committee or of its findings.  A mysterious silence has been preserved as to what were their recommendations, if any, and whether the Minister approves of these recommendations or intends to carry them into effect; that is to say, if definite <Col N="966" /> recommendations were made.  I often hear criticisms and complaints as to the present state of the School of Art.  In the first place, a very small fee is required to enter it.  That makes it possible for many persons who are not serious students at all to go to the school, to waste not only their own time, but to waste the time and distract the attention of serious students as well.  If there was a heavier fee perhaps that element could be kept out.  I have heard of students who went to the School of Art, and who, after three months, received practically no attention.  It was not possible for the masters to give them any attention, and they left the School, finding that they could do better by working on their own than in the School.  I would be glad if the Minister could give us any information as to what happened to that mysterious Committee which investigated the working of this institution.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to find out what are the regulations which it is stated are prescribed by the Minister for productions of An Comhar Dramiochta.  The only regulations that they work under, as far as I can see, is that they produce some plays on Monday evenings and at no other time.  Therefore it is clear that it is a Dublin institution and that country people, who are certainly not in Dublin over the week-end, will have to do without seeing this party doing any work in that direction.  There is also another matter on which I would like information.  The Estimate states that there is a grant-in-aid towards the expenses of the preparation of permanent phonetic records of certain Irish dialects.  I would like to know of what Irish dialects phonetic records are to be preserved, why certain dialects were picked out, and what steps the Minister means to take to preserve certain other dialects.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the condition of those beautiful buildings that are just outside this House.  I am told that very many thousands of pounds damage has been done by the weather to the soft stone and the more decorative portions <Col N="967" /> of the buildings, that they are really crumbling away, and that if they are not attended to very shortly it will cost a huge sum of money to take the soft stone out and put the buildings in proper order.  That is a matter that might be considered if the Minister would ask the Board of Work to report on it.</P>

      <P>I will ask the Board of Works for a report.  Of course they are concerned with the upkeep of buildings.  I have heard this complaint for the first time, and I will bring it to the notice of the Board of Works.  I doubt if I have any power at present&mdash;possibly I may have soon&mdash;to deal with the matter raised by Deputy Goulding.  I doubt if I have any legal authority to prevent a person from disposing of what, I presume, is his private property, strictly speaking. However, there is in contemplation&mdash; and I hope it will be soon introduced&mdash; a Bill dealing with the preservation of monuments.  The question it has been found extremely difficult to solve is to try to extend that Bill to deal with a number of other objects which we would like to keep in the country.  It has been found extremely difficult to draft a Bill that would deal in any effective way with a problem of that kind.  If you are dealing with stone monuments and large things it is comparatively simple, because they are fixed objects.  Perhaps it may not be so difficult to deal with the actual matter referred to by Deputy Goulding in a Bill of that kind, but even by legislation we will find it very difficult to prevent the export of small objects. That would be so if we had the legislation, but at present we have not the legislation.</P>

      <P>Well, I <Col N="968" /> am afraid that by no legal subtlety could I bring Deputy Goulding's skeleton under the head of treasure trove.  However, Deputy Goulding's reference to this matter shows that an interest is being taken in the necessity for keeping these articles in the country. We are dealing with the problem. It is not easy to frame legislation, and if you had legislation it might be extremely difficult to enforce it in connection with small objects.  Deputy Hogan asked for information with regard to certain dialects.  At the present moment the Munster dialect is being dealt with by means of a certain number of records&mdash;to a certain extent they are experimental&mdash;partly because there is, as things stand at present, apparently more danger of the Munster dialect in the places where it is spoken dying out than in the case of the Western.  Other large districts, such as those in Connaught, and even in Ulster, we hope it will be possible to deal with at a later stage if the experiment is successful.  The actual records that are being prepared at the moment, therefore, deal with those dialects that seem to be most in need of recording.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde is under a misapprehension in thinking that the National Library assistants are not civil servants.  They are civil servants in the full sense of the term, and they are dealt with as civil servants.  The matter has been fully considered, and that was the conclusion that was come to as to the scale of pay to which their particular rank in the Civil Service entitled them.  Another question was raised about money.  Everyone would like the National Library to have more money, but if you increase one Vote after another in small matters when a serious case is put up for it there will be a considerable difficulty when you come to tot up the whole.  Deputy Esmonde also asked about the School of Art.  There has been an inquiry of the kind mentioned, but I have not yet received a complete report from that Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general question of the Museum was raised by Deputy Alton.  He referred to an answer I gave on the matter. I forget what it was.  I know that the Museum authorities themselves <Col N="969" /> agree with this, and anything that I say is not to be taken in the slightest as a criticism of them; they are in agreement with the point of view I am going to explain.  As things seem to have developed here it does seem to be out of place and unnatural, when you go into the Museum in our capital, to find that the first thing you see is a number of reproductions of ancient sculpture.  I understand from those who are capable of judging of their artistic merits that they are not very good reproductions.  You find a miscellaneous collection as well in the rotunda.  In the principal hall you find, if you look very carefully, a few Irish objects, and you find a large number of other things, some valuable and some not.  To start off, the Museum, to some extent, suffers from lack of space.  It suffers also, as possibly most museums suffer, owing to the lack of sufficient storage accommodation, and perhaps from trying to display too much.  We have come to the conclusion that a re-arrangement is necessary, and that it will be necessary to store a great deal more. Roughly speaking, the plan that I have in mind is something like this: in the entrance hall, that is, in the rotunda, there will be something concerned with Ireland, but as the light is bad there the principal objects will not be displayed there.  But in the large central hall&mdash;the proper place&mdash; we will have what undoubtedly is one of the most valuable collections of ancient gold ornaments in the world, records of Irish civilisation, properly displayed.  Round the raised portion we will have illustrations of other types of civilisations.  In the other rooms off that we will have, I hope, mainly original objects from Mediterranean and other types of civilisations. In that way by keeping the specimens of Irish civilisation where they ought to be, in the very heart and centre of the Museum, we hope at the same time not to neglect the other sides of the Museum and to bring it into touch with what is the actual kernel of the Museum.</P>
    <P>All that will take time.  We have to make arrangements for the temporary disposal of the casts.  I am not suggesting <Col N="970" /> that we are going to remove all the casts or reproductions.  That would be neither possible nor desirable.  However much these may be appreciated by the few, and however valuable they may be to a few students perhaps, so far as we are concerned at present they are occupying space that we need. Therefore, we have arranged to find temporary homes in various places for their disposal.  We hope to be able gradually, therefore, to proceed to the reorganisation of the Museum in that way.  There is no necessity, for instance, if you have four hundred objects of the same kind, to display the four hundred.  And there is no reason, if you can find a valuable piece of Irish silver or glass, that it should be lost, so to speak, in the other collection that is there.  In that way, we are trying to make the Museum more attractive and a great deal more instructive than it is. In doing that we have the full concurrence of the officials at present in the Museum who are familiar with the work.  Therefore, that re-arrangement is in no sense at all any criticism whatever of the valuable work that they have given to the Museum.</P>
    <P>We recognise that the staffing of the Museum is depleted.  Arrangements are being made to consider the question as to what the permanent staff of it should be.  I hope to be able to deal with that gradually and to fill these posts.  As I have said already, one of the greatest difficulties that we will have to contend with is lack of space. All museums tend to get overcrowded at times.  As a museum ours is particularly badly built.  It may be anything else you like, but as a museum it is most unsuited for its purpose, as unsuited as one could possibly imagine. As a museum for displaying objects it is certainly one of the worst buildings that is used for such a purpose.  A lot of our public buildings are pretty bad, especially the older types of buildings. In the case of the Museum the architects made up their minds to display themselves rather than the objects the Museum was to hold.  We will have that difficulty as regards finding space. We will also have a difficulty in finding storage space for objects that we may decide to put aside.  There is no need <Col N="971" /> why these objects should be available to the general public, but it is desirable that they should be available to students.</P>

      <P>Before the Vote is put, I should like to make one suggestion which will not require an answer from the Minister.  It is in reference to records for preserving Irish dialects.  A few years ago, a very interesting report was presented by a Gaelic League organiser now in the Government service regarding the dialect in Tyrone. I am sure there will be no territorial difficulty in getting these records and thus preserving what remnant there is of that dialect, as well as the dialect in Omeath, but particularly as regards Tyrone, because in ten years there will not be any speakers there from whom records may be taken.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £504,433 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for the cost of the Army, including Army Reserve,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of years ago the Minister for Finance stated that he considered the normal expenditure for the Army to be about one and a half millions per annum.  The actual Estimate for this year is £1,804,433.  That, of course, is more than the Minister for Finance estimated as the normal expenditure on the Army, but I entirely agree with the Minister for Finance.  I think the fact that not only has there been a very considerable diminution in the cost of the Army for every year since 1923, but the fact that this year we have an Estimate £380,734 lower than last year makes it perfectly clear that we can, when we get to a perfect stage of normality, maintain the Army for the cost indicated by the Minister for Finance. As we approach normality, we get more into the position to place the Army and to organise it in the way most calculated to meet the needs of this country and fit in with the financial <Col N="973" /> limitations of this country.  We have spoken on previous occasions of the Army as a standing Army entirely. Then we spoke about moving from that, from being solely a standing Army and adding to it a reserve. Naturally we did not move to the creation of a reserve immediately, because men had to be attested, including the reserve service, and only as their period in the regular Army ceased would they take their place in the reserve.  This year we are adding a further class, known as the B reserve class, that is to say, men joining directly into the reserve and doing a period of, say, three months' training, and then being available to be called up annually thereafter.  The Army now consists of the standing Army and of A reserve and B reserve.  I had hoped to add a further class, a class that we might call a volunteer defence force, which would largely consist of men following their ordinary avocations of life, joining that class and in the ordinary course doing a certain amount of training in the evening after their ordinary day's work, and, in addition, giving a period of, say, a fortnight or three weeks to training during the summer months.</P>
    <P>We have been moving down in numbers with the standing Army consistently for some years past.  During the past year we have been moving fairly steadily in that line of diminution. On the 31st March, 1927, we had 888 officers and 10,710 other ranks.  In March last we had 768 officers and 9,113 other ranks.  On 30th September last we had 735 officers and 8,454 men. That line of reduction I propose to continue until the standing Army consists, roughly, of about 5,000 men.  As that reduction takes place in the standing Army so will the membership of the various reserved classes grow. That has already taken place.  For instance, on the 31st March last we had 40 reserve officers, 777 other ranks in the A class and 695 other ranks in the B class.  On the 13th of this month there were 57 reserve officers, 1,268 other ranks in the A class and 2,890 other ranks in B class so that we have moved towards our principle, as you might say.  That is a very small standing Army consisting of technical corps, <Col N="974" /> such as artillery, transport, air force, and so on, all highly trained men.  The infantry brigade consists very largely for providing all potential N.C.O.s and N.C.O.s as potential instructors in training.  That is what we are moving to.</P>
    <P>For myself, I am very satisfied with the progress we have made in that direction this year.  That move has been accompanied not merely by a great economy in the Army, not only by reduced estimates, but also it has been very clearly accompanied by increased efficiency in every rank in the Army.  During this period also a very considerable and drastic reorganisation of the whole Defence Department has taken place.  We have continued to reduce the number of posts in the country.  That is necessary for a number of reasons.  First of all, the necessity for them ceased to exist; and secondly, the more distributed an army is the greater number of ineffectives there must necessarily be.  In a small compact standing army of 5,000 it will be necessary to eliminate to the very furthest point every ineffective in the Army.  We are progressing very steadily in that direction.  I propose closing down a number of posts.  The lessening of the Army, as indicated in the various Estimates presented to the Dáil, does not quite give the full extent of the economy that has taken place in the Army.  For instance, in the early years we owned a great deal of army lands.  As we ceased to need them they were handed over to the Board of Works.  Many of these were productive of revenue, written down as grants in aid.  As we ceased to own them and they were handed over to the Board of Works this Vote ceased to be credited with the money accruing from them, so that to-day they should be added to lessen the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The standing Army will, as I say, be very highly trained, consisting of technical corps and very highly trained infantry.  It may be remembered that it was mentioned in previous Estimates we had sent a mission to the United States of America.  The object of sending these officers there was that men in the Army would be able to receive a training from the point of the <Col N="975" /> recruit joining and other ranks right up to the training of the highest staff officer.  The six officers that went to America came back, I think, last December.  Since then we have been actively taking steps towards the creation of an Irish military college. The early months of this year were devoted to certain lectures and inquiries prior to the forming of the college.  I hope within a very short time the college will be actually in existence in the Curragh, so that there will be every type of training&mdash;to the recruit joining, the training of that recruit up to N.C.O., the training of the junior officers and the training of the senior officers, and the consideration of every military problem that is likely to come within the purview of an Irish Army. The officers while in America did remarkably well, and received diplomas of graduation such as are issued to American officers.  Associated with them in the formation of the military college have been other senior officers. As we progress towards our principle it is natural that the proportion of N.C.O.s in the Army to men will be greater than in an army which is up to a full sized standing army.</P>
    <P>I think it will be found there has been a reduction under almost every heading in this list, amounting in all to as much as £380,000 odd.  That reduction was, of course, only reached by a very careful consideration of every item of possible expenditure included in the year's Estimate.  I hope that we have not yet reached our ideal level of expenditure, and that in future years we may be able to decrease it even more, but it must be remembered that within a period of a very few years we have reduced the Army from the number of something more than 50,000 to the number I have given at present, namely, 735 officers and 8,454 men.  To reduce the Army, as we hope to do within a short period to one-tenth of its original size necessarily will leave for a period a certain lack of equilibrium in the proportion of its various members.  As we reduce the number of posts, naturally for a period there will appear to be certain men in certain <Col N="976" /> ranks not as necessary as they appeared to be before.  We must reduce down to our normal as quickly as possible in any one service or rank. That, my conscience is perfectly clear, has been done during the last eighteen months with all the celerity that it could possibly be done with.</P>
    <P>I think anybody who has observed the Army to any extent will notice that during the years of its existence there has been a constant improvement in its general efficiency and in its general bearing.  I believe, situated as this country is, that in maintaining that very small Army we must expect, and have a right to expect, from the members of the Army a higher degree of devotion and a higher degree of attention to their work and the perfecting of themselves in the knowledge their work requires than possibly might be demanded in other countries.  I think we have not only the right to expect that, but that we can expect that and ask it without any qualms at all.  I believe the young men of our country will recognise that in joining the Army to serve their country that it is not merely a profession, but something more than a profession.  I think also that for officers who set themselves out to make their craft a profession we should see to it that we give them every means of making themselves as perfect as possible in their work, and we should see to it once they are determined to make that their profession and they put themselves wholeheartedly into their work, that they are enabled to make it a profession. That is my purpose in starting the college, of which we are at present actually laying the foundations.  We have moved on so quickly during the last year towards our normal that we have come across many facts we were previously unaware of, and here I have to make a slight confession, and it is that our outlook on certain points, from close observation, has changed considerably, and although I believe I promised Deputy O'Connell last year that no matter how my predecessors might have failed to bring in a permanent Army Act within 12 months that I would do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I may as well take this opportunity of breaking the news to Deputy O'Connell, who, unfortunately, is not here, that I am afraid that I shall hardly be able to introduce a permanent Army Act this year.  I propose not doing that, apart from the fact that our programme here will probably be overcrowded, because before I propose to commit the House to a permanent Act I would like to know all the possible needs of the Army and all the possible snares that we should avoid.  For instance, the Army Act as it exists quite possibly will not allow me to start my Volunteer Defence Force; on the other hand, I have in mind the starting of an Army Benevolent Fund, which also raises the question of a new section in a new Act.  I am examining a great number of things of that nature to see whether they should or should not be included in the new Act, and I would not like to come to the Dáil and ask Deputies to pass an Act, declaring it a permanent Army Act, if I felt that within the four walls of that Act the Army would be prevented from reaching that stage of perfection and having all the necessary sides to it such as an Army Benevolent Fund and so on, which I think the well-being of the Army and of the State demands.</P>

      <P>I think the speech we have just listened to is one that affords some Parties in this House matter for a great deal of self-congratulation, congratulation which is not due to the Minister, congratulation which is not due to the Government, but congratulation which has been merited and is due to the Republican Party upon these benches.  The Minister has stated that the Minister for Finance has come to the conclusion that an adequate Army can be maintained in the Saorstát for the sum of something like one and a half millions. We disagree with the Minister.  We believe that the sum required to maintain an Army adequate to the needs of this country is very much less.  We remember the time when the Minister <Col N="978" /> who spoke on behalf of the Government and was responsible for the Defence Forces suggested that the minimum sum required to maintain an Army in the Saorstát was something like two and a quarter million pounds. It certainly is a very practical tribute to the effectiveness of the criticism which the Minister has encountered from these Benches, that inside something like nine months the Government should have so far reconsidered their position as to have come to the conclusion that they would permit an additional sum of something like three-quarters of a million to remain in the pockets of the citizens&mdash;three-quarters of a million to finance industry, to pay wages and to provide money that could be devoted to the service of education.  We only hope that we shall be able to continue the good work, and that when next a Minister for Defence comes to submit an estimate to this House, he will be able to tell the Dáil and the people that the Army will no longer expect out of their savings and the products of their toil £1,800,000 and that we can maintain an Army, as we believe it can be maintained&mdash;an Army adequate to the needs of the country&mdash;for a sum of something less than a million; in fact, for a sum of something less than three-quarters of a million&mdash;and we speak on this matter not without the book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the admission that the Army is not to be the expensive plaything which hitherto it has been; that it is going to be reorganised upon the basis which was first suggested in this House from these benches&mdash;on a volunteer basis.  We should like to know how the Minister is going to reconcile the organisation of an Army upon that basis with the declaration of military principle which he made in this House on the 8th February, 1927: &ldquo;We need not blink the fact that it is quite possible, in the event of a general attack on these islands&mdash;it is perfectly obvious &mdash;our Army must co-operate with the British Army.  It is practically inconceivable that our Army would ever be opposed to the British Army.  But that our officers should go there to learn what they could in general about military matters, and of the scheme of defence <Col N="979" /> which is in the mind of the Government and the military forces which in the event of a general attack upon these islands would have the major share of the defence, was, I think, entirely desirable.&rdquo;  It would seem to me, if that were to be the governing principle upon which the Department of Defence were to determine its policy, that it would not be possible to maintain here an army upon a volunteer basis, because a volunteer army is essentially a parochial army.  It certainly is not an army that would ever make an effective overseas force, and if the Minister were really determined to base his policy upon the voluntary principle, upon the principle that the citizens of the State should render military aid to the State without fee or without reward when the exigencies of the State demanded it, I do not see how he could possibly give effect to the principle which he stated in this House on the 8th February, 1927. I am glad, therefore, that he has made the latter statement, because it does seem as if, notwithstanding the things that happened at the Imperial Conference, that the Government are about to revert to the earlier position which was stated by the Minister's predecessor, who said that the organisation of our defence force should in the first place be such that it would be capable of rapid and efficient expansion in time of need to the maximum of the country's man-power.  We feel that that is a sound principle.  It is the principle which we, if in power, would strive to give effect to, but it is a principle which, we regret to say, so far as the Government's policy is concerned, seems only to have been stated to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave certain figures of the present strength of the Army.  He showed how the effective strength of the standing Army had been reduced, and that there had been a certain increase in the reserve.  It seems to me that while the strength of the standing Army has been reduced, the corresponding increase in the reserve has not been such as to warrant the belief that the Minister seriously intended that the Army of which he is now the reorganiser <Col N="980" /> should be capable of rapid and efficient expansion in time of need to the maximum of the country's man-power. If to-morrow this country were faced with a situation that required the mobilisation of the Army, how far could this Army of approximately nine thousand officers and men expand?  Though it puffed itself out like the bull in the fable, the ultimate limit of its strength would be something like 12,517 men of all ranks, and would 12.517 men of all ranks defend this country in time of need?  Even were it stretched to the very utmost, could it be held that that Army really expressed rapid and efficient expansion in time of need to the maximum of the country's man power?  If that was the policy which the Minister had in view, if he was really guided by the principle enunciated by his predecessor, I think he would have given to this House his advance proposals for the organisation of this volunteer defence force to which he has referred.</P>
    <P>But that is not the only thing.  No matter how large that Army would be, no matter how courageous or well-disciplined it would be, or how enthusiastically it would be backed by the civilian population of this country, of what use would it be as a shield against attack if there is no independent source of munitionment?  What use is that Army even if, instead of 12,000 men, ten times that number were enrolled under the banners of the Saorstát?  These 120,000 would be of no more service to you than if you had 12,000 men, if every single cartridge for the rifle or Lewis gun, and if every rifle and every single weapon and instrument of war with which it would be equipped were provided, and supplied by that very Power which possibly would be the one whose attack the Army would be resisting? Is it not a mockery and sham to maintain an Army upon such a basis, and to spend in the maintenance of it a sum of £1,800,000, the balance of which the Government is now asking this Dáil to vote?  To spend £1,800,000, and for which £1,800,000 that Army, in time of need, could not fight and could not fire a shot.</P>
    <P>The other day the Minister for Finance opposed here a motion coming from the Labour benches and supported <Col N="981" /> by these benches, and, I am sure, supported by every honest and humane man in this House asking the Government to inquire into and to submit estimates for the cost of providing pensions for widows and orphans.  The Minister refused it on the grounds that to give effect to that motion, to accept the motion in that form would be to accept the principle and to commit the Government ultimately to an expenditure of £750,000&mdash;that £750,000 that would provide the hungry with bread; £750,000 that would keep the children in the home and prevent them from being sent to the reformatories and industrial schools.  The Minister could not spend £750,000 for that Christian purpose, and yet he asks this House to spend £1,800,000 upon an Army that in time of war could not fire a shot because every cartridge that goes into its rifles is purchased possibly from the Power with whom we would be contending.</P>
    <P>I want to go further.  The Minister's predecessor expounded the principle upon which the Army was to be organised.  I repeat this principle again so that it may become familiar to us:&mdash;&ldquo;The organisation of defence forces should, in the first place, be such that it would be capable of rapid and efficient expansion in time of need to the maximum of the country's man power.&rdquo;  I ask the Minister and I ask the Government do they accept that principle and all its implications?  It is important that we should, if we are to find common ground in this matter, know this&mdash;are they prepared to tell the citizens of this country that all able-bodied men should understand that they are expected to give military service in time of national danger.  That is the plain implication of the statement that in time of need it would be capable of rapid and efficient expansion to the maximum of the country's man power.  Does the Minister accept the principle then that all able-bodied men should be compelled to give, or preferably giving voluntarily, military service in time of national danger?  The Minister accepts that; we are glad that he accepts it.  We welcome it because we ourselves have accepted and are prepared to give effect to that principle. <Col N="982" /> But we feel that something more than mere formal acceptance of it is necessary.  If that principle is going to operate for the good of this country, if that service is going to be given willingly by patriotic citizens, there should be public confidence in the military policy of the Executive.  We and every man in this State ought to feel that the Army is truly a national Army, that it is not, as unfortunately the opinion has been formed and the impression has been given, merely a collection of Janissaries banded together for the maintenance of a certain political party in power in this country.  We are not antagonistic to the Army.</P>
    <P>We are not antagonistic to any man or section of men in the Army.  But we are certainly antagonistic to any combination of men, disciplined and in uniform who would regard themselves merely as the servants of a political party in the State.  We are anxious that the Army paid for by all the people should be the people's Army. We are anxious that the Army paid for by the people should be an Army that would command the respect and devotion of the people.  Therefore, we feel that in all his dealings with that Army the Minister should be sedulous and careful enough not to create the impression that the people who are in that Army are only his political friends and supporters.  Unfortunately the policy which the Government has pursued in this matter is a policy which has created the opposite impression.  There is nothing which has made many people in this country regard the Army merely as an armed political machine, than the fact that in all cases where public patronage is to be extended, it has been the deliberate policy of the Government to stipulate that preference shall be given to those men who took a certain side in the unfortunate civil conflict which divided this country.</P>
    <P>We feel that there is nothing which prevents the Army being taken to the hearts of the people and being regarded as the shield and safeguard of the people more than that.  Because every time that a Republican, possibly very well-qualified for the position, goes forward for a public appointment he is <Col N="983" /> met with the barrier that because he was not a member of the Army during the time of civil crisis in this country he is going to suffer a disadvantage and be at a handicap as compared with another competitor for the position.</P>
    <P>We think that this is one of the things that has kept alive more than anything else the bitterness which was engendered by the civil war, and if the Minister is going to accept the principle that all able-bodied men are expected to give military service in time of national danger he should also accept the principle that all men, no matter what their political principles or their political party may be, are entitled to equal consideration when public positions are to be filled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>We have suggested that the Army is too expensive.  We do that, as I have said, not because we are antagonistic to the Army, but we feel that the expenditure upon it is very much more than this country can afford.  When we look abroad we see other countries where the organisation of the Army is carried out upon a different principle.  Look, for instance, at Switzerland, where we find that in 1927 they paid for the maintenance of an army of 158,500 men something like £3,464,000&mdash;one hundred and fifty-eight thousand officers and men, and even they do not represent the full effective strength of the Swiss Army in time of war.  In time of war Switzerland can call upon an additional 100,000 men, and the total cost of the military machine which enables Switzerland to have at its call 260,000 citizens capable of rendering military service is <Col N="984" /> £3,464,000, and the cost per annum per effective man in 1927 was £22.  In the Saorstát it costs £1,836,884 to maintain an Army of 12,517 officers and men, or a cost of £146 per effective man per annum.</P>
      <P>I think that these figures merit the serious consideration of this House. Switzerland's Army, cheap and all as it is, was effective enough to prevent any invasion of Switzerland during the Great War, when many of the military Powers on the Continent would have been only too glad to avail of such strategic advantages as an invasion of Switzerland would bring them, and they would undoubtedly have embarked on such invasion were it not for the fact that they knew that there was there to oppose them an effective army of over a quarter of a million men. That army has been maintained at full efficiency for a sum of £3,460,000 whereas we are paying £1,836,000 for an army of 12,500 men.  Surely there is something wrong somewhere.  Is there any reason why our Army should not be organised on the same basis as that of Switzerland?  If there is any good or valid reason, I think the Minister for Defence should give it to us.</P>
      <P>If he cannot satisfy this House that there is some justification for paying £146 per man per annum for an Army of 12,500 men as contrasted with the sum for which Switzerland can maintain an army of over twenty times that size, then I think the House should reject the Vote, because it owes responsibility to the people, because it is the custodian of the moneys which have been collected from the citizens in taxation, and because already the Minister for Finance, who is supported by the majority Party in this House, has declined to accept proposals to make preliminary inquiries into schemes for providing assistance to the widows and orphans of this State.  Further, I think that every man who believes that charity comes first, and that there is a duty to the poor and the suffering in our midst, ought to vote against this Estimate which the Minister has put before us.</P>

      <P>I find some difficulty in understanding in particular the point of view that Deputy MacEntee <Col N="985" /> took.  To begin with, he claimed credit to his Party for the reduction in the Army Vote.  I will come back to that point later.  In the middle of his speech he wanted a volunteer army that was essentially a parochial army, and which would be equally expensive.  Then he diverged to the fact that if we abolished the Army we could give pensions to widows, and then he wanted an army like the Swiss Army.  The Army of Switzerland, as, I think, the Deputy knows, is a conscript army.</P>

      <P>It is a conscript army.  Is the policy of Fianna Fáil a conscript army paid at the rate of threepence a day and liable to be called up from civil occupations at any time? I have seen the Swiss Army being mobilised for a fortnight's training in gunnery.  Is that the Fianna Fáil policy?  We ought to know.  Any comparison between an army raised by voluntary enlistment, and which must necessarily be paid rates that compete with the rates in the labour market, and a conscript army paid at low rates is utterly fallacious.  I now come back to Deputy MacEntee's beginning.  He says that the reduction in this Estimate is the result of nine months' work on the part of his Party.  When did the nine months begin and when did they end?  Could Deputy MacEntee tell me that?  Did they begin last July?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand that point because I do not remember that during that period, whether five or nine months, Deputy MacEntee said anything about the Army at all.  When Deputy MacEntee talked about the bull in the fable I am rather afraid that he and his Party are rather imitating that bull.</P>
      <P>I remember two years ago, not nine months or five months ago, many Deputies in this House did make an attempt to call attention to items in the Army expenditure that could be reduced. I know that I moved half a dozen amendments&mdash;I think Deputy Gorey voted with me&mdash;and forced divisions and that on these subheads to which we moved amendments there has been a substantial reduction.  I do not want to weary the House but I have the figures here if my word is questioned and I am quite prepared to show that where I moved for a reduction by £7,450 in the expenditure on tradesmen's pay, a reduction of £16,000, more than twice the amount has been made,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way to make reductions is not by making vague general speeches but by calling the Minister's attention to points of detail upon which economies can be effected.  I moved these amendments and I was supported by the Labour Party and a large number of Deputies.  Where are Deputy MacEntee's <Col N="987" /> amendments?  Where is his careful analysis?  Deputy MacEntee has not been reading the Estimates; he has been travelling in Switzerland.  The only way in which we can get a reduction in Army expenditure&mdash;though I think it is practically finished&mdash;or any other expenditure, is by detailed analyses, by detailed arguments, and by hard work. I do not see very much of that coming from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Deputy MacEntee, in the middle of his speech, when he said that he wanted a big Army, pinned himself to a volunteer army, and said that it was essentially a parochial army.  If Deputy MacEntee had not experienced a change of heart on the road to Mallow he would have discovered that a parochial army is not an efficient army, that no army can be effective when you have small units trained separately.  You must have combined training for all units of your army.  He would find that you cannot have an efficient army trained in very small units and that even if you had a volunteer army you would have to make provision for combined training for your infantry, your air force and your artillery.  He would find that the volunteer force would probably be as expensive as the Army we have because no army raised on a volunteer basis can be effective or efficient unless there are highly skilled men in command. You must have skilled officers and non-commissioned officers and you must have a staff.  You must get them in being; they cannot be improvised. No country has tried improvising an army.  If Deputy MacEntee had examined the United States Army he would have discovered that though it is a small professional army, it is not scattered all over the country.  It is not organised on a parochial basis.  It is concentrated and it has technical schools which are very efficient indeed. The same is true of the Canadian Defence Forces.  I do not think there is much more that I can say in answer to Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points in the Estimates to which I would like to refer.  There is a substantial amount for warlike stores directed to the purchase of guns and carriages.  I take it <Col N="988" /> the intention is to re-arm the artillery. Certainly the guns with which they are now provided are of a type which were introduced about twenty years ago and I thing re-arming is justified.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether a certain percentage of howitzers would not be desirable.  In a mountainous country a howitzer is far more useful than a field gun, if you want to hit a man on the other side of a hill.  I do hope that we shall not have to hit anybody on the side of an Irish hill, because I came back from Gallipoli hoping that I would never see in an Irish boreen the horrors and awful sights that I saw there, but if our artillery is to be re-armed it should be re-armed properly.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I would like to refer is the fact that the Minister has provided under Sub-head Y (3) for the establishment of an Officers' Training Corps.  I think that is a very sound provision.  I have urged before that we should give students of our Universities, who remain in the country, an opportunity of military training so that if the necessity should arise&mdash;and I hope very keenly that it will not&mdash;to extend our defence forces we could bring in officers who have already had a certain amount of training. These two points, combined with the general reduction in the Estimate, seem to me of some value.  I think that the Minister will have no difficulty in showing us that our defence forces are both efficient and economical.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper seems to give some hope for the future of this country if one had not, unfortunately, to realise what is at the back of all this&mdash;in other words, where all this money is to come from.  If the Government expect to set out one of these days to conquer some unknown island, or that the people of some other nation will come and invade our country, this would be perfectly reasonable, but to me, and I am quite sure to every farmer in this House and in Ireland, this position is not understandable. You have an Estimate here for £2,000,000.  That £2,000,000 will come out of the farmers' pockets.  That community, that is, the backbone of the nation, is, however, in the position of <Col N="989" /> selling its produce at less money each year.  In other words, those people are told to produce more, and if they obey and produce more, they find they get less for what they produce through having to pay more in produce for the necessities of life.  I may be accounted a materialist, but I see no hopes of this nation with a huge army.  Whatever chance we have is, I should think, in the small parochial army that does not suit the taste of Deputy Cooper.  I think we have to cut our cloth according to our measure.  We are really up against this position.  It is no use in trying to persuade ourselves or to persuade the world that we can do any more.  We cannot.  We are simply portion of a very poor island, emerging perhaps from a state of persecution unprecedented in the history of the world.  I do not think, if you examine the history of the world, that you will find a nation that has suffered more and that has been systematically deprived, of its wealth like this nation has.  I think there is poor hope and little confidence given to the agricultural community to develop itself, to have any enthusiasm or any hope for the future while we, a little nation, carry on such talk as we have heard here to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this were a vote for productive measures, I for one would certainly be enthusiastically for it.  But I see no production from this, any more than it is, to a certain extent, a relief of unemployment. If there is one thing that destroyed us as a nation it is that method of relieving unemployment. They started these unfortunate subsidies&mdash;this is simply a subsidy&mdash;as far back as the years of the famine, and since then we have gradually become demoralised.  If we wanted an army to-morrow I am quite sure that the people of the country are capable at any moment of defending themselves voluntarily.  They have had to do it before, and if there is any necessity in the future they will do it again.  I admit that you have the nucleus, if you have a small army, of a larger army, or of some form of conscription.  That may be necessary, but such a huge expenditure as this, in the teeth of what the producers of the nation are faced <Col N="990" /> with to-day, is not a thing to which any individual who represents the community or industry that I represent can agree.</P>

      <P>Although I am not a soldier, I am a lay citizen, and entitled to ask of a certain number of lay citizens what exactly a national defence force is supposed to do.  We see here in the Estimate: payment of officers, £290,256; payment of men £510,732; total estimate, £1,804,000.  Is that expenditure justified?  Let us look at it from a practical common-sense point of view?  Who would this army, that we propose spending close on two millions on, defend us from?  Who could it protect us from?  What exactly could it do against an invading force? What could it do against an aerial attack?  Could we defend Dublin from an air raid?  In 1924 one would expect that the Army, after emerging from a civil war, and having had a certain amount of practice, would have learned a good deal.  As I said, I am not an authority on military matters and do not want to pose as one, but I want to quote from a speech of Deputy Esmonde with regard to the Army delivered on 15th July, 1924. The Deputy was good enough when I spoke about the Army on another occasion to say that in any other normal country I would be tried for high treason.  I will venture to make the same remarks to-day and run the risk of being tried for high treason.  This is <Col N="991" /> what Deputy Esmonde said regarding the Army:</P>
      <P>The President is Commander-in-Chief and Minister for Defence, but I doubt if he can defend Dalkey Island against invasion.  How many guns has he got?  I am informed that we have only four guns which are capable of going off at all.</P>
      <P>After many sentences of characteristic irrelevant matter he said:</P>
      <P>I doubt if the President could, inside Ireland, defend the Capital or could hold the line of the Boyne.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether these things could be done, but if we are to expend £1,804,000 on an Army we want to know what exactly they are capable of doing, and whether they are capable of doing these things that Deputy Esmonde said they were not capable of doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another, and to my mind a greater danger, attached to the existence of this National Army.  I am rather inclined to think that it is a national menace.  There are in this country certain posts and ports held by a foreign State.  It would be a perfectly justifiable act of war for any foreign country at war with England to try and seize these.  If our defence force is to seek to repel a foreign force, like Germany, France, America, or any other country, that seeks to take these posts or ports, we then go into the mess of the war&mdash;we go right into the whirlpool. We are going to be open to attack as a country participating in the war and we are going to be put into the position of Belgium in the Great war. I am sure nobody wants to see that, but it is a matter that should be considered. In the event of war, say, with America &mdash;which we hope is very far distant and which some strategists tell us is absolutely unthinkable&mdash;is it contended that if an American force tried to land in this country and take over posts and ports that are the property of the country they may be at war with, we are to repel them and get ourselves exposed in this open country to air and naval attacks and such things?  I would have thought that the Minister would have told us something on this <Col N="992" /> matter.  What is exactly the use of the Army?  Why is the taxpayer paying, not alone for officers and soldiers, but for barracks, equipment, transport, and all the other paraphernalia that goes with the maintenance of an army?  One would expect from the Minister a justification of why he asks the taxpayer to foot a bill of close on two million pounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankKerlin" hpid="Mr. KERLIN Mr. KERLIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KERLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy MacEntee in opposing this Vote. This Party has already expressed their opposition to the entire Army Vote and we oppose this particular balance of £500,000 all the more because the sum of, I think, £1,300,000 has already been voted for Army expenditure.  That sum, in our opinion, is more than ample for the purpose.  We have not put down an amendment to reduce the Vote by any particular sum, as we consider that by refusing this particular Vote it will be in the nature of carrying an amendment to reduce the total vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask all Deputies in the House who on previous occasions advocated a reduction in Army expenditure to avail of this oportunity to vote against this particular balance and to bring the expenditure down to what it should be. This particular balance to our mind represents the difference between what should be the maximum expenditure on the defence forces of the country and what should not.  Under the present system the Army is too large and too costly and it imposes unnecessary burdens on the taxpayer.  Admittedly, and we have had some information from the Minister for Defence this evening which we had not got before, reductions are being made.  But I submit that the reductions which have been made during the past couple of years are not the reductions which are required and are not the reductions which are urgently necessary.  At the present moment while the finances of the country are in an unexceptionally bad way&mdash;and I do not think anybody knows that better than the Government because they are finding it pretty hard to get money&mdash;we think that the cost of the defence force should be reduced to the absolute minimum. I do not necessarily mean that the effective strength of those defence forces should suffer as can be very <Col N="993" /> easily demonstrated in fact by the formation of a suitable territorial force. At present the Army is one of the most expensive establishments in the State and as Deputy Hogan has pointed out it has very little value as a national asset.  What purpose is it for?  What can it do at present?  As the Deputy said if this country were attacked to-morrow by any big European power equipped with all the latest methods of warfare what effective resistance could the present Army offer to such invasion?</P>
    <P>The more this problem of defence is studied the clearer it becomes that the present type of Army is not suited to the needs of this country.  What we want is a very small permanent force and a large territorial force.  The Minister has more or less indicated in the debate on the Defence Forces Bill that his point of view on this matter was more or less in accord with ours.  In many particulars there is a very big difference.  This matter was discussed to some extent on the Defence Forces Bill and the Minister indicated then, and he gave further information now, that he was proceeding with the formation of a reserve and he said, I think last November, that they would proceed with the formation of a territorial force in the almost immediate future.  Twelve months have elapsed since he made that statement and as he stated this evening the formation of that territorial force is still in the future&mdash;I suppose in the almost immediate future.  He said at that time there was certain considerations which made it impossible for the Government to consider bringing that territorial force into being as quickly as they would like.  Perhaps the Minister would be more explicit in that matter during the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>As far as the reserve is concerned, I see from the Estimates, and from what the Minister has said on this matter, that he is proceeding with the formation of this reserve.  I have examined the regulations which have been issued by his Department in connection with the reserve, and to my mind at least the proposed system is modelled on the British reserve system. The reservists are attached to their <Col N="994" /> original units, and in time of mobilisation they must report back to those original units, no matter where they are located.  The Minister spoke of Class A and Class B reservists.  It was apparently intended in the case of Class B to enlist men for combined army and Class B reserve service.  They would serve a period not exceeding three months in the Army and they would then be transferred to the B reserve.</P>
    <P>Apparently from these regulations it is the intention of the Minister to build up a large reserve.  In our opinion he should concentrate his attention more upon building up immediately and not in the almost immediate future a suitable and adequate territorial force.</P>
    <P>There is another point in connection with these regulations which I think it well to touch upon.  I see that a local brigade commander or G.O.C. &ldquo;on receipt of a written requisition from the District Justice shall mobilise the Army and equip the whole or such portion of the reserve, resident in his area, as he considers the exigencies of the situation require.&rdquo;  I do not think that that is necessary in any reserve system or in any army system.  It really amounts, in my opinion, to making this reserve an auxiliary police force.  What purpose could exist that a District Justice should be able to mobilise the local reserve and give them work to do.  Perhaps that matter may commend itself to the Labour Party for consideration.  Perhaps it might be in an instance of labour trouble or strikes, or so on.  Surely the police force is large and capable enough in the Government's opinion to deal with such a situation.  I do not think there should be any such provision as this in regulations that govern the formation of a reserve.</P>
    <P>There is another important point: the question of the paid reserve.  From the regulations this is apparently the policy of the Government.  They are establishing a paid reserve, and apparently from the particulars here in contion with the Class B reservists they intend to establish a large paid reserve. The Minister did not give any definite figures as to the ultimate size of the reserve.  I also see that there is provision <Col N="995" /> made for a reserve of officers, which consists of officers who are retired from the force and are liable to be recalled for service in the force. These officers of the reserve will be liable to be called up for permanent service, for temporary service in aid of the civil power, and for annual training not exceeding 30 days in any one year.  Again, these officers are to get an annual grant varying from £50 in the case of junior officers to £85 in the case of senior officers per annum for a maximum of 30 days' training.</P>
    <P>During that period of thirty days' training I understand these officers will also get their usual daily pay and allowances.  In fact, I even see provision is made in these regulations, if in any year it is ordered that no training of the reserve officers shall take place, officers of the reserve shall receive the above grants.  I consider these rates of remuneration are altogether excessive. There should be no necessity for them at all.  This system of paying the officers, N.C.O.s and men of a large reserve is to my mind just a continuation of the Government's policy of enlisting paid support.  They are simply buying the support of these men just the same way as they have obtained the support of the large number of Army Service pensioners they have throughout the country.  They are creating what really amounts to certain vested interests, and they will make it more and more difficult for a succeeding Government to alter that state of affairs, because obviously these people will oppose any future Government, perhaps even to the extent of opposing them by force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KERLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says no, but he does not know what may happen. They may, as I say, oppose them to the extent of force simply to maintain their own position and prevent a different system from coming into operation under which they would lose their benefits.  We suggest there should be no reserve of this kind at all.  The Minister can have a permanent force, consisting simply of training and maintaining troops and a territorial force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> Of course, Deputy Cooper has just decried the merits of a parochial force, as a real territorial force should be.  It should be organised in districts under local officers, of course supervised by officers from headquarters.  But Deputy Cooper forgets he would not be sitting here this evening if it were not for a parochial army.  As far as a reserve of officers are concerned, we suggest there should be only a small reserve of officers who would assist in the annual training of members of the territorial force.  Apparently what is intended here in the suggested reserve is merely an extension of the present system, and we know, as Deputy MacEntee pointed out, what the purpose of that Army was, as expressed by the present Minister for Defence.  According to the quotation which Deputy MacEntee read out, the Army was to be used as an auxiliary force for the British Army in the event of what the Minister described as a general attack on these islands.  That particular quotation has been referred to and quoted so often&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankKerlin" hpid="Mr. KERLIN Mr. KERLIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KERLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid he does in this case.  In case the Minister thinks that quotation is the only one we can find I can give him one or two others. Mr. Hughes, who was Minister for Defence in 1927, speaking on the 17th February, 1927, and referring to the previous statement by the now Minister for Defence, who was then Minister for External Affairs, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I stand by what the Minister for External Affairs said, the actual statement he made.  It is quite correct as far as this island is concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> Again, the present Minister for Defence, speaking on the same day and on the same matter, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not conceive it is at all likely that our Army would be engaged in warfare without Great Britain.  She is our nearest neighbour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When we take those statements of responsible Ministers, as these Ministers are supposed to be, in conjunction with the statement that we had here early in the year from the Minister for Finance, that famous, or rather should I say infamous declaration of loyalty to the British Empire&mdash;a declaration of satisfaction with our present status and a declaration that his Party intended to take no further steps in the matter of attaining complete freedom for this country&mdash;what conclusion can we come to?  The conclusion is fairly obvious, that this Army and the proposed extension of it, as far as this reserve is concerned, is just for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>This Party considers it of vital importance in this question of national and imperial defence that there should be no doubt whatsoever as to where the Government stands.  We want the Government's policy made absolutely clear to the man in the street so that he can know exactly where we are going and what is being intended.  Perhaps the Minister for Defence, when replying to the criticisms in this debate, would refer to this question of policy again and let us know definitely where we stand.  There was a point which occurred to me in connection with the Imperial Conference, which was held, I think, in 1926.  I was wondering what secret assurances, if any, were given at that Imperial Conference in the matter of imperial defence.  I read over the published Report of that Conference, but there was nothing to be learned from that Report of the special discussions which took place on imperial defence. I learned nothing from that Report of any special contributions of the representatives of the Free State to such discussions.  I think these representatives included military officers. Does the present Minister for Defence, as we may expect from his previous statement, base his whole army outlook, <Col N="998" /> his present army policy, on the principles of co-operation and consultation laid down at that Imperial Conference?</P>
    <P>Is the present defence policy based on the scheme which was hatched out at that Imperial Conference, the scheme under which, as the Report stated, &ldquo;organisation, training and equipment of the available forces of the British Empire should be standardised so as to become interchangeable&rdquo;? Apparently from the Minister's statements and from the regulations in connection with this reserve he is following that plan which was outlined there.  We cannot but conclude that in this matter of national defence, as well as in economic and financial matters, the interests of the British Empire are becoming the primary consideration of the Government.  It is not what system suits the best interest or needs of this country, but what will suit the people on the other side.  As I have said, the present army system, including the formation of this reserve, follows too closely the British system.  I suppose the fact that the members of the Army have been supplied with steel helmets is just another step in the Imperial defence plan.  When we had Deputy Cooper referring to big guns and howitzers, I suppose that is the kind of army he thinks of.  That is not the type of army we have in mind at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee referred to another important aspect of this defence problem.  That was the question of the provision of warlike material. Deputy Aiken asked a question last November in connection with this matter. He asked the Minister for Defence to state what steps he had taken or intended to take under the powers conferred upon him by Section 29, subsection (b) of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, to establish factories in the Saorstát for the manufacture of arms and ammunition. The Minister replied: &ldquo;The question of the manufacture of ammunition within the Saorstát has been under consideration.  No decision has yet been taken in the matter.  The question of the manufacture of arms <Col N="999" /> has not yet been explored.&rdquo;  Perhaps the Minister when replying will inform the House what further steps he has taken in this matter, and how far this question of the manufacture of arms and ammunition has advanced since last November.  This, in our opinion, is a matter which should receive very earnest consideration.  Of course, the present Government are not worrying on that score.  All their supplies, as happened before, will be forthcoming from the British Government. Their neglect of this important matter is a natural corollary to their Imperial defence policy.  We are at present dependent for all our military supplies on Great Britain.  That is a state of affairs which should be changed.  I think the present Government should make some effort to change it without delay.  I think that practically every important country in the world manufactures all, or the major portion, of their own military supplies, and I think that we should aim at doing something to provide our own arms and ammunition, at least ammunition for a start.  Of course, as I have said, the Minister and his Government will depend for their supplies on the British Government.  That is if we are to rely on what he has said about the present Army never being likely to be opposed to the British Empire.  He said that it was inconceivable that our Army should ever be opposed to the British Empire.</P>

      <P>Our conception of what an Irish army should be is fundamentally opposed to that of the Minister for Defence.  We want in this country an adequate and efficient army to protect us against outside aggression, and, as I have said, in particular against the aggression of that power which has interfered with our rights and liberties in the past and which will have no hesitation whatsoever in interfering with those rights and liberties in the future if her own interests suggest it.  If we are to advance any further along the road to complete independence, we will have to get rid of the intermediate barriers, one by one.  That is only going to be done by a strong national Government, supported by an adequate and efficient army, such as a territorial force can produce.  I suppose the present Government has left all thoughts of making any advance behind.  What about the protestations of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in 1922?  Where is the stepping stone idea gone to?  What about the freedom to achieve freedom theory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently these things have been cast aside, and we have the policy as expressed by the Minister for Finance early in the year.  Of course, under those circumstances I can easily see why the Government is satisfied with <Col N="1001" /> the present type of Army.  They do not intend to move any further because they are quite satisfied.  I suppose it is too much to hope for that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, or at least a section of it&mdash;for I am afraid that some of its members are beyond redemption &mdash;will see the error of their ways on this question and will come back into alignment with the forces in this country that are striving for complete independence. Especially on this question of national defence we want a unified national outlook if we are to make any real progress, and to my mind the formation of a suitable territorial army would be an important factor and would help very considerably in bringing about such a unified national outlook.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee suggested to the Minister the principle that every able-bodied man should be liable for service in a time of need, and I think the Minister nodded his acceptance of the suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankKerlin" hpid="Mr. KERLIN Mr. KERLIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KERLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an article in the current number of &ldquo;An tOglach,&rdquo; the Army Journal, which deals with this question of military systems.  Referring to those countries which have adopted territorial systems and territorial systems which are, in most cases, based upon compulsory liability for service, there are one or two paragraphs which perhaps it might be profitable to read to the Minister and to those Deputies who have given the matter any consideration.  Referring to countries in which territorial systems, based on compulsory service, are in existence, the writer says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those countries, service is not considered as a burden, but rather as a privilege whereof no self-respecting man would willingly be deprived. The Army is not divorced from the people, but is an integral part of their social life, a part to which they are all related or linked by ties of one kind or another.  Every male citizen looks on the soldier as a fellow worker in the life of the nation, as a prospective comrade in arms, a &ldquo;pal&rdquo; in every sense of the <Col N="1002" /> word.  Just consider what a tremendous asset this fusion of the military and national life is to morale, esprit de corps and sense of duty.  In nations, where national service in a military capacity is considered a citizen's prerogative, where none is excluded save he who is physically or mentally defective or those who have become criminal outlaws and from whom the higher privileges of citizenship have been withdrawn, compulsory service, or what we loosely term conscription, holds no horrors.</P>
    <P>Again in another portion of the article he says:</P>
    <P>The best manhood of the State is trained and made available for war. From the financial viewpoint it is contended that for a given expenditure at least three times as many men can be kept under arms by the compulsory system as under any known &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; system.  The available reserve is, as a consequence, of far greater magnitude than any reserve that is based on a &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; system.  Additional advantages are: increased cohesion between the Army and the civil population; the Army includes all classes (not one or two classes); the national life is strengthened to a considerable extent; there is less danger of internal disunion. Military training adds more years of usefulness to the end of a man's life than are taken off at the beginning. Military training inculcates principles of organisation, cohesion and discipline which are invaluable assets in the industrial and business life of the State.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has read this article or not, but I would recommend it to him for his consideration. Of course, the question of compulsory liability for military service is a different one altogether, and is one which should be discussed at another time.  But you could have a territorial force, based mainly on a voluntary system, and perhaps you could even go as far as adopting the system-that they have in South Africa, where, if they are unable to get voluntarily the number of recruits they require every year, they have a ballot by districts for the <Col N="1003" /> remainder.  I pointed out some of the advantages of the territorial system which were given in that article.  The Army under such a system would really become part of the life of the nation, and it would undoubtedly obtain the support of every class and section in the community.  But apparently the Government is not tackling that problem in the right way.  They are merely, as I have said, extending the present system, and we know already what the purpose of that system is.</P>
    <P>Together with the establishment of a suitable territorial force, I would suggest that attention should be directed to the preparatory training of the youth of the country.  The necessary preparatory training could be given through the medium of cadet corps, boy scout organisations, gymnastic clubs, and even school organisations. Such a system would work in well with a territorial force, because those who have acquired a certain proficiency in physical and in preparatory military training through the medium of such organisations would have to serve only a small period of training in the territorial force; if they acquired a certain proficiency between the ages of fourteen and eighteen it would lessen their period of training with the territorial force, and prevent any serious interference with the ordinary life of the country.  I noted from some articles in connection with this matter that over 90 per cent. of the recruits that are annually called up in Switzerland for training have already passed proficiency tests in training, musketry practice and so on.</P>
    <P>In connection with a territorial system it may not be out of place to look at the system in other countries. Deputy MacEntee referred to Switzerland, and I think he brought Deputy Cooper down on his head as a result. Taking Great Britain as an example, I will look at their territorial system. They have a permanent staff, exclusive of headquarters, administrative staff, which amounts to 1,800, and if we are to add 1,200 as an outside figure for the headquarters and administrative <Col N="1004" /> staff, it would give a permanent force of 3,000.  They have a permanent force of 3,000, and they have a territorial force amounting to 180,000.  The cost of the officers, N.C.O.s, and so on, of the permanent staff amounted to, roughly, £563,000, and the cost of training, conveyance and other miscellaneous expenses of the territorial force amounted to £1,116,000.  Adding those sums together it will be seen that the cost per man per annum for training amounts to £12.  In Australia they have a permanent force of just 2,000, and they have a territorial force of 45,000, and this force of 45,000 represents only one in every eighteen of the total males between the ages of 18 and 35, which is the best period for military service.  The total cost of their military forces amounts only to £1,041,000.</P>

      <P>We are merely dealing with the Army.  I am not talking about a navy at all.  In addition to that £1,041,000 they give a grant of £50,000 to rifle associations.  Canada has a permanent force of 3,400 and a territorial force amounting to 127,500. Their cost, according to the latest figures I could obtain, is £2,400,000, and working it out we find that the cost per head per annum of each effective is roughly £8.  New Zealand has a permanent force of 500 and a territorial force of 22,000, and their total cost is less than half a million.  Denmark has a permanent force of 1,100, and they have a special reserve of about the same number of officers and N.C.O.s, for training purposes only. They have an effective strength, I think, under war conditions of 100,000, and their cost amounts to only £1,383,000.  So on with Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.  I just give these figures to show that it is quite possible to have a large and effective territorial army for a comparatively small sum, for instance, well under the <Col N="1005" /> figure which the Minister for Finance suggested&mdash;£1,500,000.  I think that, in fact, such a force could be maintained under a million and a quarter, allowing for extra expenditure on the manufacture of arms and ammunition, and on grants to gymnastic clubs and organisations for the training of the youth of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Defence spoke of 5,000 as the figure he would aim at as a standing army.  Considering the figures I have read out we think we could do with a permanent force of, say, 3,000, and that force would include the various technical corps, some maintenance troops, and a corps of instructors.  As far as the territorial system is concerned we would suggest that, say, 5,000 recruits be brought up annually for training, that the average period of training would be 60 days for the first year, and ten days for the second and third years.  During that three years the men would be considered first line troops, and then, say, after a period of nine years had passed, second line troops, during which period they could be called up every third year for an additional ten days' training. After that they would pass on to the reserve where they would give merely nominal service.  That is just a rough idea of what we were thinking would be the most suitable system for this country.  Of course the best possible system could be hammered out, but it would be necessary to have certain facts which are now, perhaps, in the possession of the Minister and his staff.  We suggest that such a system would be most suitable, and I made certain calculations of the cost which I will offer.  Taking sixty days' training in the first year as the most suitable period, I consider that the actual cost of each recruit would be, to give a maximum figure, say, £40.  In connection with that I took some figures from this year's Estimates dealing with the training and maintenance of the present &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; reserves.  Leaving out the question of the reserve pay under class &ldquo;A&rdquo; the annual cost per head for fourteen days training would only be £3 17s. 6d., and in the case of &ldquo;B&rdquo; reserve the annual cost per head, excluding the special grant of £3, over <Col N="1006" /> a period of 30 days training, is only £6 6s. 0d.</P>
    <P>From the various figures which I gave a few minutes ago in connection with the territorial system of other countries, the annual cost per head for training did not, I think, amount to more than £8 or £10.  I was including in the figure I used pay and allowances during the period of training.  I also included the cost of conveyance, provisions, insurance, the cost of general administration and of instructors and of the maintenance of the training camp.  I put all that at the outside figure of, say, £40.  For the period of refresher training, the ten days' period in the second and third year, I calculated that the cost would be, giving the outside figure again, £10.  It is obvious that in the first year, with 5,000 recruits, the cost would be £200,000.  In the second year, with 5,000 men, first-line troops, the cost would be a quarter of a million, and so on.  I calculated the cost in each year as the system changes.  I make out that the maximum cost at the end of, say, the twelfth year would be £450,000.  The cost in the first year would be £200,000, and the maximum cost would be £450,000 at the end of the twelfth year.  You would have, in fact, 60,000 men trained.  As well as that, you would have your permanent force of 3,000. That was what I estimated would be the maximum cost of a territorial force of that description.  Then, of course, you have the permanent force, and we suggest its figure should not exceed 3,000.</P>
    <P>If we were to base the cost of such a permanent force of 3,000 on the figure supplied in the present Estimate for an army of, I think, 10,500, the cost, working it out and allowing even a greater percentage on account of the increased overhead charges, should not exceed £600,000.  Deputy MacEntee suggested three-quarters of a million, but I think it could be kept even lower than that. If you add to that the £450,000 which would be the maximum cost of the territorial force, you have the result that the cost of your entire Army would be £1,050,000.  In addition to that, under an ideal system, there would be certain grants for cadet corps <Col N="1007" /> and organisations for the training of the youth of the country.  There would be grants, too, for the manufacture of arms and ammunitions at home, and for the building of gymnasiums throughout the country and the encouragement of gymnastic clubs.  That figure, we think, would be more than ample for the requirements of a suitable defence force in this country.  I will ask those Deputies who on previous occasions expressed their opposition to excessive Army expenditure, and advocated reductions to this figure of one and a quarter millions, to vote against this balance of £500,000 which the Minister for Defence now requests the House to pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a good deal of confusion of thought running through the whole of this debate.  Having listened very attentively to most, if not all, the speakers on this Estimate during the evening, I am forced to one conclusion&mdash;I commend this more particularly to those who may be induced to comment on the lack of speakers up to now from the Labour side of the House&mdash;that they should carefully examine the speeches delivered by the Labour Party in former Dáils.  If they did so, they would at least learn to make some sort of constructive criticism on the Estimate now before the House.  I am not in the habit of throwing bouquets at any member of the Government Party or at any Member on the Government side.  But I think we should at least recognise that something has been attempted and something done.  The fact that the strength of the Army has been reduced from 50,000 roughly to 8,000 odd is evidence of the economy axe being at work.  It is also evidence, perhaps, that we are approaching something like normality in this country. I am one of those who believe that just as much credit is due to the ordinary citizen of the country as is due to the Minister for Defence and those associated with him in bringing about that reduction in the armed forces of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We again have had evidence of the military-minded person in this House. On the one hand, we have the Minister <Col N="1008" /> for Defence making an honest effort to reduce the armed forces in the country, and, on the other side of the House, from amongst the official Opposition, people who advocate conscription, not alone conscription, but the very worst form of conscription that exists in any country, namely, the conscripting of our young boys into forces such as the Scouts and other training grounds to afford an outlet for the military instinct in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KERLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation.

Deputy Anthony is taking up what I said quite wrongly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want this royal fusee to be interrupting me.  I said there was confusion of thought. If any Deputy wishes to criticise my statement, he can do so without unnecessary interruption.  I am not a military-minded person.  While Deputy Kerlin says that I have ministerpreted him and that he did not mean all he said, I want to know from him, why then did he quote at such great length from the various documents dealing with territorial forces, standing <Col N="1009" /> armies and all the other paraphernalia of war?  Again we have heard what appears to me to be an obsession with many people in this House.  We have heard about British policy and British influence as if there were no Irish-minded people in the House except certain Deputies who proclaim that they have absorbed in themselves all the patriotism that is left in the country.  I reject that idea and so does every decent Irishman.  Patriotism is not the prerogative of a few people in the official Opposition to-day. On occasions in this House the Labour Party have opposed abnormal votes on account of military expenditure, and we would do the same again if we thought it essential or necessary.  But there is the fact that the Army has been reduced from 50,000 to 8,000, and Deputies should bear that in mind when criticising this Vote.  We have heard of the advantages that might accrue to this country by adopting instead of our present military system a sort of glorified militia system.  Anyone of us who is old enough to remember the old militia corps in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and perhaps some of those opposite were members of that distinguished corps.  Some of us will remember even British Ministers declared that that militia system was most expensive.  That should be borne in mind when we are criticising a measure of this kind.  I am not so sure that the territorial system would be the best for this country.  Knowing what I do about some countries in which militarism is a strong feature, I am not sure that the fact of getting the youth of our country into training centres for two or three or four weeks at a time that you might turn out some amateur soldiers, though you have enough of them, God knows, in this House, would have the beneficial effect some people seem to think.  Some people talked about reducing the Army, and we were asked in the next breath for something that will correspond in expense with that standing Army.  Personally, I would like to see all standing armies abolished.  I think <Col N="1010" /> they are a menace to the peace of this or any other country.  I am not one of those who would perpetuate a system that would be a curse to this country, as it has been to other countries.  I would rather direct my attention to the constructive side of the Vote, and throw a bouquet to the Minister for being able to reduce the expenditure and personnel of the Army, but while the Army is there there are a few things I would like to see done.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it may be suggested that I am going from the sublime to the ridiculous when I come from war to ordinary matters.  There is the probability that in any hastily conceived scheme of reducing the Army you may throw on the unemployed market an abnormal number of physically fit young men who would be unable to secure other employment.  For that reason I suggest to the Minister that when bringing in his next estimate he should provide by a system of deferred pay&mdash;a system that obtains in other armies&mdash;a sufficient sum of money to enable the demobilised soldiers to live in some sort of frugal comfort for six or seven months, or until such time as they are enabled to secure suitable employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I would like to have discussed is the new rule to the effect that Army officers must not appear in mufti except by the special permission of their superior officers.  That, in time, will entail expense on young officers, and it may mean that you are going to close the door so far as officers are concerned, to the poor man, and establish a class in the National Army which, in my opinion, is of no use to the Army.  As one of Napoleon's officers said, the private soldier may have a Marshal's baton in his knapsack.  So far as these officers are concerned, I understand much of their clothing is manufactured abroad.  That is a point, I think, we should lay some emphasis on.  We preach a lot here and outside about the necessity of encouraging Irish industries.  Yet I am informed that much of the wearing apparel of the officers is manufactured abroad.  What is the reason?  I think any member of this House who dresses in Irish <Col N="1011" /> material is as good as any officer you could get in the Army.  I do not think they are drawn from such an exclusive class that they should go to the West of England for their riding breeches, and articles like that.</P>
    <P>Let us talk in peace even though we are discussing matters of war, and discuss it from that angle and not be multiplying armies.  We have heard of territorial armies, boy scouts and all that, and I was coming around to the opinion that we were beginning to forget about petrol cans, dynamite, gelignite and the rest.  Let us talk about things that matter to the ordinary citizens.  One thing concrete has been done, and that is, the reduction of the Army, with a consequent reduction in expenditure.  Suggestions have been made as to the way other reductions could be brought about.  There is something tangible in that.  I submit, with all due respect to the military-minded persons, to those who claim for themselves all the patriotism and the rest of it, that they might commence to discuss now in a useful way how we are not alone to further reduce the Army, but to see that when the men are disbanded provision will be made for them.  We ought to have a system of deferred pay, bounty or bonus, so that these men when disbanded will not be sent to swell the ranks of the unemployed, which, we all know, are large enough already.  I throw out the hint that we would be doing something constructive if we were to discuss the subject along these lines, and although it is a matter dealing with a warlike question, let us discuss it in terms of peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CARNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have his little joke.  In speaking on this particular matter of the Army, and as Deputy Anthony says of war, few like to speak about it less than some of us do, because there is no sane man who likes war for the sake of war.  At least, I do not think he is sane if he likes it; but at the same time, seeing that necessity exists at present for armies, and that we are not living in an Arcadia of our own making, we have to adapt ourselves to the circumstances under which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one particular point that Deputy Anthony seems to have forgotten, and it is that we cannot afford to talk about the total abolition of armies as far as this country is concerned until such time as we are free; and even then it is questionable if the thing can be taken on.  We are accused of talking generalities, that we do not come down to facts and give concrete examples of where money might be saved in this Department.  When there are concrete examples given they are ignored on all occasions.  I see here in a book called &ldquo;Appropriation Accounts&rdquo; a lot of little matters and I wonder are those items going to be repeated.  I wonder if the money that we are now voting&mdash;at least, that some people in this House are now about to vote&mdash;is going to be used in the same way as the money has been used in the past. There is one item here and upon that item there are certain comments by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I wonder if that item is going to be repeated in the financial year 1928-29. Here are the comments: &ldquo;Flying pay at the rate of 4s. a day was issued to an officer who acted as wireless instructor with the Army Air Corps.  Army aeroplanes do not appear to have been equipped with wireless apparatus during 1926-27, and as no provision is made in existing regulations for payments of this kind, I have asked the Accounting Officer for an explanation of the charge.&rdquo;  Now there is a wonderful state of affairs.  I presume that is extra pay, what Deputy Cooper would call proficiency pay, for the art of teaching others how to use a wireless apparatus on aeroplanes.  The funny part of it is that there was no such <Col N="1013" /> thing as wireless apparatus on aeroplanes belonging to the Free State Army.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor-General further said: &ldquo;I observed that an officer who was on leave without pay from the 10th December, 1926, and who resigned in the following year, continued to receive his usual pay for the period up to the 31st March, 1927.&rdquo; It is an extraordinary state of affairs that an officer who had already resigned continued to draw his usual pay for months after he had ceased to be a member of the Army.  Again, we have this comment under Sub-head J&mdash; Mechanical Transport:&mdash;&ldquo;A claim was made by two officers for recoupment of expenditure incurred by them on repairs to a car which had been captured in 1922.  The use of the car on military duty had rendered repairs necessary. Subsequently the car, of which the ownership had not been ascertained, became derelict, and though it was stated that the officers were willing to accept the sum realised by its sale in settlement of their claim a payment of £38 3s. 11d. was made to them.  The car was taken on army charge and disposed of for a sum of £9.&rdquo;  It is definitely stated there that the officers were prepared to accept the sum of £9 which was realised for the car in lieu of their claim and £38 was the sum actually paid to them for the car.  If it had been their own car it would be a different matter, but it was one of those mysterious cars captured in 1922. I suppose it was blamed on the Republicans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CARNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Yea, a Daniel come to judgment!&rdquo; Here is another item under Sub-head M&mdash;Clothing and Equipment&mdash;&ldquo;Although officers are in receipt of uniform allowances, a payment of £95 12s. 0d. was made for <Col N="1014" /> specimen mess uniforms which were ordered without the prior authority of the Department of Finance.  On inquiry I was informed that it is not proposed to dispose of these specimen uniforms.  They have been taken on store charge.&rdquo;  As Deputy Cooper will be one of the first to admit, in the ordinary clothing and equipment department of the Army they receive free, gratis and for nothing, I understand, specimens of the equipment with which it is proposed to supply the Army; that is, regulation uniform or equipment.  Those things are not paid for.  They are advertised, and if a man supplies or thinks he can supply a uniform he sends in a specimen of that uniform.  He does not want to be paid for it; he is looking for an order. But this is quite a different thing altogether. It is even worse because those officers were entitled to get specimens of their own uniforms.  They were paid for supplying their own uniforms and they should have got the specimens. Still, the money had to go out of the Vote and the uniforms are still lying, I presume, in the stores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have another little item, and this comes under Sub-head N&mdash;Animals and Forage&mdash;&ldquo;A number of horses, the private property of officers who, it was stated, were not entitled to be mounted, were foraged at the public expense, and forage was drawn for more than one horse by some officers who were entitled to be mounted.  Departmental action is being taken in this matter, and refunds of the cost of forage have been secured in some instances. There are no regulations which permit an officer not entitled to be mounted to have a privately-owned horse stabled in military quarters.&rdquo; Here was a home of rest for officers' horses at the public expense.  An officer who was not entitled to be mounted could have his horses stabled in the Army stables and fed at the people's expense.  Here is another little item in the horsey line:&mdash;&ldquo;During 1926-27, 213 horses were purchased for the Army at a total cost of £8,717.  The purchases, which do not appear to have been effected on competitive lines, have all been made from a dealer whose name appears on an <Col N="1015" /> approved list submitted to the Department of Finance in June, 1925.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That may have been a perfectly honest deal on the part of the man whose name appeared on the list; I am not saying a word about that.  But there was no competition.  That is the fault I see in the matter.  He could, I presume, charge what he liked.  Further on in the report I see: &ldquo;Included in the charge to this sub-head is a sum of £1,165 expended on the purchase of six chargers suitable to compete in jumping events.&rdquo;  That is great. &ldquo;Two of these horses proved to be unsuitable as timber jumpers and were to be disposed of, at the opening of the hunting season in November, 1927. Another jumper to replace one of the two unsuitable horses was subsequently purchased from an Army officer for £250.&rdquo;  I suppose that horse had been fed at the public expense. That is, roughly, £194 per horse for six horses suitable for jumping and two of them were found to be crocks.</P>

      <P>Whether it costs £1,700 or £700 for chargers matters little in comparison with an item like that of £14,272 for maintenance, feeding, shoeing and stable necessaries, etc.  The point I want to make about this horse business is this.  On the broad question of the Army here and now, I and many others, including whoever it was who wrote that article in &ldquo;An tOglach&rdquo; that I glanced through the other day, seemed to think that the Army as at present constituted is not at all suitable to this country.  This is where the expense is coming in, making of the Army what I call a pocket edition of the British Army, and by no means as efficient numbers for numbers&mdash;not that the men might not be as good or better, but that the men are not equipped in the same way.  This is not a country at all for making a pocket <Col N="1018" /> edition of the British Army.  If we are going to depend on the Army for defensive purposes it must have been proved conclusively to anyone who has a knowledge of Army matters that the mass action manner in which the Army is being trained at present is not at all suitable for this country, that the most suitable method of warfare to be conducted by us for defensive purposes was the method that had been tried and perfected by de Wett in South Africa and by our own guerilla fighters here in Ireland.  Does the Minister or any other responsible person in this House mean to tell me that the Army as at present organised and equipped is going to be a defensive force in this country such as would prevent the descent on the country of a foreign enemy?  Does the Minister suggest that in a vulnerable country like this that is open on all sides to attack from the sea his force of 12,000 or even 50,000 men equipped as they are would be adequate to stop the invasion of our shores?  The Minister probably will say not.  Then I ask why make it a small edition of the British Army trained for mass action fighting when they will not be able to meet the enemy coming in on these shores?  Why does not the Minister have an alternative? He talks glibly about reducing the Army and forming a volunteer reserve.</P>
      <P>Yes, a volunteer reserve, a paid reserve.  For what purpose? Certainly not for the purpose of conducting a guerilla warfare in this country against an enemy whom we could not possibly stop from coming in.  Let us examine it.  It has been referred to already and, as a matter of fact, so often that the thing has become almost hackneyed.  One hates to talk about it.  In this country we are dependent on this so-called defensive force of 8,000 or 12,000 men which the Minister admits is going to form a branch of the British Army, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dependent solely and entirely on supplies of arms from England.  If we are at war with any other country &mdash;we do not want to fight any other country&mdash;and if any other country went to war with England, which mind you, is not outside the realms of <Col N="1019" /> possibility, because we saw what happened when there was a Peace Pact on the carpet and behind backs there was another secret agreement, these things might develop any time.  How do we know but at any time there might be an outbreak of war against England? England has her Treaty Ports here, and the natural thing for her to do would be to send her vessels into the Swilly or into Cobh.  We are faced then with the possibility of being embroiled in war not of our own making. What is the Minister going to do?  Is he going to co-operate with the British Army and allow this country to be made the cock-pit for all the countries of Europe?  That is what it will amount to.  Either a foreign enemy comes in and takes complete possession of us, or the British send their transports full of troops and make this country their stamping ground&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. CARNEY Mr. CARNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CARNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister propose?  What does the Minister mean by saying that this Army may form a branch of the British Army at some future time?  What would the Minister think if we were at war with a foreign country?  Supposing we were attacked and the English people came over to form an alliance with your Army, what would happen if we were surrounded by submarines and if your supplies of arms and munitions were cut off, where would we stand? Suppose, on the other hand&mdash;and this possibility will not be admitted by the people on the benches here&mdash;that England were at war with Ireland.  Does the Minister mean to tell us that fatherly John Bull is going to supply us with arms and munitions to be used against himself?  Not likely.  In this case with England it is a case of &ldquo;Heads I win, tails you lose.&rdquo;  Why, then, does the Minister try to make this Army a pocket edition of the English Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may ask for alternatives. We have given an alternative. Nobody knows better than we do that if we are at war with any superior country, at war with England, we cannot stop an invasion.  Only a fool would <Col N="1020" /> say that we could.  We cannot prevent the enemy coming in, but we can train our Army to be such an effective guerilla fighting machine as to make it impossible for an enemy to remain in the country.  We can use those small units, which have been sneered at by Deputy Cooper, to do what we did before, only in a more effective way.  We read in the Press about a Red and a Blue Army that go down to the coast, and we hear about the Blue Army invading Ireland and the Red Army stopping it.  I ask the Minister what country in the world, short of some petty South American Republic, and not even that, would be stopped by a Red or a Blue Army from invading us? We have given an alternative, namely, to reduce the standing Army to a minimum, to train effectively and maintain a staff of 3,000 to form a volunteer reserve.  That would not be a multiplication of armies in the sense that Deputy Anthony means.  It would be a multiplication of armies but not of expenditure.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is doing is expending the greatest possible amount of money for the least possible return. We want to spend the minimum amount of money with the maximum return.  There must come a time when it will be absolutely essential, if our demands are not met in an honest and open way, that they must be backed by force.  What I mean is, not by a Party, but by the State, or what is called the State.  We never could get anything for this country unless there was a foreign power behind us or armed resistance of some kind in the offing. That must develop again.  I hope it will not, but if we cannot succeed in getting the <i>ultima thule</i> of our demands, then our demands must be backed up by armed force, by an effective fighting machine that can be used if necessary.  Nobody deplores the necessity of having a fighting machine more than I, but it must be effective. We cannot afford to have cavalry charging all over the country.  Let the Minister cast his mind back to the time of the guerilla fight.  Of what use would cavalry be there?  What would the Minister think would happen in a guerilla war if they had big guns, <Col N="1021" /> which, according to Deputy Cooper, are 22 years old, and which were bought from the British Government?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper made one wise remark when he suggested that light howitzers should be used.  I can appreciate that, because that is the only type of light gun that we might have used at one time, and used effectively. The guns which we see parading, polished, and shining in the sun, would not be worth a snowball in hell to the Free State.  Here we have officers quartering their horses in Army stables at the public expense.  But even if they do not do that, let us take the cavalry as it is and admit, if you like, that in every country they have a certain number of horsemen for ceremonial purposes.  You can keep them if you like, but we say that you should wipe out the artillery, which has to be purchased from what is tantamount to an enemy country, artillery that can be stopped at any time, artillery for which we would not get one shell if it did not suit John Bull.  We say that the Minister should focus his mind on what is essential to the country.  Let the Minister not think so much of all the methods of training that we might learn from either England or America. Let him think rather of the lessons to be learned from the guerilla fighting in South Africa.  Let the Minister and his officers&mdash;and he has some capable officers&mdash;develop their own system of training on the lines which we adopted in this country during the Black-and-Tan struggle.  It was not perfect by any means.  In many cases it was most imperfect, but it met with a big measure of success.  If the Minister would only apply his mind, or get his officers to apply their minds, to developing a system of training along these lines he would get a most efficient and effective fighting machine by adopting the suggestions we put forward, and he would get it with a minimum of cost.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply, probably will tell us that all these arguments have been put forward so often that they have become hackneyed. No one, I am sure, in this House likes to repeat what he has already said, but if the Minister does not listen, there is no change in the case <Col N="1022" /> at all.  The case still exists, and if the arguments were true before, they are just as true now, and they must be put up because the Minister is not heeding them.  In our country we say:</P>
    <P>He is like Willie dear.</P>
    <P>What he doesn't like he doesn't hear.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has developed a hard side in that respect.  The Minister need not attempt to be flippant in his reply.  He need not attempt to pass this off with a wave of his hand because the time has gone when he could wave his hand airily and talk nonsense.  We want some solid foundation to build upon and the sooner the Minister gets down to that solid foundation and takes off his coat the better.  You have our suggestions. We will not say they are perfect.  Any suggestion can be improved upon, but the Minister must make a start some time, and the sooner he makes a start the better, because this thing of waving his hand and telling us that we must be a branch of the British Army, if the necessity arises, has gone on too long.  We want in the country something that we can use if it is necessary that we should have an army.  Unfortunately it is necessary, and we want something that we can use and use in the right way when the necessity arises for using it.  I hope it will not arise.</P>
    <P>I hope when the time comes for this country to look for something beyond what it has already secured; we can, if necessary, do what the old Fenians did when they said: &ldquo;We have men behind us with guns&rdquo;&mdash;unfortunately they had not the right kind of guns&mdash;&ldquo;we have physical force behind us. If you give us what we want quietly, well and good.  If you do not, there is something over and beyond that, that we will use.&rdquo;  The Minister ought to look ahead as well as back.  He should look back to the time when we developed, under stress and big difficulties, a guerilla fighting machine in this country.  Though it was not perfect, it was as near perfect as it was possible to get it under the circumstances. He should look forward to the time when it might be necessary <Col N="1023" /> to use a fighting force such as that again.  What we want is that if we are going to spend money on an Army at all that fighting machine will be the most perfect we can put into the field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'DOWD</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on those benches are frequently met with the question from the benches opposite, when we speak on an Estimate or on a Bill such as the Central Fund Bill: &ldquo;How do you propose to reduce expenditure? Show us the items in which a reduction can be effected.&rdquo;  The speakers who have preceded me on those benches have shown what is the policy of this Party in regard to an army.  If the number of that Army is reduced as it could be, and as we maintain it should be, the numbers employed, both officers, non-commissioned officers and men, in the different departments of that Army could be reduced. Even if that Army is to be maintained at its present strength, even if we were to admit, which we do not, that the present standing Army is necessary at its present strength, I maintain that a very big reduction could be made under sub-head (E) of the Estimates.  In a former debate I referred to the cost of the medical services in the Army.  I am not alone in my references to the cost of the medical services.  I find that in 1926 Deputy Cooper spoke on the cost of these services.  In 1927 Deputy Baxter and the members of the Farmers' Party arraigned the Government for the cost of the medical services, and the cost of the services to-day is just as excessive proportionately as it was in 1926 and 1927.  Will Deputy Cooper say why, in 1928, he proposes to vote for this Estimate which maintains the same cost per man in the Army for the medical services, when he voted against it in 1926?  Will the members of the Farmers' Party tell the Dáil why they opposed the Army Estimates because of the cost of the Army medical services in 1927, and why to-night they are prepared to support it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1927 Deputy Baxter, who was then leader of the Farmers' Party&mdash;I quote from the Official Debates&mdash;said: &ldquo;I did not hear Deputy Murphy make one single point against the case for <Col N="1024" /> maintaining a medical service in the Army whereby a doctor and dentist are provided for every 160 or 170 men.&rdquo; If you compare the Estimates for 1927 and the Estimates for 1928 you will find that proportionately the same number of officers are employed in the medical service.  In 1927 Deputy Baxter disagreed with the Government when they said that they must maintain a medical service of that strength. I wonder why those who succeeded Deputy Baxter in this House have changed their view?  In the Army to-day you have 53 officers in the medical service for an army of 10,256 officers, non-commissioned officers and men. That means that there is an officer in the medical service for every 197 officers, non-commissioned officers and men in the Army.  You also have 33 nurses to take care of 10,000 men.  Now compare that with the Poor Law services.  I am sorry Deputy Anthony has gone out.  Deputy Anthony threw bouquets at the Minister for Defence for the reduction he had brought about in the Army from 50,000 down to 10,000, and for reducing the cost, etc.  Will Deputy Anthony or anybody else suggest why there should be one doctor for every 194 or 195 able-bodied young men when under the Poor Law dispensary services there is only one doctor for every 5,000 persons.</P>
    <P>These are the figures.  In the dispensary service, which has to take care of the poor, for whom Deputy Anthony shows such concern, you have one medical officer for every 5,000 people.  In the Army you have one doctor for every 194 men.  The Poor Law service has to deal with the old, the infirm, and the children, and the medical officer has to travel long distances. He has not alone to do medical work, but that big branch of midwifery as well.  The President, in speaking on the Army Vote on one occasion, said that the Army medical officers had extra work in looking after the sanitation of the barracks.  Dispensary medical officers have also to look after sanitation, as they are medical officers of health.  They have to travel long distances, and their work is much harder and more difficult than the work of an Army doctor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> On a previous occasion I pointed out that the cost of military hospitals was excessive.  For instance, when a soldier gets sick in Cork and is taken to the Cork Military Hospital, he costs the country 15/- per day, or five guineas per week.  That was the answer which the Minister gave when I asked him what the cost was in Cork.  Will Deputy Anthony, who is a member for Cork, explain why it is that a soldier costs the country five guineas per week, while the poor, for whom he shows such concern, when they are sent into the North Infirmary in Cork, cost only two guineas per person per week?  The people for whom he speaks are at least entitled to the same treatment as the military.  If the military are getting such great treatment at five guineas, then the poor should be entitled to the same treatment.  There should not be a difference of three guineas in the cost of treatment.</P>
    <P>There are six military hospitals in the country.  There is a large hospital in Dublin, a large hospital at the Curragh, and hospitals in Athlone, Cork and other places.  I think in these hospitals never more than half the beds are occupied.  I venture to say that at times twenty-five per cent of the beds are not occupied, and yet you have big staffs employed there.  In the county from which I come, if a person in the mining district of Arigna gets sick he has to travel a distance of forty miles by ambulance to the county hospital in Roscommon.  Would it be too much to ask the Minister to consider, for the sake of economy, the closing of some of these military hospitals?  Could not military patients be brought from Athlone to the central hospital at the Curragh?  He could even go further and close one of the two big hospitals &mdash;either the one at the Curragh or the one in Dublin.  The total number of military patients in all the hospitals at one time would not fill one of the large hospitals.  Yet we keep these establishments open with big staffs, and we are told that there cannot be any economies made.  I say that there could be drastic economies.  We will be told that the few thousand pounds we could economise on these services would not be worth while.  But every little counts, and if we do not begin somewhere this <Col N="1026" /> country will not be able to stand the strain.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the medical services for this year is £32,755, and for drugs and dressings £1,820.  I do not include lodging and other allowances in these figures.  If that were reduced by half, as it could be without impairing efficiency in the slightest, we would have a saving of practically £20,000, and every £20,000 will count.  In a previous debate on the Central Fund Bill the Minister admitted that the services are overstaffed.  What is he going to do to reduce them?  Is he going to assure the House that they will be reduced before a definite time?  He knows as well as I do that it is too much to have one doctor for less than two-hundred able-bodied young men who, in the ordinary course of events, should never be ill.  As the result of a series of questions during the last session we find that in some hospitals there is one nurse for every three patients.  These patients must be very well cared for.  In one case&mdash;I think it was Athlone&mdash;there was one nurse to every two patients.  I wonder what would the people in the county hospitals, where there are only two nurses for a whole institution with about two hundred patients, say if they were told that in the military hospitals there was one nurse to look after every three patients?  I am convinced that the cost of these services can be drastically reduced, and I would like an assurance from the Minister that something will be done to reduce it.  I am not alone in this.  Deputy Cooper in 1926 held that there should be a reduction, and in 1927 Deputy Baxter and the Farmers' Party maintained that there could be a drastic reduction. There has not been any proportionate reduction since then.  Why has the opposition of these Deputies in 1926 and in 1927 changed into support of the Ministry on this Vote in 1928?  On looking over the Army pensions list, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to what seems to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have nothing further <Col N="1027" /> to say except that in comparison with any other service, such, for instance, as the civilian hospitals in Dublin, the cost of any military hospital exceeds the cost of any civilian hospital.  You have it on the authority of Deputy Sir James Craig, who understands all about civilian hospitals, that the cost of a civilian hospital is £140 per year per bed.  The Minister could not tell us of any military hospital that can keep its doors open at that cost.  The cost of a civilian hospital in Dublin or Cork is £140 per bed per year, at an outside figure, while the cost of a patient in a military hospital in Cork is five guineas per week.  Deputy Anthony would be well advised to get the poor people in Cork better treatment, if the effect of raising the cost per bed per year in these hospitals will ensure better treatment. The poor people, for whom he was so solicitous in other speeches, are entitled to as good treatment when they are sick as the military.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Dowd has spoken of dispensaries where a doctor had 5,000 people to look after. I did not know that these 5,000 were all paupers and entitled to free medical treatment.  I was in a dispensary myself which was one of the forty largest districts in Ireland, and I had a population of 4,500 to look after, but 2,000 of these people were paying patients.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I did not say that the 5,000 were non-paying patients or pauper patients, but what I said, and what I repeat, is that one doctor is responsible for the health of 5,000 people in rural districts in Ireland, whereas in the Army one doctor is only responsible for the health of 194 people.</P>

      <P>Let us come to a more concrete instance.  You get district hospitals in Ireland where you will at times find only four or five of the beds occupied.  That takes some explanation.  I know the Poor Law Medical Service is poor, and I do not want to boost it, but I think it is very unfortunate that Dr. O'Dowd has brought in comparisons in these matters. If you want your Army patients treated as paupers you can have it done.  But I doubt if the medical men in Dublin or in Cork are willing to treat your soldiers free.  There is no army in the world but pays for the medical treatment of its soldiers.  All armies in the world work on pretty much the same lines.  If you take a doctor to 190 soldiers you must remember that there is a barrack occupied by 190 men, and there must be a military doctor to look after those men.  The medical service in the National Army has not been an attractive one.  The doctors are not pensionable and they are badly paid.  I think these men should be entitled to pensions.  While occupying their position, I believe they can be dismissed at a moment's notice and they do not get any preferential treatment in regard to public appointments. I certainly do not think their lot is to be envied, so I think Deputy O'Dowd can ease his national conscience, <Col N="1030" /> with regard to anything they are getting.</P>

      <P>Whether for the whole of Ireland, it does not matter. We will say the Free State.  They have decided upon a certain form of Government and if they were allowed to run that government, you would have less necessity for an army.  But while that is questioned and there is talk of war by Deputy Carney who seems to be a miniature Napoleon, I think we must keep up our Army. Otherwise we would be always at his mercy.  I do not want to say anything to Deputy Carney.  I understand he was in the British Army and I do not know whether they have discharged all their financial liabilities to him, he rendered them such splendid service. He is a soldier and I salute him.  Of course, the expenditure on the Army is very considerable but we must look things in the face.  What causes that expenditure?  We should not want an army.  We must admit that an army such as we have would cut a very sorry figure against invasion by Germany or America or the British.  If we were content to abide by the majority <Col N="1031" /> rule in this country, we could dispense with the Army and that is the only way to keep down the expenses of the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate, but a few questions were raised upon which I would very much like to speak.  This is a Vote that is liable to give rise to acrimonious debates and to reminiscences owing to the circumstances in which the Army, called national, arose. Now, I intend to eschew all references that might create ill-feeling.  I am not a militarist.  I hate war as much as Deputy Anthony does and I abhor civil war.  Deputy Anthony asked us to speak on war matters in terms of peace. I do so as one who loves peace.  He referred to standing armies, territorial armies, and the paraphernalia of war as advocated by Deputy Kerlin. Deputy Kerlin quoted, I think it is the official organ of the National Army, &ldquo;An tOglach,&rdquo; as putting up an alternative to the present Army organisation supported by the Minister for Defence.  Now I am as pleased as Deputy Anthony that the standing Army is to be reduced to 5,000.  I should like to see it reduced still more. I am heartily in agreement with Deputy Anthony in saying that the clothing and equipment of the Army should be of Irish manufacture even if it would not, which I question, look quite as smart as imported material.  Abolish all standing armies, says Deputy Anthony.  I wish it could be done.  I wish from my heart it could be done and were done all over the world.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shaw asked what would we do if Russia invaded us.  Now they have disarmed Germany, and if they had not it would be a long time before the Russians reached here.  I fail to see anxiety on the part of those who disarmed Germany to disarm themselves. They have peace talk and at the same time they have secret agreements.  The term &ldquo;defence forces&rdquo; is a happy term.  I like the name &ldquo;Minister for Defence,&rdquo; for we seek war with no one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few small points I might refer to.  One is that the cost of the Defence Department is rather high.  I see that sixteen gentlemen of this Department <Col N="1032" /> divide amongst them a quarter of the salaries of 239 individuals. I think there is something wrong there. As regards the proportion of officers to men, I think it is too high.  In Belgium it is one to fourteen; in Italy it is one to fourteen; in Poland it is one to fourteen; in the Argentine it is one to seventeen, in the case of the British Territorial Forces one to eighteen, and in the Free State Army it is one to twelve.  That might be a proper proportion if you had an organised territorial army with a small standing army, because then you would have to keep, naturally, a larger percentage of officers.  The cost of 809 officers is £452,000.  That includes pay and allowances, marriage allowances, rations and mess allowance, of £560 per head.  I understand, but am subject to correction, of course, that there is £450 furnishing allowance as well for married quarters.  As to the term &ldquo;Minister for Defence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Army of Defence,&rdquo; what I want to know is, defence of what, of the Free State, Ireland, or the Empire?  We are asked by Deputy Shaw what is our solution.  I do not say it is possible at the moment, but I say it is a policy and ideal to be aimed at.  I am quite sincere, and I say it for myself and I believe that the majority of those on these benches will agree with me on it.  We should have the policy of neutrality, if possible, with that neutrality guaranteed, because it is as well to face facts.  It is not quite an impossibility, for instance, that the Empire and the United States might be some day at war.  I am not an anglophile any more than I am an anglophobe. I would not have enmity with the Empire if they left us alone.  I will admit as a free country we would see to it that they were not attacked through us.  We do not want any of them fighting here, Germans, French or Americans making us a pawn in the game if we can help it, and I say it would be a good national policy if we could have guaranteed neutrality.  If England is attacked, where do we stand?  What I want to know is: Are we to be dragged into the game?</P>
    <P>Deputy Hennessy said that Deputy Dr. O'Dowd was a bad trade unionist. I am glad that any Deputy of this House is called a bad trade unionist <Col N="1033" /> when doing his duty as the representative of the people here, and when he puts his country before his trade union. As regards the perverted version of figures, Deputy O'Dowd stated that it cost five guineas a week for these men in the hospitals, and that does not include doctors' salaries.  There is an item in that connection which I would like explained.  On page 283 of the Estimates for Public Services, sub-head W&mdash;Insurance (a) Non-commissioned officers and men, Health Insurance, 1927-28, £11,660.  I would like the Minister, when replying, to tell us what that is for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I will refer to 1928-29 if you like.  The years are in parallel columns.  The amount there is £7,800.  I hope the income tax officials are taking a note of secrets revealed by Dr. Hennessy that the cost of an operation in Cork is £100.  I suppose it is double that in Dublin, and that when they are estimating the income of the doctors they will charge accordingly.  We have got a public declaration that these are the fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Anthony spoke of our advocating boy scouts, territorials and the Lord knows what else.  Let us look at the facts as they are.  We have a semi-suppressed organisation, Fianna Eireann.  Then we have the Baden-Powell Scouts, whose chief object I do not believe is the ultimate freedom or unity of this country.  I do not know. They are not credited with having that in the foreground of their organisation at any rate.  You have then Fascisti. I believe you have British Fascisti. Then you have the British Legion. Then you have the National Army in this country itself, an army apart from the people.  I would say if you had a small standing army and a territorial army or a volunteer army that you could have a force which would absorb boy scouts, Fascisti, British Legion and any other armed forces that are in this country, and have them all national and advocating a free Ireland. But I do not say if we were in power to-morrow that we could accomplish all that in a day.  I do not say that if we <Col N="1034" /> were in power&mdash;I will be straight about it&mdash;that you would have a united Irish Republic on the following day, but I say in this matter of the Army that we can have a policy of neutrality guaranteed for this country.  If the policy of an army which is not a class apart, but will absorb all the elements of this country, whose purpose is defence of this country, not in mass formation but to be used in guerilla warfare, if necessary, to prevent any foreign Power holding this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is more or less what was suggested by some Deputies on these benches, and I suggest that an Army organised on these lines would be sure to absorb those different elements and would not have the militarist ideas, because we want to attack no one.  It would make for peace and national unity in this country.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture interrupted the last speaker with a question as to who would guarantee the neutrality of Ireland.  The time is coming when the question of the neutrality of Ireland may very well become a very real issue.  It is not lightly put forward, and it is not a matter which can be silenced by a single question.  I admit that the whole discussion of that belongs rather to foreign policy than to the vote we are debating.  But more than once we have been asked for our alternative to the present system of the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with it.  Our alternative is covered by three points.  First of all that whatever military organisation there is in this country should, from the bottom upwards, be based upon the ideals of Padraic Pearse.  Of course I know that the Minister for Agriculture has very strong objections to the expression of these views.  He has admitted in the House that he himself prefers pornography.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt that behind all these publications were the ideals of Pearse.  Now we are getting into an atmosphere in which these ideals can be asserted in a more peaceful manner. I think that the best elements in the Cumann na nGaedheal side also want to see those ideals inspired into our youth.  If we get those ideals into the boys, into those who will be in the earlier stages of a military organisation, whatever it may be, provided it is done on a sufficiently wide basis it cannot lead to civil war.  That is the first part of our alternative.  I do not propose to go into the ideas that have been already developed fully.  The various forms of military organisation have also been dealt with.  The next thing is that we should have a real democracy in this country.  Deputy Doctor Hennessy said that one of the ways to peace was to have majority rule, but in the discussion on the Referendum the Minister for Agriculture answered the argument in favour of the Referendum by saying that what we wanted was a Government by character.  That is the second element in our alternative, and the third element is the policy of neutrality.  In contrast to that policy you have the policy here of an army which is merely the cockshy of the big guns of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember a discussion which took place between a very well known war correspondent and one of our very prominent volunteers in the old days.  They both agreed at that time, before there <Col N="1037" /> was an opportunity of forming the new Army or the basis of it, that the worst thing in the world would be to have a standing Army like England, with military barracks and all that whole formation, because it would mean that these would easily be dealt with by the big artillery of the invading Army. You have these barracks and that system of standing Army.  You have together with that a foreign policy which makes it inevitable that English soldiers are entitled to come to this country, and if England is at war with America, America must attack Ireland.  The policy of the Free State Government at present is a policy which makes Ireland the cockpit for the next war.  All tendencies are towards a war between England and America.  Experts say that the financial position is developing in that direction.  Secret agreements are being developed by England, always with a view to the possibility of a war with America.  We stand by and allow this policy of drift to continue, we allow the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, through its Ministers, to let matters stand as they are at present. We do not know what agreements there are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to pursue the matter further in view of your ruling, except to say that it has a very <Col N="1038" /> substantial reality, and if I might be permitted to make this remark in answer to the Minister for Agriculture, the countries that would guarantee the neutrality of Ireland would of necessity be America, England, Germany and France, and if a propaganda was started unitedly from this country in order to pursue that policy and make it a real policy, we would be doing something towards establishing real peace, not only for ourselves but for other countries also, and incidentally might make a reduction of the expenses of our own Army a possibility.  We are spending considerably more than we should on what is entirely unproductive. Only to-day we heard the Minister for Education pleading for more money, because that is what it amounted to. He told us he could do a great deal more if he had more money.  If there was a saving even of the £500,000 suggested, that money could be devoted to education, or to some of the social services which are crying out for assistance. At present, if the Army is not there to fight anyone we must regard it as a kind of glorified outdoor relief.  The policy of Fianna Fáil is to establish some system whereby these men would be put to productive work.  A policy of employment is essential if you are going to carry out a thorough revision of our whole Army policy, but that is a matter that I cannot pursue in this debate because, like the question of foreign affairs, one cannot pursue it on a debate dealing with the Army Estimate. In any case that is our attitude, and I think in that matter we have much in common with the Labour Party.  I had not intended to take part in this debate, but the challenge on certain questions which arose made me feel that it would be a pity to let the points go without some statement in return.  I hope that the Minister for Defence will show in the next year that he is as much under the influence of the Fianna Fáil Party as he has already shown, because he has made certain reductions which I am perfectly sure are due to the strong influence which has been brought to bear on him in public from this side of the House.</P>

When the Deputy's Party gets a majority, when they declare a Republic, and when they attack France, England, Germany and any other country, when they spend their unexpended heroism in attacking England or any other country they will find no one here on their flanks.  We have made that absolutely clear. I want to assure Deputy Flinn, Deputy Kerlin, Deputy MacEntee and any other Deputies who are full of warlike enthusiasm and dying for fight that the day they get a majority and the day they make up their minds to fight another country they will have no one on their flanks; they will have a free hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies seem quite reassured on that point.  Deputy Kerlin was interested in some other point but I will leave it for the moment.  Deputy Hogan (Clare) wanted to know what the Army was for.  So did Deputy Kerlin and other Deputies.  Like all the Deputies who spoke, I am not a military man.  I should not say &ldquo;like all the Deputies,&rdquo; but a few Deputies pointed out they were not military men.  A few other Deputies neglected to point out that, so I assume they are experts in these matters.  I accept the teaching on these matters of any Deputy who likes to get up to lecture, and I gather that in the next war the things that will count are aeroplanes and gas. <Col N="1041" /> If gas counts we are going to do very well.  In the next war aeroplanes, tanks and all that sort of thing are going to count, but experts like Deputy Hogan from Clare, and Deputy Kerlin point out that our equipment in these matters is absolutely negligible, and that we have no chance of taking on England, France, or Germany. I accept that.  They want to know what is the Army for.  That is quite a reasonable question.  But when I hear that talk so much from the people who advocate a territorial force, from the people who want to know if we are to establish munition factories in the country, I cannot understand the logic of the position. As I said, I am not a really first-class general, a field-marshal, or anything else like that, but I suppose most of the experts will admit that if 10,000 men are no good for the purpose, 20,000, 50,000, or 100,000 men would be no good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN (Clare) Mr. HOGAN (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer the question about the territorial force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My reference to the question of a territorial force is quite relevant.  If 10,000 are no good, if 20,000 are no good for the purpose of attacking Germany or the United States, 50,000 would be very little use for the same purpose.  If that is a fact, and if we have not got resources of a first-class force, what is the use of munition factories?  I started by saying that Deputy Kerlin made a reasonable enough contribution to the debate, but I want the Deputy to carry his own arguments to their logical conclusion. Will the Deputy tell me what would be the use of any munitions we could turn out in this country for the purpose of the next war?  Will the Deputy also explain to me if our Army, small, cramped, without any tanks, with a small air service, without any of the modern appliances for propagation of poison gas, is no good at all, what is the use of establishing a few munition factories?  Is it not only playing with the situation?  The real trouble with this country is that we need to pursue our arguments and our convictions to their logical conclusion.  If the <Col N="1042" /> Deputy agrees that our Army, such as it is, is useless for the purpose of defending the country from a first-class Power that would wish to attack it in a military way, why does he ask us to establish munition factories?  I believe that his argument is sound.  I believe that in our present circumstances we are not in a position to defend this country from a first-class Power that might wish to attack us.  But why, then, ask about the establishment of munition factories and about the establishment of a territorial force?  What is the Deputy at?  One of his arguments contradicts the other.  Why does he not draw the quite logical deduction from the facts which he states, and which are facts&mdash;which are true?</P>
      <P>In these days and in our circumstances at the present moment force will not be a remedy in any issue between us and any other country.  This is the only logical deduction to draw from the particular points that the Deputy himself made.  That is the position, and if Deputies would only realise that we would be very much nearer to what they profess to be so anxious for, namely, agreement.  We are never going to settle any of the issues in our present circumstances, under actual world conditions, until world conditions change here and in other countries, and we are not going to settle issues that lie between us and other countries, as issues lie between practically all the independent countries of Europe, by force.  Accept that and we are very much nearer to each other than we would be by pretending that that is not the true state of affairs.  This sum of £1,500,000 odd is a big sum to spend in this country on the Army.  The Army is not for the purpose of aggression; it is not for the purpose of defending us in a military way against any first-class Power that wants to attack us.  It is quite useless for that purpose.  There is no use in talking about guerilla warfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will never be a guerilla war in this country again except between Irishmen.  There are any number of Powers in Europe which could simply strangle us.  You need not be a soldier to know that.  If a dispute between this country and any first-class Power <Col N="1043" /> were to be settled by force there are a number of first-class Powers in Europe at the present moment who could strangle us without ever landing here. But when you speak of guerilla warfare you must contemplate warfare in this country and between Irishmen. So what is the Army for?  Why is all this money being spent?  I will tell you: to see to it that the people of this country have a right to do wrong. That is all.  That is what the Army is for.  If we were absolutely certain that you could face up to the fact that in this country no one would challenge the majority will of the people, there would be no need for such an Army or for anything like as big an Army. And if there is £1,500,000 being spent for an Army, and if prudent men think it necessary to spend such an amount on the Army, then we are not to blame.  I will say no more than that.</P>
    <P>I want to say this, further: People talk lightly about disbanding the Army.  Every citizen in this country, including Deputy Hogan, has an obligation to the Army.  We are enabled to meet here and to pass these Estimates, we are enabled to debate, to accept or to refuse any proposition which is put up here which affects any citizen in this country because of the Army.  This Dáil could change the land laws.  It is no argument to say that we are not doing it.  This Dáil can change the whole industrial system of the country.  Deputies may ask why do we not do it.  That is a question to be debated.  And if we can do it, there is no doubt about it that if we can meet in peace and quietness to discuss these questions it is the Army that put us here in that position.  I ask Deputy Hogan to remember that, and he ought to remember it.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy said that this Army was an army apart from the people.  In what sense?  Is it not the humble servant of the majority of the people?  Is there any Deputy who dares to deny that it is the humble servant of the majority of the citizens of the country, of any Government which is elected by the majority of the people of the country? Does it exist for the purpose of <Col N="1044" /> seeing that the laws passed by the majority elected by the people of this country prevail in this country?  What right has any Deputy to say that it is an army apart from the people?  What is the meaning of those words?  Of course, it is very hard to know whether people mean what they say or to know whether they attach any meaning to their words.  But when I hear Deputies loosely and casually getting up and saying: &ldquo;This is an army apart from the people,&rdquo; if it is an army apart from the people as the French Army is apart from the people, the German Army is apart from the people and the Army of every civilised people in the world is apart from the people&mdash;it is not an army apart from the people at all; it is the people's Army, and it is an army which exists so that the people's law shall prevail in this country and that no other law shall prevail.</P>
    <P>What is our policy to be in a future war?  Really we ought to come down to brass tacks in this matter.  I do not know what our policy is to be in the next war, and there is no Government in any country in Europe which knows what its policy is going to be in the next war.  Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Little and all the great, imaginative and far-seeing statesmen on the other side can ask us what is our policy in the next war.  If you asked the German Chancellor on the 1st August, 1914, to say what his policy was to be in the next war he could not have told you, notwithstanding the fact that the next war was to break out the next day.  I know what our policy will not be in the next war.  People envisage a war between England and America, or England and France, or England and Germany. I do not know if there is going to be such a war.  No Deputy knows it. But let us assume that there will be a war between some of these nations and I will tell you what policy we will adopt.  As I listened to Deputies opposite, the only conclusion I could come to was that the duty of our Army should be this: the first duty of the Army should be to smash up communications between this country and its principal market.  We should see to that at once.  We are to see to it that no cattle leave this country, that no cattle are sold in England.  That is <Col N="1045" /> very important.  I am sure that the farmers of Athenry are all in favour of that policy!</P>

      <P>No, I am not.  In any event, apparently the policy is this, that the moment war breaks out we are certainly not going to help England. Deputy Little says that we are going to have our neutrality guaranteed by Patrick Pearse.  I will not refer to that because I think it is too much of a joke.  I dare say it will be guaranteed by Deputy Little or by some manifesto issued by the Fianna Fáil Party when the guns begin to go off.  Anyway, our ancient enemy is to guarantee our neutrality, and France, which does not care twopence about us, and Germany.  Of course, the Germans are remaining awake at night thinking how they will guarantee our neutrality. The position is this, that Germany, France and England have quite enough to do thinking of their own problems, and they do not care twopence about this country.  Why should they?  We do not give twopence about them, and all this talk about guaranteeing our neutrality is simply the greatest nonsense.</P>

More neutrality.  Anyway, they have been telling us that England, France and Germany are to guarantee our neutrality.  All this will appear in <Col N="1046" /> the newspapers in the morning.  It will get into the &ldquo;Daily Chronicle&rdquo; and other English papers.  When people outside read it they will think that we are a lot of children when we talk nonsense of that sort.  I will now get away from that sort of futile balderdash and come to the point.  Deputies want to know what our policy is in the case of war?  The policy of Deputies opposite is to give as much trouble as possible to England.</P>

I ask Deputies to consider that they cannot have it both ways.  The thing to do then is to see that no cattle and sheep go out.  We will then have plenty of meat at home, and never mind the price.  The thing to do is to see that no butter and eggs go out, and that there is complete interruption between this country and England; to see that the flow of trade between this country and England is completely interrupted.  We will all be happy then with our army and navy. Of course, we should build a navy also for that purpose.  At any rate, the Army will have done its job, and we will all be in a very happy, contented, and patriotic state, as the unfortunate farmers of Wexford were when all the ports were closed against them early in this year, because of foot and mouth disease.  When that day comes, Deputy MacEntee will raise the whole question in the Dáil and will want to know why the English do not buy our cattle.</P>

We now know what the Army is for.  The Minister for Agriculture gave us quite a few openings, which I hope will be taken advantage of when the discussion on this Vote is resumed.

We happen to know that under the Treaty we are not allowed to have more than a certain number of rifles in the country and a certain amount of ammunition at any time.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Defence knows very well that at a particular period during the Truce his own Party were desirous of procuring from other countries, outside of England, plant for the manufacture of ammunition and of rifles, so that they could get over the difficulty of the number of rifles allowed them from England and the quantity of ammunition at any particular time.  That is one item that we do know about.  The peculiar situation is this: that if trouble did arise with any foreign country we would only then be allowed to take part in it if we took the side of England or the side that England was interested in.  If we took the other side, we would get no supplies. What then is the use of having this Army trained for the purpose of being directed from outside and not from inside?  Deputy MacEntee dealt with some figures as to costs.  These figures were disputed by Deputy Cooper. Since that discussion took place, I <Col N="1048" /> have made a calculation.  The cost per man of the Army here, according to Deputy MacEntee's figures, the accuracy of which has not been disputed, is £146 per annum.  Deputy Cooper pointed out that the Army costs that much because allowances and payments are made to the men here which are not made to members of the Army in Switzerland, the country chosen for comparison.  If you take the actual cost per man in the Free State Army and deduct from it the allowances and payments referred to, you will find that the nett cost is about £83 per man per annum, while in Switzerland the figure is £22 per man per annum.  That gives a difference of roughly £60 per man.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence, when introducing the Estimate, referred to the state of the different units in the Army and said how perfect they were. In other words, he indicated that they were ready at any time for war.  We, on this side of the House, have been discussing all the time the possibility of doing away with that type of Army and having, if possible, a territorial force, preferably on a volunteer basis, that could be called up to defend the shores of this country if attacked.  We are not anxious to have an Army such as the Minister for Agriculture outlines which is to be used against the people of the country itself to keep, if you like, the present Government in a secure position.</P>

      <P>I would not raise this matter but for the flippant manner in <Col N="1049" /> which the Minister for Agriculture treated this question which so gravely affects the barley growers.  In reply Deputy Aird a few weeks ago, the Minister recommended that the farmers should keep a greater proportion of their barley than has been the practice and utilise it for feeding pigs.  It is regrettable that the Minister did not spend a little bit more time on the farm, for I am sure if in his young days when the harvest was threshed, and his father was considering the selling of it to pay his rates and annuities, if the future Minister suggested then that he should use it for the feeding of his pigs, the answer would be more forcible than polite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in a reply to Deputy Davin, asked did the Deputy want him to make representations to Messrs. Guinness that they should take more barley than they required. Deputy Aird asked the Minister this question to-day: &ldquo;Whether he will take steps to place an embargo on the importation of all foreign barley and malt entering the Saorstát, until such time as the barley produced by barley growers in the Saorstát has been disposed of.&rdquo; I do not think any member of this House who is aware of the position of the tillage farmers in this country would consider the reply given by the Minister as being in any way satisfactory. It was simply in the negative. When we look into the position as regards the importation of foreign barley we find a very grave state of affairs.  In the year 1926 there was imported 116,044 cwts. of foreign barley at an average cost of 8/- per cwt., and in the same year we exported 388,000 cwts. of barley at an average price of 6/- per cwt.  In the year 1927 there were imported 214,000 cwts. of barley at an average of 10/3 per cwt., and we exported 264,000 cwts. at the price of 10/- per cwt.  We imported last year 150,000 cwts. of malt at a cost of £147,000.  That is very grave matter not alone for the barley growers, but for the unemployed who have been dismissed from the malting houses.  Up to the 30th June Messrs. <Col N="1050" /> Guinness imported 163,000 cwts. of barley at a cost of £83,000.  More sinister still, in the month of June we imported 151,798 cwts.  Most of the imported barley this year was brought in in the month of June.  I do not know was it by collusion or not, but in the reports given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for July and August, there is no reference to imports or exports of barley.  We had imported in the month of June 66,000 cwts. of foreign malt at a cost of £65,000, so for the three months preceding our harvest we had imported £157,000 worth of foreign malt and barley.  That was a nice preparation for the harvest of the farmers.  Then the Minister tells us he can do nothing. No, he can do nothing, but the sheriff and the bums will in due course collect the annuities.</P>

      <P>I want you to do what Deputy Aird suggested, not to allow to be dumped in this country before the farmers' harvest barley which the farmers of this country are able to produce. The farmers could very easily have a market for their barley if the Executive Council recognised that the upkeep of the country is mainly dependent on the farmers, and prohibit the import of foreign malt and barley and leave the home market open to them. I think it is a scandalous state of affairs that the farmers in my constituency and in other constituencies are unable to find a market for their barley except at a price that is ruinous, while the foreign barley is being imported.</P>

Now the Dáil is the first institution in the State.  If one of our American friends visits us here and he suffers from thirst and we take him to the bar we can only give him the produce of foreign barley, though our own brewers produce good stuff out of home-grown barley.  You could not give them <Col N="1051" /> Beamish's stout.  It is undoubtedly a very serious matter that the farmers cannot find a market for their malt and barley.

But it is time that this matter was definitely and seriously considered by the Minister for Agriculture, who, after all, is responsible to the farming community whether he likes it or not.  But whether he likes it or not, I consider it is his duty to do something in this matter.

      <P>I think it is necessary that the Minister should make a definite statement in view of the general feeling in the country that the Government has some responsibility for the present situation.  It must be realised that the farmers in at least six or seven counties are placed in a very serious position at the present moment.  In these six or seven counties barley is the staple crop, and from what we can ascertain there does not seem any prospect whatever that these farmers can sell their barley at any price.  There is a feeling fairly general that the Government could impose a duty on barley without any disadvantage to the State.  There is also <Col N="1052" /> the feeling, and the more general feeling, that whatever may be the position as regards barley there could be no excuse for the State allowing foreign malt to be imported; that whatever excuse the users of malt may have to put up for importing foreign barley for their purpose, there certainly can be no excuse for the importation of foreign malt into a country that is studded with malt houses and where labour is cheap; they, at least, should have the right to malt the barley that is required in the liquor industry.  I hope the Minister will make a definite statement on that question as to the difficulties, if there are any difficulties.  If it will not mean any interference or reduction in the brewing or distilling industry, there seems to be a strong case for a duty on barley.  Whatever the reason may be, even if the Minister is able to give reasons to show that the duty on barley would have the effect of interfering to a dangerous extent with the liquor manufacturing industry, he will at all events find it difficult to show that the duty on malt will have such an effect. In view of the general feeling throughout the country I hope the Minister will make a definite statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The whole situation arises out of the importation of foreign malt.  If it were possible to stop that, or to reduce it to a lesser bulk, a great deal of the difficulty would be overcome. That is the opinion of the barley growers of the country.  If at any time the Minister could see his way even to have a time limit so as to have the home product bought up previous to the importation, we would be quite satisfied&mdash;not to allow the imports in until the farmers have had an opportunity of selling their own barley. Unless there is something done in that direction I am afraid that things will not be bright nor the prospects before the farmers in any way good.  The importation of malt must certainly be stopped if the farmers are to get an opportunity of going ahead.</P>

      <P>It is quite evident that some form of dislocation has taken place in the barley-growing industry. It is hardly to be expected, <Col N="1053" /> this evening at least, that any form of protection or prohibition is to be put up.  But I am quite sure that it is possible to devise some temporary remedy. I take it that barley is a cash crop, and as far as I understand the difficulty of storage is one that the farmers are faced with.  They may not have complete storage, but I believe that inside this country there is a market for barley at a price.  Cash can be got for barley.  The difficulty is to find that market, and I suppose that the market is found to-day to a very limited extent. It is found by means of certain distributors, so that the difference between the prices the producer gets and the prices the consumer pays is too much.  I am sure the Minister is in a position to devise some means of connecting the consumer of barley with the producer.</P>

      <P>I am not going to detain the House very long.  I only just want to say, that, in my opinion, if the Minister does agree to do what he is asked to do here&mdash;that is, to put a tariff on barley he would be doing a thing he should not do and this House would be doing a thing it should not do if it voted for a tariff.  I say that for this reason&mdash;that in my opinion, and I claim to have some experience of farming and of tillage farming at that, that the days of growing corn for sale as a cash crop are past.  You will be going against the people's own interest by encouraging them to grow barley as a cash crop. I do all I can to encourage tilling farming, and I claim to be the biggest tillage farmer in this House.  I want to encourage farmers to use on their own lands all the corn they grow there &mdash;to feed it to their live stock instead of trying to turn it into a cash crop. If the people in this country who can afford to feed their corn crops to their live stock and who are in a position to do so. and who are also in a position to store their own corn instead of rushing it to the market, then they will be doing a service to the smaller farmers who are not so well circumstanced, and these letter will be in a position to get better prices for the corn they have to sell.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jordan has undoubtedly struck the right note.  The Midland counties have been encouraged, year by year, to keep on to a totally unsound system of farming.  That is what has been happening.  There is a prospect held out before them that by some sort of State action the prices of corn can be kept up to a paying level. That is the only serious part of speeches like those of Deputy Corry's and the speeches made from time to time on this matter.  Due to these speeches farmers in the Midlands are still encouraged against their own better judgment to keep on growing barley as a cash crop, believing that by some State activity he can be ensured better prices than the economic price of this crop.  Now that is very serious. We cannot blame the farmer for doing what he is doing.  We cannot blame a man in any business for proceeding on the lines that he knows well.  That is what the farmer is doing in this matter of barley.  He is continuing to grow barley as a cash crop.  He had, say, a middling year last year, and a medium year the year before for the sale of his barley, and he thinks that as a result of political agitation or some agitation that ways will be found, that a method will be devised whereby he can keep on doing as he always did in the past and that it will pay a lot better.  As Deputy Jordan pointed out, any farmer who examines the matter for himself will see that with the world position to-day, the days of growing corn as a cash crop are past.  The farmers will have to face up to that and to realise that in future they must make some arrangements under which they will consume most of their barley or else sell only very limited samples of their choicest barley as a cash crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry suggested in all seriousness that the State should prohibit the importation of barley and malt.  Does Deputy Corry know whether foreign barley is required by Messrs. Guinness?  I am not in Guinness's secrets.  But even when we are dealing with a fourth or fifth rate firm we must assume that it knows its business. It may be that foreign barley is necessary to the mixture that Messrs. <Col N="1055" /> Guinness use.  I dare say Guinness's stout is sold because people like it, and they like it because it has certain qualities. I presume there is a considerable amount of thought and a considerable amount of science brought to bear on the whole question of producing that particular product.  It is just the little difference between Guinness's stout and other stout that makes all the difference in the world to the sale of that stout.  That difference is due to factors over which we have no control.  It may be that that difference is due to the mixture of foreign and Irish barley.  I have not asked Messrs. Guinness what their trade secrets are, but Deputy Corry seems to know all about these things.  Now Deputies will have to realise in this hard world that it is efficiency that counts.  The difference between Guinness's efficiency and some other small breweries that have gone down has been the difference that counted, and it is this slightly more efficient management exercised over a long period in the case of Guinness that means the difference between them and the smallest and most footy little brewery in the country.  Guinness's brewery is the largest in the world, and their success may result possibly from the fact that they are using this mixture of foreign barleys.  Anyway, we must presume that they know their own business.  Is it seriously suggested by Deputy Moore that I should go to Guinness's, the biggest and one of the most efficient businesses in the world, tell them I am a politician, that I know nothing about brewing, but that I am going to advise them as to what sort of mixture they should put in their brew?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, Guinness's are to buy Irish barley as far as <Col N="1056" /> possible, as far as it is available.  But Irish barley may not suit them.  They have to sell their stout here, in England, and all over the world, and it may not suit them to buy Irish barley.  The reason they buy foreign barley is because they want it.  Foreign barley is of a slightly different quality from Irish barley, but perhaps that slight difference in quality makes all the difference in the world to the stout. Guinness's is a big business firm, and I can assure the Deputy that every individual in a big concern like that has to do as much work as the Deputy, in his own particular niche, in such a business.  It is as a result of all that work, the work of the brewer, the chemist, the ordinary workman and the clerk, that a big business like Guinness's is able to turn out a first-class article.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should not argue out of sheer wantonness that Guinness's are importing foreign barley.  They are importing it because it suits them.  No company with hopes for an industrial future expects to be told, &ldquo;The State is going to dictate to you what raw materials you are to use in order to turn out a finished product.&rdquo;  Anybody who thinks of doing that is foolish, and anyone who talks about it is talking pure foolishness.  According to Deputy Moore we are to put a duty on foreign malt or barley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should you put a duty on?  The Deputy says that the policy of Fianna Fáil is to encourage industry, to encourage it by means of tariffs and bounties.  Here is one of the biggest industries of its kind in the world.  We have it here, and the suggestion is that we are to interfere with its commercial operations.  Why? Because they do not give the price that we would like for their raw materials. What effect would that have on Guinness's if the State came in?  If the State interfered with my commercial activities in a serious way I would consider the question of leaving the country. That is a question that Guinness's could consider, and why would not they?  The Deputy might say that <Col N="1057" /> that is a suggestion that should not be made, but we should realise in this country that people will act in business matters quite logically.  We must not assume that we can interfere with Guinness's or with any other firm simply because this is Ireland.  If we so far interfere with the commercial methods of Guinness's or any other firm in the country as to make the raw materials dearer, the first thing they ought to consider is whether they would or would not stay in the country. Of course, that is the first thing they would consider.  I do not know whether they would go or not.  I suppose they would go if there were not some other reasons why it was necessary they should stay.</P>
      <P>What would the effect be upon other firms coming in here?  Here we have an industry in being, a first-class industry, and one that is of the most vital importance for the country. What way do we behave towards it? Because we are not satisfied that they are giving sufficiently high prices for raw materials we put on a tax.  Would not that be a nice example for any other industry that thinks of starting here?  After all, what effect would it have on the price of barley?  It would not increase the price by one penny. Guinness's are the only buyers.  That is too bad.  It is a pity there is not competition.  If Guinness's were not there, there would be no buyer except the man who might want barley for feeding purposes.  Why should Guinness's give more for Irish barley simply because they have to give more for English malt?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will look up the daily papers he will see that barley is quoted in the English market at 35/- a barrel when the season opens.  Why is that?  Because there are people willing to give 35/- for it.  Why do they not give 35/- for Irish barley?  Is there any prejudice against Irish barley?  If Irish barley fetched the same price as English barley you would have plenty of shippers here buying it at 30/-, shipping <Col N="1058" /> it across, and selling it at 35/- on the English markets.  When the Deputy asks if the barley is as good in Ireland, or superior, that means nothing.  As good for what?</P>

      <P>The brewers think that it is not, and they must have good reasons for thinking so.  In any event, how is it going to make Irish barley one penny dearer?  It is not.  Guinness's can give the same price and they can make up any losses that they may suffer with regard to foreign malt by paying less for Irish barley.  Guinness's are the only buyers and they rule the prices.  The farmer must face that, and no State action that can possibly be taken could force Guinness's to give a higher price and remain in business.</P>

Why should they?  It is an absolutely wrong point of view.  The farmer has his remedy. The farmer in Leix and Offaly&mdash;it is a hard thing to have to say to him&mdash;will have to change his method of farming. He has good land, better than they have in the West&mdash;far better land for mixed farming&mdash;and he will have to change his methods if he wants to progress. I wish I could grow barley.  I have to buy a couple of hundred pounds worth of Indian meal every year simply because I cannot get barley.  Oats are no substitute for barley.</P>

There is no use in deceiving the farmer in Leix and Offaly by pretending that any State action we could take would increase the price of barley.
