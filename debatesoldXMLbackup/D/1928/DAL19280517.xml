      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state the reason for the delay in proceeding with the scheme of drainage of the River Akeragh, under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, as submitted to the Kerry County Council by the Office of Public Works in their letter of 14th April, 1927, and accepted, with a contribution of 20 per cent. of the cost by the Council; whether, in view of the fact that the most suitable season for work of this nature is now at hand, he will have work expedited.</P>

      <P>After receiving the promise of the County Council contribution the Commissioners of Public Works prepared a detailed drainage scheme for the Akeragh Lough district and exhibited it for the votes of the occupiers. A public inquiry was then held in respect of the objections to the scheme. As a result of the inquiry certain minor revisions in the scheme were found necessary and these are now being made.  It is hoped to submit the scheme to the Minister for Finance for confirmation shortly, and, if and when it is confirmed, work will be started without delay.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that, in a circular issued by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Ltd., detailing the procedure for obtaining loans, it is stated that loans under £50 will be obtainable through co-operative societies and that persons desiring such loans should approach existing co-operative societies; and whether he is aware that <Col N="1536" /> the Corporation has not supplied any information or advice whatever, as to their functions and methods of operation, to the existing co-operative societies to whom they have delegated this work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. CROWLEY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether in October or November, 1927, an action was taken against Mrs. White, of Knockeenduff, Killarney, to recover money alleged to be due by Mrs. White, in respect of money received at foot of an old age pension; whether the case was dismissed, with costs, by the Circuit Court Judge; whether the Minister then appealed, and subsequently withdrew his appeal, which was dismissed with costs; whether the costs of the said proceedings were taxed to £18 6s.  6d., which the Minister for Finance was ordered to pay Mrs. White; whether, although repeated applications have been made for the amount of the said costs, payment has not yet been made; and whether he will now take steps to have payment made to Mrs. White.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of a decision of the Department of Local Government and Public Health that Mrs. White had not been entitled to any pension, proceedings were taken under Section 9 (2) of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1928, for the recovery of £114 6s., the amount of old age pension money drawn by Mrs. White during the period covered by the decision of the Department.  It is clear from the judgment that, while of opinion that the debt was due to the State, the Circuit Court Judge was obliged to dismiss the claim on a technical point which arose in connection with the manner in which the local Pensions Committee dealt with the claim.  As the existence of this point would <Col N="1537" /> operate against the success of the appeal, it was withdrawn.  I understand that payment of the costs was made in the ordinary course on 14th instant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. SHEEHY (Tipperary)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that a sum of only £100 was given to Mrs. Ellen MacCarthy, of Fianna Road, Thurles, as compensation for her son, James MacCarthy, who was murdered by British Forces on the night of March 27th, 1920; whether he will state why such a small amount was paid; and whether he will re-consider the matter with a view to increasing the award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>An application for compensation by Mrs. Ellen MacCarthy, of Fianna Road, Thurles, in respect of her son, James MacCarthy, was carefully considered by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, and a recommendation was made that a sum of £100 should be paid to the applicant by way of compensation. At my request the case was specially reviewed by the Committee in November, 1924, but after the fullest consideration of all the facts the Committee reported that they were unable to vary their original recommendation.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, and having regard to the fact that the Committee has long since ceased to function, I am unable to have the case reopened, as suggested by the Deputy, or to hold out any prospect that any payment will be made to Mrs. MacCarthy beyond the sum of £100 which she has already received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. SHEEHY Mr. SHEEHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHEEHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that James MacCarthy was employed as a baker at a wage of £4 a week, and that he contributed his earnings to his mother; also, that he was the first victim of the Black-and-Tans in Thurles, and that the dependents of other victims at that time received £600 compensation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite hear what the Deputy said.  Compensation in these cases was paid on the recommendation of the Committee, and all I did in any case when representations <Col N="1538" /> came to me which indicated that the awards seemed to be insufficient was to send it back to the Committee and ask them to review the facts.  In a few cases, as the result of the recommendations being sent back, a variation was made.  In this case no variation was made in the recommendation.  I know the facts.  The deceased was employed as a baker, and I think there were two other sons living at home, both of whom were bakers and employed.  Consequently, this son was not the sole support of his mother by any means.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he will state why Mr. Dan Donovan, Lackenduff, Clonakilty, a postman of thirty years' service, who is married and has a family of five children, has had his route changed and his pay reduced to 9s.  4d.  per week since 1924, whilst a naval pensioner has taken over the duties previously assigned to Mr. Donovan, in addition to his own; whether he is aware that Mr. Donovan has now to walk three miles to Clonakilty to get the letters for delivery, whilst previously he obtained them at the local sub-post office; and whether there is any reason why he could not be given back his former route and rate of pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Dan Donovan was employed as an allowance deliverer at Lackenduff, Clonakilty, from 1903 to July, 1924, when, following a general revision of the postal services in that area, his services had to be dispensed with.  He <Col N="1539" /> has since been given three offers of employment on other posts, each of which was considered suitable to him and carried higher wages than his former post, but he refused to accept any of them.  The auxiliary postman referred to in the question was senior to Mr. Donovan.  There is, unfortunately, no suitable vacancy at present in Clonakilty which could be offered to Mr. Donovan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MULLINS</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that I am not in a position to give every detail in connection with this case.  The answer states that three offers of employment were made and they were better than the post he previously held.  The officer in question refused to take any of the offers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. MULLINS Mr. MULLINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MULLINS</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the answer, which states, &ldquo;Each of which was considered suitable to him and carried higher wages than his former post,&rdquo; it is hardly necessary to supply the information.  If the Deputy wishes to get the exact information I will provide it.  But it is so that the wages were higher.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the whistle buoy which is at present placed on Bullman Rock, off Kinsale Harbour, is inadequate as a warning to shipping during thick weather; that an unwatched lighted buoy placed in addition on the rock would obviate the existing danger to navigation, and encourage boat owners to send their vessels to fish off the harbour; and whether, in view of these facts, and in the interest of shipping and the advancement of the fishing industry at Kinsale, he will take the necessary steps in the matter.</P>

      <P>I have received representations regarding the desirability of establishing an unwatched lighted buoy on Bullman Rock, off Kinsale Harbour, and have placed the matter before the Commissioners of Irish Lights, who have informed me that the proposed light could not be provided at the cost of the General Lighthouse Fund.  The provision of lights required for local purposes is ordinarily a matter for the harbour authorities concerned, and there are no funds at my disposal out of which the cost of facilities of this nature could be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MULLINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the importance of this, and in view of the fact that shippers have informed the local authority that they will not continue to send their boats there unless some provision is made for the safety of navigation, that the local harbour commissioners are prepared to pay a reasonable share of the costs, and in view of the danger to boats as a result of an unwatched lighted buoy not being available, would the Parliamentary Secretary not find it possible to reconsider it and to provide portion of the costs out of some fund, seeing that this is essential to navigation in that area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was under consideration on representations already made by Deputy Sheehy, and there was correspondence with the Harbour Commissioners.  On the 7th May we wrote to the Deputy pointing out that the Irish Lights Commissioners were unable to provide this out of their own funds, but that they would provide it if the Harbour Commissioners were prepared to enter into agreement to accept liability for the expenditure incurred in connection with the establishment and maintenance of the buoy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that at this stage of the Bill the discussion is to confine itself to the principle of the measure only.  Therefore I intend to confine myself to considering the purpose of the Bill and the method of securing it.  This Bill proposes to increase taxation, and to aggravate the already too heavy burden upon our people and upon their industry.  We must ask ourselves whether such an increase is justifiable and unavoidable, and whether also it is equitably distributed. According to the figures supplied to us, the minimum amount to be raised by taxation in the current year is £20,735,000.  The actual amount raised last year was £20,396,000, so that at the very lowest computation taxation during the current year will be heavier than last year to the tune of £339,000.  Can we impose such an additional burden?  Will industry sustain it, for if industry cannot sustain it I submit that we are not justified in imposing it.  At the present moment, in proportion to our resources, in population and in wealth, we are the most <Col N="1550" /> heavily taxed country in Europe.  I daresay that we are almost the most heavily taxed country in the world.</P>
      <P>Last year the total amount paid in local and State taxation by the citizens of the Saorstát was 25½ millions.  Next year, if the Minister's proposals are carried, the total amount will be not less than £25,830,000, or 20 per cent. of the estimated National income.  That is not the worst aspect of the problem, because though excessive taxation is bad enough in itself, we have to remember that a considerable proportion of the money thus collected passes into the hands of the citizens of the Saorstát and back again to the source from which it came&mdash;the industry of the mass of the people.  In addition to this money which, by taxation, industry is temporarily denied the use of, industry has to pay another toll which, in this case, is an irrecoverable loss, and that is the sum of £5,325,000 which, under the Treaty and the several agreements entered into since the date of it, has to be paid annually to Great Britain.  The burden of our taxation is heavy enough, so heavy, as I hope to show, as to cripple industry, but heavy and all as it is, it is not nearly so damaging in its effects or so detrimental to our prosperity as that foreign tribute is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to make any debating point about the matter.  I simply wish to draw attention to the question, irrespective of Parties, in order that it may receive the serious consideration of this House, for I believe relief from that tribute is one of the first things necessary to restore prosperity to the Free State.  There is no use in attempting to minimise that payment.  When I was referring in the discussion on the financial statement to the amount of money we paid by way of land annuities the Minister for Agriculture interjected a remark and asked me how much of these annuities come back to citizens of the Free State.  I thought it worth while to inquire, and I found that out of £3,400,000 paid in 1925-6 the actual amount that came back by way of interest to the citizens was £211,000.  That is thought by the Minister for Agriculture to be some justification for a financial transaction of that description but then on top of the combined <Col N="1551" /> burden of the tribute and the taxation we have the effect of our adverse trade balance.  The real difficulty is in the trade balance, which in the calendar year amounted to £8,750,000, representing the value of the actual assets which we had to realise in order to meet our external commitments.</P>
    <P>What is the Government policy as embodied in the Finance Bill now before us?  It is first of all to withdraw from the process of production the sum of £39,880,000 of which £25,835,000 is temporarily withdrawn, and of which £14,000,000 is permanently withdrawn. Of this £14,000,000, £8,750,000 definitely represents a diminution in the national capital and in the national wealth which will not be made good or replaced until the adverse trade balance against us disappears for a term of years and is replaced by a favourable one.  With these figures before us we can understand how hard it is for industry to flourish in the Saorstát, and why it is so hard to establish new manufactures here and foster and develop them.  In these figures lies the reason for the fact that, as the Tariff Commissioners reported, of 38 firms owning mills equipped for the manufacture of flour two of these businesses were at the time the application for a tariff was made to the Commission in the process of being wound up and ten had ceased to manufacture. These figures explain why it is when an offer is made to the public of shares, such as those in the Agricultural Credit Corporation with every guarantee of the Government behind them, and with every inducement to an investor to put his money into them, that we find the investing public of Ireland, those who might have a surplus over and above their everyday needs, were only able to take up something like £20,000 worth. I submit, in view of the fact that, as the President has claimed here so often, the majority of the people of the country uphold his Government and support and endorse his policy, if they had been in the financial position to do so they would have supported and endorsed that policy of his in a practical way by putting their money down.</P>
    <P>When they got the opportunity of doing that we found they were unable <Col N="1552" /> to do so.  Why?  Because this country instead of having a surplus over and above its everyday needs is compelled every day, largely by the fiscal policy of the Government which is embodied in this Finance Bill, to withdraw some part of that capital from industry in order that it may meet its external obligations and commitments.  That £39,880,000 explains why it is that so long as the present policy of the Government in relation to taxation and expenditure continues the cost of production for any commodity in this country must be higher than elsewhere, even though the real rate of wages paid to workers is lower.  These figures explain the decline in industrial activity, the derelict breweries, the bankrupt distilleries and the general industrial position so precarious that one of our best-established industries is working on a margin so narrow that it cannot afford to incur the slight extra cost not in raw material, as this Report bears witness, but any trouble which would be involved in attempting to save an essential industry from extinction.  In short, under our present system the old-established industries are as it were in the grip of a boa constrictor and the infant industries are being strangled at their birth.</P>
    <P>Is the Dáil going to connive at that process of industrial strangulation?  Is it going to cry halt and face up to the Executive Council and say boldly &ldquo;You are asking more than the country can give, more than industry can afford and survive&rdquo;?  That is the real situation. We are being taxed far beyond our capacity to bear or pay.  Taxes indeed have been screwed up and up until now they show a diminishing return.  I think that is the most ominous feature of the financial table explaining the Budget which was furnished to us by the Minister for Finance.  We have found that taxes which years ago yielded an increasing return to the Exchequer are giving a steadily diminishing yield, and that the Minister for Finance has been compelled to drop some taxes altogether as being unproductive and worthless.  That very fact is of the gravest significance. It indicates that the danger signals are up and that we must call a halt to this extravagant expenditure or go smash.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1553" /> Although the danger signals are up, the unfortunate thing for the country is that we have a Finance Minister who, though he sees the danger signals, cannot read them.  Financially, he is colour-blind, and like the driver of the ghost train he is rushing past them and driving on to inevitable disaster&mdash;and not alone the Minister for Finance but the whole Executive Council.  There they go rushing down the line like the little puffing Billy at the head of the Flying Canadian whose driving power has recently been enlisted to carry them, and the whole country is being dragged after them.  The signals are against them and one day or another they are going to come up against inevitable disaster. Those who have to earn their bread in ordinary avocations, farmers who have to work in their fields, shopkeepers who have to make ends meet, and workers who have to find their wages at the week-end, who know the financial and economic position of the country and not those who live in sheltered avocations, who are not in touch with the industrial position, and whose only concern seems to be to collect money and spend it, realise that at present the Government are draining the life blood of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Minister for Finance sees the danger signals and disregards them.  One wonders whether he does that in malice or in folly. Whatever his motive or attitude is, the one thing that is undeniable is that he sees the signals, for in the statement explaining the Budget which he circulated he estimates that this year the tax revenue on the present basis of taxation will be only £19,650,000.  Last year these same taxes, imposed on the same people, the same industry, and the same population, yielded £20,396,000. This year the Minister, on his own confession, estimates that he will not be able to get more than £19,650,000. What does that indicate?  It indicates that the Minister sees the danger signals. He knows that the capacity of this people to pay taxation is becoming exhausted. What steps has he taken as a Minister and a member of the Executive Council to secure a remission of that taxation, to give relief to that over-harassed and over-driven people?  There is one way and only one way in which <Col N="1554" /> that relief can be given, and that is by a reduction in every service that is not essential to the well-being of the people. I wish to emphasise the qualification because I do not want any person to say to me afterwards, &ldquo;You are in favour of reducing old age pensions; you are in favour of curtailing expenditure upon education.&rdquo;  I am not in favour of any one of those things.  I believe that every social service that is given in any other country under God's sun should be given if we can possibly do it, and I believe we can, if only we restrict our expenditure to those things which are absolutely essential and which should be enjoyed by the poor and the workers amongst us, who are the real producers of wealth and are entitled to the first share and first charge upon it.</P>
    <P>The Minister already realises that henceforward, if taxation is continued at the same rate as heretofore, he is going to be faced every year with the problem of a diminishing return.  What would a Finance Minister in a normal country, faced with such a situation, do?  He would consider the whole economic position of the community and his Budget would be devised if not to improve industry, at least not to aggravate the position for it.  Obviously taxation must be reduced if industry is to prosper and taxation cannot be reduced unless expenditure is reduced. The ratio of non-producers to producers in this country is altogether too high.  The number of drones is altogether out of proportion to the capacity of the workers to support them.  The number of men in services like the Army and the Gárda Síochána should be reduced, not in order that they may starve, but in order that they may be absorbed in industry and given employment as producers of wealth.  At the present time they are only consumers of wealth, maintained by the rest of the population, maintained in a state of luxury to which the general mass of our people can never aspire, and in conditions of comfort that the general mass of our people do not know.  The services which they render to the community are not at all commensurate with the awards which they draw from the community.  The awards are altogether out of proportion to the resources of the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> Every one of us knows that the situation here with regard to the Gárda Síochána is not a normal one.  This country and our people are not any more lawless than people anywhere else in the world.  As a matter of fact, civic life in Dublin compares very favourably with life in Glasgow or London, and the general aspect of the people in the twenty-six counties, so far as the ordinary normal course of the law is concerned&mdash;that law which has not a political aspect&mdash;is as good as the attitude of the average Englishman or Scotchman.  Yet under the present Government, we find that it requires 23 policemen to every 10,000 inhabitants to preserve the public peace, as compared with 12 in England or 13 in Scotland.  Is there any justification for that?  Is there any justification for maintaining that extra quota of Gárda Síochána in a comfort that the ordinary mass of the people do not know?  I agree that they may have to be maintained. I agree that if we cannot find work for them they may have to be maintained, but the surplus members of that force should not enjoy any special or privileged position here.</P>
    <P>As the average worker has to be content with very much less for doing practically the same thing as the ordinary Civic Guard does, so the surplus members of that force should get no more than the average person out of employment demands as of right from the State&mdash;maintenance in a frugal way, maintenance at such a rate, or upon such a scale, as will enable him to keep himself in good health and remain a good citizen.  There is no justification, therefore, upon any ground whatever, except possibly the ground of political patronage, for maintaining the Army and the Gárda Síochána at the present rate.  The same might be said in reference to a number of other Government Departments.  We do not want the strength of the Gárda Síochána and the Army reduced, or the personnel in the Government Departments reduced, in order that men may starve, but in order that, the burden upon industry being lightened, industry may be able to absorb them into employment, instead of making them consumers of wealth, as they are at present&mdash;drones living <Col N="1556" /> upon the general produce of the workers &mdash;to make them producers of wealth who will add to the common stock of the community.</P>
    <P>With regard to the trade balance, I think every one of us must realise that as the actual trade balance, which is derived after taking into account the visible and invisible exports, is against us, it is a matter to which we should give very serious consideration, because in so far as it is not offset by reproductive capital expenditure, it represents an actual decrease in the general wealth of the country.  It represents so much money withdrawn every year from productive processes and paid away abroad.  Other countries have been faced with that problem and have regarded it as a very serious one. Italy, which, only two years ago, was in an even more precarious financial position than we are, was faced with the same problem and took steps to deal with and redress it.  I believe that we ought almost contemplate exactly the same steps here.  In the present mood and disposition of our people, following, I think, the example of Government extravagance which has been set them, there is only one way to redress that adverse trade balance&mdash; I know that Deputies O'Hanlon and Gorey will be very angry with me when I suggest it&mdash;that is to restrict imports, particularly unnecessary luxury imports, to make our people keep their money or spend their money at home.</P>

      <P>If, therefore, the Minister had to find increased revenue, had to increase the burden of taxation, as he has had to do, in order to meet the expenditure to which the Government is committed, instead of putting an added burden on the people, as he does by way of a sugar tax, which gives no compensatory return by creating employment; instead of handicapping our dying industries by restricting the credit which the State hitherto allowed to them, he should have imposed, if you like, another tariff, or increased the present tariff on boots and shoes or clothes, upon sugar or sugar confectionery, upon toilet preparations, or patent <Col N="1557" /> medicines&mdash;luxury motor cars if you like&mdash;any one of those things which we can either do without or make at home.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects of the Finance Bill which I should like to deal with, but I think that we can best consider these in detail on the Committee Stage.  I feel, however, that we ought not to allow the measure to go through without calling attention to the fact that it discriminates very heavily against the poorer classes of the people. It is the boast of the Government for a long time that the rate of income tax in the Free State was lower than in Great Britain.  That was only half a truth.</P>
      <P>So far as the wealthier classes of the community are concerned, no doubt it was so; but so far as the people with the smaller incomes were concerned it was not so.  In the Free State the married man with an income of £300 a year, after the allowances to which he is entitled are taken off, would pay in income tax the sum of £3 7s. 6d.  A married man enjoying the same income in Great Britain, and after securing rebates and allowances to which he was entitled under the scale in operation, would only be paying £2 10s. 0d. in income tax.  So that, instead of the income tax on smaller incomes being 25 per cent. lower, as apparently it is, in actuality the income tax upon the smaller incomes in the Free State would be 35 per cent. higher than in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes to give an extra £150,000 to old age pensions.  We do not quarrel with that.  Our only quarrel with it, indeed, is that it is not sufficient, but while the Minister gives £150,000 to the old age pensioners, or to the section of the community from which they are drawn, he, with the other hand, takes away in the form of a sugar tax something like £200,000 from exactly the same section of the population.  A device like that is, to my mind, like dropping a penny, attached to a string into a blind man's tin to make it rattle.  It is just as senseless and unjustifiable and just as hard. For the reason, therefore, that the Finance Bill does not consider the economic needs of the State and people, because it does not propose to grant <Col N="1558" /> any relief to industry and the workers in industry, and because it makes no attempt whatever to deal with the adverse trade balance which is draining our capital, and because the whole incidence of the taxation which it proposes to impose is inequitable and unjust, we feel on those benches that this Finance Bill should not be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to dwell at any length on the proposals in the Bill at this stage, because most of what I shall have to say would be more properly raised on the Committee Stage, but I would like to protest against the continued policy of the Minister in his failure to give any relief to the poorer classes of the taxpayers. As mentioned by Deputy MacEntee, there is no doubt that discrimination is shown against the smaller taxpayers by the Minister in his income tax policy.  That is a matter we have raised year after year for the past three or four years.  There was a time when there was hope that the Minister would give consideration, and very full consideration, to the claims that have been made for a greater measure of relief to earned incomes as against unearned incomes, and a greater measure of relief especially to men with small incomes but large families to support.  There was a discussion on an amendment in 1925 which I moved to increase the allowance on earned incomes from one-tenth to one-sixth, and the Minister is reported as having said on that occasion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would like to say in regard to this amendment&rdquo;&mdash;that was the amendment to increase the amount of the allowance from one-tenth to one-sixth&mdash;&ldquo;that it is admitted that one-tenth is not a sufficient allowance for earned incomes.  Previous to the inauguration of the present system in regard to income tax there was an allowance of 25 per cent.  It is clear that a person who depends on earnings and who, if his labour ceases for any reason, will have nothing to fall back upon, ought not to pay tax on as high a rate as a person who is getting his income from investments.  That is clear enough.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> And later on he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If a time comes at all soon when it is possible to contemplate further reductions of income tax, it will be a matter for consideration whether we should not rather try to do something in the way of reliefs to the poorer taxpayers than spending anything we can afford for income tax reduction on the reduction in the standard rate.&rdquo;&mdash;(Official Reports, Vol. XI, 6th May, 1925.)</P>
    <P>That statement of the Minister in 1925 held out some hope that when the opportunity arose for the reduction of income tax relief would be given to the poorer class of income tax payers. His main excuse that year was that they were reducing the standard rate from 5s. to 4s. and that that was all they could afford to do.  In 1927 he was in a position to reduce the income tax again, but instead of giving that relief, as was clearly indicated in his statement in 1925, either by way of increasing the allowance on earned income or giving a bigger allowance in regard to children, he again reduced the standard rate from 4s. to 3s., and the main measure of that relief went to those who have big incomes or whose incomes are derived from investments. On the same occasion he made what might be regarded as a definite promise in respect of an amendment to increase the allowance for children. He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe that before, or concurrently with, any further reduction in the standard rate some increase in this allowance should be given.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a very definite statement of the Minister in the year 1925, but when money was available in 1927, and he was in a position to reduce the standard rate, he evidently forgot his promise, and there is no indication in this Finance Bill that the Minister proposes to do anything in the future in the direction he indicated.  I think I am safe in saying that all parties in the House and in previous Dála joined in pressing upon the Minister the advisability of changing his policy so as <Col N="1560" /> to give further relief to the poorer taxpayers. It is quite evident that indirect taxation presses more heavily upon the poorer section of the population than on those who have big incomes. A man with a number of children pays a considerable portion of his income away in direct taxation&mdash; apart altogether from the increased taxation&mdash;on clothing and boots, because on all boots a man has to provide for his children he has to pay the import duty.</P>
    <P>I certainly protest against this continued neglect, and what appears to be now the definitely settled policy on the part of the Minister to give whatever reliefs may be given to the richer classes in the community.  I think it is a mistaken policy, and I think it is quite wrong.  There will be further opportunity to discuss these matters on amendments which will be submitted to the sections dealing with income tax. There is a matter that would also perhaps be a Committee point, but I would like to raise it here in order to give the Minister an opportunity to look into it in the meantime, if he has not already considered it.  It is in connection with Section 23 of the Bill under which certain reliefs are given from the entertainments tax on racing. There is a condition set down there that relief will be given to meetings, and only to meetings which are held under the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee or under the Turf Club Rules.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that there is another Association in Ireland, the Irish Racing Association, under which races are held throughout the country in the rural areas.  Small meetings are held under the auspices and control and under certain definite rules of the Irish Racing Association.  I have a list here of some 140 small towns and villages throughout the provinces in which races have been held during the past year or two.</P>

      <P>They are popularly, I believe, called &ldquo;flapper meetings,&rdquo; but they are run under regular rules.  If the argument for reducing <Col N="1561" /> the entertainments tax on racing generally has anything to do with the horse-breeding industry, I think that argument could be equally well applied to these races.  It may not be the same class of horses that you have running at these meetings as at the others.  But if the argument is good in one it is good in the other, and I think there is no justification for the Minister making a distinction.  If he is going to remove the tax in the one instance he should do it in the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that there is.  I am in a position to say that there is.  I had representations from two race committees in my constituency last week to say that they have been informed by the Customs and Excise officer that he will collect the tax.  It was in that way it first came to my notice that this special exemption or condition was made in the section. These races might be described as the poor man's races, one day in the year. The amount of the tax is not very large, because I understand that in a great many cases there is no entrance fee charged except in the case of motors, and that is because these races are got up by the people in the towns. They are not got up by a regular company for the purpose of making money. They have no enclosures.  They cannot charge an entrance fee to the ordinary public.  They charge perhaps on motor cars that go into the course.  Very often these races are got up for some purpose connected with the town, by towns improvements committees, or, in fact, they are got up in connection with some charitable purpose like the Vincent de Paul Society, and in one or two cases that I know of they are got up for the improvement of the local church and schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has given any consideration to this, but I think that he should not make any distinction, and that if he is going to take it away in the case of one class of races that he should take it away altogether.  I believe that this tax would not pay for the trouble of collecting <Col N="1562" /> if left on in these other cases. We know what happened in the case of football where the tax was left on.  In the case of one set of rules the tax was allowed and eventually the Minister saw the wisdom of doing away with it altogether.  There is a strong claim from the small towns and villages that get up this class of races.  I intend to raise this matter here again and I intend to put down amendments on Committee if the Minister does not himself do so.  I want to know what the Minister's intentions are with regard to the matter and whether he is giving it any consideration?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several things which are ignored altogether by the Minister when he brings his Budget before the House.  Many of these have been mentioned already by Deputy MacEntee.  The Minister leaves out of account from the point of view of what people have to pay, several very important matters, but there is one thing he has ignored altogether, and it has an overriding significance.  That is not a matter of opinion, but it is a matter of the Constitution.  I refer to Article 37 of the Constitution.  The words of that Article are: &ldquo;Money shall not be appropriated by vote, resolution or law unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by a message from the representative of the Crown acting on the advice of the Executive Council.&rdquo; That means, I take it&mdash;I stand under correction if I am wrong&mdash;that all money Votes must be submitted to the representative of the Crown, and that means that the British Government is privy to all the proposals before they come before this House.  If that is so, of course there is a dominating influence exercised in the matter, and everything that is done in connection with the Money Bills is on a different footing altogether from any other Bill. It is bad enough that a Bill, after being passed here, should have to go for the Royal Assent, but here the matter is apparently canvassed and discussed in London before it comes before the House.  I notice that whenever questions of a serious nature, involving a certain amount of abstract argument, and when questions of fundamental <Col N="1563" /> principles arise, the attitude of the Government is always one of flippancy which leads one to suspect them to be even more servile than one would like to suspect them of being, because if they were sincere they would probably deal with the thing from a very different angle altogether.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is giving an interpretation to Article 37 which is, to say the least of it, extraordinary.  In any event this Bill does not appropriate money at all.  This is not an Appropriation Bill and it does not appropriate money.  It is a Finance Bill dealing with taxation. An Appropriation Bill follows the Estimates.  It shows the objects for which the money is being appropriated. The question of appropriation does not arise at all in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must allow me to think that there <Col N="1564" /> is no connection whatever.  This is the process of collecting or raising money. The other process is quite separate from that.  The process the Deputy speaks of arises when the Money Resolution&mdash;the Resolution for the expenditure of money&mdash;is submitted for the approval of the House.  It will arise on the Estimates.  It does not arise in this Bill at all.  The whole process does arise in the House, but under different headings, for different purposes and for different Bills.

      <P>I submit to the Ceann Comhairle's ruling in the matter that to discuss the question of appropriation here would be out of place, but my contention is that unless you have your purpose clearly defined you are not going to appropriate money for it, and there is a close connection between the raising of money and its appropriation. When it comes to dealing with an outside source, there is nothing about which this House should be more jealous than allowing any other nation to be privy to what the plans of our Government are about money matters of any sort or description.  I submit that this Article gives an outside Power the opportunity of using an influence which is not a proper influence to use upon the finances of any nation.</P>

      <P>Any construction that the Deputy or anyone else can give to this Article will not have relevance to this Bill.  No construction of the Article, no matter how far-fetched that construction is, can be relevant to this particular Bill. In any event, it appears to me that this, or any other Bill, cannot be used to debate Articles of the Constitution, their value or appropriateness.  This is a separate question altogether. Article 37 has no connection with a Finance Bill.  We appropriate money by Resolution in the Dáil.  We appropriate it eventually by law, but we appropriate it preliminarily by motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to the ruling of the Chair, but my point in general is that it is a very difficult thing to discuss the raising of money without <Col N="1565" /> referring to the appropriation of money.  When you refer to appropriation it involves discussing certain powers which dominate the appropriation of that money.  I do not propose to pursue the matter, but no one can consider the Budget as a whole without taking into consideration certain very important elements, certain very important factors, in the situation.</P>
      <P>The National Debt of this country ignores altogether the Land Loan, which amounts to £120,000,000.  It is all very well on technical grounds and there is a question of controversy in this matter. Some people hold those annuities are paid, not in respect of a National Loan, but in respect of what you might call a public debt; that it is more or less a private concern as between the people who lend the money and the people who have the benefit of the money and who have to pay back annuities.  That is one point of view.  The other point of view is that it is in the nature of a National Loan, a public debt.  Whether you regard it from one point or the other, the payment of this money is all coming from the pockets of the Irish people. When it comes to a question of raising money from the people who are already paying these things, it explains how hard normal taxation falls on the shoulders of the Irish people.  That is a factor which one must take into consideration and it would be far better for the Minister for Finance frankly to admit these restrictions.  It would be better to admit that we are raising money in the country, making for the poverty of the people, rather than push these matters aside, ignore them and not consider them.  If the Minister were to go so far as to admit that these things were burdens upon us, it would be one step towards getting united action from the whole State towards the relief of this situation, which can only be achieved by united action.  With that strength it would be possible to reopen the negotiations connected with the annuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another burden which is upon us is the fact that the Six Counties are excluded from the area of taxation.  These are pretty rich counties and that again throws back the burden of taxation upon the Twenty-six counties.  You have in the other Six Counties a <Col N="1566" /> Government which has no reason for its existence at all.  Perhaps there is nothing which tells so much against the people as that Government in the North from which a contribution is going to England and for which there is no return.  I do not want to pursue the discussion because it is a little bit outside the actual question, but at the same time it is very difficult to consider the question as a whole without making some reference to it.</P>
    <P>As to the trade balance, when one considers the invisible imports and exports, one must take into consideration that the money which comes in from the emigrant is considered as an invisible export.  That is quite proper, but the actual value of the emigrant, the capital value of the emigrant, is not considered.  Again, the investments of Irish capital in England have to be considered and the dividends upon those investments are considered as invisible exports, and properly so; but on the other hand the actual loss of the capital is not allowed for.  If these things were considered it would increase very much our adverse trade balance.  There are other matters concerned of a more detailed nature, but I do not know whether one can discuss them on the actual sections of the Bill or whether it would be better to refer to them here.</P>
    <P>As regards the administration of income tax, I would like to refer to the powers in the hands of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.  Their powers are very arbitrary and they act at the one time as the persons who are making the claim for the money and the judges.  For instance, in the case of excess profits, the excess profits tax as a whole has gone, but if the Commissioners decide in any case that there has been wilful neglect or fraud on the part of the person who should pay income tax, then the Commissioners can reopen the whole case and charge excess profits for the period over which they think fraud or wilful neglect has been committed.  It is most unfair that these Commissioners should at the same time be the people most interested in collecting the money and then be the judges whether it is fraud or wilful neglect.  It would be far better if some authority or tribunal were appointed. <Col N="1567" /> Almost any tribunal would do, whether it would be composed of laymen or lawyers.  It would be a matter that could be easily decided, provided that judgment would be given by somebody who would be independent of the people who are in a sense interested in getting the money.  Naturally one is prejudiced, and the more earnest one is in carrying out one's duties as a public servant the more anxious one is to get money and one's mind would be biased in the matter.  I suggest the Government give consideration to the possibility of setting up some sort of tribunal to deal with a question like this. It is a matter bearing on the gathering in of revenue, because experts think more arrears of income tax would be paid if there were not the menace of this excess profits at all.  In fact, the best thing would be to abolish the collection of excess profits.  The sum is very small and only arises in very few cases, to people who have in the past failed to send in proper returns of income tax.  Take the people who have done it through wilful neglect or fraud. They are not going to make proper returns. They will either clear out and we will lose the benefit of the income tax or do their best to evade it.  Evasion of law is always expensive to those trying to administer the law. Therefore, from the financial point of view, it would be better to abolish excess profits and give people an opportunity of paying up arrears of income tax and clearing the debt which is there.  I know from experience that where people owe £2,000 or £3,000 in arrears of income tax, they are willing to pay that, if they thought it was all. But they know that behind that, if they show their hand, they will have to pay £10,000 or £15,000 in excess profits.  If the excess profits in those cases were abolished, it would make it far more easy for the Government to collect its income tax, and it would be far less expensive also from the point of view of the actual collection.</P>
    <P>There is another matter too.  I have no desire to raise these questions out of their proper time, but I do not see where it will come in under the Finance Bill.  It is a question which vexes <Col N="1568" /> lawyers and other people having to do with the transfer of property.  Income tax may have been paid in respect of certain parts of property, and not paid in other cases.  In the transfer of property the lawyer applies to the Inland Revenue Authorities, and they are informed that income tax has been paid and the property sold.  Some years afterwards the same property is sold again, and a new claim for income tax arises.  The certificate or letter&mdash; it is not even a certificate&mdash;given by the income tax authorities is of no value. It is not binding on them, and they can always go back for the same thing again.  I suggest that the certificate given by the Inland Revenue Authorities should be binding, and some machinery should be established so that when, on the conveyance of property, inquiries are made from the authorities to know if the income tax is paid, some machinery should be set up to ascertain whether income tax has been paid or not.  It is due to some extra departmentalisation under different schedules that at one time it would turn up and at another would not.  It would not be discovered for the time being; it certainly would facilitate the payment of income tax and would be an advantage to the income tax people, because in all these cases everyone is anxious for anything that would expedite payment of income tax.  It would be an advantage from the point of view of the public in general, because it would remove a vexatious matter on the transfer of property.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister, in reply, would indicate where amendments dealing with the matters I have mentioned could be introduced, or whether the Government would be willling to consider these matters themselves.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee treated us to a very carefully prepared discourse, but I do not think it left us any wiser.  If he has any definite things in mind he will have an opportunity to put them forward during the discussion on the Estimates.  What he said with reference to the police can very well be discussed at length on the Vote for the Department of Justice or the Civic Guard.  I think, however, it has got to be recognised in this country that people are not yet, and perhaps will not be for a generation, as willing to co-operate with the police as they are in certain other countries, and this altogether apart from offences of a political character.  Perhaps the readiness to co-operate may come more quickly than I have suggested, may come within a generation, but I think anyone will recognise that in this country a single Guard living in a village by himself will not be effective in the way I understand the village constable is effective in England.  It seems to me until a considerable change has taken place in the public mind and habits of the people that we are bound to find the policing of the people more expensive than that of any neighbouring country.</P>

    <P>Then again, additional duties outside the ordinary police duties have here been imposed on the Civic Guards, and the tendency is to impose new duties on them.  The view has been taken that so long as it is not possible to have a single policeman living by himself, we must have Guards living in barracks.  One of the ways of reducing the cost of the Army is to give additional duties to police, so that they will be giving public service that policemen do not give in other countries, and another thing that has to be borne in mind is that we find the work that is done and that is to be done here by the police is done by outside authorities in Great Britain.  I saw lately in England great numbers of the employees of the Automobile Association doing point duty.  I do not think we are likely to have any outside organisation in this country employed to do point duty for a considerable time.  The question of the Army can be discussed when the Army Vote comes on.  There is not much use in the sort of statement <Col N="1570" /> that Deputy MacEntee makes that all kinds of popular expenditure will be maintained and increased, and that great savings will be effected in directions which will meet with no general opposition.</P>
    <P>We have to bear in mind in addition that the hardship of taxation depends in part on the actual weight of the burden and in part on the return or the lack of return that is given for it. I think I have invited Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches to put forward any suggestions they may have for the abandonment of services that do not seem to be worth the money spent on them.  Deputy MacEntee talked about the subscriptions to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  No doubt if a big effort had been made more people could have been induced to subscribe, but it has to be borne in mind that it was not as good an investment as National Loan, because it was issued at par, and the rate of interest was 5 per cent., while the National Loan had been issued at 97.  When we did issue the National Loan we made a big effort to get money, and plenty of money was obtainable.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee talked about the decay of breweries and distilleries, but there are two factors in operation there.  So far as breweries are concerned there has been a process of centralisation and there has been a tendency for the smaller breweries to go out of operation.  So far as both breweries and distilleries are concerned there has been a decline in the consumption of alcoholic liquor.  That has been brought about very largely by the high taxation, but it is not due entirely to high taxation.  There was a change taking place in the habits of the people in any case.  I have been informed by people who took an interest in the matter that before high taxation was introduced there had been a fairly steady increase in the habits of temperance in the country.  High taxation besides making it impossible for certain people to procure liquor and so operating to reduce consumption, has operated in an indirect way also in preventing people, who might otherwise have done so, from taking to the use of liquor.  It is one of those cases where <Col N="1571" /> one could hardly say that the industry has been killed by taxation because there is another factor responsible also.  In so far as distilling is concerned the distillers have had to face competition from a country where whiskey is made by a different and a cheaper process which leaves a margin to the manufacturers for advertising that manufacturers carrying on under the old process here have not.  Then the distilling industry has been very much injured by legislation in other countries.  It has been tremendously affected by the enactment of prohibition in America.  The placing of that industry on a basis which would give it some hope of recovery is a difficult matter.  It is one in which distillers have been very much engaged of late, in which they have been in consultation to some extent with the Government and in which we are anxious to assist them.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee talked in his oratorical way about the tributes to England.  If Deputy MacEntee has anything serious to say about that matter, or if any member of his Party believes in the things they have been saying outside about it, he can put down a motion in this House in reference to it and have it discussed.  If it is all that they say it is, it is a matter worthy of consideration and much more worthy of having a motion put down in reference to it than many of the trivial matters that have been the subject of motions here.  Deputy O'Connell referred to the question of the relief of small taxpayers.  He says that I had in previous years expressed sympathy with his proposals and his arguments.  That is quite correct.  The difficulty that we have been up against here was the difficulty of doing something in the way of giving relief from taxation that would tend to stimulate industry and to encourage the giving of further employment.  We gave a reduction in income tax in the hope and in the belief that it would have that effect and that it would benefit not merely the small taxpayer but also the person who is exempt from income tax by improving his chances of employment. It would be impossible this <Col N="1572" /> year to give relief to the small taxpayer unless we were prepared to impose some taxation not foreshadowed in this Bill.  I do not believe that we could at the present stage make up the loss that would be occasioned by relief to the small taxpayers because we are setting out to get an extra £250,000 in the way of arrears beyond what the Revenue Commissioners could have obtained in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>If we decided at this stage to give certain reliefs to the small taxpayers and to increase the rate of taxation, that process would so impede the collection of the tax that it would be impossible to obtain from income tax the amount we estimated in the Budget. Consequently it would be necessary to impose some tax other than income tax to make up whatever the cost might be of the increase in the relief to small taxpayers.  It is a matter to which I have given some consideration.  I would cause a scheme to be formulated during the year to enable relief to be given to small taxpayers, but that scheme would certainly involve some other increase in the rates or some other changes affecting the larger taxpayers. If such a scheme were formulated and were ready in advance it might be possible in a subsequent financial year to give the reliefs that Deputy O'Connell has in mind to small taxpayers without reducing the yield in income tax.  At this stage it would not be possible to do that, and it would simply mean that if an amendment were now to be introduced giving this relief to the small taxpayer we would have to look around and see what other tax could be imposed to make up for the money that would be lost in that way.  With regard to Section 23 and the Irish Racing Association, I cannot claim to have fully considered this matter, but the Inter-Departmental Committee which sat to consider the position of Irish racing recommended that the entertainment tax should be taken off only in the case of meetings controlled by the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee or the Turf Club.  I believe the view that is taken is that the flapper meetings are of no assistance to the horse-breeding industry and are not of any great commer- <Col N="1573" /> cial importance.  In fact, the increase in the number of these flapper meetings has injured other meetings that are of commercial importance.</P>
    <P>I am looking into the matter, but so far as I have gone into it that is how I understand it.  The Deputy was slightly wrong in suggesting that at one time taxation was taken off one sort of football and kept upon the other.  What happened was this: the tax was legally payable in respect of all sorts of football, but the British Government here illegally refrained from collecting it in respect of one association, and we continued their bad practice.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General drew attention to the fact that the Revenue Commissioners were not collecting tax payable by the G.A.A., and we proceeded to regularise the position of the Revenue Commissioners by remitting the tax in the case of all these games.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little talked about Article 37. I do not know whether I could at the moment satisfy Deputy Little about the matter, but these Money Messages are really obtained only in cases such as Estimates or Bills which propose the expenditure of money.  The Money Messages have nothing to do with Bills which impose taxation, but only with Bills which deal with expenditure.  For instance, a Bill in connection with which a Money Message was received was the Old Age Pensions Bill.  With reference to the further point about outside people having the supervision of our business in connection with our money, I would like to tell the Deputy that what happens in connection with these Money Messages is that they are prepared by the Secretary of the Department of Finance.  They are sent to the Governor-General and signed by him, and are then brought back by the person who took them up.  That is about all that happens in connection with them.</P>

      <P>If he did not sign them there would be a Constitutional crisis.  Deputy Little was one of the people who spoke about land annuities. That is a matter as I have said that, if people have the feeling that Deputy Little appears to have, certainly deserves a discussion.  The collection of Excess Profits Tax is almost at an end. I do not think at this stage that it would be worth making any change.  I am sure the Deputy had some particular case in mind when he spoke of it, and I will discuss the matter with a view to seeing whether in fact it would be desirable to do anything.  At the moment I do not think so, but I will undertake to look into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point about Schedule A, Property Tax, I have known <Col N="1575" /> cases where the solicitor acting for a purchaser did not take care to make inquiries as to whether the tax was paid or not, and people who purchased property found themselves liable for a tax that they did not anticipate.  But in particular cases, one or two of which were brought to my notice, the fault lay with the solicitors.  If Deputy Little could tell me of a case in which an inquiry was made from the Revenue Authorities, and an answer given which was then found to be in fact inaccurate or incomplete, I would be glad if he would give me particulars.</P>

      <P>I will look into the point that Deputy O'Donovan raised about agricultural shows.  I think we had it up last year or the year before, and we made certain amendments in the law as it was then. I do not know how these have worked out, but I will look into that matter further.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a question in connection with the <Col N="1576" /> allowance for children over sixteen. The question was raised by Deputy Davin two years ago, and the Minister promised to look into it.  It is with regard to the exemption of young men who are in ecclesiastical colleges like Clonliffe and Maynooth.  I am given to understand that a man who has a son at one of these ecclesiastical colleges gets no relief in his income tax, whereas if his son is being educated at a university or a lay college he does get exemption.  I would like to know what the position is.  I hardly believe that there is no exemption in the case of these people, but if that is the position, I think the Minister ought to set it right.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was dealing with certain matters that had been raised on this Estimate, one being the question of transport As I fear certain remarks that I made have been mis interpreted, I desire briefly to recapitulate one or two points.  I have made no statement that there is not going to be anything done with regard to the advent of motor buses in competition <Col N="1579" /> with the railways.  I have said that, in so far as there are bus regulations required for the safeguarding of passengers and matters of that sort, these regulations are the subject of discussion at the moment, and that legislation will likely be brought in to give effect to the Committee's Report.  I have said further that a particular finance scheme has been adopted with regard to the upkeep of the roads, and that there may have to be certain changes made in regard to the incidence of taxation as it presses on different classes of motors, and that if such changes are found to be necessary they also are going to be made.  That reduced the whole question of co-ordination and control to a very narrow point. It meant control in the sense of the allocation of routes and a statement with regard to fares as well as the possibility that, Deputy Davin I think added, of having scheduled timetables to which the buses would have to run.  I pointed out that that would have to be narrowed in its application only to public road services plying for passengers.  I went through that in order to get this problem brought down to the narrowest possible limit, but even on that I have not stated that there is not going to be anything done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated that there were two big objections to anything being done at present. One was that it meant the adoption of a particular principle that, where certain people made a decision that there was too much competition, then somebody was going to be debarred from competing.  I wanted the House to have it before it hereafter that such a decision is to be taken, and to realise that if that decision is taken with regard to transport, it inevitably is going to have a wider application than merely to bus traffic.  My second objection to anything being done at the moment was that there was no one in a position to state, after careful consideration and on ascertained facts, what is the proper minimum fare that could be set down as a charge.  I am ready to move on this matter when information, properly verified, comes before me, and further when the people who are said to be prejudiced by <Col N="1580" /> motor transport, as it exists at the moment, raise that as a complaint.  I have had the closest possible association with the amalgamated railway company since it was formed, and never once have they put in any demand with regard to any sort of restrictive control in the case of bus traffic.  They did ask at one time that they should be given permission to run buses on the roads themselves.  They were given that permission last year.</P>
    <P>Then, on the other hand, there are the local authorities from whom we get complaints voiced by two or three Deputies that the ratepayers have to pay too much for the upkeep of the roads.  That contention, I think, I have already answered.  The second point is that the roads, no matter what moneys are being put into them, are not at the moment able to stand up against the present wear and tear occasioned by the bus traffic.  I have already pointed out that there is the Roads Act of 1920. Under that Act a local authority, on its own initiative, can move to get a road closed.  I pointed out to the House that under that Act there had been six applications made.  Of the six, one was granted completely, one was granted partially, and one was referred back with the statement that the order asked for by the local authority was not one that came under the Act, and that an order could be made to accomplish the same purpose.  As regards the three others they were not followed up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean to suggest that under that Act powers are given to a local authority to close a public road permanently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the terms of the Act yesterday.  Three reasons must be stated when application is made to have a road closed.  Under Section 7, sub-section (4) of the Roads Act. 1920, the Minister may, by order, on the application of any county council after holding a public inquiry prohibit or restrict the driving of vehicles of any specified class on any specified highway in any case in which it appears to him there would be a danger to the vehicle or passengers or other traffic using the highway, or where a <Col N="1581" /> highway was unsuitable for such vehicles.</P>
      <P>On such an application being made to the Minister for Local Government, the Department of Local Government have a definite policy which they follow with regard to the closing of a road.  After the application has been made by a local authority to have a road closed a public inquiry is held.  As regards three of the six applications which were sent in asking to have roads closed, three were dropped when the county councils in question found that there was a necessity of holding a public inquiry.  As regards local authorities, that is the only use that has been made of the Act by them.</P>
      <P>As long as that is the case, how can people come along here and complain that the county councils are feeling the burden of the increased rate in the rates on account of heavy bus traffic? In the first place, if that contention is made, it can be refuted quite easily by the figures.  The actual amount contributed from the rates to the roads has lessened year by year in the last three years.  At present it is slightly below the figure that at one time was decided on as being the proper contribution from the rates.  When speaking yesterday I went into a certain amount of detail.  I want it to be understood that there is no hesitation in facing up to this problem once complaints are put forward by the local authority or by the amalgamated company, which is the only railway service operating completely in the 26 Counties.  The point I want to make is that the volume of complaints from the county councils to the Minister for Local Government has not been sufficient to raise this whole question so that it should be regarded as one of extreme urgency.  As I have said, the amalgamated company has made no representations on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another remark of mine that I think was misunderstood.  I have not said that I would regard, or do regard, with equanimity the railways becoming merely a goods carrying service. I agree with Deputy Lemass in what he said, that the railways must be maintained here.  Circumstances that arise may alter that point of view, but the circumstances as seen at the moment <Col N="1582" /> back that point of view.  The railways must be maintained.  There are certain types of service to be rendered to the country that at the moment can only be rendered by the railways company.  If there are certain other subsidiary services which the railways company can render and which other companies at the moment have taken away from the railways, leaving them a little lean and in a state tending towards bankruptcy, then, certainly, even though it may mean the introduction of some new principle with regard to the closing down of competition, that new principle will have to be adopted.</P>
    <P>I have not said that I regard passengers as being irretrievably lost to the railways.  The railways company, while not making any complaint to the Department most closely in touch with them, have on occasions publicly put forward what amounts to that argument, but they have not specifically stated that a certain amount of passenger traffic may be regarded or is being regarded by them as being irretrievably lost.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I could not find myself in agreement with that argument if it were put up.  Certainly if such an argument were put up publicly before the Railway Tribunal, it would be argued against.  I know, of course, that there is a certain disposition amongst people to regard the passenger traffic on the railways as being irretrievably lost.  If that contention were made before the Railway Tribunal, and if the Tribunal agreed to it, then necessarily a reaction to the decision of the Tribunal must follow in this way: that the railways must readjust their whole service so that they will become a goods-carrying service.  I regard the whole argument as a rather absurd one.  It is for the railway company to give better service and convenience than the buses, and to see what they can do in the way of economy. They are now given power to put buses on the road, and they can draw back passengers from the type of bus that has taken them away.</P>

      <P>Of course, they are in a different position.  There are restrictions that the Dáil thought fit to impose, and which I myself was not anxious to have imposed.  These restrictions were imposed owing to the fears that the railway company, being a wealthy corporation, would be able to run buses all over the country and crush out competitive services, and once that was done the community would not get the advantage of the different types of transport and the lower fares that competition brought about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at my request. If the Deputy would read the debate that took place when the matter was under discussion, he would see that I was not seeking that any restrictions should be put on them.  If I had my way, I would have a simple piece of legislation giving the railway company power to run on the roads and nothing else.  As a matter of fact, amendments were forced in on that Bill with which I was not in agreement, and I think I expressed my disagreement with them. The question of nationalisation was raised in a funny way yesterday.  It <Col N="1584" /> was raised in the course of an argument that I thought was as to whether or not there should be commercial control of the buses, or some Government Departmental control.  How nationalisation comes in to affect that problem I do not see.  It was not a question of nationalisation as against amalgamation that was under discussion.  The question was should certain types of motor vehicle transport be under control of a Government Department equally with the railways, whatever control the Department has over the railways, or whether they should be left as they are.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass said when asked for his policy that if it should turn out to be that nationalisation was the solution the Fianna Fáil Party would face up to nationalisation.  I would not like to stand up here and give out a statement of policy which was based on the hypothesis of Deputy Lemass, that if as regards trade, transport, or anything else, it should be found hereafter that something was the policy, I should not hesitate to adopt it.  That is not an intelligent reaction to the question asked.  It may be that what Deputy Lemass did mean was that he was not scared by the word &ldquo;nationalisation,&rdquo; and is ready to face up to it under particular circumstances.  But when Deputy Davin asked him under the present circumstances what was the policy of Fianna Fáil towards the railway situation as complicated by the advent of bus competition, all that Deputy Lemass could say was that he did not regard the 1924 Act as a permanent solution of the railway problem, which no one suggested it is, but if nationalisation should turn out to be the solution he would be ready to accept it. That, as far as I can gather, was Fianna Fáil's contribution to the transport problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  A statement quoted here yesterday as having been made by the President on the Second Reading of the Railways Bill was that this was the proposition under particular circumstances.  There was a hint given there, and it was relied upon yesterday by certain speakers as <Col N="1585" /> an argument that there would be a further advance.  But certainly the President would not say at the moment that the advance is towards nationalisation, or that nationalisation is the solution at the moment.  I will go so far short of Deputy Davin.  I do not know where the Fianna Fáil Party stands on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. CASSIDY Mr. CASSIDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CASSIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in the year 1922 the Government set up a Commission to inquire into the railways, that three members of the Commission recommended nationalisation and that only one member recommended amalgamation, and that the Government accepted the minority rather than the majority recommendation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact, but it does not carry us any farther. Deputy Davin is of opinion that the number of railway directors is the cause, or partly the cause, of the failure of the Railway Act.  He complained that the Government had fixed the number of railway directors at fifteen, and that the Government were not consistent, as afterwards the Electricity Supply Board was set up with a lesser number of directors than fifteen.  The Deputy tried to draw the conclusion that if we were right about the railways we were wrong about the Electricity Supply Board, and also that the argument applied the other way.  There is no application of the argument from the railway directors to the Electricity Supply Board.  The Deputy did not quote the Railway Act correctly.  The Act states that as regards the number of directors under the amalgamation scheme there was to be a minimum of twelve and a maximum of fifteen.  One must remember the circumstances under which the Act was passed.  It meant the amalgamation of certain groups of railways, and each of the larger groups had its own directors. There had to be such a number agreed to at the start as would give representations to the various interests, for there were interests to be reconciled in the early years of the amalgamation and absorption scheme.  Supposing an amendment was contemplated now, it would be a useful thing to withdraw the minimum number and not to put <Col N="1586" /> any number in.  It would be a useful amendment to say that the amalgamated company should be run by a Board, by the people who settled the previous amalgamation scheme, or a minimum number to be fixed by the Railway Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that the amalgamation scheme was settled by the railway companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made no suggestion that comes anywhere near to that.  Surely the question of the directors, what pay they get, the number of them, and whether they are so numerous that they are clogging efficiency, is a question for the shareholders. The railways are not Government controlled, but they are subject to Government intervention, and have to be controlled under statutory regulations by the proprietors of the several companies.  It is a matter for the shareholders to decide what the number of the directors should be and how they are to be paid.  Even though there is a minimum number of twelve set down, it is easier for the shareholders if they agree that the number of effective directors should be less to do as was done in connection with the Electricity Supply Board, and insist that a certain number should be part-time and a certain number whole-time, with salary and emoluments fixed according to the work done.  That is a matter for the proprietors of the company, for the shareholders themselves.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore quoted me as saying that transport was all right and the Railway Act was a wonderful success. I object to the adjective &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo;&mdash;I never made any statement of the sort.  I say the Act was successful in what it set out to achieve, and where it has been rendered unsuccessful, as it has been partly unsuccessful, that is by reason of a definite and new form of transport which was not in contemplation when the Act was passed, and which has to be looked to, but as to which we have not the full details to get a proper decision as to what is to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider the present situation with regard to the Railway Tribunal and the prospects <Col N="1587" /> of standard charges satisfactory &mdash;does he consider, for instance, that standard charges that will have any permanent value are likely to be settled in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Most decidedly. One has only to follow the proceedings of the Tribunal and the arguments put before it to see just why the rates and fares should be reduced and what prospects there are of getting reductions. There may be a particular hold-up by reason of the fact that Deputy Davin referred to, that an appeal has been entered on certain points.  An attempt is being made to expedite that appeal, but it is not right to discuss here the matters that are in dispute in that appeal.  I said before, and I say again, that the Act itself reduced rates and fares&mdash;in fact brought about a reduction of more than 12½ per cent.; it was nearer to 15 per cent.  than anything else&mdash;and saved the railways an expenditure of £777,000.  These things alone, stated in that way, are a justification of the amalgamation scheme, and there is no well-informed opinion at present against that scheme.  That being stated, I have only to add a further point, that the amalgamation scheme was never regarded as the last word to be said even about railway transport.  It certainly was the last word to be said at a particular time, and it stands justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several points have been raised with regard to buses.  Deputy Davin raised a point as to insurance, and made the statement, I think, that passengers who travel by the Dublin United Tramways Company's buses are insured, or that they have, at any rate, a chance of some compensation being recovered by themselves or their relatives in case of accidents, but that in regard to other buses there is no such thing.  Again, that is a matter which should be attended to by the Committee dealing with traffic regulations, but even at present that is working itself out, because there is no doubt that people are getting informed of the fact that certain chances with regard to compensation and insurance go with travelling on a particular type of bus, and do not <Col N="1588" /> go with travelling on another type of bus.  If that fact were widely advertised, it would certainly bring most of the companies up to the standard of the better ones, and would possibly in itself help to reduce the number of competitive buses that really have no right to be in existence.</P>
    <P>A further point has been made as to the free stances for buses granted by local authorities.  That may have come to the point again that it is a serious nuisance at certain places to have a congregation of people waiting for or getting off buses, but again the local authorities are concerned.  As to there being any injustice in that, the tramways company are not charged for resting places or stopping places for their cars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>They pay rates and for wayleaves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the buses pay for the upkeep of the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The buses pay, or are intended to pay&mdash;I go no further than that&mdash;for the damage which they do to the roads.  If that doesn't satisfy the Deputy, and he puts up the point that they in fact are not, I say what I mentioned before, that the incidence of the tax between the private motor car and motor bicycle, the heavy motor lorry and the heavy passenger bus, may not be right and may have to be adjusted, but in fact motorists as a whole are paying for the extra money that has to be expended on the roads by reason of the fact that they run over them.  The tramways company, for instance, do not pay for a stance around Nelson's Pillar, and the buses do not pay for a stance near O'Connell Bridge&mdash;they are equal in that.  The tramways company pay for wayleaves, and they have to keep certain portions of the road.  But that was in particular conditions&mdash;that was when the tramways company were granted a monopoly of tram transport in the city, and also by reason of the fact that in running over certain streets they restricted the use of these streets to the ordinary user of the highway and were made pay for it.  The roads were built <Col N="1589" /> for the ordinary type of vehicle that the ordinary person would own, and if there is any question of wear and tear of the roads, I meet it again by the old argument&mdash;that the buses ought to pay. We are making an attempt to see that the buses and other types of motor vehicles will pay.  If that has not been successful to date, it will be more successful in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>What do the bus companies pay for the use they make of the tramway track between Dublin and Dalkey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing; no more than Deputy Davin pays for the use of it; no more than I pay for it in a private car; no more than the ordinary person who drives on the ordinary outside car about town.  What happened was that the Tramways Company were made to pay extra because they got the right to run trams through the city and they were granted a monopoly of tram transport.  That is what that comes to.  If the trams were not there, there would be an ordinary road, and for the wear and tear of that the buses would be paying.  If there happens to be a different type of road set up for the trams, the Tramways Company got certain considerations for it.</P>
      <P>I do not pay much heed to the argument of Deputy Lemass, that the buses were financed by British firms in order to break the Irish railways.  One might as well say that some very suspicious Englishman interested in the L.M.S. Railway Company might say that the English buses were financed by a lot of cross-grained, antagonistic Irishmen to smash their railway companies.  The argument would cut both ways, and is equally ludicrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to a matter raised by Deputies MacEntee, Goulding and Derrig in different forms as to the ratepayers' contribution to the roads. Deputy Derrig said that the ratepayers were heavily mulcted in rates for damage to the roads by the buses. They, in fact, are not.  If one takes the contribution of the ratepayers to the Road Fund in 1914, takes the contribution to-day, takes the value of wages, the difference in wages paid now as compared with 1914, there is, in fact, <Col N="1590" /> less work being done on the roads at the expense of the ratepayers than in 1914.  The extra proportion of the money that the ratepayers have to find, compared with what they found in 1914, is less than the percentage increase of wages as between 1914 and to-day.  Deputy Goulding would not admit my contention about the percentage increase being a fair one.  That is a matter that could be argued on another occasion.  The policy, at all events, was to make the ratepayers simply pay the old bill, the adjustment being made in the value of money. Deputy Goulding went on to say that, despite the fact that some roads are closed, others will not stand up to the traffic.  I invite him to call the attention of his local authority to the Road Act of 1920 and let application be made and see what follows from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. GOULDING Mr. GOULDING">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOULDING</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the County Waterford practically all the work on the roads is done by piece-work&mdash;the greater proportion of it&mdash;and that the rates paid for the piece-work are practically the same as in 1914, but the ratepayers have not the same bill to pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratepayer is paying something less than 50 per cent. over the 1914 contribution.  I do not know if it applies to this particular county, but all over the country there was a calculation made, and the basis for the policy was as I have described. It was discovered that the increase in wages and cost of material certainly represented an increase of about 121 per cent. over 1914.  The amount contributed by the ratepayers for road-making&mdash;the average for 1923-4-5 over 1914&mdash;is about 98 per cent, so that it was considered that the ratepayers were not paying any more.  There was another basis taken for the rates that in future it was considered they should pay.  County Waterford did make an application under the 1920 Act, but it was not proceeded with when it was discovered that there would have to be a public inquiry.  I do not know whether it was that the local authority did not think itself strong enough to stand up to a public inquiry, but for <Col N="1591" /> some reason the application was not proceeded with.</P>
      <P>The question of the reorganisation of the railways has been raised; that has been looked to every day since the Amalgamation Act.  It is being done on a proper basis.  Deputy Cassidy said the Inter-Departmental Committee could not consider reorganisation under the terms of its reference.  Of course it could not.  It was deliberately precluded from considering that. This Committee has only to consider one aspect of the whole situation. Deputy Derrig advanced the contention that any man could advance without any thought; that the railways should be reorganised to meet the new conditions, without describing the new conditions, or showing that he knew anything about them, or giving any hint as to what reorganisation was. Deputy O'Reilly had the same point of view, that some sort of co-ordination and reorganisation were necessary.  As a matter of fact that whole question is being looked to in detail.  There have been suggestions for reorganisation along certain lines, and, even suggestions as to methods by which schemes which were proposed to the railway company, and more or less denied by them, could be better tackled, and even an invitation was issued to the railway company that another point of view could be brought to bear upon certain proposals put before them.  I hope there will be some advance.  The matter is more or less sub judice between the railway management and other people at the moment, but I hope that there will be sufficient reorganisation at any rate from the demand made upon them with regard to the latest endeavour in that way.  However, this is a question I would rather not go into detail on.  We must still wait and look for results somewhere towards the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I agree, but I did not think that Deputy Davin was leaving the other side of the railway service just so quickly.  Deputy Cassidy raised one particular question which I would like to deal with before I leave this question of transport, that is that the motor lorry is a competitor with the railway in Donegal.  Either he is misinformed or I am.  There is certainly a conflict between us.  I understand that most of the lorries that ply in Donegal are in fact registered in Donegal, and by reason of certain reciprocal arrangements, are enabled to go into Derry City without the payment of a certain tax.  I believe that actual conditions under which something approaching a reciprocal arrangement has been arrived at do in fact favour the lorry registered in the 26 Counties as opposed to one registered in the Six Counties.</P>

If that bus starts with a certain number of passengers and comes inside this area and goes out without having a greater number of passengers than it had coming in, without having taken up or having dropped any passengers, there is a remission&mdash; there is no tax to pay.

      <P>Yes, but it is on the licence duty question that the reciprocal arrangement comes in.  Certain buses are registered here and ply, I understand, in the Six Counties.  They are registered here, and they do not have to register in the Six Counties. If Deputies will look at the regulations I do not think a change in the present arrangements would be proposed.  I think the arrangement is quite satisfactory from our point of view.</P>
      <P>I should like to clear the air on one point, raised previously, with regard to a certain report that is expected from the Railway Tribunal.  I made inquiries as to that report and I find it is held up by a delay occasioned by myself in not having sent forward the names for a particular panel to be established.  That report is ready for printing now and will be available soon, but the delay was occasioned by myself in not being able to get certain nominees in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point raised was the delay <Col N="1594" /> of the railway company on the matter of standard charges.  There is going to be occasioned a slight delay owing to the appeal, if that appeal is not taken quickly, as was suggested.  With regard to standard charges, I would like simply to draw a comparison admitting that the conditions are not equal between the imposition of the standard charges here and in Great Britain.  The British Railway Act was the Act of 1921 and the standard charge for the British railways only became operative from the 1st of January this year.  Of course they had much more to consider.  It is a different situation, but at the same time, even though there may not be the same mileage and the same conflicting interests, the problem is essentially the same one.  It was a very complicated and difficult one to argue here, and the fact that the Tribunal, as far as its own efforts were concerned had been brought clean up against the imposition of standard charges this month is very definitely in their favour.  They have got through their work more speedily than was expected, and only for this appeal they would have come down to the last point on the standard charges and we would be in the position shortly to have the standard charges in operation.</P>
    <P>The geological survey was raised as a special point by some speakers.  I may have misled the House by joining up the geological survey and the transfer of the office to a few remarks I made regarding a new Vote I am asking for, for trial boring and the sinking of trial pits.  I did not mean that there is not going to be any geological survey except when there is commercial possibility from it.  The survey will go on in the ordinary way.  There are certain things to be done in the season that goes on in the ordinary way.  But I wanted to emphasise the fact that I could not use the sum of money I am asking for special borings and trial pits except there was a possibility of commercial development from it.  Otherwise I put it to the House if it is expected that as part of the geological survey there should be boring done, and trial pits sunk, obviously there is going to be no prospecting <Col N="1595" /> done in the country except by my Department. There is no firm that will do that work for itself.  Rather will they come to my Department, make an appeal and say that they are likely to have a proposition, but they want certain information.  They will ask what the surface indications are and what is shown by the geological survey.  Possibly they will ask us to proceed to make borings, and borings are a very expensive item.  One of the matters referred to by one Deputy could easily cost £20,000, and there might not be any result; there might be only the result that there is nothing there, and that the particular vein had run out and nothing could be looked for from it.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with Deputy Lemass's phrase, that information now in the hands of the Geological Department is useless.  I think there was a lot of valuable material collected, but it is quite clear that there were new developments brought about during the war period which enabled services of a more complete character to be made, services of an up-to-date type which give perfectly good results.  Also there are newer technical methods employed. At the moment there is quite a lot of valuable information as a result of previous geological surveys in hands, but that has to be revised, and a certain amount of work has to be kept up from year to year.  All that will be looked to.  There is really a lot of information available at the moment.  I put it to the Executive Council that as there was going to be a mass of information soon in the hands of the people of this country that they never had before arising out of classified particulars from the census of population and production, that around about the same time we also should have brought up to date and tried out by the newer methods of information that could be got, certain particulars with regard to the geology of the country and its mineral wealth.  That is the aim that is at the back of this.</P>
    <P>A lot of criticism has been made in regard to the industrial side.  Deputies have complained that I should have spoken on certain matters, and that I <Col N="1596" /> should not have gone into such detail with regard to the description of the machine such as the industrial branch is.  I dealt with two aspects because I learned from observation that there were two matters about which people were talking at the moment, the question of transport and the particular branch of my own Ministry which has to deal with industrial development.  I find, by reason of the fact that I did deal in detail with that, I got the type of comment made by Deputy Derrig that this is a huge machine.  It is not a huge machine.  The criticism of Deputy Flinn was much more accurate, that, if anything, it is too small for the purpose. It cannot be described as a huge machine, modelled on British lines, or any other such description that comes readily to the mind of any Deputy who has not thought much about the thing. These remarks about dealing with Irish matters in a small and in a petty way rather than in a broad and generous spirit come quite readily to those who have not considered the subject.  Anybody who uses those remarks has not given the slightest thought, apparently, to what is required and if there is anything deficient.</P>
    <P>If it is thought the branch is not doing its work very efficiently, I would like to have a test case brought to me. It is only by test cases that matters like this can be threshed out.  I would like to have an example of an industry in this country which is employing a certain number of men and which is enjoying a certain amount of capital, which has shown certain results and which, if some type of Government assistance were mentioned and given to it, it would mean an increased number of men being employed, would give better results, and would get additional capital in order to increase the industry.  It is only by the application of particular remedies to particular cases that we will discover whether the remedy would be too costly in view of the effect to be produced.  The cost of any remedy of that sort has to be borne by the general taxpayer.  It is only when we have particular instances given that we are going to get to any improvement in the whole situation.</P>
    <P>There is machinery set up here. <Col N="1597" /> Deputy Lemass says it is not the machinery but the outlook that directs the machinery that counts, and the function of the Department should not be confined to the administration of statutes, but should be directed to stimulating industry.  I think yesterday I cut out entirely all the statutory duties, except that I referred to them incidentally by saying that the people engaged in statutory duties had also imposed on them an extra duty&mdash;that they were to report in a way not imposed by statute upon conditions in certain areas and upon conversations they had had with people who ran certain industries; they were to state what seemed to be the impediment in industry, what were the impediments that certain industries seemed to labour under, and they were to suggest remedies if they thought they were available. I left out completely the statutory duties, but statutory duties have to be mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig says that these statutory duties were imposed by a foreign Parliament and were taken over simply en masse by this Parliament. I would like the Deputy to go through these and sift out the ones he thinks are unnecessary or the ones he thinks that are necessary but are extravagant in our present circumstances. Even where it is thought the administration is being over-done and there is too much attention paid to inspection and Trade Board work, I will meet the Deputy on all these points, but it has to be after the House has had the point of view expressed relating to some instance of factory inspection and other matters.  It has not been found in this Department that the inspectorial or factory duties that have to be performed are any hindrance to the work of the industrial branch.  I claim that the people engaged in the enforcement of this work have brought back valuable information very often to headquarters with regard to certain industries in the country and have been able to bring back certain indications of policy and remedies to the people engaged in the industry.  In that way the whole staff has been used for the purpose of industrial development.</P>
    <P>I was stirred to a certain amount of <Col N="1598" /> enthusiasm when I heard Deputy Lemass say that unemployment was the responsibility of the State and that with a properly-directed policy unemployment could be made to disappear. I hope it is not for merely party reasons that he is going to withhold the secret as to how unemployment can be done away with.  It is a question that everyone would like to have settled.  We find Deputy Lemass urging three or four matters.  One is the protection question that we have dealt with at length on other occasions. I dealt with that on one particular occasion when we spoke of tariffs, but only from the point of view of employment. There are certain tariffs put on in this country which result in decreased employment in the country. The results which follow are so valuable that even the decrease in employment might be faced.  There are certain tariffs asked for where a likely result would be a decrease in employment. Merely to say that there should be tariffs does not mean that tariffs will increase employment.  The Deputy stated there should be protection for the home market.  There should be, he said, provision of capital for Irish industry, more efficient management and better technical skill.  Which can the Government supply?  Protection has been supplied to a very big number of industries and will be supplied again where a case is made.  As regards the provision of capital, the only moneys at my disposal are moneys under the Trade Loans Act and that Act has not been availed of.  Why, I am not in a position to say.  I know there are statements made that the Act is too tightly drawn and there should be a provision for providing working capital.  I think we had better postpone the debate on that until the Act comes up for renewal, as I intend to have it renewed.  As regards efficient management and technical skill, no Government can supply these things unless the Deputy means that the Government is to go around getting efficient managers, feeing them and asking them to run certain industries or get technically skilled people, fee them and put them into certain industries.</P>
    <P>I did not gather if Deputy Lemass <Col N="1599" /> had gone into that point.  He did say that there should be State participation in the way that he mentioned, following the line of the pamphlet brought out by the Liberal Party in England.  He said that there should be a State Investment Trust, and that that State trust should be provided with money and be able to put it into Irish industry.  That is not the first time such a suggestion was made.  I remember at one time here when banks in the country were under discussion and the question of credit both for agriculture and industry was raised, the statement was made and accepted pretty readily by those here at the time, that for the ordinary good, safe type of business proposition, the banks, had not failed in their duty.  The banks had put up whatever money was necessary for a good safe business proposition. If any complaints had been made against the banks in the last few years, those complaints would be in regard to certain land transactions&mdash;that in fact the banks lent money too readily and too liberally, and that the people who borrowed from them are now feeling the pinch of hard times. But it was also stated that it was not the function of the banks to provide industrial initiative.  It was stated that it was not their function to be opportunists in the way of looking for the establishment of industry in the country; that it was not their function to be optimistic about the establishment of industry in the country.  There is lacking in this country what there is in other countries&mdash;some sort of investment corporation, whose business it is to provide the industrial initiative and that experience which lead to the optimism that is necessary to get business going in the country.</P>
    <P>Various methods have been canvassed as to how one can get that combination; and a proper regard and belief in the country's possibilities altogether, without a certain amount of funds.  The fact of the matter is that most of the people who have been interested in the finances of this country are of the safe conservative type, who are very pessimistic about the chances of development in the country.  The <Col N="1600" /> people who are optimistic are for the most part inexperienced, and nobody could count on them in starting industries. But even if one were to develop on the lines that Deputy Lemass suggested, and it is a line that was suggested years ago in this country, along which we have endeavoured to go, one will find that the difficulties are personnel. Supposing that there was money at the disposal of a State Investment Trust, supposing those moneys were there ready to be handed over and that this was a corporation whose business it was to go round and water the ground for industrial development, where is the personnel for that to come from?</P>
    <P>It either has to be experienced men full of pessimism, who do not display industrial initiative, or inexperienced men full of optimism and possible enthusiasm. It is altogether a matter that will depend on the type of personnel. Again, one will be up against the type of business man who will be brought into that corporation and from whom value could be got.  It is obviously the type of man who will be doing well in his own business.  If you have men with initiative they are very likely in business at the moment, and they are not going to be tempted out of that business very readily, and certainly they are not going to be tempted out of it by the laying down of a condition that no man in the country is worth more than £1,000 a year.  It will be very hard to get a successful man to give up his prospects as a successful business man for the rest of his life and to come along and operate for the good of the State and to build up industries that will probably be in competition with the business he has left.  The whole matter turns on the personnel.  It is a suggestion that we can argue again if there is an opportunity of discussion hereafter of the getting together of such a corporation; it is a line than can be followed usefully.  Because undoubtedly it is a big defect in the country, and it is a defect that has not yet been made good.  A certain attempt has been made towards it with regard to agriculture and in the recommendations of the Banking Commission to go a certain <Col N="1601" /> way with regard to industry.  I am not sure if it has gone a sufficient way.  At any rate these recommendations have been examined.</P>

      <P>I must say that I have often heard that phrase used vaguely.  I have had experience now in this matter.  I have not had much experience, because I always refused to interfere in a matter between the banks and their clients, and no member of a Government likes to interfere. These are matters between the banks and their clients, but on occasion I have been pressed to go into matters of that sort, and I say this: that it has always been my experience that the bank has treated its clients in a liberal way.  I have not yet found an occasion in which the phrase &ldquo;undue pressure&rdquo; could be applied.  I started quite as prejudiced against the banks as any Deputy on the opposite Benches.  I have a limited experience in dealing with this matter because I avoid that kind of case.  But in two or three cases I was made go into the matter.  There is a Deputy on the Labour Benches, and if he were here present he would tell you about one case, and I think he would agree with me that in one case presented in an ex-parte fashion and to which was applied the phrase &ldquo;undue pressure,&rdquo; it turned out when examined that the bank had been unduly lenient towards that man.</P>

      <P>I would like to have the example privately, because I would like to know if the whole thing has been examined fully and the full facts from the banker's point of view <Col N="1602" /> had been cleared.  I say that because this case that I speak of, and in which a Labour Deputy will bear me out, presented a very different aspect when you heard the two sides of it.  I heard first the statement of the case from the person upon whom it was alleged undue pressure had been put, but when the banker began to speak you had a very different type of case.  I would like to refer Deputy Moore to the instance I am referring to.  I think I can get the Labour Deputy to give him the full details of this case.  Deputy Moore is one of the Deputies who complained that I have not spoken about particular industries.  As a matter of fact, when speaking yesterday about industries, there came a point when there were three industries about which my Department had collected an amount of information and had sought to get outside people interested.  However, in this matter, three cases being under consideration, I did not want to speak of them.  Two of these industries, however, were mentioned.  One was artificial silk and the other was cement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing that I have had more propositions about or heard more talk about than I have heard about cement. It was one of the things that was under discussion when I first came into this office, and there have been propositions regarding cement pouring in since. The thing that amazes me is this&mdash;I find that most people approach this cement proposition in the same mind as Deputy Moore does.  Take Denmark. Denmark not merely makes all the cement that she wants for herself, but she exports a great deal of cement, and she manufactures the type of machinery that is useful in the preparation of it.  Deputy Moore heard, as I heard also, that Ireland was far richer in the necessary ingredients for cement than Denmark, and yet there are no cement works in Ireland. Deputy Moore has apparently got the same answer that I got.  He was told that certain firms interested in foreign cement companies came here, bought up the only sites of cement factories and closed them down.  One of these sites I hesitate to mention, because Deputy Corish is present.  That is Drinagh.  Drinagh has been examined over and over again.  Every foreigner <Col N="1603" /> who came to this country in quest of a good cement proposition was referred to Drinagh in the first instance, and there has not been an individual who looked into Drinagh who has been able to say that it is worth developing.  They have to pass it over.</P>

There has <Col N="1604" /> been no matter more definitely investigated than that of cement, and particularly cement in application to Drinagh.  We are told Drinagh had been bought by people with intent to crush out the industry.  If Deputies have still their suspicions about that, they can come to my office.  I will let them see every file, and a reading of those files will convince them that there is nothing in the suspicion with regard to Drinagh.</P>

      <P>There is that allegation.  If Deputy Cassidy is full of that suspicion let him come along and read through all the material about Drinagh and Magheramore and the whole Portland Cement Association.  It will take him about three hours to go through the whole matter connected with it.  I think he will go away satisfied that there is nothing whatever in the suspicion, and if he is not satisfied I will put him in touch with the very many people who have come here with intent to establish a cement business in the country.  Let him try and convince them that there is good business in Drinagh.  The first thing they satisfied themselves on was that no good could come out of Drinagh.  Deputy Moore I think it was who had a suspicion that there was a belief that the trading community of Dublin had got so much hold of the Government that the tariff weapon had been blunted.  To any person who talks about the tariff weapon being blunted I can only say that if it were blunted it was blunted by use; fifty per cent. of the tariffable articles coming into the country have been tariffed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe talks of the Trade Loans Act, and said if I wanted to get some reason why it had not been used I had only to read the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I read that Report.  I read a Report he issued the year before last, and that Report was under discussion in the Dáil when I brought forward the Trade Loans Act for extension.  I stated I was going to neglect legal opinion as expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, because I believe he had nothing at his disposal to give him any correct legal opinion.  I stated further that, as to the recommendations made by the Select Committee, I was going to disregard them if the House gave a Second Reading to the Trade Loans Act.  After making that definite statement the House gave me a Second Reading, and the Trade Loans Guarantee passed without any division. I took that as a sign that I could go ahead on the lines I had spoken of.  I proceeded on those lines, and I am ready to make my justification for proceeding on those lines whenever the Report comes up.  I am not going to be terrified by anyone pointing to the Comptroller and Auditor-General as legal opinion about my going outside the four corners of the Act, when I am backed by the legal opinion of three successive Attorneys-General that I am completely inside the Act, and when I got the justification of the House last year after it was stated in such a way that I had been held up to odium by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I consider the House is superior to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and it gave me leave to act in a particular way.  At any rate I do not know why Deputy Briscoe brought that under discussion; <Col N="1606" /> why he asked why the Act was not successful, because if anything it means that Deputy Briscoe and others who sit with him on the Public Accounts Committee want to tie up the Act still more tightly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the outset that we would have an opportunity of discussing this item when the Report of the Public Accounts Committee came before the Dáil.  I was trying to get from the Minister an indication as to whether he agreed that the Act in its present form could be worked in the interests of the community generally, or if it did not require some amendment in order to make it useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be worked in the interests of the community.  By further amendments it can be worked with greater advantage.  That matter will arise on the Act itself, but then the Deputy read portion of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's report that it was not desirable as used&mdash;I think that was the phrase used.  That is the point of view of the Auditor-General that was quoted last year for the Dáil.  I stated that I was going to use it in the same way if I got approval and, after I stated that, there was no division on the Second Reading.  The matter referred to by Deputy Briscoe raises this point.  Some other Deputy said a few days ago that the Civil Service should be cut down, and that if we had less red tape and paper methods, more work could be done.  Who is responsible for the red tape in Government Departments?  This Dáil.  This Dáil insists upon a certain responsibility being put on certain people in such a way that there is this red tape.  We can get rid of the red tape if the Dáil says in any legislation it passes &ldquo;Very well, you can have a free hand.&rdquo;  However, it happens that Deputies who complain of red tape in this House go into the Public Accounts Committee and show they are intent on tying up every Government Department in coils of red tape.  You cannot have it both ways. You have to give some freedom.  If there is going to be a rigid insistence on responsibility, and you are to have one man responsible for every act taken, then you are going to have red tape. <Col N="1607" /> Of course, the responsibility put on people in charge of a department is eventually the responsibility of the Minister.  If there is any disposition in this House with regard to red tape, that too much red tape is being used and that there is too much minuting, that can be remedied, but it will be remedied only by the Dáil relaxing a certain amount of control and giving, in certain circumstances, to heads of departments or to Ministers, leave to act in a certain way.  If the Public Accounts Committee is to insist rigidly on certain things being observed, the more insistent they are on a rigid observance of rules the more red tape there is going to be, the more minuting there is going to be from one Civil Servant to another, and the more delay there is going to be.  The House has it in its own hands to relax all that and to institute another system.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any control over the accommodation provided for first and second-class passengers on railways?  There are some cases where the railway companies are extorting money under false pretences. A passenger is charged a first or second-class fare, and after he leaves the main line he finds that the first-class accommodation provided is worse than the third class on the main principal line.  It would seem to be a case where the public ought to be protected, because as a general rule a passenger who takes a first-class ticket does not know what accommodation he is getting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not replying on the food prices question now. With regard to the films the intention is to have available for our representatives in other countries a series of short films illustrating the more attractive features of life in this country.  It was originally propounded by the Tourist Development Association that such a film would be useful, and from that point of view it was considered first. But afterwards we did get representations made, mainly by our representative in Brussels, that a film of a <Col N="1614" /> particular type which would be of interest to industrialists would also be of use.  For that purpose a conference representative of different departments was held, before whom, through the kindness of the Film Censor, there was exhibited a film of the same type as is at present sent forth by Australia and by Canada.  The departments interested in that conference were my own Department, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Local Government, the Department of Education, and the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first time this film was spoken of it was from the tourist point of view, and the people who proposed it suggested that they should have facilities to photograph certain places where business was being carried on.  It is expected that the film will still mainly cater for tourists, but we will have the other side too.  Of course, what will eventually appear I cannot say, but the discussions we had with other Departments broke down when it was discovered that, no matter how far this conference might go, and how far we might go in arranging for the production of the film, there was no money. Therefore we halted and came here to get the money.  But there is a fairly good plan.  There will not be an exhibition of red herrings, as the Minister for Fisheries might put them up, or as the Fianna Fáil Party might put them up here.  With regard to the Food Council, I have already stated here that I was prepared to recommend the acceptance of the findings of the Food Prices Tribunal on certain points. I think I told Deputy Cooper, in reply to a question as to the matters we were prepared to introduce certain legislation on, that that was already under discussion. Certain matters that they have recommended will fall for settlement within the Merchandise Marks Act, and there is one other Act that will deal with certain matters.  Certain others will involve consideration beforehand. But the one thing I did say was that I was not at the moment disposed to accept the recommendation with regard to a permanent Prices Tribunal.  I do not say that that has been definitely turned down; this is only so far as our consideration has gone, but at the moment <Col N="1615" /> the money that would have to be expended on it seems to be out of all proportion to the advantages that would be likely to accrue to the country from it. But even that is not finally decided.  I thought I indicated, when the question was asked, that the matter might better fall for discussion on a separate motion instead of having it raised on the Estimate, as there is really no part of the Estimate under which it would fall for discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate his attitude with regard to some of the minor recommendations?  I regret his decision not to set up this Tribunal, though I admit he is justified by the fact that the public appear to have no interest whatever in the subject. But there was a recommendation that tea should be sold at net weight. In 1922 a British Act to that effect was brought in, and tea is now sold by net weight in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland.  There was also a recommendation that a butcher, when delivering a joint to a customer, should also deliver a docket stating the weight of the joint and his charge per lb. These are small things; I do not know if the Minister has had time to go into them, but they are of some value, and I hope that they will not be entirely overlooked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I indicated to the Deputy that I was prepared to recommend to the Executive Council the adoption of the recommendation with regard to short weights. They have accepted that since.  How far they will go, whether they will go the length of the fullest point as to a regulation about the butcher delivering meat will, I think, all fall for discussion on the legislation when it is introduced. But the particular matter of short weight is going to be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order: The amendment which was down in my name and upon which a Division has now been taken, concerned a matter of policy.  I understood from previous experience in this House that following a Division on a matter of that kind the various sub-heads of the Estimate would be taken item by item. Deputy Lemass stood up first, and you allowed him to discuss a matter concerned with sub-head LL.  I submit, with the greatest possible respect, that you should have taken the items one by one&mdash;A, B, C, and down to L, and that any Deputies who wanted an opportunity of raising different matters in the sub-heads would be entitled to raise these matters.  Therefore, I claim that Deputy Broderick is quite in order, seeing that the usual procedure had not been carried out, in raising the point which he wants to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is: what is the usual procedure? The usual procedure is not for the Chair to call a sub-head and ask: &ldquo;Is there any point under A?  Is there any point under B?  Is there any point under C?&rdquo; and so on.  That is not the usual procedure, and in this instance it was understood, and I stated it yesterday, that the division upon this amendment would conclude the debate on general policy.  Deputy Corish asked if that would conclude the whole thing, and I said it would not.  But the usual procedure, which has been adopted to-day, is that a Deputy rises to make a point dealing with a particular sub-head, and if the sub-head is not sub-head A, the Chair gives warning that we cannot go back on that sub-head.  In this particular <Col N="1617" /> instance Deputy Lemass rose, and no other Deputy rose.  When Deputy Lemass made clear to me the point he wanted to raise which, as Deputy Davin said, we could not know anything about until he mentioned it, I indicated that the sub-head he was referring to was Sub-head LL, and that it was the last sub-head on the Vote. No protest reached me that any Deputy wanted to raise a prior question. Deputy Lemass, I am sure, would have given way at once if it had been indicated to him that he was taking up a sub-head so far down.  That is what happened, and there is nothing unusual in it.  The Deputy has not been deprived of any right which he ordinarily has.  I allowed the question on the Food Prices Tribunal, but what I am not prepared to allow is that we should go back through all the sub-heads. That would be impossible.  If the only point to be raised is by Deputy Broderick, we can take it if it does not occupy too much time.  Not only has the usual procedure been followed, but there has in fact been an arrangement made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges with regard to the time to be taken for Estimates.  The time taken on this Estimate has exceeded the time allotted for it.  I will now take Deputy Broderick's point on the understanding that I am prepared to take no other point afterwards.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his statement yesterday told the House of the results from his industrial inspectors of workshops and factories. I wonder what are the results of their work as regards the retail and bespoke tailoring industry?  Does the Minister want the House to believe that the industry is in as good a position now as it was twenty or thirty years ago?  To my mind it is an industry that at the moment needs a good deal of looking after by an inspector from his Department.  In Dublin it has been turned into a sweating industry.  There is no Deputy who leaves an order with any firm of tailors in Dublin for a suit has a guarantee that portion of that suit is not sweated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRODERICK</NameTxt>
      <P>The tendency now is that portion of the suits made in the majority of houses in the City of Dublin and other cities in the country is made by sweated labour.  That system of sweating is even creeping in into the smaller towns in the provinces.  I think it would be a great thing if the Minister would direct his inspectors to make an examination of the different workshops and tailoring shops in the Saorstát.  The tailoring shops are fairly well ventilated, but what are the conditions under which garments are made where sweating is carried on? They are made in places that are bedrooms at night and workshops during the daytime.  Such are the conditions prevailing in Dublin and other large towns in the Saorstát.  There is another point to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  As regards tailors working in this particular part of the industry, their numbers in their society have decreased since 1919 and 1920.  The Minister said some months ago that his Department would be prepared to set up a wages board in connection with any industry where the society was not able to protect its members. Here is one where that might be done.  There was a wages board to regulate conditions in this industry some three or four years ago, and I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of re-establishing it.  There is a wages board in the wholesale end of the industry, but not in the retail end. I would ask the Minister to give his earnest consideration to the points that I have mentioned.  The workers in this part of the industry are suffering a great grievance, and I hope the Minister will do what he can to remedy it.</P>

      <P>This raises a point that has been previously decided by the Dáil.  The Deputy made a complaint under two headings.  One is that there is no longer any machinery under the Trade Boards Acts in the retail bespoke tailoring trade.  The other point seems to me to be a complaint outside that, that there is no inspection of workshops.  The position is this, that the withdrawal of that particular trade from the operations of the Trade Boards Acts was done here openly in the House.  It was done for <Col N="1619" /> reasons which, at the time, seemed sufficiently good to the House.  The reasons given were, first that the application to it had never been made in this country until at a particular time when a Trade Board had to be established in any trade in which an application had to be made in England.  The second reason was that the conditions under which the Trade Board machinery was applied was such as to render it most mystifying, and impossible to know what was happening.</P>
      <P>There was one matter raised that even the Labour Leader, who was present at the time in the House, did not feel fully competent to discuss, namely, the question of the Scottish log as well as a whole lot of very difficult and technical matters which rendered almost futile the application of the Trade Board machinery.  Thirdly, there was the big point that all Trade Boards Acts are only supposed to apply to trades where the workers are not sufficiently organised to be able to stand up to the employers themselves. The argument was put forward and accepted by the majority here that the workers in this trade were sufficiently organised, and it could not be said the conditions essential for the application of the Trade Board machinery were present in this case.  At any rate, the House decided that the machinery of the Trade Board should be withdrawn from the trade.  As to the Deputy's second point, if there are shops or factories in this particular business, they will be inspected in the ordinary way, but not inspected by Trade Board inspectors to see that Trade Board conditions apply, because there is no longer the application of Trade Board conditions to them.  The machinery of the Trades Board to the retail bespoke tailoring trade which was definitely withdrawn by the House on a previous occasion, cannot again be applied to it until the House agrees to do so, and there may be a way of bringing it before the House.</P>

      <P>The Estimates before the House suggest under the head of salaries a further reduction in the cost of the staff of the Department. There has been a fairly continuous reduction in that cost during the last few years.  In the year 1923-24 the actual cost of the staff, including temporary clerks and typists, was £95,508.  In the year 1927-28 the actual cost was £88,001, involving a reduction in the staff of from 216 to 202.  The present Estimate suggests a continuance in this reduction.  It is not likely, however, that there can be a much greater reduction in the cost of staffing.  This <Col N="1621" /> reduction has been brought about at a time when there was a very considerable increase in the work of the Department arising out of legislation passed in 1923, 1925 and 1927.  In spite of the additional work thrown on the Department as a result of the legalising of amalgamation schemes and the giving of power to introduce schemes where amalgamation had not taken place, as well as the additional work thrown on the Department under public health and in connection with the roads, this reduction has been brought about.  In addition, it might be said that the Department generally has got over the difficulties that arose during the last few years, owing to the dislocation of its staff and its records and of the difficulties that public bodies generally laboured under.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as records are concerned, the local taxation accounts for the five years ending March, 1926, are at present in the press, and will be available for the public shortly.  The second Report of the Department will include the two years ending March, 1927.  It is hoped to have that published very shortly, but while these publications have not been available up to the present there has not been as much difficulty as might have been expected, because such information as was wanted by Deputies or the public was very readily available from the Department. The bringing up to date of these matters has involved a very continuous and painstaking work on the part of the Local Government staff.  Under the sub-head dealing with public health we have reported very steady progress in the application of schemes&mdash;child welfare, and medical treatment of school children, etc.  That progress is to a certain extent reflected in the expenditure, where under Sub-head M, grants under the Education (Ireland) Act, 1917, regarding the provision of school meals, a reduction of £3,550 is shown. That does not mean there would be less work under that sub-head in the course of this year than there was last year. Last year was the first year in which the local bodies got an advance of the State grants on part of their expenditure during the year.  In previous years they had to wait till the end of the <Col N="1622" /> year to get the State contribution.  In last year's Estimate provision was made that a grant could be made at an intermediate stage during the year. Since last year an additional number of urban bodies have undertaken to comply with the Act.</P>
    <P>The Estimate under housing involves the complete expenditure of the moneys voted under the three Housing Acts, 1924, 1925 and 1926.  In fact, the position with regard to the £900,000 voted under this Act is that with the exception of £300 or so the whole of the moneys is allotted. Up to 31st March last the amount allocated was £886,755, and the number of houses involved in that allocation is as follows:&mdash;Total number of houses built by private persons, 8,727, of which there are completed 6,553.  There are in progress 1,332, and not yet commenced 842.  Total number of houses built by public utility societies 345, of which 201 are completed; the number in progress 101, and the number not commenced 43.  The number of houses built by local authorities was 2,778, all of which are either completed or in progress.  That gives a total of 11,850. Since 1st April an additional £13,000 has been allocated.  As I say, the whole amount of £900,000, with the exception of about £300, has been allocated, and that means approximately an addition of 170 houses, so that the Housing Acts of 1924, 1925 and 1926 have been responsible for the erection approximately of 12,020 houses.  With regard to the housing position generally, in order to avoid misunderstanding, it must be realised that moneys voted by the Oireachtas under the Housing Acts have been fully allocated, and that any further application for assistance to build houses must wait until it is possible to frame a new policy.</P>
    <P>The future progress will depend to a large measure on the success and speedy outlook of the Committee considering the question of building costs, and the matter, I understand, is being approached by the Committee with goodwill and energy.  But in the meantime applications for assistance towards house-building must wait until we have had the results of that Conference, and we know what provision it is possible to <Col N="1623" /> make to give assistance towards house-building.</P>
    <P>With regard to the road position, the moneys allocated for the national road scheme will, as anticipated, be fully expended by October next.  In eight counties the work under the scheme is practically completed.  There are eleven counties in which very substantial sums still remain to be expended.  On 1st April last there was £680,670 unexpended, that is, not drawn from the Department.  Since October last the expenditure on the scheme has been at the rate of about £80,000 a month.  As to maintenance, the peak expenditure usually occurs in the winter months, and the peak expenditure on improvements in the summer months.  It is anticipated that the expenditure for the month in front of us will be more than £80,000, so that with the exception of one or two counties the whole of the amount for the national road scheme will have been expended by October next.  It will be possible next year to allocate towards maintenance and improvement a grant of £500,000 from the Road Fund.  There have been complaints that this amount is not as much as was expected, and that the grants made from the Road Fund in previous years were such as to lead the County Councils and other authorities to expect more, but in fact it is practically the same, as the average allocation for the last five years for the national scheme has amounted to £458,355.  In the matter of maintenance the attitude of the Executive Council was, I think, announced in 1926.  It was expected that the road authorities would spend on the maintenance of their roads approximately 50 per cent. more than was expended by them in the year 1913-14.  At that time they were expending something more than that. Expenditure from the rates on road maintenance in 1913-14 was £670,960. The estimated expenditure this year is £1,158,9973.  That would represent an increase of 73 per cent. over the expenditure for 1913-14, by the aid of the grant made towards maintenance from the Road Fund, which was approximately £235,000.  It is anticipated that the actual expenditure <Col N="1624" /> on roads and road maintenance will be £968,000 odd, representing an increase of about 44 per cent. of the expenditure of 1913-14.  There is a tendency on the part of some rural authorities to curtail the money applied from the rates to the roads.  Generally speaking, the figure, an increase of 44 per cent. above 1913-14, is satisfactory, but if there is a tendency to curtail their expenditure much below this, steps will have to be taken to prevent it.</P>
    <P>The rates position will be somewhat affected this year by an increase in the amount of land annuities not paid.  For the year ending January 31st, 1926, there was withdrawn from the Guarantee Fund, because of the non-payment of annuities, £484,628; for the year ending 31st January, 1927, the amount was only £387,270; but for the year ending 31st January, 1928, there has been an increase of approximately £95,000.  This is a serious matter for the local authorities, and it is most desirable that they should do everything in their power to influence the payment of annuities in their counties.</P>
    <P>Irrecoverable rates tend to increase. I am speaking now with respect to County Councils only, because these are the only figures which it has been possible to examine.  In respect of County Councils, irrecoverable rates in 1922-3 were 1.32 of the amount of the collectors' warrants; in the year 1923-4, 1.01; in 1924-5, 0.84; in 1925-6, 0.94.  For the year 1926-7 there are three counties for which the returns are incomplete, but with the incompleted return the irrecoverable rates amount to £33,282, being 1.1 per cent. of the total of the collectors' warrants, and it is possible that it will be 1.06, showing a tendency to non-payment of rates.</P>
    <P>It may be well, for the information of Deputies, to refer to the position with regard to rating generally as regards County Councils.  If we take the average rate struck for the financial year 1927-28 and 1928-9, on the assumption that the special rates for separate charges have been levied over the whole county, in two counties there has been a reduction in the rates of between 2s. and 2s. 6d.; in one county between 1s. 6d. and 2s.; in five counties between 1s. and 1s. 6d.; in seven counties between <Col N="1625" /> 6d. and 1s.; and in five counties something under 6d.  There have been only seven counties in which there is an increase.  In one county there is an increase of 3s.  That is the special case of Dublin, where the rate for the year 1927-8 was abnormal for special reasons.  In one county the increase has been 1s. and 1s. 6d.; in one county between 6d. and 1s.; and in four counties under 6d.  That can be regarded as satisfactory, even though we take into consideration the fact that there is a falling off of 6d. in the rates because of the cessation this year of the 6d. tax in respect to road damage.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the relations between the Department and the public bodies are of the most satisfactory kind.  Where difficulties and differences do arise, I do not think any party has anything serious to complain of as regards the spirit in which the work of reconciling these differences is approached. The General Council of County Councils has continued to be of very great service to the Department in its work, and there is great evidence that it can be of very great use in future in this matter.  We anticipate that when the working of the Local Appointments Commission over a further period has helped to tone up and make more efficient staffs working under public bodies, the relations between the Department and public bodies will, as a result of the more efficient discharge of business, be even more satisfactory than at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'KELLY Mr. O'KELLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it can be maintained successfully here that the work allotted to this Department in any particular aspect can be said to be as satisfactory as it ought to be. Whether that is due to direction from headquarters or whether the blame is to be put on the local authorities is a matter about which there will be difference of opinion.  But I am of opinion, so far as one particular aspect of the work of local government is concerned, that the Department responsible has not given the lead that should be given by it and that is with regard to public health work.  I need not emphasise the importance of that work.  Everybody should know its importance.  But anybody acquainted with the rural areas <Col N="1626" /> must realise that the attention to public health in general that ought to be given has not been given.  So far as public health and sanitation generally are concerned, and such matters as child welfare and inspection for health purposes of school children, we are very backward.  We are backward, I say, largely because the country has not got the lead from headquarters that it ought to get.  I am sorry that the Local Government Department was not prepared to ask for much larger sums for these very necessary services so as to put the Department in a position to insist that, in so far as it could at any rate, the public health of the country would be properly looked after, which is not being done at present.  Despite undoubted improvements, and the slight progress made in the last three or four years, another Department that has not worked as progressively as it ought is the Housing Department.</P>
      <P>It may be said that the money provided by this House has been used and expended.  The Minister told us that the moneys granted under the last Act passed will be all expended very soon. I would have thought that knowing that these moneys were to be expended some statement would be made by the Minister in charge of this important Department, telling us and the country what his proposals were in regard to this important and very urgent matter for the coming year.  He did refer to it, and said there was a committee considering the question of prices.  That committee has been sitting for a number of months, and may sit for many months more, but that does not, in my opinion, relieve the Department and Minister from the responsibility of stating to this House what his ideas on the matter are and how he proposes to deal with that urgent, pressing problem, and no less an urgent, pressing problem from the point of view of convenience of the public, but also an urgent, pressing problem for the people from the point of view of public health, with which his Department is charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are two aspects of matters that have not, in the statement of the Minister, been given the importance and attention that naturally the responsible head of a very responsible and important Department ought to give to those <Col N="1627" /> big aspects or matters that concern so deeply not a section or class of the community, but every class of the community. Public health is a thing that concerns everybody.  If the public health of one area, due to bad housing or bad sanitation, is badly affected, the whole country suffers.  I think, therefore, that those two great problems&mdash; general public health and, secondly, housing&mdash;have not received the attention they ought to have received in the recent past, and that we have not had, and that we might justly expect, a statement from the official head of the Department telling us what his policy and the policy of his Department is, and what are the prospects in the immediate future of improving the conditions, both from the point of view of public health in general and, secondly, from the point of view of housing, which also directly and indirectly affects public health.</P>
    <P>There is another important matter with which that Department is charged with supervision, and that is the question of the maintenance of the roads. That is a great problem at the present day.  The local authorities are in difficulties, and they know that these difficulties are in all probability likely to be greater as time goes on.  They are finding the problem of getting money to maintain the roads in their areas in anything like decent conditions more pressing every year.  The Road Fund, as the Minister for Finance told us recently, is not by any means in a healthy condition, and the prospects for the future do not look bright.  We would like to know a little more with regard to the policy of the Department which is charged with looking after a great part of the roads of the country, and what its policy is to be with regard to the maintenance of particularly specific roads that have been marked out as national roads.  The little the Minister did tell us did not, in my opinion, enlighten us very much as to what is to happen in the future.</P>
    <P>To-day we learned from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that this subject is being discussed by an interdepartmental committee.  But it may be a long time before that committee <Col N="1628" /> reaches a decision.  If the Minister for Local Government who is charged with these matters tells us that he hopes to solve the difficulty at an early date and will be able to assure the local authorities as to where the money is to come from, for the upkeep of these roads, it will be some little satisfaction to know the matter is receiving earnest consideration, and that a way is being sought to lessen the burden on the backs of those least able to bear it for the upkeep of the roads.  In many cases in the rural parts of Ireland that have not so many motor cars registered in their areas they find it difficult to meet the heavy charges put upon them for the upkeep of the roads, particularly the special roads.  They do not find that the grants made from headquarters are sufficient to meet the pressing demands made upon them to keep those roads in proper condition.</P>
    <P>I am sure we are all satisfied to know that there was a decrease in the number of officials of the Department.  I do not particularly wish to say that decrease in the number of officials is always satisfactory, and that it means that a less number of officials are doing the same amount of work or doing a greater amount of work.  But there has been, justly or unjustly, an idea in the minds of many of us that that Department at least, perhaps some others, also, was overloaded and that there was more than was necessary of auditors and inspectors of one kind and another and other officials of the higher and more expensive sort.  That idea was very prevalent and, evidently, it was justified, because there has been, according to the statement of the Minister, a continuous decrease in the number of officials in the Department. Looking at the debate that took place on the Estimates in 1926.  I see the figures given, I think, by the Minister of the number of officials in the Department was 253 in 1926.</P>

If that be so, and if the Departmental <Col N="1629" /> work is done as efficiently as can be expected of it, it is certainly a creditable thing and something that everybody here in the House ought to express appreciation of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow, there has been a decrease, and in so far as that does not mean that the work of the Department will decrease in efficiency, I say it is satisfactory. There has also been a decrease in the travelling expenses of the various Departments, and I take it that is a matter that we ought to express our satistion about also.  There is one matter that has been mentioned in the Estimates of some other Departments, and perhaps it would be no harm to refer to it again.  That is the idea that some of us, at any rate, have that there is too much centralisation of experts of one kind or another that might be useful to more Departments than one in each one of the several Departments of the Government.  The Local Government Department, in common with other Departments, such as the Board of Works, the Post Office and other similar Departments, employs expert officials, professional men, architects, engineers of one kind or another, and perhaps lawyers of one kind or another. It has occurred to me that there could be some arrangement come to by these Departments that employ professional men of that kind by which one would probably be able to do the work of at least two, if not three, by having that work centralised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is certainly true, I understand, with regard to the Supply services, <Col N="1630" /> that there is duplication and triplication of work.  Anybody who has ever had anything to do with a Government Department, the head or anybody in which wishes to get stores, will know that when one desires to get any article that would be in use in an office, an order of some kind has to be made out and signed by the head of the Department. It appears that when that order is sent out by the head of the Department it goes perhaps to two, three or four different Supply Departments before it can reach the person who can supply the article.  I must say it does not always do that.  Likewise, when that article is being returned it goes through several Departments before it reaches the person who made the demand originally.  If some body were set up by the Government to reorganise Supply services for every Government Department, and if that body were put under one head, we believe a very considerable saving might be made.  In the same way professional men who are employed&mdash;lawyers, engineers and architects, who are doing for their several Departments good work, no doubt&mdash;should be centralised.  In the way their work is now divided we believe there is loss of time and money. This applies to the Local Government and other Departments.  If there was a legal Department, which would assist every Department of the Government, organised under the headship of the Attorney-General, if you like, and if in the same way those who are employed as architects, draftsmen and engineers in the various Government Departments were all gathered together under one head and put into one building so that they could assist each and every Department of the Government, it would tend towards economy of time and money.</P>
    <P>Take the case of Government architects. They could be controlled by the chief architect for the Government and he would have assistance.  Centralisation in that case would mean that the work would be speeded up; it could be done more efficiently and with less cost.  The very same remark could be applied to other sections such as the engineering section.  Some people may consider that there would <Col N="1631" /> not be a great saving.  I believe there would be an actual saving.  There certainly would be a considerable saving in time and that is just as valuable, and there certainly would be increased efficiency in my view.</P>
    <P>Child welfare is a Department that was recently established in this country, and I gather from the Estimate that it is a growing one.  I believe it ought to grow at a greater rate and the Department ought to do a good deal more to impress on local authorities the necessity for doing the work that should be done in regard to child welfare.  I believe more money should be asked for under this head.  I believe that more propaganda ought to be done by the Department throughout the country to encourage local authorities to take up this work.  It will be difficult in many cases.  I know that there is ignorance on the subject in every part of Ireland.  I know that the Department will be met with the difficulty of inducing the local authorities to raise the necessary additional rate that will be required, even after the Government has allotted whatever grants they may make.  Even though there will be difficulties, that should not deter the Department from doing its obvious duty in this matter, and that is pushing forward the necessity that this work of public health must be modernised and brought into line with modern scientific medical thought all over Europe.  We cannot afford, perhaps, to bring it into line with such progressive countries as America, but we can certainly do much better than we are at present doing.</P>
    <P>On the question of public health, I expected to hear from the Minister some statement as to what he or his Department proposes to do with regard to the recommendations made some months ago by the Poor Law Commission. I am astonished he did not mention the subject.  That is one of the burning questions of local government in the country.  There are many problems that were investigated by that Commission that are of very urgent importance and that require immediate attention.</P>
    <P>The Department must surely be aware of them: the Department must <Col N="1632" /> have given some consideration, perhaps not final consideration, to the important recommendations of the Poor Law Commission.  And not one reference was made to them by the Minister in his statement on these Estimates.  I would have expected that the Minister would have been in advance of the Dáil in this matter, charged as he is with responsibility for the public health here; charged as he is with leading the country in matters of importance of this kind.  But there has been no mention of that important Commission or the fruit of the Commission. That is an omission I hope he will rectify before the debate is over.</P>
    <P>We would like to know what the policy of the Department is or what it is going to recommend to the country, with regard to unmarried mothers, for instance.  We would wish to know what they will recommend to the Government and to their own Executive with regard to the question of allowances or pensions for widows and orphans.  Many matters in relation to the recent amalgamation of the Unions and the upset that it occasioned, probably justly occasioned, in the administration of the Poor Law and medical assistance in many counties were discussed by that Poor Law Commission, and recommendations to get over the difficulties that arose were made.  Many on these benches who have to deal with this problem in different counties in Ireland would like to hear the views of the Department as expressed by the Minister on these matters.  We expected that he would have dealt with them on his own initiative.  I hope he will deal with this matter before the debate closes.</P>
    <P>I would like personally to hear what the policy of the Department is with regard to sanitation and to sewage in the smaller towns in Ireland. That is a matter that has not received sufficient attention in Ireland. I am not blaming any Party or body in particular, because it is a thing that goes back a long time.  It is a thing in which everybody in the country requires to be pushed in order to rectify it; I would like to hear what the policy of the Department is, if it has any policy, with regard to the question of improving sanitation, par- <Col N="1633" /> ticularly in the smaller urban areas in the Saorstát.  I know that in the last few years efforts have been made to improve sanitation in many of the smaller towns in the south and west, but owing to the extra cost there were difficulties.  These difficulties have got to be met and overcome.  I would like to know what is the policy of the Department, if it is considering the matter, in endeavouring to induce the towns where sanitation is in a backward state to show at least some sign of improving the conditions under which the people are obliged to live.</P>
    <P>I have referred to housing and to the failure of the Department with regard to housing.  I believe that the number of houses built since the present Ministry took control is not creditable, considering the condition of housing in Ireland at the present day.  Take the City of Dublin.  Despite the fact that there have been about 3,000 odd houses built in Dublin in the last five years, the slum population of Dublin is greater to-day than it was five years ago.  There are more people living in one-roomed tenements in Dublin to-day than when the present Executive took control.  Is that a justification of their housing policy?  I cannot speak with authority as to the number of such slums in other cities like Cork, Waterford or Limerick.  I believe they are, in proportion, equally great in number. On that one issue alone I say that the Executive and the Department of Local Government, on this question of ending the slum problem in this City of Dublin, have failed and failed lamentably. Dublin is worse off, from the point of the slum-dwellers to-day, than it was five years ago, notwithstanding all the glowing accounts we have heard of the magnificent housing work done by that Government.  They have, as far as Dublin City is concerned, merely tinkered with the problem.  They have not had the courage to face it in the way it will have to be faced if it is to be ended, and that is to face it in a big way and with courage.  It will mean, getting a lot of money.  It will mean, perhaps, raising a big loan.  But unless we have courage to face that we might as well say to the poor slum-dwellers of Dublin that they have got to remain as they are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> A Committee is now considering this question.  I have read something about the work they have been doing, and I have read the speeches of the Chairman of that Committee, and I believe that if five years ago the Department of Local Government had put up schemes of the kind that are now talked about, and that may fructify some day, they would have gone very much nearer the solution of the housing problem in Ireland generally and in the cities where there are slums, much nearer than where they are to-day. I believe that we are on right lines in the endeavour to get the employers and employed together in consultation on this matter, in the endeavour to work out schemes which will reduce the cost of housing.</P>
    <P>That certainly is a work that, to my mind, is satisfactory, and it will, I believe, if they have the courage to go through with it, do much to help materially the housing question and to end the slum problem.  But beyond speeches and beyond the promises they have not taken the serious, courageous steps that are necessary to face the tremendous problem with which the whole of the Saorstát is concerned, and particularly this City of Dublin, which has been neglected for so long, not alone by the present Executive, but for many years before this Executive came into power or existence.  This was not a problem that arose in their time.  I do not want to charge them with that.  It is a historical problem, but it is one of the things which the Government ought to have tackled with courage, goodwill, and energy when they took control, and in that they have failed.  Unless they radically change their tune, unless they go out and show they are in earnest, and that they really mean what they say when they tell us at election times that they have a housing policy, and that they intend to provide the working classes and others with decent, comfortable homes at reasonable rates, they will have to alter their policy very materially if they want me, at any rate, to say that they are serious in their promise to end the slum problem in this city.  The policy of the Department has been in the last three or four years one of centralisation and, in so far as it is one of centralisation, practically all <Col N="1635" /> power and all initiative is at headquarters, and in that respect I say that they are doing an injury to the country.</P>
    <P>Those who fought to get an Irish Government established believed in the Irish people and had trust and faith in them.  Some of them seem to have lost that; for my part, I believe you would get the best local government and other services if you trusted those whom you elect on public boards.  Give them power and, if they misuse it, leave it to the people who elect them to call them to account.  The policy that has been ruling the local government for the last few years has been one of distrust of the people, taking back from them even the power the British Government gave them under the Local Government Act of 1898. This shows that they do not trust the will of the people.  They have no belief in the rights of the people over the expenditure of their own money. Centralisation is not an idea that will help us to encourage, first of all, patriotism, and, secondly, citizenship in this country.  If we want the people to have pride in their own country, to give service without paying and to give their best to the people it is not by filching from them whatever powers were given to them in former years, but by giving them still more power in local affairs, and training them to be upright in the service of their own country, training them to trust themselves, and training the country, at the same time, to act severely with those who are found to misuse the trust the public has placed in them.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I think the Minister ought to have referred to. I have had brought under my notice frequently, a considerable amount of demands, first of all by occupants of labourers' cottages, and, secondly, by local authorities, for the adoption of a scheme whereby occupants of labourers' cottages can become purchasers of their holdings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'KELLY Mr. O'KELLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe he has. There is also a considerable number of complaints from local authorities that the capitation grants made to them from Government funds in regard to the upkeep of inmates of asylums is too low and is a matter that ought to receive the attention of the Government. That, again, is not a problem that is of the making of the present Department.  It goes back a long time. It is one, notwithstanding its age, which is still a pressing problem which causes a good deal of discussion and requires attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had brought under my notice by some of my colleagues a matter which I am doubtful whether or not it would require legislation to alter. That is the question of the granting of home assistance to occupants of labourers' cottages who have anything from a quarter of an acre to an acre of land.  I am told that many of the Boards of Health have refused, even in very urgent cases, to grant relief to occupants of houses of that kind. Relieving officers say that if they granted relief they would be leaving themselves open to surcharge.  Whether they have that power or not, I am not certain.  If the Minister can give us any information on the matter, I shall be glad.  I hope, before he closes, that the Minister will find it possible to state for us his policy and that of his Department on the important matters I have referred to, first of all, the matter of public health and public services generally, the question of housing, the grants for which are now exhausted, what he hopes to do and how much money he expects to be able to place at the disposal of public bodies in the coming year.  I would also like to hear what his Department's policy is with regard to the important question of sewerage and sanitation generally.  These are burning questions of public importance which I believe <Col N="1637" /> the Minister ought to have dealt with in his statement introducing the Estimate.  For some reason or other, he omitted them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>In one of the first speeches I made in the Dáil I called attention to the unsatisfactory condition of sanitation in the Free State.  We have had since then a certain amount of legislation to improve matters.  A considerable time has elapsed since we passed legislation by which it was enacted that county officers of health should be appointed. I want to know how far that has proceeded, because it is a long time since this law was enacted.  I want to know how many counties have made provision for the appointment of those county medical officers of health.  It is linked up with another matter I take an interest in and have spoken of from time to time, namely, medical inspection and treatment of school children. That has been held up, largely because of the want of a county officer of health, to see, that the regulations with regard to medical inspection and treatment of school children should be carried out.  I want to know what position we are in with regard to medical inspection and treatment of school children, how far it has been adopted and how successful the matter has been in regard to any of the local authorities that have adopted it.</P>
      <P>I have on former occasions criticised, perhaps severely, the number of inspectors appointed under the Local Government Department.  I do not intend to go into that.  I only wish to say I dislike very much a crowd of inspectors. There is always a suggestion that people are not doing their work when a large number of inspectors are needed to report on the work being done.  I was glad to find Deputy O'Kelly calling attention to child welfare.  I am pleased to see an increase in the grant of the present year, although the amount in my opinion is not anything like what is needed.  However, we have not got a lot of money to throw away, and therefore one cannot be too severe on the Government if they have not given as much money as they ought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the blind, complaints have reached us from time to <Col N="1638" /> time with regard to the impossibility of poor people getting their vision tested. I am told&mdash;I do not know whether it is the case&mdash;that only one of the medical inspectors is capable of doing vision tests.  It is to some extent a fairly difficult thing, but I see no reason why dispensary doctors who are not capable of doing this work should not be allowed a month or six weeks in order to take a post-graduate course so that they would be able for the work.  I am certain that I have heard complaints repeatedly made here that poor people were unable to get any grant because of the fact that they were not able to get their eyes tested.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly endorse everything that has been said by Deputy O'Kelly in his statement that too much cannot be done for small towns in the way of providing a proper water supply and a proper sewerage system.  In a discussion on a previous occasion Deputy Ward gave a picture of the conditions of one of the towns in his dispensary district.  It is appalling to think of the poor attempts that have been made by local authorities to provide proper sewerage and water supplies in those places.  One of the first things which my medical colleagues on the Fianna Fáil Benches brought to my notice was the fact that they were prepared to push forward demands for improvement in social services, and I said that I would be very glad to back them up in any attempt made to improve the conditions of the people.  This is one of the things in which I am sure they will continue as they have started to press for an improvement in the sanitation of country towns.</P>
    <P>In reference to another matter raised by Deputy O'Kelly, I see that the grants to local authorities and the various other authorities for building houses have been reduced from £251,000 to £175,000.  I think that is a deplorable state of affairs.  I do not think I feel more strongly on any subject than I do on the subject of improving the housing conditions of the poor.  Invariably I refuse to talk about medical matters here unless I am pressed, but on this subject I do want to say one particular thing, because it is propaganda that is advisable.  A large number of heart <Col N="1639" /> diseases that occur in the country are produced by rheumatism and, in my opinion&mdash;I do not say it is the opinion of everybody&mdash;there is nothing that conduces more to rheumatism than to have people living in damp, ill-ventilated houses.  I think if we proceed to improve the condition of the poor in that direction we shall, in some way at all events, greatly lessen the amount of rheumatism, which is in turn responsible for a great number of heart diseases in the country.  I do not think any other disease knocks people out at an early age more than inflammatory conditions of the heart, valvular lesions of the heart.  It is more responsible for knocking out young people than any other condition I can speak of.</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on the efforts he is making to improve public health, but I do not think he is doing as much as one would like to see. We admit that he has not got the money.  The money is not forthcoming, for all the reforms we would like, but I do press upon him to see that County Medical Officers of Health are appointed. At the time that Bill was before the House, I gave it as my opinion that if the appointment of these men meant only increased expenditure to the country, and that if men were not appointed of the very highest standard as far as ability, education, and training were concerned, I would tear up the Bill and trample it under foot.  We want to see really effective sanitation, and we will not have it until we have County Officers of Health.  I admit that the Minister has met with objections from local authorities.  They are blind.  Things have to be pushed upon them and driven against them before they see that it is necessary that expenditure must be undertaken in order to save money in various directions. I appeal to the Minister to force this on because it has held up, as far as I know, other services, particularly the service in connection with the medical inspection and treatment of school children.  If he would relieve my mind in these directions I would feel more satisfied that his work is progressing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'DOWD Dr. O'DOWD">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'DOWD</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate the <Col N="1640" /> difficulties that lie before the Minister and his Department in improving to a standard that one would like to see, the sanitation of inland towns in Ireland. Much was said on the occasion of the unemployment debate about the sanitation of the towns, and many suggestions were made.  At that time a certain proportion, about 20 or 25 per cent., of the money allotted for the relief of unemployment was allocated to local authorities for the improvement of sanitation and for the provision of proper water supplies and sewerage systems.  Unfortunately some of the local authorities, at any rate, did not take advantage of the grants offered and schemes were dropped.  To my mind the only way that sanitation in general can be tackled in a proper manner is to treat sanitation in general as a national scheme.  Some two or three years ago we had the trunk roads of the country taken up and treated on a national basis.  The tourist traffic or good roads are only second in importance to what public health is and what public health should be.  If sanitation in general were tackled in the way in which trunk roads were tackled some three or four years ago, in two or three years' time we would be in a position to congratulate ourselves on having done something tangible.  It will take the loyal co-operation of every party in this House to improve the sanitation of the country, and the sanitation of the country at the moment badly needs improvement.  Reports are made each half-year on the sanitation of the various dispensary districts in Ireland, and I am sure the Minister would agree with me when I say that in 50 per cent. of the cases the reports of the medical officers of health are unsatisfactory.  If you have bad sanitation, you leave people exposed to all kinds of diseases, and if outbreaks of fever occur the money that will be spent in trying to save the lives of the people will be far in excess of that which could prevent the outbreaks occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer is infantile mortality in the Saorstát.  While I have no exact figures and while I am glad that infantile mortality has decreased to some extent in the Free State, still the percentage is at the moment pretty high, <Col N="1641" /> especially among illegitimate children.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why it should be higher in the latter class than in the ordinary class of children.  In my opinion, infantile mortality could be decreased, at least to some extent, by proper supervision of the milk supplied to the poor people in the towns and cities, either direct from the dairies or through the dairy shops.</P>
    <P>There is great inconvenience, and I may say that many complaints are made, in the rural areas since the amalgamation of the hospitals.  In most counties there is one central hospital and an auxiliary.  In some counties there is no such thing as a building that deserves the name of hospital at all.  In County Roscommon there is a local hospital at Boyle, and a County Infirmary in Roscommon which, when fitted up, will, I dare say, be adequate for the purpose for which it is intended; but for the reception of medical cases there is no hospital whatever in the county.  There is, if you like, accommodation for the treatment of medical cases in what is known as the County Home.  In the County Home there are all classes of people&mdash; the very poor who go there because they have no other means of existence, and also the type of patient that one could not certify for an ordinary asylum&mdash;imbeciles&mdash;the old and feeble, unmarried mothers, and ordinary medical patients, while in another part of the building are the fever patients. An hospital should be an hospital, and in an hospital there should be only hospital cases.  An hospital should be a distinct building by itself, if it is to carry out the work that should be done in an hospital.  People have a certain reluctance about going into institutions as long as they are called County Homes or whatever name you like, as long as all these different classes are assembled there.  If we want the poor to get the best possible treatment available in hospitals, the hospitals should be made distinct buildings.  In every county there are a number of disused workhouses.  In County Roscommon there is one at Castlerea and another at Strokestown.  Either of these could be made a County Home for the infirm and the old, and the hospital could be <Col N="1642" /> left a distinct building.</P>
    <P>As regards county infirmaries or county hospitals I would like to make one suggestion.  Undoubtedly there should be in every county hospital a surgeon able to undertake all classes of surgical work, provided it is general surgery.  Even in Dublin the greatest general surgeons do not attempt to deal with special subjects.  I understand, at least as far as Roscommon is concerned, that special permission would have to be got after the appointment of the county surgeon to send a patient to a city hospital.  I do not think that any county surgeon, no matter what his qualifications are, should be asked, for instance, to deal with a specialised thing like the throat or nose, or be asked to undertake a Caesarian section.  I do not say that it is the policy of the Department to encourage that, but boards of health are certainly under a misapprehension in this matter, and do not allow their medical officer to send patients at his discretion for special treatment.</P>
    <P>As to housing, money for housing is, of course, money very well spent.  No one would deny that, but dissatisfaction exists in rural areas because no money is made available for reconstruction there.  Much work of that kind would be done if a grant for reconstruction were made available.  As to the sanitation of schools, I would like to know from the Minister if medical officers of health in the country districts are directly responsible in this respect, and if, when a school is in an insanitary condition, the medical officer of health is in a position to see that the school is properly looked after, and if the local sanitary authority has authority to see that the necessary work is carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir James Craig mentioned that, as far as he knew, there was only one inspector in this Department for examining the blind.  I do not know if there is any inspector there at the moment, as I saw an advertisement in the newspapers for one.  Perhaps the Department is going to get another inspector. In this particular matter there is great dissatisfaction.  I know of people who are waiting twelve or eighteen months, who hold strong certificates from their own doctors as to <Col N="1643" /> the condition of their eyes, in whose cases the disease might have been progressive during that period.  They might, for all the Department knows, have been completely blind for the last six, nine, or twelve months, but they are still waiting for the inspector to come to examine them.  I hope the Department will speed up the examination of people who are waiting to have their eyes examined.  As regards roads, undoubtedly a great deal has been done on trunk and main roads throughout the country, but there are a lot of other roads that might be called second class roads, and I would suggest that out of future grants at least a little money should be allocated to them.  The trunk roads are in a fairly good condition, and if more money is to be provided from the Road Fund, I suggest that at least some of it should be allocated to what I might call second-class roads.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to call attention is the question of housing. A housing scheme was prepared for a town in County Roscommon some two or three years ago, and the Department carried out their portion of the contract all right by sanctioning a grant of £100 per house, but when it came to borrowing money there was trouble with the banks.  The terms for which they would lend the money was so short that the houses could not be put up at such a price that they could be let at an economic rent.  Something should be done in that way to encourage building. If the banks adopt the attitude that they have adopted for the past four or five years with regard to the length of the term for which they would grant loans to local authorities, I am afraid the local authorities will not get very far with the building of houses on any very large scale.  If something could be done to ease that position we would have more houses built, and I think that local authorities would avail more and more of future grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. BRENNAN Mr. BRENNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on the administration of the Local Government Department.  We are this year asked to provide for salaries, wages and allowances, including travelling, a sum of £99,685 for what I might <Col N="1644" /> call the Central Department.  That works out at something like £3,800 per county.  What we have got to consider is if the State is getting value for the money.  If you divide the amount of the Vote by 26 you get a sum of close on £4,000 per county, which means that the Central Department is costing each county practically the same amount as the administration of the roads costs.  I do not say that the Local Government officials in the Central Department are not working, but I do say that there is considerable overlapping, due to the system of local government which we have at present, and due principally to watertight compartments.  It is quite possible at present to find, say, four medical men from the Department going down in the one train to the one village to carry out four different kinds of inspection.  You can find a medical inspector going down to examine people who are applicants for blind pensions, another medical inspector going down to the County Home, a medical inspector of lunacy, and a medical inspector of public health.  I think it is time for this House seriously to consider the examination of the system of local government which we have, and I think that an investigation into local government as administered in other countries would be well worth the money.  I do not know how it is carried out in other countries, but I have been told that a much simpler system of local government, which would be more suitable to us, might be evolved.  I think I am not far wrong&mdash;or wrong at all&mdash;in saying that some of the present members of the Executive Council, particularly the President, were of that opinion in 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly, Deputy Sir James Craig and Deputy O'Dowd have mentioned sanitation.  If we examine the success of local government in this country by the progress that has been made in the provision of proper sanitation and waterworks, I am afraid we will have to come to the conclusion that we are at a standstill.  There is no use in the Local Government Department throwing the blame upon local authorities, because after all this is a big national question, and it is too much to expect local authorities to tackle it in the way it has got to be <Col N="1645" /> tackled.  To give an illustration:&mdash; Some five years ago the Government compelled each county to contribute sixpence in the pound to a fund for the repair of malicious damage to bridges.  That cost Roscommon county about £37,500.  I do not say that a rate equal to that ought to be put on by the Government for sanitary purposes, but I do say that something in that direction ought to be done.  We paid that rate for five years, and we are there still; it did not send us to the county home.  If we had a sum equal to £37,500 to spend on sanitation in Roscommon, we would be a model county, from the sanitary point of view.  My point is that there is no use in throwing what is a big national question over upon the local authorities which have to deal with things in a very small way; it ought to be solved from the centre, because it is a national question.  It seems absurd and ridiculous for local authorities at present to be making contributions from the rates towards the development of the tourist business when if half a dozen visitors came into a town in any county like my own they would find no sanitary accommodation.  There are only a very few places where we have water supplies.  All over the county the children attending the national schools cannot get a drink of pure water&mdash;cannot get a drink of any water.  This is a question which ought not to be left to local authorities to decide and to carry out.  It is a big national question, and it must some time be tackled by a Government Department or it will never be done.</P>

      <P>I am afraid if you wait for that you will never have the country where we want to get it. Deputy O'Kelly said that too much centralisation apparently bred distrust, and I am afraid he was right, at least as far as I can see lately with regard to appointments.  It certainly has led to it.  This House passed an Act&mdash;the Local Authorities Act&mdash;which placed the appointment of officials in the hands of the Appointments Commissioners. Personally I was very glad of it, but a provision was made in that Act whereby a local authority could, within a certain specified period, make an appointment itself by way of promotion. That is specifically stated in Section 5.  Now the Minister says that that section cannot be taken advantage of by a local authority without his prior sanction.  If that is the legal interpretation of the Act, I submit that the Act when it was put through the House &mdash;it was a contentious matter&mdash;was put through under false pretences.  When it was put to the House, the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Bourke, made this statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In fact one Deputy suggested that it was merely transferring patronage from the local authorities to the Minister for Local Government.  I do not see how any Deputy who has read Section 5 could say that.  That section gives local authorities absolute power as regards the promotion of suitable officials at present in their service, and power to elect suitable pensioners who had experience of similar work in the past.  There is absolute power to make those appointments without any reference to the Commissioners. It is only in cases where they fail to make these appointments that the machinery of the Commissioners comes into operation at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to cry for the privilege <Col N="1647" /> taken from local authorities with regard to making appointments, but there is one serious aspect of the question to be considered, and it is that if the local authorities have not the right to make promotions, and if their officials do not feel that some day they will have the right to get promotion without the prior sanction of the Minister then I am afraid you are going to have less efficiency in the public service.  The only incentive you have to efficiency is the chance of promotion.  Take that away, and you have nothing else left. Section 5, which gives the right to local authorities, reads: &ldquo;An appointment of a person to fill any office to which this Act applies may, subject to the sanction of the Minister, be made by a local authority&rdquo; within three months.</P>
    <P>The original draft of that section read: &ldquo;Whenever an office to which this Act applies becomes vacant the local authority, with the consent of the Minister, may within a certain specified time make the appointment.&rdquo;  There were amendments put down on the Committee Stage to delete the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;  As a result of these amendments, the Minister had the whole section re-drafted until it read: &ldquo;Subject to the sanction of the Minister.&rdquo;  The interpretation which local authorities put upon that phrase, &ldquo;subject to the sanction of the Minister,&rdquo; was and still is that they had liberty to make an appointment and then get the Minister's sanction. The Minister's contention now is that no local authority has the right to make any appointment under that Act unless he specifically permits them beforehand to do so, and that he has the right afterwards to refuse sanction.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter on the adjournment some time ago, when the Minister for Local Government made this statement. He said that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The local bodies are fairly well represented and can get their voices heard through the General Council of County Councils.  I have not had a single complaint that the employees of the local bodies were dissatisfied with the way in which the Department is administering this Act.  If there are any representations to be <Col N="1648" /> made by those particular bodies on behalf of employees, or by the General Council of County Councils on behalf of the public bodies, the Department and myself are only too anxious to hear what they have to suggest as to how the spirit of this Act is to be given effect to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Following that, a meeting of the General Council of County Councils was called.  The meeting unanimously refused to agree to the Minister's interpretation. The Local Government Officials' Union took up the very same attitude.  On the day on which I brought the matter up at a meeting of the General Council of County Councils, there appeared in the Press a notice setting out that the position that was in dispute was to be filled by the Appointments Commissioners, notwithstanding the fact that even if it were filled that day by the Appointments Commissioners, that particular officer could not take up duty until the month of September.  The General Council of County Councils spoke on the matter in no uncertain terms, and a deputation approached the Minister.  What happened? The Appointments Commissioners had been asked to hold their hand until the case was decided in court.  They said that they could not hold their hand unless the Local Government Department allowed them. The Local Government Department said it was gone out of their hands, and that they could do nothing.  That is the position in which local authorities find themselves to-day.  When the Act was passed, local authorities and their employees felt that under Section 5 they had the right to look forward to promotions without having to ask the Minister's sanction beforehand.  We admit that the Minister has the right to refuse his sanction, but we do not admit, from the wording of the Act, that he has the right to insist upon his sanction being asked before a local authority proceeds to make an appointment. I may say that we have got counsel's opinion on that.</P>

      <P>I am not asking for the interpretation of an Act passed by the House, but I am asking for fair <Col N="1650" /> administration of the Act as it was interpreted by the House when it was being put through by the predecessor of the present Minister.  However, I have little more to say about it, except that so far as local authorities are concerned they believe, and they are entitled to because they were led to believe, that this section would operate in a certain way.  They are now told something quite different.  My contention is that if the present interpretation is right we have been led astray.  I think the Local Government Department in their administration ought to be more careful than to take up an attitude which they know perfectly well is not consistent with the attitude taken up by the predecessor of the present Minister, and which is responsible at the present moment for a lot of muddle in local government affairs.</P>

      <P>As a member of one of the local authorities in County Cork, I may say that we find the great difficulty in carrying out a housing scheme is the providing of funds.  I hope the Minister will take into consideration the advisability of enabling local authorities to obtain long term loans for the building of houses.  The Midleton Urban Council have a site purchased for the last two years.  We have some houses built and are trying to complete the scheme, but we cannot get money from the banks for a longer period than fifteen years.  The rate per week at which the houses could be let is too much for people of the poor class.  With long term loans these houses could be let at a reasonable rent.  With regard to rural workers, the Act of 1906 was one of the best ever put into operation.  Under that Act a house and an acre of land could be let at 1s. per week, and the rural workers were able to get proper houses.  I would ask the Minister to extend that Acts so that we could carry out another scheme in County Cork. One Department under the Minister for Local Government, that is the National Health Insurance Act, is being administered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CAREY</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to sanitation in villages, we have had under consideration for a long time in County Cork the question of carrying out a big scheme for these villages, but it would involve a rather heavy expenditure on the part of the ratepayers.  While the economy party in the county council might make criticisms, and say the Government should put up money for schemes, still they are very slow in asking the ratepayers to foot the Bill for carrying out schemes of sanitation. If a certain amount of money were put aside by local authorities for schemes, and a rate were struck by the county councils, that would be one way of putting villages in a proper condition from a sanitary point of view.  If that is not done the Local Government Department will have to consider the advisability of insisting that the county councils should carry out these schemes.  So far as national health is concerned a medical appointment has been made by the Cork County Council within the last three or four months as the result of which the school children and the public generally will benefit. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the amalgamation scheme which was carried out some years ago as regards unions and hospitals.  There is no doubt that has been the cause of a great deal of hardship in Cork county, which is one of the largest in Ireland, with a valuation of over £1,000,000.  I think it is not a step in the right direction that a county like Cork should have only one home for the whole county.  I have been twenty years in local public life, and in my opinion there should be four homes for Cork county, one each for the north, south, east and west and one for Cork city, with an hospital attached to each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People living in rural areas are different to people living in the towns and cities.  They believe in living amongst their own people, and if they have to go into an institution they want to go into one where their relatives can come and see them every Sunday at least, and can bring them some little extra comforts.  It is bedrock commonsense that something should be done to meet the local wishes.  If you want to make a real success of local administration you will have to consult local <Col N="1652" /> opinion.  In that respect I am glad to say all parties are agreed that poor people are not treated as they ought to be treated.  Deputy Sir James Craig referred to poor old persons suffering from rheumatism.  They should not be left in their own homes, but should be sent into a county home or hospital. These people naturally would wish their people to be able to see them once a week and get any little extras they may need.  I think there is too much centralising.  There is centralisation in the way of purchasing.  From time to time stocks are wanted by local authorities.  The central purchasing authority has a price list for certain commodities, and I think that could be made elastic, and that local traders should get the opportunity of tendering for the supply of those commodities to the different institutions.  They are local ratepayers and they would like to see reverting back to them some of the money they pay in rates for the upkeep of these institutions.</P>
    <P>If the local authorities assert themselves and can depend on one another to carry out certain objects in local administration; if they consult together in a proper civic spirit, they will have no trouble in overcoming the difficulties in the way of housing and sanitation.  If they are united in coming to the Department and insist on getting reasonable concessions, such as long loans for housing in the case of urban councils, I feel sure they will succeed.</P>

      <P>A comparison between the number of the staff in 1919 in the old Local Government Board and the number of the staff on these Estimates will be useful and give Deputies room for thought.  In no other Department has the work been so centralised as in this Department.  We find that both the cost and the number of officials have been increased.  The total staff in 1919 was 229 for 32 counties, while the present staff for 26 counties is 259.  The total expenditure in 1919 for 32 counties was £132,022, and the present expenditure is £404,556, an increase of over 300 per cent.  The total for salaries in 1919 was £68,974 for 32 counties, and at present is £90,385, an increase <Col N="1653" /> of over 130 per cent.  In 1919 there were 21 auditors as against 18 now; nine general and three temporary inspectors as against 11 now; ten general and one temporary.  In addition, there are four inspectors and one technical assistant in the Trade Department&mdash; that is, 15 inspectors as against 12 in 1919.  There were five medical inspectors and an allowance of £500 for a temporary inspector in 1919; now we have 11 medical inspectors.  There were two lady inspectors for the inspection of boarded-out children in 1919; we have one now.  There were four engineering inspectors and three temporary inspectors in 1919; there are eight general and housing inspectors and five temporary inspectors now&mdash; that is seven in 1919 and 13 now.  There was one legal and one assistant legal officer in 1919; there is the same number at present; one Registrar of old age pensions in 1919, and one now; 114 clerks in 1919 as against 104 now; 20 typists as against 28 now, and three in the Trade Department; 22 messengers and one porter, as against 32 messengers and 5 porters to-day; 16 cleaners and fire lighters as against 23 now; 1 draughtsman in 1919 and one now, and one office keeper.  That is a total of 225 as against 258 to-day.  A person would naturally think that increased work is accountable for the increase in the staff, but that is not so.  As the returns show, there are 104 on the clerical staff as against 114 in 1919. The increase in staff is noticeable in the higher appointments.  There are now 14 general inspectors as against 9 in 1919, and an increase in the medical inspectors from 5 in 1919 to 11 now. In the Engineering Department the increase is even more marked.  There is a staff of 8 general and 5 temporary inspectors now, as against 4 general and 3 temporary in 1919.  The increase in the cost of the Department and in the number of the staff is not warranted, and this country will not be able to bear either the cost or the number of officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1919 there were 158 Unions and 210 Rural District Councils.  In the case of the Unions they have been centralised to 27 County Homes, and the Rural District Councils have been abolished.  We have now one Union as <Col N="1654" /> against 158 in 1919, and one Rural Council as against 210 in 1919.  Therefore, the work cannot have increased. It is obvious that centralisation has not tended to reduce charges, but to increase them.  The Local Government Department is to-day costing three-and-a-half times what it cost in 1919.</P>

      <P>It is in the Estimates.  I also draw attention to the fact that there is on the staff of the Department two general inspectors, one medical inspector, one trade inspector, and one auditor, who are acting as Commissioners in the place of elected bodies.  I submit that that is a policy which should be resisted and opposed by every Deputy.  If these officials were required to perform the work of the Department to which they were appointed, one would think they would be working for the Department and not doing work that should be done by councils elected by the ratepayers. Fancy an auditor acting as a Commissioner, while the accounts of the Leitrim County Home have not been audited since the County Home Committee was set up in 1922!</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">

    <Speaker pid="SamuelEHolt" hpid="Mr. HOLT Mr. HOLT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOLT</NameTxt>
      <P>The accounts for some of these years must be ready.  The County Council spent twelve months asking the Department to send down an auditor to audit their accounts. They had to threaten the Department that they would resign unless an auditor was sent.  The accounts of the County Committee of Agriculture have not been audited for three years.  I am only dealing with Leitrim.  What occurs in other parts of the country I do not know.  If the Department can afford to have an auditor acting as a Commissioner while these accounts are <Col N="1655" /> not audited, it is a very serious and discreditable state of affairs.</P>
      <P>I should like to have some idea of the policy underlying the appointment of these Commissioners.  We have had a very bitter experience in connection with the Commissioner sent to Leitrim. It is only recently we got the audited accounts.  They were thrown at the heads of the Councillors on the last day that they will meet before the elections next month, and we have had no opportunity of going into them.  I notice in the accounts that a sum of over £8,000 was cancelled by the Commissioner and sanction given by the Department for that cancellation.  What right have the Department to give that sanction?  None whatever.  The report of the auditor states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The net amount of Mr. Curran's arrears was £4,259 9s. 8d.  On the recommendation of the Commissioner the Department of Local Government and Public Health agreed to the writing off of this sum of £4,259 9s. 8d. as irrecoverable arrears.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Did anybody ever hear anything like that before?  I have been connected with public work and public bodies since 1898 and I never knew of an application like that coming from any public body before.  The report also states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In Collector James McMorrow's district for the half-year ending March 31, 1921, there were arrears amounting to £350 13s. 6d.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In Collector James McNulty's district the Ministry agreed to strike off the sum of £978 4s. 6d.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the money in Collector McNulty's district could be collected at any time he is asked to collect it.  When the Commissioner came down in 1923 our rates were 1s. 11d. in the £ on land and 3s. 11d. in the £ on buildings.  When the Commissioner left there was an overdraft of £35,000 in the Munster and Leinster Bank and <Col N="1656" /> the rates on land had gone up to 6s. 6d. in the £, and on buildings to 10s. in the £.  So much for the Commissioner in Leitrim.  The people of Leitrim are well salted.  Yet we find in the papers, from time to time, that bodies here in Dublin are asking for Commissioners to be appointed.  I wish they had the experience we have gone through, and then they would not ask for the appointment of Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In respect to the road grants made to the County Councils, I was comparing the grants given to Leitrim with those given to Roscommon.  In 1923, I find Leitrim only got £1,540, as against £2,820 for Roscommon; in 1924, £15,000 as against £28,000 for Roscommon; in 1925, £8,000 as against £12,000 for Roscommon; in 1926, £24,091 as against £24,092 for Roscommon; in 1927, £25,601 as against £49,574 to Roscommon; and, so far as this year is concerned, we have received £6,830 as against £12,210.</P>
    <P>Our population is very close to that of Roscommon&mdash;that is, 78,000 as against 93,000 in Roscommon.  On the basis of population we should get an increased sum.  Of course, Leitrim is not as rich or so highly rated as Roscommon, but I hold that poor counties like Leitrim, Donegal and Kerry, for instance, should get preferential treatment in respect of these grants.  In regard to the Agricultural Grant, I notice this year in the case of Leitrim the sum of £3,715 6s. 8d. was deducted from a grant of £5,145 15s. 0d., leaving a balance to the county of only £1,430 8s. 4d.; while the sum of £905 4s. 0d. is deducted from the Estate Duty grant of £1,090 13s. 9d., leaving £185 9s. 9d. This £905 is deducted because there were arrears of land annuities.  Altogether there is a sum of £1,616 sent to us, instead of £6,236 8s. 9d., and this means a rate of 8d. in the £, if we do not get this grant.  I notice that in the case of Roscommon there is a sum of £10,000 proposed to be deducted this year from the Agricultural Grant for arrears on land annuities.  I hold that the rates should not be made amenable for the collection of land annuities.</P>

It is too bad to ask the sick poor to journey 50 miles to the County Home.  I suggest that the hospitals in the old disused workhouses should be re-opened, in the case of Leitrim in any case, and that district hospitals should be established there. I would like to get some information from the Minister as to when he intends to put the recommendations of the Poor Law Commission into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if I am in order in discussing on this Vote the local appointments that have been made by the county councils and that have not been sanctioned by the Department?  Nine months ago a home assistance officer was <Col N="1659" /> appointed in Leitrim, and up to the present moment the Department have not sanctioned the appointment of that officer.  The work is thrown upon another officer.  I do not know why there is such delay or why it takes nine months for the Department to make up its mind in the case of such a simple appointment.  Is it for political reasons that this man's appointment has not been sanctioned?  Then we have the case of a typist.  The county council appointed, by a majority vote, a typist, and the Department thought fit to turn down that appointment, for what reason I do not know.  They give no reason, because the young lady who was appointed by the county council was never asked up to be examined as to whether she was suitable or not for the position.  That is another political issue, I suppose, between the Department and the local bodies.</P>
    <P>Then we have the case of a rate collector.  A young lady who was appointed rate collector in the place of her brother unfortunately paid in the rates that were outstanding, and now her appointment is turned down by the Department.  I hold that is very unfair.</P>

      <P>There is another matter to which I want to refer, the matter of overdue accounts.  In the years 1921-1922, during the troubled times, there was quite a number of accounts due to contractors and others, and because the Boards of Guardians at that time had not sufficient money on hands these people were not paid their accounts. I think the Department would be quite justified in bringing in a short Bill making it legal to pay these accounts now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to housing, instead of the doles and bribes that are given out at election times by this Department in conjunction with the Land Commission, I would like to see the Department give grants similar to the grants that were given by the Congested Districts Board for the repair of houses.  I would like to see grants of that sort given instead of the doles and bribes that were given at the elections.  I <Col N="1660" /> would also like to ask the Minister about the purchase of labourers' cottages, and if the different county councils put up schemes will the Minister sanction such schemes?  I know that we in Leitrim could at any time put up a scheme, if it meets with the approval of the Minister, for the sale of labourers' cottages to the occupying tenants and it will not cost the ratepayers anything, and, I think, from what I know about labourers' cottages, that the ratepayers would be well rid of them. The rent that is paid does not cover the cost of the repair in many instances. Deputy O'Kelly asked about relief to occupiers of labourers' cottages.  As I mentioned on a previous occasion, there is a penal section in the Act that should be removed.  That section that has been in operation against the Irish people since the workhouses were built, should now be deleted.  It was put into the Act by the English Government in order to lessen the hold of the people upon the land, and in fact to get them to go to the workhouse or to accept relief.  The Act, as it stands at present, provides that a person who holds more than a quarter acre of land cannot get outdoor relief.  That Act should be repealed.</P>
    <P>In regard to sanitary works in small towns in rural areas, I know that the real difficulty is due to the fact that the areas of charge have never been fixed, and when the grant was given, such as the unemployment grant, the people could not avail of it, for the simple reason that in rural areas the people are averse to putting up schemes for sanitary purposes for towns.  They will not sanction schemes in any cases that I know.  All the local bodies are against the towns getting sanitary facilities at the expense of the rural districts.  The chief difficulty is the area of charge, and until the Minister changes the area of charge, there is no use in giving grants for this purpose. The people in the rural districts say that the towns should pay for their own sanitation.</P>
    <P>There is also another matter, and that is the grants to nurses in rural areas.  From 1912 up to last year we were fortunate enough to have the services of a nurse who was appointed <Col N="1661" /> under the Jubilee Nurses' Scheme, but she got married last year and went away; and we have not sufficient money to pay a successor.  There is no better work for which the Department could give a grant-in-aid than that done by these nurses.  I would like to see the scheme extended to every district. That lady who worked in our county did invaluable work in the Carrick-on-Shannon district, and I would like to see the Minister giving a grant for similar nurses elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that the position in so far as sanitation is concerned was not so bad as the picture that has been painted here by practically every Deputy who got up.  If the position is so bad, I have no hesitation in saying that the Local Government Department is not altogether to blame for that state of affairs.  The local authorities all over the country have sufficient power to carry out sanitary schemes by themselves.  I do not say that at the moment or for the last three or four years this work could have been done by the local bodies unaided. But for years past when money was cheap, and when it was easier to get money from the banks than it is now, I believe that more attention should have been paid to the sanitation of towns and villages in Ireland, and if the sanitation is so bad as it has been pointed out to-day, I am beginning to think that after all I do represent a model county council, because County Wexford is not as bad as the other counties have been pictured for you here to-day.  We have had suggestions from some Deputies that there should be centralisation so far as sanitation is concerned, while on the other hand we have had complaints that we have had too much centralisation.  I must admit that it is hard for the Local Government Department to make up its mind on this matter in the face of these conflicting statements.  I always find it hard to criticise the Local Government Department, because in my dealings with that Department, I have always found the officials most courteous, and they are imbued with a good progressive outlook so far as most of the things that I have brought before them are concerned.  I do honestly believe <Col N="1662" /> that if the heads of the various sections had sufficient money at their disposal, and if they were allowed to put their own outlook into operation, that a great many of the things that we complain of from year to year here would be speedily remedied.</P>
      <P>A great many of the public bodies have for years been shelving the sanitary question.  The outlook of a certain type of people in this country for years, especially on the county councils, has been nothing but economy. They talk economy and they act economy from the first day they come into a public board until they go out again.</P>
      <P>They pay no attention to the representations made to them by the medical profession or by people who have an interest in the poor&mdash;people who have an interest in how the poor are living, and people who complain of the conditions under which the poor live.  Their care has always been economy and they forget that the economy they have been practising is false economy, that the people's health has been suffering all the time, and that they have brought the particular place they represent into the position now that it will take Government intervention before anything can be done to set right public health matters and sanitary matters generally.  I do agree that we have now arrived at the stage when it is necessary there should be Departmental intervention in order to get some of the towns and villages in Ireland into a proper sanitary condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to housing, two or three Deputies have spoken about housing and everybody has the same complaint &mdash;that it is very hard to get money over a long term.  That is, to my mind, what is preventing the housing question from being solved.  I have pointed out in this House for the last five years, every time housing was under discussion, that it was the position taken up by the banks that prevented the various public bodies in Ireland from making an earnest effort to solve the housing problem.  The President knows as well as I do that it is absolutely impossible for a public authority to build houses in any part of the State to-day and let those houses at anything <Col N="1663" /> approaching an economic rent.  So long as that state of affairs prevails, there is no possibility of solving the problem and the question is only being touched on the fringe.</P>

      <P>The President has admitted when dealing with the matter of housing that he is about to do something in the way of the lending of money over a long term.  He admits that it is absolutely necessary that money should be given over a long term of years in order that an appreciable effort might be made by local authorities in the State to solve the housing problem.  I hope that the Committee that is being set up, in consequence <Col N="1664" /> of the Report of the Unemployment Committee, will have pressure brought to bear upon it by the President with a view to a decision in the very near future.  We are now practically in mid-summer, and if anything is going to be done at all this year we ought to have the report of that Committee very shortly.  As the President knows, it is not good policy to build houses in the winter time, and, unfortunately, we are never very long without the winter in this country, and if we are to have houses built at all it should be in the summer period.</P>
      <P>I am sorry I was not here when the Minister was speaking.  I understand he stated that his Department is not in the position to give any more money for road maintenance than what has already been given, or what each local authority has been notified of.  I stated here some time ago that the policy of the Local Government Department in so far as road-making this year is concerned has placed many, if not all, of the county councils and other local authorities in a very peculiar position. The rates were struck before any intimation was received from the Minister as to the amount of money available for road-making.  The county councils naturally were of the opinion that a similar amount or very nearly the amount that was available last year and in previous years would again be available this year, and they struck their rates in accordance with what they considered would be their due. The result is that now, when so much money is not forthcoming, the roads will be allowed to get into a state of disrepair again.  I will give the Department credit for placing a good deal of money at the disposal of the county councils for the past two or three years, with the result that good roads have been constructed all over the State: but they will deteriorate very rapidly now that there is a change of policy in the Local Government Department in so far as road-making is concerned. I ask the Minister to reconsider this very important question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were given to understand last year that there was something like two millions available, and that it was going to be raised on foot of the amount of <Col N="1665" /> money taken from motor taxation.  A false impression was created all over the State that a certain amount of money was to be available during the next two years.  That has been knocked on the head now, so far as we can see, and the county councils are in a peculiar position.  I think the Minister and his Department ought to reconsider the whole question.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the question of central purchasing.  In so far as central purchasing generally is concerned, I have been converted to the idea that it is good for the country.  I have had experience of goods that could be purchased a lot cheaper by buying them through the Department, but there is this aspect of the situation that I wish to refer to: I think that more attention ought to be paid to the quality of the goods procured by the Central Purchasing Department.  From time to time public bodies have purchased certain commodities through the Central Purchasing Department and they have been absolute shoddy.  I think also greater attention should be given to the support of Irish manufacture by the Central Purchasing Department, and a greater degree of preference, if any preference is given at all, should be given to Irish manufacture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy make any suggestion as to how that might be done, because it has been a great concern of mine to endeavour to see that Irish manufacture is given preference; but owing to the fact that the local bodies are the actual purchasers, I find myself up against a difficulty in the matter which I am at present trying to get over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand what the Minister means by saying that the local bodies are the actual purchasers.  They are nothing of the kind.  There is a list submitted to them, the prices are there and they are told that they must accept those prices unless, of course, that they can get a lower or an equal tender in their own area.  But apart from the question of Irish manufacture which, of course, I would like to stress, I would urge that more attention should be paid to the kind of goods, because some of the <Col N="1666" /> goods are absolute shoddy and rubbish.</P>
      <P>There is one matter on which I would like to have the views of the Minister.  In some of the towns in Ireland municipal bodies have had difficulty in securing rates from the Franciscan Order.  The Department has been asked by various public bodies from time to time, what the position is in so far as the Franciscans are concerned. We all know the history of the dispute between the British Government and this Order.  The Franciscans were classed as outlaws, and maintain that according to law they occupy the same position and refuse to pay rates.  It is a serious matter for a great many local authorities, and I think it is time the Minister for Local Government adjusted it in some way. The Ministry have been asked on various occasions by the public bodies if the latter have not secured an answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. ALFRED BYRNE Mr. ALFRED BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ALFRED BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise not so much to criticise the Vote as to appeal to the Minister for Local Government to get the authorities in charge of Poor Law Administration to loosen a little the tightening-up process going on for the last couple of years.  It is really economy gone mad.  The economies are at the expense of the very poor. There are very many poor families in <Col N="1667" /> working class areas in the city of Dublin on the verge of starvation.  I do not wish to exaggerate, in any way, that statement.  It is due to the administration of the Poor Law system in Dublin city which is different from that of any other part of the country. Section 13 of the Poor Law Act is in operation in every area in Ireland with the exception of the city of Dublin, and I appeal to the Minister to see that the discretionary powers in Section 13 of the Poor Law Act are put into operation immediately in the city of Dublin, because in his own area there are fathers healthy and fit to work who cannot get work.  Until that father breaks down in health and secures a doctor's certificate or goes into hospital the authorities who have the administration of public funds will not give as much as a cup of tea to his children, but if he breaks down in health, secures a doctor's certificate or goes into hospital the Poor Law authorities then step in and at very heavy expense support the family of that unfortunate man.  I ask the House do they wish to see in the city of Dublin a different set of circumstances from what exists in any other part of the country?</P>
      <P>It is already stated that we have 8,000 people signing up at the Dublin Labour Exchange and the Minister's Department granted to Dublin city £20,000 out of, I believe, an unemployment grant of £100,000.  If the proportion of £20,000 to the 8,000 people is not correct, I want to know where the balance of that money went to.  Has it gone into the areas that have power to put Section 13 into operation and given relief to the poor and unemployed? The area that cannot or will not put Section 13 into operation gets the smallest share of the unemployed grant.  I ask the House is that fair? Are those people to continue to suffer because of the failure of the Department to do what has been done when another Government was operating in this country?  I only ask that the city of Dublin shall be treated as the unfortunate unemployed or poor in other districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the poor rate goes down, but as it goes down the overdrafts <Col N="1668" /> of the charitable institutions of Dublin become bigger and bigger, and they have to make an appeal to a certain section of the public to do the duty that, I hold, the general ratepayer should do, by administering relief to those people.  It is not fair to ask a certain section of the charitably disposed people in this country to take upon their shoulders the duty of the general ratepayer when, for a penny or twopence in the £, they could prevent those hardships to children of the unemployed. In connection with that I draw attention to one item of grants under the Education (Provision of Meals) (Ireland) Act, 1917.  In spite of the growing poverty that exists you will see that the School Meals Grant is reduced by £3,550.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that in my introductory remarks.  It does not mean that there will be less distribution this year than last.  As a matter of fact more local bodies are taking advantage of it this year than last, but it was necessary last year to make provision for more than a year's payment, because in previous years a local authority could not get the money it was entitled to under this Act until after the expiration of the financial year when they could show what the total expenditure was.  Last year we made an arrangement so that they could get the advance they were entitled to during the year.  £10,550 represented last year something more than a year's expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BYRNE Mr. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally from what I know of the hardships that school children suffer in the citly of Dublin who leave their homes in the tenement areas on the north and south sides to go to school without breakfast, without even a cup of tea in some cases, I would ask the Minister to see that there is an extension of the benefits in the city of Dublin.  Unemployment, no matter what grants were made recently, has not decreased in Dublin.  I wish I could say otherwise.  I also noticed that grants in respect of housing which would give employment in the building trade are reduced, thus creating further unemployment.  I have tried to <Col N="1669" /> make clear that I am not in any way attacking or criticising the Vote that is before the House, but I am making an appeal to the Minister to see that Dublin will get a better chance than it is getting at present.  We all know that when unemployment is bad in the country, when a young man in any country district becomes idle, in some way or another, by walking or otherwise, he comes to Dublin city in the hope that he is going to get work.  He drifts slowly, but surely, into the rotten tenements in Dublin city.  What does that mean?  The local authority in his own area is saved the upkeep of that man who walked from his own district to Dublin.</P>
      <P>I say that matter should be considered. I say that an unfortunate man, with his wife and children, who are placed in that position should get proper treatment.  If there is any doubt about such cases existing, I will give particulars to the Minister.  I know of cases of people who walked long distances to the city and who have called on me.  There is, for instance, the case of a man with a wife and child who, by easy stages, reached Dublin, and eventually found himself begging on the streets.  He is a fine, hefty young man.  I say that something should be done for people of that kind, and if work cannot be provided for those people, they should not be allowed to go hungry at our doors.  I earnestly express the hope that the Minister will impress upon those who are charged with administration of relief in the city to do everything in their power to give relief work to the unemployed, because since the 7th of last March not one man has been taken on on relief work in the city of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>Having some experience of local administration in the country, I find that there is a decided objection on the part of county councils to the system of centralisation that has taken place in the last few years. A good deal of opinion existed at one time in the early stages as to the advantages that would accrue from that, but after some years' experience I find that it is the practically unanimous opinion that the centralisation scheme is not at all successful.  I am referring <Col N="1670" /> to the centralisation scheme which resulted in the abolition of various workhouses all over the country and the institution of the county home, and also to the institution of the centralised form of purchasing.  There is no doubt that when first started the underlying motives were sound, and the people generally thought that it was an advance on the old system of workhouses. To an extent it has been successful. It was thought that when the scheme was first initiated it would remove the taint of the workhouse from those institutions and that they would be in a position to provide something like decent modern home comforts for the inmates.  Our hopes in that direction have not been realised. Notwithstanding increased rates and general expenditure, the various counties now find they have to be satisfied by providing a home for those poor people in one of the old workhouses, with very little improvement in housing accommodation.  That is certainly a matter that must receive attention. It is very pitiable in some of the county homes I know of to see these poor people huddled together under conditions that are neither sanitary nor afford a decent measure of comfort for the inmates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pass now to the other form of centralisation&mdash;the combined purchasing scheme.  It is claimed that as a result of this scheme the public boards have been saved a considerable amount of money, inasmuch as they are supplied at a cheaper rate from the centralised purchasing body, but there is a decided disadvantage in it, because it deprives local contractors or traders, who in the ordinary way would be the contractors to those institutions, and who are ratepayers, of any facilities by way of the increased purchasing power that they would possess as a result of being contractors to these institutions for which they are directly responsible as ratepayers. It deprives them of those facilities by which they could purchase goods on special terms, and to that extent it injures their customers in the locality.  We are not at all satisfied that the little advantage these institutions secure by way of a lesser charge on the goods supplied is any advantage, <Col N="1671" /> because we do not fully know what the cost of that centralised purchasing body is to the country.  It is a very doubtful proposition as to whether it is any real gain at all to have that form of centralised purchasing.  Many of the local institutions complain that they have not the same means of remedying faulty goods sent in as if they were dealing with local contractors. After some years' experience, I have the opinion of some local bodies that the scheme is not satisfactory, nor is it in the interests of the institutions, either from the point of view of economy or general satisfaction.</P>
    <P>Apart from the matter of centralisation there is a tendency to deprive local bodies of every form of authority that as public representatives they should have.  Local representatives are treated merely as children at school.  They are dictated to in every turn and move they make in the discharge of their duties. The only authority is the Local Government Department, and whatever decision the local authorities come to, it is always subject to the Local Government Department.  The Local Government Department may or may not sanction it.  The whole matter rests on their veto.  So much has centralisation gone on, and so much has this system of taking liberties and power from the local representatives gone on, that at present it is very difficult to find intelligent men with any self-respect to undertake the duties of public representatives on these boards.  If the Local Government Department had a little more confidence in the people and was prepared to give extended power to local bodies, rather than filch from them the powers they have, much more interest would be taken in the selection of public representatives, and much keener interest would be taken by these representatives in the discharge of their duties.  There would be also much more efficiency and much more economy in connection with local administration. We heard some Deputies speaking of the great efforts that have been made for economy, and of how energetic most public bodies are in striving for economy.  What are the results?  We have a Government which claims that <Col N="1672" /> it is working on economic lines, but that economy is so great that they consider it necessary to pay substantial salaries to their various officials.  When it comes to a question of expenses for county councillors, their economy and their appreciation of the duty discharged by public representatives are gauged by the amount of travelling expenses they allow&mdash;2½d. per mile.  Down the country one man described that as being something like the midwife's jaunt.  They allow enough to take people out of their homes, but they have to find their own way home.  An allowance of 2½d. a mile to county councillors is not sufficient.  This Government is not responsible for the collection of the money, which comes from the pockets of the ratepayers, and they are satisfied to pay their representatives on the public boards at least full travelling expenses.  If they are satisfied, I claim that the Government has no right to interfere with the ratepayers in doing what they consider is best for the honest discharge of the duties by public representatives.</P>

      <P>It appears so.  There has been a good deal of discussion here about the money that is spent on the roads.  One would imagine that the Government found the money from some source other than from the farmers, and that they are entitled to a lot of credit.  I would like to know what was the total sum collected from the sixpenny rate for the past five years, and which came to an end last March.  That rate was struck for the purpose of making good the damage done to the various bridges during the period of civil strife, and during the trouble with the British.  The total amount spent on repairs to the damaged bridges <Col N="1673" /> amounted to something like £400,000, while the amount collected from the sixpenny rate in the Twenty-Six Counties ran into a sum of some million pounds.</P>

      <P>I cannot say.  I have asked the question as I would like to know what has become of the difference. Has the difference been put into the public fund from which grants have been made by the Local Government Department through various bodies?  If so, I would like to know what proportion each county got from the sum collected.  I am conversant with some of the poorer counties in the Twenty-Six Counties, County Leitrim, for instance, and it seems to be agreed that we have not got the full allowance by way of grants from the Local Government Department.  I claim that it is a most unjust act for this Government to spend money collected from the poor unfortunate farmers in a congested county like Leitrim on roads around the city of Dublin, where the people are very much better able to maintain roads.  I claim that there has not been honest administration in that Department, and I would like to have a full statement as to how the money collected from the sixpenny tax was spent in each county.  A statement was made by Deputy Corish that the economy effort on the part of local bodies has, in fact, been detrimental to the poor.  While local bodies certainly strive for economy in so far as it is necessary to do so, seeing that the whole lives of the poor are made up of one desperate struggle for existence, and that a very meagre one, I have never known any public body in this country to refuse full sympathy to the poor. They endeavour to treat the poor as generously as their means would allow, or perhaps a little beyond that.  I refute the statement that public bodies are cheeseparing when they come to deal with the poor.  Only that they are debarred, as they very often are by the Local Government Department, they would be more generous than they are.</P>

      <P>This form of control by the Local Government Department has a very injurious effect on administration generally by local bodies.  I am quite satisfied that local bodies are capable of managing their own business in their own way.  Each county council should have authority to select its own officials in its own way.  I have experience where selections were made of officials to fill various posts.  I can give the Minister details of these.  One case was that of two nurses in Manorhamilton. The local committee made the appointment, and it was subject to ratification by the Local Government Department.  In one instance twelve <Col N="1675" /> months elapsed before they sanctioned the appointment, with the result that a temporary assistant had to be paid at the rate of £3 a week, while the payment in the case of the permanent appointment would have been at the rate of £80 a year.  The local rates were made to bear that increased expense.  Another instance is that of a case a few weeks ago in Sligo Mental Hospital.  A selection was made by the Local Appointments Commissioners. The Committee, having considered the whole circumstances, decided that the Local Appointments Commissioners had not given due notice to one of the applicants, inasmuch as they only allowed five days from the date on which they sent out the notice to the applicant that she was required to attend for examination.  Having regard to the fact that in some rural districts there is only a delivery of letters every three days, that notice was insufficient, the applicant did not receive it in time, and was not able to attend.  In the opinion of the whole Committee that applicant was, beyond question, the best qualified person, according to the terms set out in the advertisement published by the Commissioners. The Committee refused to make the appointment of the applicant selected by the Local Appointments Commissioners on the grounds that sufficient notice was not given.  The Department weighed the matter for two months, and at the end of the second month they sent word to the Committee stating that the selection had been made and that the Committee must accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a similar way we have had experience of centralisation in Leitrim.  The Leitrim County Council was disbanded by the Department some years ago, and a big measure of centralisation was effected by the appointment of a Commissioner. The Commissioner, a very able gentleman, spent a few years in the county, and a short time before he left he stated that he had been spared by the Government for the purpose of clearing up the mess in Leitrim, and that he had succeeded.  The result of his work was in the hands of the County Council in Carrick-on-Shannon yesterday, <Col N="1676" /> in the shape of the auditor's report for the period in question, and we discovered that he had succeeded in clearing up the mess to the extent that £8,000 irrecoverable rates had been wiped out by the Department on his recommendation.  A rate collector present informed me that £900 of that amount was in his warrant.  He assured me that he was in a position to collect £800 of that, but that he was not given the opportunity.  That is what happened in the case of one rate collector, and I claim that the same thing would probably be applicable to the rest of the £8,000.  So much for the clean administration and the management of the perfect system of centralisation under the Commissioner's control.</P>
    <P>There was also before that meeting yesterday a request from the Local Government Department to set aside certain surcharges that had been made against the same Commissioner.  Any Deputy who has experience of public boards will realise how difficult it is to get the Department to take a lenient and merciful view in such cases.  They invariably insist that the letter of the law must be complied with, but in this case, because it was one of their own nominees who made the mistake, they appealed for consideration for him, so that it should be a public charge rather than be paid by the man who was responsible. That is typical of your centralising powers.  I feel that the honest way of administering these things is to give wider powers of administration to the county councils than they have, and to cease meddling with them and interfering with their administration at every turn by this Department, which has little interest in and little knowledge of local conditions. There is far too much expenditure and far too much inspection.  You should loosen this control by inspection and this centralised control that you have applied in many departments of late.  But there are a few departments that require to be taken control of from the local bodies.  The Local Government Department should be responsible for the upkeep of the main roads, because it is unfair for the farmers, who maintain roads suitable for their own requirements, to be called upon to <Col N="1677" /> maintain roads specially for motor traffic, in which they have very little interest.  If these roads are to be made passable for motor traffic under modern conditions that should be the affair of the State and should not be left to the local farmers, who often find such roads more of an inconvenience than an advantage.  I also say that the control and maintenance of the mental hospitals, which is a very heavy charge, should be centralised and made a State charge.  By doing that and by getting rid of so many of those public officials who are wandering round the country inspecting, reporting, and inconveniencing these public boards, they would relieve the local ratepayers of these charges, and the councils would probably be able to make some effort to deal with local requirements by building labourers' cottages, providing better housing accommodation, and better homes for the poor unfortunate people who have to reside at the end of their days in public institutions.</P>
    <P>As far as hospitals are concerned, I have to complain that there is not at all sufficient accommodation.  In Leitrim there is only one home and one hospital for the treatment of the most severe cases, and often a patient has to travel thirty-five miles to reach the hospital. That is not in accordance with humanity.  Doctors have told me that the health of their patients has often been very much prejudiced by having to take such journeys over very indifferent roads at certain periods of the year.  That is not humane treatment, and if that is the best result of centralisation, centralisation has been a failure in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience of the Local Government Department, I have found that they are always very willing to help a public body whenever a decent scheme is put up to them. One Deputy not very long ago said that the ratepayers would be well rid of the labourers' cottages and that they should be sold to the tenants.  I say that the ratepayers would be well advised to build more labourers' cottages, and I stand up to-night to ask the Minister to go back to the old system that obtained under the rural district councils and once again inaugurate <Col N="1678" /> schemes of labourers' cottage-building. I hold that the Act under which these cottages were built was the best Act that this country ever had, and we, a new Government, a national Government, a home Government, should preserve that instead of scrapping it or partly scrapping it.  I would ask the Minister to take steps to renew these schemes of labourers' cottage-building that were so fruitful of good health to the children and to the labourers in rural districts.  There were some housing schemes in the urban areas, but I am certain that when the necessity for starting these labourers' cottage schemes is put before the Department the rural labourers will have very little to complain of.  The ratepayers in my district are not anxious to shirk the responsibility of keeping labourers' cottages in repair, and are not ready to get rid of them.  They are valuable to the country, and neither the ratepayers nor the Government will ever get rid of them, because they can never be done without.  They are the bone and sinew of the labourers.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that home assistance is not well carried out in the different districts.  I belong to the different public bodies in County Cork and am a member of the home assistance committee.  I can assure the House that in my district this system of home assistance is admirably carried out.  No person, whether he has land or not, if it is proved that he is destitute, is ever left without immediate relief.  I desire to congratulate the Local Government Department for seeing that, under recent legislation, a county medical inspector was appointed in Cork.  To my mind, he is the most useful official in the county.  He is a disinterested man, and in going around through the villages and towns is not afraid of landlords or others to condemn houses that need to be condemned.  He has no interest in any of these people.  They are not paying patients of his, and if he finds that they own insanitary houses he condemns them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some county councillors who, after reducing the rate estimates put before them, go around shouting and pretending that they must raise <Col N="1679" /> the workers' wages, while their action at the county council meeting makes it impossible to maintain the present rates paid to the workers.  When that sort of thing fails with them they go round saying, &ldquo;Ah, it is the Local Government Board; the Local Government Board is not giving us fair play, and if we got fair play we would give you a better time of it.&rdquo;  But these are the very people who, when Government grants are sent down for the roads, collar the grants and, instead of applying them to the roads, apply them for the benefit of the rates.  They do not use the grants for the purposes for which they are intended, namely, to remove dangerous corners on the roads and for the execution of other useful works that would give employment to the labourers.  These grants are put to the benefit of the rates by a lot of councillors who pretend to be the labourers' friends.</P>
    <P>We are told that all the money that is spent on the roads comes from the farmers.  What about the motor taxation? I was told that, as regards the motor taxation, if there was a surplus in one part of the country it goes to another part.  I find as regards the much-abused Local Government Board that whenever a public body goes to them for a grant, if they see it is necessary for a district, they give it immediately.  Not alone that, but they do the same with the private individual if he knows how to get at them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been dealing with these matters for the last six years, for a period long before Deputy Maguire came into the House, and I want to show him that instead of the roads suffering as the result of the grants that are made that our objection, as Deputy Daly explains it, is that the grants are not used by many county councils for the purpose for which they are given, namely, for the making of the roads and the consequent relief of unemployment, but that instead they are used by many county councils by being put to the relief of the rates. What really happens is this: that when a county council is notified of the allocation to it of a grant of twenty, thirty, or forty thousand pounds, they take a sum of five, six, or up to ten thousand pounds off their county surveyor's ordinary estimate for the roads because of the fact that they are getting a grant.  Therefore, the grants, instead of being put to the making of the roads and the relief of unemployment, are put back into the ratepayers' pockets. If Deputy Maguire does not know that he ought to know it.  The Deputy talked about local economy and took Deputy Corish to task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Maguire questioned a statement made by Deputy Corish that many public bodies were economising at the expense of the poor.  I cannot speak of the conditions in Deputy Maguire's constituency, but I know a number of public bodies that have been doing so.  Public bodies in my constituency have fixed a maximum rate of outdoor relief for a <Col N="1682" /> destitute family at 4s. a week for a man's wife, and 1s. per week for each child, with no allowance whatever for the husband, so that the maximum outdoor relief given to a man, his wife and four children is 8s. per week, and the Local Government Department in this case does not prevent the payment of a larger allowance than that.  That rate was fixed by the County Board of Health.  People talk about atrocities committed in other countries, and in this so-called Christian country we are supposed to have some regard for humanity, but yet we have a county board of health fixing the maximum allowance for a family of six at 8s. per week.  With regard to the inspection of county homes and district hospitals, I am not satisfied from my experience, that the inspection of those institutions is what it should be, and I believe the Local Government Department is not insisting upon having those institutions as they should be.  It is well known to anybody who takes an interest in the matter that following on the amalgamation scheme old people were dragged across the country and put into buildings that were in the majority of cases old and without any proper sanitary accommodation.  They were herded together like cattle in those buildings, and that obtains to-day. In some of them there is no proper accommodation whatever, and no proper segregation.  I do not want to talk about the amalgamation scheme, but about what the Minister might do, and ought to do.  I believe it was one of the worst schemes ever carried through in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was against it from the very first on the grounds that there was no economy worth talking about, and any economy secured was at the expense of the very old and weak people.  In connection with the district hospitals, the Minister's Department insists that there shall be so many beds.  I confess that I do not understand the fixing of the number of beds in a district hospital at, say, 20.  The local doctor is warned that he is not to accept more than 20 patients for a particular hospital. What is the doctor to do if he has 20 patients in the hospital, and if others come along?  What is he supposed to do?  It is, I expect, to transfer <Col N="1683" /> some of the 20 to the county home, which is what frequently happens.  I think that is not a proper way to approach this matter.  We should have as good social services, if not better, as we had under the British Government. I do not think that any person in this House would claim that the social services to-day are anything like as good as they were under the British Government.  I wish principally to impress upon the Minister the absolute necessity for the strictest supervision and inspection of those county homes and hospitals.  I do not want to exaggerate, but it is a matter upon which I feel very strongly, and I say it is inhuman that old people should be parted away from their friends and the associations they have had all their lives to some place thirty, forty or fifty miles across the country.  So far as seeing their friends again is concerned, they might as well be sent to England or some other place, because in most cases their friends are so poor that they cannot afford to travel to see them.  The least we can do while the amalgamation scheme is in operation, is to see these old people in the county homes or district hospitals are made as comfortable as possible, and not herded together like they have been up to the present.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the debate with the greatest possible interest.  I find there is on every side a deep anxiety to improve the public services of the Saorstát.  The way to do that is by loyal co-operation amongst us, and instead of being severe on the Local Government Department we should rather encourage it to further effort.  We are all aware of what it had to go through for the last five years, and that it has been all up-hill work.  I was rather pained at the references by Deputies on the other side to the slums of Dublin and the way they have been neglected.  In the years that have gone why did not these critics who were living near the slums come into the Dáil and perform their duty towards those who reside in the slums?  Ireland will not be helped forward by following shadows and phantoms, but by facing up to the realities <Col N="1684" /> of the situation, and that is to properly house and feed the destitute.  I appeal to the Minister for Local Government, and I am sure my appeal will not be in vain, on behalf of the fishermen and labourers who reside along the seaboard of the Saorstát, and who are badly in need of assistance at the moment.  I know the anxiety of the Department in the past on their behalf, and I am sure it will respond to my appeal now.  In West Cork the houses of many of the fishermen are unfit for human habitation, and the labourers are flying from the land because they cannot get houses to reside in.  It is the duty of the Local Government Department to come along and help them. If Deputies are honest in what they have said, they should stand behind the Local Government Department and help in securing more grants of money. They cry out that there should be a loan of £2,000,000 of money.  Deputy O'Kelly has said that.  How are we to get that if we raise the banner of unrest again and frighten the people from putting their hands into their pockets to help the State?  I hope nonsense of that kind will disappear, and that we will all join loyally to support the Constitution in such a manner that before five years have elapsed everybody in the Saorstát will be happy and contented and as free as air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been several references to Commissioners to-night.  If they want to appoint Commissioners, why do they not appoint them to take charge of the Department if they are so anxious for Commissioners?  The Minister said that there was a reduction in the rates made by several county councils this year.  The reduction in Cork would be about 2s. in the £, but that is because the representatives realised that the ratepayers cannot pay the present rates and because these representatives are more in touch with the people than the Department.  Only for the interference of the Department with the Cork County Council during the last few years, further reductions would have been made.  The reduction, I must say, is also due to the fact that this is what I may call election year, and the Budget <Col N="1685" /> must be specially considered in view of the elections.</P>
      <P>A statement has been made that portion of the grants given for the upkeep of roads in Cork county has been handed over for the relief of rates.  I wish to contradict that statement definitely. What is going to the relief of the rates is the refund that we get from the Department of the percentage of the money that we expend on roads. If we spend a certain amount on roads, the Department guarantee that they will give a certain percentage of it. We get a refund of portion of that money, and that is what is going to the relief of the rates.</P>
      <P>I have looked over the salary list, and I am honestly surprised at the salary paid to the secretary of the Department (£1,200), while the secretary of Cork County Council is getting £2,900.  That is due to the great centralisation process that has been going on.  I cannot see how one man can do all the work that the secretary of that county council is supposed to do&mdash;how it is that all these positions are centralised in him.  He is secretary to the county council, and he is responsible for carrying out the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, and also the Franchise and Juries Act, and he gets a very large salary for each.  Some of the work he has to do is really national work, such as that in connection with the franchise.  When the secretary of that council is pensioned off his pension will be far more than his salary as secretary of the council.  I think that pension should not come out of the rates, but out of national funds.</P>

    <P>As to the Agricultural Grant of £600,000 I suggest that that grant, instead of going to the relief of the rates of ranchers with a thousand acres, employing only a man and a dog, should be given to the relief of the rates of tillage farmers.  The Minister some time ago asked Deputy Maguire for a definite instance of the cutting of workers' wages.  I myself in Cork saw one of the Department's officials raising his hands in holy horror at the idea of paying 35s. per week to workmen. He said they could get plenty of men for 29s.  If that is not cutting down workmen's wages, I do not know <Col N="1686" /> what it is.  I wish to comment very seriously on the manner in which the Local Government Department is dealing with the question of competitive examinations in Cork.  I shall deal with that matter now rather than bring it up on the adjournment.  The Cork County Council decided three years ago that all positions should be filled by competitive examination.</P>

      <P>We had on the Cork County Council at that time a majority of the Farmers' Party.  A Deputy remarked the other night that we should not say anything unkind of the dead. I do not wish to say anything unkind of them, but one of their principles was competitive examination.  A vacancy occurred in the Kanturk district recently. The advertisement and the examination which was held cost the ratepayers £16.  An official of a Government Department went down and sat for that examination.  He came first in the examination.  His appointment was sanctioned by the Department; then he packed his bag, returned to his position here in Dublin, and appointed his brother, who came sixth in the examination, to collect the rates.  The question was raised in the county council and that gentleman was forced to resign. Then the majority of the council, the <Col N="1687" /> Farmers' Party, appointed temporarily the brother who only took sixth place. We have had experience there already of temporary appointments, and temporary appointments generally result in the people who get them being made permanent after six months, thus wiping out the hope of competitive examinations.  The Minister, in his reply to me to-day, said: &ldquo;The county council, with full knowledge of all the facts, decided to appoint Mr. R. Philpott temporarily.  So that no avoidable further delay should take place in completing the collection of last year's rate, the proposed appointment was sanctioned for this purpose only.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> I may ask what avoidable delay there would be in appointing the candidate who came second in the examination for the position and who was camouflaged out of it, if I might use the expression, and chucked out by an official brought down from Dublin.  Is competitive examination to mean that you can hire a professor, send him in to do your examination, and then as soon as the professor is appointed, some one else goes in and takes up the job?</P>
    <P>Progress ordered to be reported.</P>
    <P>The Dáil went out of Committee. Progress reported accordingly; Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m.</P>
