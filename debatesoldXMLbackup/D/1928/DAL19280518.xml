      <P>Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Davin have inquired what day would be fixed for a discussion of the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I presume that the form of the motion will be that the Report be considered.  I propose to set apart this day week for that discussion. I presume the discussion will be finished in one day.  I anticipate that quite a number of questions will be raised in the course of the discussion on that Report which might otherwise fall to be raised on the Estimates.  I assume that when they have been raised it is unlikely that they will form the subject of discussion again.</P>

      <P>I would ask for a little more time to consider that matter. Quite a number of things have arisen which do not come before the Dáil and which occupy a considerable amount of time on the part of the Executive Council.  They are under consideration at present.  I undertake to set aside Wednesday, or Thursday next at the latest, in this connection.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £269,556 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health including Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, Grants to Local Authorities, and Sundry Grants in Aid, and the Expenses of the Office of the Inspector of Lunatic Asylums.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was dealing with the definite case of Richard Philpott and the action of the Local Government Department in that matter.  As I <Col N="1691" /> pointed out last night, this is one of the most odious cases that has occurred in the public life of any community. This is a case where a competitive examination was held by the county council, and an individual came down and stood for that examination without any intention of filling the position. He came first in the examination, took over the position, was sanctioned by the Local Government Department, and then handed over the position to his brother who came sixth in the examination. The matter was then exposed and this individual was compelled to resign, and the next thing that happened was that his brother, who came sixth in the examination was appointed, the authorities ignoring altogether those who came second, third, fourth and fifth.  Those boys who, at any rate, came second and third are absolutely, if I may use the term, starving.  They are hungry and they have no employment, even though they were educated to that pitch that they were able to come second and third in the competitive examination.  The young men who came second, third, fourth and fifth were completely ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sanction of the appointment of the man who came sixth is going to have a very bad effect on competitive examinations in future.  Individuals will come to the conclusion that there is no use standing for competitive examinations if this sort of thing is going to be camouflaged by a party who go before the electors claiming to stand for efficiency, economy and no jobbery and who come afterwards and stage this kind of job over the heads of the Cork County Council.  That kind of thing will take us nowhere, and only this state of affairs was found out in time we would have found ourselves down there in a very serious position. Richard Philpott was a rate-collector for three or four months without the knowledge of the Cork County Council or anybody else.  During that period the council had no insurance bond in connection with that individual and no insurance company was liable.  I do not know where we will find ourselves if that sort of thing is allowed to continue. The Local Government Department <Col N="1692" /> dissolved corporations and local authorities for far less corrupt practices than in the case of that individual whom they sanctioned.  I consider the sanction of that individual should mean the appointment of a Commissioner to take over the blooming Department.  I see no other way out of it.  That state of affairs is going to bring odium on any public body.  It is a state of affairs that we, at any rate in Cork, do not stand for, and we will try to keep public life in Cork County as pure as we can.  There is no use in trying to do the sort of thing that has been done.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that the Department was responsible for a state of affairs in which a person who he alleges was not entitled to collect rates was actually collecting them for four months without the knowledge of the county council?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I make it on the fact that Denis Philpott, who came first in the examination, collected very little rates, if he collected any at all.  He might have started the collection, but that is all he did, and then he came back to his job in Dublin as an instructor under the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion made here is that a certain person took first place in an examination and that he was appointed, but that instead of setting about his duties and collecting the rates, his brother set about the collection of them, and that the Cork County Council found that out after four months.  The Deputy blames the Department for that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the Department for that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Deputy did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I blame the Department for a state of affairs in which, with the full knowledge of these facts, they actually sanctioned Richard Philpott in this appointment.  It is for that I blame the Department, and I say it is not a state of affairs that should be expected from a Department with any sense of its responsibility.  There is no use in holding competitive examinations if that state of affairs is to continue.  I made a statement here last evening which was contradicted by a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  That statement was that the Secretary of the Cork County Council received as a gross salary yearly a sum of £2,700 or £2,800 odd.  That statement was contradicted by a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, who is also a member of the Cork County Council.  I would like to get a definite statement from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health as to what the salary of the Secretary to the Cork County Council is, so that the people of Cork would be clear on the matter.  Two years ago there was an agreement reached between the Cork County Council and this Secretary, who is drawing a higher salary than the President of the Executive Council. That agreement was sent up here to the Department.  It contained, together with the agreement, an arrangement as to pension which, in my opinion, and in the opinion of other members of the county council, was not justified.  That agreement has since been dilly-dallying between the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health and the Cork County Council.  I understand that up to the present, at any rate&mdash; and we are now within one month of the election&mdash;the Secretary of the County Council has succeeded in drawing the full amount of about £2,800 from the County Council.  I would like the Minister to reply on this matter and let us know definitely what the facts are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that this Department is paying £22,869 in war bonus to its officials. <Col N="1694" /> The Cork County Council on several occasions endeavoured to abolish the bonus for their own officials, and on each occasion they have been turned down by the Department.  That war bonus means that £3,000 of the money of the ratepayers of Cork is paid in war bonus.  That money is collected from the ratepayers of Cork, though the representatives of the ratepayers of Cork and the Cork County Council have, on several occasions, voted against paying a war bonus to its officials.  I would now ask that the wishes of the Cork ratepayers and the Cork County Council, who are paying this money to their officials, should be considered.  I consider that it is unjustifiable, especially in view of the fact that the ratepayers are not able to meet their obligations and are certainly not able to meet the payment of the enormously high rates placed upon them.  Under these circumstances we say that this £3,000 should not be paid in war bonus.  We consider that this is unjust and absolutely uncalled for.  In that respect, too, I notice that every advertisement appearing at present from these public bodies and from the Department contains, in addition to the salary, a war bonus.  I thought that the war was over long ago&mdash;all the wars.</P>
    <P>There was another matter alluded to here last evening by another Deputy from East Cork, and that was that a certain amount of money which was given as a grant was turned into relief of rates by the Cork County Council. I wish here definitely to deny that statement, and if I am wrong I hope the Minister for Local Government and Public Health will correct me.  I definitely deny that this money was meant as a grant.  It was money that was given as a refund of moneys expended by the county council on roads under a grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>It was I made that statement. This £29,000 went down as a refund for money spent on the roads. I hold that that £29,000 was a bonus and should be spent on the roads.  It was not spent on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear Deputy Daly saying that, because I <Col N="1695" /> want to hear from the Minister, who was responsible for sending down this money, whether it was a refund or a bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been given to road authorities from the Road Fund last year and this year a maintenance grant.  The amount is to be applied to the payment of 50 per cent. of the actual outlay on main roads and 30 per cent. of the actual outlay on trunk roads.  A sum of £29,565 was granted to the Cork County Council. Of that money £23,565 is being applied to the relief of rates, as is proper, and £6,000 is being applied to road improvement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>It was understood by the county council and stated there that this money was given for employment on account of moneys already expended by the council on roads, a proportion of which, they understood, was to be refunded to them.  This money was given as a refund, not exactly for expenditure on roads, but to be employed in whatever manner the council liked.  If the council were wrong in applying this money for the relief of rates instead of expending it on roads, why did the Department not take notice of it and correct the council?  The fact that the Department did not take action proves that my statement is correct.  As regards workmen's wages in Cork, we were told last night that there was very little use in looking for increased wages for workers while we are taking this money from the workers.  The Deputy who spoke is a member of a Government which lays down that a workman should not get more than 29/- a week in wages.  I would point out that the men who are taking these contracts are making enormous and outrageous profits out of them, and I can prove my words.  A contractor in Cork, who had taken one of these contracts at 3/- per square yard, is paying a wage of 9d. per hour, and a contractor in Fermoy, who had taken a similar contract at 4/- per square yard, was only, up to last Tuesday, paying a wage of 8¼d.  He had a clear profit of 1/- per square yard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  The wages allowed by the Department for road work in the urban area is 35/- a week, and in the rural area 29/- a week.  Deputy Daly apparently made an agreement with the men that the wages would be 32/6 all through, and the contractor then made them work a 54 hours week for the 32/6.  I am glad to be able to inform Deputy Daly that these men are now getting 39/8.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst Deputy Daly and I do not agree on this question, there is a matter on which we do agree. I would re-echo Deputy Daly's demand for an increased number of labourers' cottages.  The farmers are anxious that they should have houses for labourers, that they should have labourers living near them whom they could employ, and that they should have houses for them.  But I do not quite agree with Deputy Daly's suggestion that the labourers should not be the owners of these houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an example of this extreme centralisation that I spoke of last night in another direction.  We had an example of it in connection with boards of health and boards of assistance, where one individual is put in charge of two or three departments which he is absolutely unable to manage efficiently.  One individual cannot manage six rural districts rolled into one and formed into a board of health, and the same six rural districts rolled into one and formed into a board of assistance.  One secretary cannot manage all these.  As regards commissioners, a commissioner is an official drawing a salary, and I hold that it is unjust to the ratepapers to have in control an official drawing a salary who is naturally interested in raising the salaries of other officials.  It is unjust to the ratepayers, who have to pay the piper, to have such an individual in charge of the rates.  I am speaking from experience of the actions of commissioners. Commissioners are supposed to be super-men, but they are not. I wish definitely to call the attention of the Minister to the anomaly of having the Secretary of the Local Government Department drawing £1,200, and the secretary of a county council drawing about £2,800.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephByrne" hpid="Mr. J.J. BYRNE Mr. J.J. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister for Local Government is to be congratulated on this Estimate. When one looks down the figures and sees the decreases tabulated, I think it ought to be a matter for sincere congratulation to the Minister.  There is a decrease in salaries of £5,488, in travelling allowances of £1,350, in salaries for auditors £224, and in travelling expenses for auditors £400, and we have a net decrease in the total vote of £82,247, while the efficiency of the Department is being fully maintained.  When one examines an Estimate of this kind to-day, it would be well to realise that we are in a totally different position now from what we were in 1919, as examined by Deputy Holt.  I venture <Col N="1698" /> to suggest that such criticisms as Deputy Holt made on the Estimate, drawing a comparison between the 1919 and the 1928 figures, are perfectly valueless.</P>

      <P>It is, but it is a <Col N="1699" /> matter of degree.  We have heard a comparison drawn that left entirely out of consideration a sum of £250,000, a sum of £15,000, and a sum of £2,000, so that I venture to suggest that the contention that I have made is still perfectly correct, and that no analogy exists for the comparison drawn by Deputy Holt between the year 1919 and the circumstances existing to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice with regret the housing grants are exhausted.  I ventured some time ago to appeal to the Minister for Local Government for the building of dwellings for workmen whose means to pay rentals were small.  I come from the North City of Dublin and know it is a crying want to which no attention has been paid, even since the present scheme of housing has been undertaken by the Minister.  In that area large numbers of houses have been built, but the rentals of those houses run roughly from anything ranging from 16/- to a £1 a week.  How is a man earning 50/- a week or thereabouts to pay from 16/- to 20/- a week?  I ventured some months ago to ask the Minister to earmark at least some portion of the money available for housing grants for the building of self-contained dwellings of some kind or another for the ordinary workman.  I drew the attention of the Minister to the fact that in most of the large cities across the water in Glasgow, London and Leeds they had self-contained flats built at rentals averaging from 7/6 to 10/6 per week. I realise the difficulties of the Minister. I realise that building at present is practically uneconomic, but I venture to suggest to the Minister that certain schemes of building which on the face may appear to be non-economic may, upon closer examination, be found to be a very good investment for this Department.  Nobody in this House will deny the amount of sickness that arises from the present conditions of the housing of the workers in the north and south city slums in Dublin.  I suggest, with all respect, that something should be done for these unfortunate people in the city of Dublin as has been done in other cities.  Those people are certainly deserving of the <Col N="1700" /> help of a Department like that of Local Government.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer very briefly, that is the loss of rates from vacant business premises in the city of Dublin.  I believe that the loss arising from those would give relief generally to the ratepayers of something like 2d. in the £. To my own knowledge, some of those houses have been idle for periods ranging from three to four years.  I think it is unnecessary to labour the fact that those particular business premises are really required and can be filled provided they are let to traders in the city at a reasonable economic rent.  I would ask the Minister to endeavour to frame something, by way of future legislation or policy, that would enable these business premises to be let at a reasonable rent and not to allow them to be standing there as empty mausoleums, of no benefit to the community, and of very little benefit to the owner.</P>
    <P>I also must congratulate the Minister upon the way the question of roads has been treated, and I see with pleasure that though this Estimate, as I have already stated, shows a net decrease of £82,000, that £1,958,970 is estimated to be spent on the roads.  There is only one other matter to which I would appeal to the Minister, and upon which I have already appealed, and that is the question of transport over certain roads.  I appealed in a particular instance to the Minister before with regard to a certain avenue in Fairview, and have asked the Minister to prohibit the running of bus traffic along that particular avenue for the reason that that traffic was doing the greatest possible amount of injury to the houses there, and that the road upon which the traffic was passing was entirely unsuitable to the traffic.  In the greater number of instances the inhabitants living in that particular avenue owned their own houses, and the loss and damage to property fell upon the actual owners themselves, humble individuals who had, by sheer economy, succeeded in obtaining the ownership of their own houses.  We have appealed to the Commissioners, and that appeal has been turned down.  We have again appealed to the Minister for <Col N="1701" /> Local Government, and I regret to say that appeal still remains turned down. At one time when we first approached the Commissioners on this subject we were told that the damage was due to the heavy traffic, on account of building operations in that particular area. A notice was posted up by the Commissioners at the end of the road prohibiting that heavy traffic.  A promise was given that this traffic would be entirely discontinued when building operations ceased.  At one time, as the Minister is aware, this avenue was practically a cul-de-sac, upon which there was only one-way traffic.  A road has been built for a number of years, and is entirely unsuitable for this bus traffic.  The mode in which the Commissioners have carried out their promise to the inhabitants of Windsor Avenue is to remove the sign which prohibited heavy traffic passing along that avenue.  Now to add to their troubles or to increase them very considerably they are making it a new bus route.  The Minister has been good enough to inform me that if application is made to him by responsible authorities, this bus route will be discontinued, but if, as may reasonably happen, the Commissioners are wrong in their findings, how is this evil to be redressed as far as the inhabitants in this particular avenue are concerned?</P>
    <P>I think the whole question of existing law upon this problem of road transport is in a most chaotic and unsatisfactory condition.  The Commissioners have performed a test in this case that I, as an ordinary layman, consider entirely valueless.  People skilled in those matters and skilled in such tests have also corroborated me in my opinion by stating they were entirely valueless.  I have examined these houses personally.  I can speak for the amount of damage done, and can speak for the continuation of the damage at present.  When the question of vibration came to be examined I, with an expert, went down to that avenue and the vibration one could feel by the mere passing of a loaded coal dray was of a significant kind and character.  I am in a position to submit for the consideration of the Minister, if he wishes, the damage done <Col N="1702" /> to this particular property, and the damage that continues to be done by the passage of this new bus traffic along that particular road.  I do not wish to say one word against the administration of the Commissioners, but it has been said here by some of the Deputies that the Commissioners are supermen.  I submit they are ordinary individuals like ourselves, liable to errors of judgment, and I submit a serious error of judgment has been made in this particular instance.  I believe that some temporary alleviation of the traffic has been made at present, but what I would ask the Minister to say in his reply is, that that traffic will be discontinued, and that, under the Roads Act of 1920, he will give us the benefit which exists there of the power vested in him, by which he can prohibit and restrict such traffic along an unsuitable road.</P>

      <P>As the Minister and Deputies are aware the periodical elections for membership of local government bodies will take place next month.  I refer to it now, because I think it is very likely that the result of these elections will bring to the forefront problems in connection with local government which have not heretofore received the attention that they should have received.  I think it will be generally admitted that the foundation of local government in this country rests upon the ability and honesty of purpose of the members of local boards. If we cannot secure the right type of public representatives to look after the local affairs of the country, then all the <Col N="1703" /> headquarters machinery which has been established for that purpose will be rendered useless.  If, therefore, we find that there is in the situation anything which makes it practically impossible to have the right type of member elected on these bodies we must reconsider the situation as a whole.  This subject has perhaps not been adequately considered before, because it did not arise in an acute form.  It will only arise in an acute form when the elections to these bodies are taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the abolition of the rural district councils there is now thrown on the county councils an amount of work far in excess of what previous councils had to perform. Membership of a county council involves absence from a member's business or occupation to an extent not heretofore experienced.  Attendance at the council meetings and at committee meetings, as well as the time occupied in doing the work of the council, frequently takes a man from his home and his business for seven, eight or nine days in the month.  The members of these councils are not of course granted any allowance for that time, and, as was pointed out here, the allowance for travelling expenses is in many cases inadequate.  I do not propose to deal now with the question whether or not a change in that system should be initiated, but we have to face the fact that the effect of the new conditions is that the very type of individual who, in the best interests of the country, should be members of these boards are most reluctant to go forward as candidates for election.  An individual who has devoted his time and his attention to his business, and who has made a success of it, is the type on whom we would like to see the administration of affairs thrown.  But that type is the very type that will not now consent to go forward.  The policy of the Government in taking from the councils a large part of the discretion which was hitherto allowed them in matters concerning local appointments has also resulted in a similar situation.  Many of these councils and boards are now in effect nothing more than bodies for <Col N="1704" /> registering decisions arrived at behind closed doors in the Department of Local Government in Dublin.  We find general resentment throughout the whole country at that practice, general resentment at the dictation from Dublin which is taking place, with the result that individuals of upright character and of independence of thought will not submit themselves to what they consider to be the indignity involved in membership of these bodies, when, in any matter in which a suspicion might be cast on their honesty of purpose, that suspicion is cast, and the Ministry and the Local Government Department proceed to act as if they could not be trusted.  That policy on the part of the Government has resulted, as I said, in men of upright character refusing to sit upon these boards.</P>

      <P>The restrictions I have in mind were mentioned frequently in the course of the debate. They are the restrictions imposed in the matter of making appointments to local services, and there are also restrictions in the matter of ordering supplies.  It is implied by inference under the Central Purchasing Act that local authorities have power to purchase supplies locally, if they can secure them as good and as cheaply as they can get them under the central purchasing scheme.  But that is only by inference. One suggestion I would make to the Minister is to consider the advisibility of putting into that Act, so as to leave no room for doubt, power to local boards to make purchases locally, if they can be secured as cheaply and as good as the central purchasing board can supply them.  The average individual who is not a member of a public board, but who takes an intelligent interest in this question, knows that these boards will not be satisfied while there is that interference on the part of the Department and of the Ministry.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy hold that men of honesty and men of ability are prevented from taking <Col N="1705" /> part in the work of local boards, simply because laws have been introduced regulating the manner of making appointments to the staffs of local bodies, or which prevent people buying supplies locally if they can be got more economically in another way?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that men of business ability or honesty of character are prevented from becoming members of public boards, but I say that the inducement given to such individuals to become members has been decidedly lessened, particularly by regulations concerning the making of appointments.  The policy of the Ministry in this matter is a definite indication that they do not consider that representatives elected locally can be trusted to withstand the temptation to corruption, and things of that kind in the making of appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>We have undoubtedly set up special machinery, and it was this House that did that in its discretion, but the members of local bodies were given no discretion in the matter. The Ministry decided that.  If the consent of local bodies was asked for that system, and if they agreed to that system, no one would have any complaint, but that consent was not asked nor secured, and I think it will be admitted that the majority are opposed to the scheme.  That matter will be debated more adequately in the near future in the Amending Bill which this Party is introducing.  The only matter that I want to refer to now is the fact that the general policy of the Ministry, in connection with local government, has resulted, as I said, in a decided lessening of the inducements offered to the right type of candidate to accept election to these bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of all that, we have at present a dishonest and misleading campaign being conducted by the daily Press and by some Deputies in this House in support of what they call <Col N="1706" />&ldquo;no politics on local bodies.&rdquo; The Minister by his silence has encouraged that campaign.  He could stop it, of course, immediately if he wished, by merely publishing a definition of &ldquo;politics.&rdquo; It is not contended, I think, that any of the big national issues on which the main Parties of the country are divided should be debated at local boards to the exclusion of all other matters, but behind this campaign of &ldquo;no politics on local boards&rdquo; we find not a desire to exclude politics but a desire to exclude nationalism, and in particular to exclude Republicanism, if it is not in actual fact a desire to exclude men of principle.  Personally, I am convinced that the big political parties, Cumann na nGaedheal no less than Fianna Fáil and Labour, are in a position to induce men of the right character to stand, even against their own wishes and interests, as candidates because of their attachment to general national principles. If the outlook concerning these matters was changed and if it was realised that principles have as much a part in the local government of the country as they have in the national Government, we believe that better local government bodies would be secured in consequence.  If that other campaign gains fruit and if the Ministry sanctions it, then every avenue to the local government bodies will be closed except the avenue which is the hope of self seekers, gombeen men and those who hope to make the local bodies a stepping stone to achieve their own purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter which concerns this issue.  The Minister for Finance on behalf of the Minister for Local Government replying to a question put to him on Wednesday last stated that the Courts had decided that the holders of premiums for bulls from county committees of agriculture are not eligible to be members of county councils.  Whether that in theory or in fact be the case is a debatable matter but it has resulted in fact in the exclusion of the very type <Col N="1707" /> of member whom it should be in the general national interest to secure as members of these bodies.  I would like the Minister to consider whether it was the intention of the original Act that that type of person should be excluded and if the decision of the Courts in that case, was anticipated when the Act was being put through.</P>
      <P>Before concluding there is another matter to which I wish to refer.  I want the Minister to state definitely if between the last day on which the matter was discussed and now, any steps have been taken to prepare the Bill which is to give legislative effect to the report of the Greater Dublin Commission.  The term during which the Commissioners may hold office expires next March, and if a Bill to establish a new system of local government for Dublin is to be introduced and passed here in time to allow elections to take place before March next, there is room for very little delay.  I would like the Minister to inform us when the Bill will be introduced.  From the statement which we have had as to the activities of the Commissioners, particularly from Deputy Holt, we can find some justification for the apprehension that is growing in the minds of the citizens of Dublin concerning the manner in which their affairs are being conducted by the Commissioners here. I was astonished to hear Deputy J.J. Byrne go so far in desertion of his Cumann na nGaedheal principles as to admit that the Commissioners are not supermen, but ordinary individuals who can make mistakes.  There are, however, more important matters than the small matters to which he drew attention.  I would like to ask the Minister if it is not a fact that the Commissioners have failed to print and publish the abstract of the annual accounts for Dublin Union, and if they are not bound by statute to print and publish these accounts.  If that is so, what is the reason for the secrecy in this matter?  I would like him to state why the annual accounts of the Dublin Union are being withheld from publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally known that members on this side of the House hold strong <Col N="1708" /> views concerning the suppression of the democratic rights of the people by the appointment of Commissioners. We are anxious that that suppression should be terminated as quickly as possible, and that in Dublin, the capital of the country, the control of local affairs should be given once again without delay to the citizens of the capital.  I hope the Minister will be able to assure us that the Bill based on the report published in 1926 is, at least, being prepared, and that it will be introduced into this House in the near future.  I would also be glad if the Minister would inform us whether the Government have in contemplation any revision of the whole system of local government in this country.  I think it is likely that the continuance of the present policy will involve such re-organisation of the local government system.  Whether or not that re-organisation would be necessary if another policy were in operation I cannot say, but we cannot possibly face the likelihood that the local government system may break down, or may get into the hands of useless and worthless men in consequence of the Government's policy.  If the Government are alive to what the consequences of that policy must be, they must realise the need for reconsidering their attitude towards the existing system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTReynolds" hpid="Mr. REYNOLDS Mr. REYNOLDS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. REYNOLDS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bring a few points to the notice of the Minister before he concludes the debate.  One of these is in reference to sanitation in areas in congested districts. There is practically no sanitation in small towns, and there are hardly any sewerage systems either.  In some cases outbreaks of disease have occurred owing to lack of sanitation. It is a very difficult problem for the people of the congested districts.  The amount of money necessary to finance a sewerage scheme in small towns would have to be raised in the local area, and everybody knows at the present time that it is very difficult to raise any large sums of money in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if the Local Government Department was prepared to give a further grant of, say, fifty per cent. in such cases that it would be very use- <Col N="1709" /> ful.  I would not say that they should be expected to do it in all cases, but I think that in the congested districts areas the people are entitled to some consideration.  We have been told that the local authorities should undertake the work of carrying out sewerage schemes.  In many cases, the cost would be too much for them, especially in the congested districts areas.  As regards housing, some Deputies seem to think that the present housing schemes were altogether a failure.  I do not agree with that.  In the part of the country that I come from a number of houses have been built under the housing schemes, and they seem to me to be very satisfactory.  That is one of the best schemes the Local Government Department is responsible for.  An ambitious and industrious farmer who feels that he would be able to build a house for himself is offered approximately a hundred pounds as free money to enable him to do so.  I think that was a great chance for the people, and many availed of it.  They might not have all the money at the time they needed it, but they raised the balance by some means or other.  It was a great chance for them to be able to build a good house for themselves.  But on the other hand, there are many people living in these congested districts who are not in a position to build houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>There are many people living in, say, two-roomed, thatched dwellings, and if grants could be made available for them, as they used to be made under the old Congested Districts Board, they would be enabled to add an additional room or two to their houses.  It would be very satisfactory indeed if that could be done.  There are many ambitious, thrifty people who would like to improve their dwellings, and they would do so if they could get some help in the way of a grant.  If these grants were given they could not only improve their dwellings but also their out-offices.  That would help to improve housing conditions greatly.  I think the Minister should give this special consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the labourers' cottages, as far as I know they were built on loans that were obtained by the local authorities.  Many of the occupiers <Col N="1710" /> at the present time believe that they have already repaid the amount of the loans obtained for the building of their cottages, and they are anxious that a scheme should be put into effect enabling them to buy out their cottages. I think if that could be done it would be wise.  The scheme which provided a cottage and an acre of land for a labourer at a rent of 1/- a week was a great thing for the labourers of the country.  I think that for schemes of that kind it would be a great thing if grants were made available, so that the labourers of the country would be able to get decent houses to live in. Labourers would not be able to pay the rents of the new houses which cost so much to build to-day.  I hope the Minister will be able to do something with regard to having more money made available for the building of labourers' cottages.</P>
    <P>In regard to the roads, and as to the Co. Leitrim getting a fair share of the grants, unfortunately the geographical position of the county excludes a large part of it from expenditure on the roads.  The reason for that is that the trunk roads running through the county border either on Roscommon or Sligo, and it is the neighbouring counties that get most of the benefit from the expenditure on trunk roads in Co. Leitrim and not the county itself.  Outside of the trunk roads, I would say that the other roads in County Leitrim are entitled to more grants if possible, and that the county is not treated fairly as regards the amount of money spent on roads generally.</P>
    <P>With regard to appointments, I have had a good deal to do with public administration and would prefer that selection committees should deal with this matter of appointments, because it is a great source of annoyance to men in public life to have people running after them looking for their influence and their votes.  I just wish to refer to the appointment of a rate collector in the County Leitrim, and hope the Minister will be able to do something in connection with it.  The man who held the position was dismissed.  His sister came along and paid up a sum of money that was in question.  On her doing so the county council gave her a <Col N="1711" /> promise, I do not know whether they were justified in doing so or not, that as soon as the money was paid up they would appoint her as rate collector. The Minister for Local Government refused to give his sanction.  The county council petitioned the Minister to reconsider his decision in the case.  The position is that this lady borrowed from the bank the amount that was required to pay the county council.  She certainly did her part, and I hope that the Minister will see his way to sanction her appointment so that she may be put in a position to be able to repay what she borrowed from the bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise for the purpose of getting information on a few matters.  There is a good deal of dissatisfaction in some places as to the way the road grant is divided.  With regard to Clare, we would like to know the basis on which the grant is distributed. Looking over the list, one finds that some small counties get a much larger share of the road grant than counties with a much bigger area. For instance, the County Louth gets a much larger share of the grant than the County Clare, and no one would think of suggesting that there is a larger road-surfacing area in Louth than there is in Clare.  There is a great deal of dissatisfaction over this.  I would like if the Minister would give some indication as to the basis on which the grant is distributed.  There is another matter I want to refer to.  I have taken some trouble to look into it as carefully as I could, as well as to inspect the different materials supplied through the central purchasing arrangement. In one institution in the County Clare, of which I am a member of the committee, we find that English or foreign material is supplied to us.  As regards spades, shovels, forks and agricultural implements supplied to the Clare Mental Hospital, the committee, when they made an investigation, found that not alone were these articles of foreign manufacture, but that they were not suitable for the work for which they were intended.  These agricultural implements were of no use whatever for the work they were intended to do in these institutions, and more money had <Col N="1712" /> to be expended in order to make them suitable.  That is a matter to which I think the Minister should give some consideration.  I do not charge the Minister with being anxious to dump English or foreign manufactures into the country.  I do not believe that, but the fact remains that local institutions have to incur extra expense in order to make these articles useful for the particular purpose for which they were intended.  They come from Stourbridge, and from my geographical knowledge I do not think that is a place in Ireland. I also find in the purchasing scheme list Cassidy's whiskey.  I cannot find any distiller of the name of Cassidy. Deputy Davin reminds me it is at Monasterevan.  I am not an authority on whiskey, but I was informed that distillery has been out of commission for the last twenty years.</P>

I have on other occasions referred to the fact, and I wish to emphasise it now, that the local ratepayers are expected to maintain practically a national service, that is to say, we have buses, motor cars and lorries from Dublin, Waterford and Cork running through County Clare, and we are expected to maintain the roads for this national service, so that it is being made a local charge.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring a few matters to the attention of the Local Government Department, and I hope they will receive consideration.  The first has reference to the sanitary conditions of the schools, especially in the rural areas.  There should be strict <Col N="1713" /> supervision over them.  There is not a year that passes in which the majority of these schools have not to close for some time owing to outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, and other causes.  I believe it is advisable that we should aim at having a healthy community.  A sanitary inspector should frequently go round and examine the schools from a sanitary point of view.  The majority of the children going to those schools come from the labouring class.  I can say from my experience that during the winter months those children endure great hardships owing to weather conditions, and they have to go to school practically unclothed.  I suggest to the Local Government Department that those children should be provided with a decent suit of clothes, and a substantial meal daily during the winter months, if not during the whole year round.  A great deal has been said about the improvement of the roads.  I agree that the trunk roads are much improved and are a credit.  The work has been well done in regard to them and the money well spent, but what about the roads in other districts?  The farmers are the principal contributors to the upkeep of these roads, but so far as these people are concerned they are very much neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently there was a scheme in Fermoy for improving the town, and the Government gave a grant towards it.  Unfortunately the principal street was left out of that scheme, which is a great drawback to the scheme.  I ask the Minister for Local Government to consider the advisability of giving a further grant so that the principal street in Fermoy would be improved equally with the other streets.  My friend, Deputy Daly, suggested yesterday that any time he came to Dublin and had a sound proposal to put before the Department he was never turned down.  He said there was a way of getting at them.  I suggest to the Minister for Local Government that he should advise Deputy Daly to keep that secret to himself, as, otherwise, if Deputies get into the know his office would probably be besieged and a perfect nuisance would be created for the staff and himself.  It reminds me of the three-card trick.  The three-card <Col N="1714" /> man comes along with his three cards and he invites you to find the winner, or King Richard.  If we adopt that principle in this House it may be the means of turning us into a gambling institution.  We will turn up King Richard often, and the Minister will pay on the winning card, and perhaps the Local Government Department will become bankrupt.</P>
    <P>As regards the cottage scheme, I think these cottages were built close on 40 years ago, and half an acre was attached to them, and they were let at a small rental.  I think it is time for the owners of these cottages to get them free of rents and rates. They have paid sufficiently for these cottages.  We must remember that in the days of the land war these men stood loyally by the farmers through thick and thin.  The least we can do now for them is to give them a grant of these cottages, with the land attached.  There is a demand for a new scheme of cottages.  I hope the Minister will consider the advisability of putting such a scheme into operation. At present it is rather difficult to get labourers of a suitable class to work on the farms.  It was stated by a Deputy yesterday that a large number of these people from the country go into the cities of Cork and Dublin, and elsewhere, looking for employment which they do not find.  There is no necessity for them to do that.  If these young men and women want employment they would get plenty of work even at the reduced wage which the farmer can pay having regard to his present means.  If they come to the cities looking for employment that is their own fault.  With reference to water schemes: there is a scheme for my locality which seems to be held up for some reason that I do not know. About 80 people have to use the water from a polluted stream.  I think it would be money well spent if that scheme was put into operation.  I wish to impress on the Minister these few points, and I hope he will take them into consideration.</P>

      <P>This is a subject with which I am pretty well conversant, having been a member of public boards for a considerable time.  Although that <Col N="1715" /> is so, it is not my intention to go into detail in the very important matters that come under this Vote, but there are a few items with which I would like to deal.  We have heard a good deal about economy, and that is a very difficult subject.  I intend to show that the expenditure of public money will in many cases result in great economy and in a saving to the ratepayers.  In Westmeath a lady bequeathed a sum of £2,000 to be utilised for certain purposes. We decided that the best way we could spend the money would be to provide a first class <i>x</i>-ray apparatus. We spent £1,500 on its erection, and we know that by its work during twelve months we have benefited to the extent of at least half the money. Formerly we sent a large number of cases to be treated in Dublin hospitals; such cases are now practically all kept at home&mdash;85 per cent. of them anyway are now treated in the county hospital at Mullingar.  Every hospital in the Saorstát should have a first class <i>x</i>-ray apparatus.  It will be of great benefit to people who cannot afford to come to Dublin and will pay for itself in a very short time.</P>
      <P>I hope that the scheme which is being considered in connection with the sale of labourers' cottages will materialise. The present position with regard to these cottages is most unsatisfactory. In Westmeath the ratepayers are losing something like £3,000 per year on them. A large number of occupants of these cottages are anxious to purchase and I hope the scheme will be speeded up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sewerage and sanitation are also very important matters.  I believe that the expenditure of money on sewerage and sanitation will save the ratepayers a good deal in the end, because the condition of many towns and rural areas as regards sanitation and sewerage in my opinion is the cause of a great deal of illness, and, I am sorry to have to add, one particular disease, which I am afraid is on the increase in Westmeath&mdash;tuberculosis. Of course, poverty, bad housing and matters of that kind are also contributory causes.  In Westmeath recently the county hospital was connected up with the sewerage scheme.  We borrowed money at 5¼ per cent. from the bank.  The Board of <Col N="1716" /> Works quotation was 5¾, so that we did better by dealing with the bank, and the cost to the ratepayers of that beneficial work will be very small.</P>

      <P>As one who has had a good deal to do with the Local Government Department, as Chairman of the Board of Health and a member of other boards, it is only right that I should pay a tribute to that Department for the manner in which they facilitate such boards in connection with matters brought before them in the right way. Many difficult and controversial matters have had to be settled between that Department and the board of health or county council, and when I accompany deputations to the Department's officials we are in almost every case able to settle our problems.  We are received with sympathy and courtesy, and I certainly would like to pay a tribute to the Minister, and especially to the Secretary, Mr. McCarron, for going out of his way on every occasion to settle the difficult problems or differences which arose between the boards and his Department.  Public boards that meet with such difficulties would do much better by laying the case before the Minister and his officials rather than by passing resolutions, which are really political and are really of no help in connection with the matters under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the work of boards of health is properly understood. These boards are at present carrying out 90 per cent.  of the administrative work in every county, and a progressive board can undertake innumerable works which would be of great benefit to the health of the people.  These boards have very great power and responsibilities.  They have to administer the Medical Charities Act, the Tuberculosis Act, home assistance, and to deal with doctors, nurses, dispensaries, the supplying of medicines, and innumerable other matters of importance that are of benefit to the community.  I am only mentioning matters concerning public health.  It is very important that those who are members of these boards should adopt <Col N="1717" /> the methods we have adopted in Westmeath. By excluding politics and adopting business methods we have succeeded in reducing the demand on the ratepayers during the last three years by 25 per cent.  notwithstanding the fact that there was an increase of about 33 per cent.  in the amount paid in home assistance, which now amounts almost to £11,000 per year.  I hope that the important work done by boards of health will be recognised.  People should not be blaming the Local Government Department for many matters complained of.  If there are complaints about water supplies or other matters, they should blame the boards of health and not the Department, because the Department does not tie down these boards in regard to health matters. Deputy Brennan mentioned something about a scarcity of water in Roscommon.  Such matters are dealt with by boards of health, and a progressive board, which excludes politics and acts in the best interests of the people, ought to be able to carry out works of very great benefit.  I hope my remarks will be carefully considered by people who are in the habit of blaming the Local Government Department, when they ought to blame their own representatives.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to a remark of Deputy Lemass, suggesting that there was some cause for secrecy in connection with the alleged non-publication of the Abstract of Accounts of the Dublin Union.  The last audited Abstract was formally published and offered to the Press for publication if necessary.  It was not printed, for the reason that it would cost about £100, and that hitherto the applications for copies of the printed Abstract numbered two or three.  But it was formally and duly published, and is available for reference to any one who wants to refer to it.  I feel that Deputy Lemass's statement was made thoughtlessly, but it is rather irresponsible to suggest that there is cause for secrecy in connection with the accounts of any public body without, at any rate, making some inquiry as to what the position is.</P>

      <P>This House is supposed to insist upon the fulfilment of all statutory law, and the Minister is supposed to be the guardian of the law in regard to Local Government.  He stands up here and lectures people for asking that the law of which he is the guardian, on behalf of this House, shall be insisted upon.  The Minister might adduce good reasons as to why £100 or £50 should not be spent.  But if there is a law on a statute book authorising and insisting that these accounts should be printed, and submitted to the public, in a certain way. and if he wants that law amended there is a way to do it, and that is to bring the matter before the House and have the law amended.  As long as the law is in existence he should see it is carried out.  The Minister should be the last person to lecture the House and tell us that a law that he thinks <Col N="1720" /> is not necessary, or that ought to be amended, need not be carried out, because he thinks it unnecessary that a certain sum of money should be spent. If the ratepayers are to be saved the expenditure of this money, there is a way of saving it.

      <P>The debate which has just concluded convicted the Government of breaking a law, and the question which we propose to discuss now is one which may lead to a decision which may be a breach of the Constitution. If it decided to-day that this petition is not to be accepted, and that no machinery is to be set up to carry out the terms of Article 48 of the Constitution, it will be a direct and gross breach of the Constitution.  On a famous occasion the President, when he was displeased with the Labour Party's conduct, made the following remark: &ldquo;You cannot challenge one part of the Constitution and prostitute another.&rdquo; The Constitution, when the President finds it useful to his Party's purposes, is a sacred instrument, but when he finds it is not suitable I do not know whether he is challenging the Constitution or prostituting it&mdash;he can take his choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But he certainly is not setting up in this country the respect for the Constitution which he has always preached. He may be setting up a valuable precedent for other people later on to treat the Constitution in identically the same way as he is treating it now.  The plea is a plea that it is not possible to carry out Article 48 of the Constitution. That itself is an admission of intellectual bankruptcy and of an utter lack of common sense on the part of the people who drafted the Constitution, a thing which he is really not going to get anybody to believe.  If the Government wished with their majority, such as it is to carry out Article 48, they <Col N="1722" /> could very easily find a means of doing so.  They talk constantly&mdash;and this is particularly true of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture&mdash;of the will of the people and the law of the people. The Minister for Agriculture says that that is a thing that must be regarded as the linch-pin of the Constitution. Here we have something which is very directly the law of the people.  Nothing could be more direct and come closer to establishing the principle of the law of the people than the principle of the initiative and referendum. Yet, when that question arises and when it comes to a question of making a reality out of their professions of faith in the law of the people they turn from it to find several excuses for not putting that particular principle into force.  In an interruption the Minister for Lands and Agriculture referred to the last three elections as establishing the authority of the majority of the people.  The less they look into that matter the better, because they will find that at one of the elections they got a majority by Mr. Jinks.  Perhaps they regard that as the will of the people.  Perhaps they regard that as a more democratic form of government than enforcing Article 48 of the Constitution.  At present they hold their majority by having converted Deputy Heffernan and the Farmers' Party to their side against the direct mandate the Farmers' Party got when it went to the country, because it was put up by Deputy Gorey to the Farmers' Party that they should amalgamate and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a debate on the presentation of a petition prepared in accordance with the provisions of Article 48 of the Constitution, the Deputy can discuss the petition. In answer to a question by Deputy de Valera, I said that it was inevitable that the merits of the Initiative as a Constitutional expedient should be discussed.  I think that is so.  It might be ruled technically that we are not even discussing the Initiative now.  We are only discussing whether leave ought to be granted to present this petition.  I think it is only reasonable that the merits of the Initiative as a Constitutional expedient should be discussed.  To discuss the matters that the Deputy wants to go into now seems utterly irrelevant. The Deputy must realise that the guiding principle always is: &ldquo;Where will the debate end?&rdquo; If the Deputy raises questions that are likely to go out and out and out, not only will we not be finished before 2 o'clock to-day, but we would not finish in what remains of Private Members' time in this session.</P>

We have no other way of expressing ourselves.  We have no way except speaking across the floor of the House to answer the objections raised.  It was with that in mind that I made the remark I made.  On the plea of impossibility, this childish ground is put forward, that because the petition is presented to this House it cannot be presented at the same time to the Seanad.  I think we have settled the question of the King in this matter, because the King's functions are limited by the Constitution itself, and I do not think that on this petition a question about the King should be pursued, because unless another Article of the Constitution is going to be flouted at the same time, I take it the contention that the King should be presented with the petition will not be pursued.  Another Article says the function of the King is limited either to <Col N="1724" /> accepting the Bills when they come and signing them or refusing to sign them.</P>

      <P>If it is held that the intention of that petition, as drafted, was that it really contains two petitions at the same time, there is nothing to prevent this House from taking one portion of the petition and dealing with it.  If the House and the Government were sincere in their attitude; if it wished to implement its own Constitution, and wished to carry out Article 48 of the Constitution and, at the same time, if it objected to references in that petition to Article 17 of the Constitution, it could easily have put in an amendment to this motion that only the portion of the petition dealing with the actual setting up of the Initiative should be dealt with by the House, and the rest could be left aside.  To contend now that because there are two parts to the petition that therefore it is vitiated is absurd. There is nothing in the Constitution or the laws of this State that could vitiate the petition.  The fact that there are redundancies in any petition does not vitiate the petition and, so far as the petition has a bearing upon Article 48, it is effective and valid, and if the people of this House were in earnest about maintaining their Constitution they could easily find a way out by an amendment.  They could carry through and implement Article 48 of the Constitution, reserving the other part of the petition to be dealt with at a later time.  As a matter of fact, one of the advantages of having that double petition was that it saved expense, for the two parts of Article 48 would be <Col N="1725" /> carried through at the same time.  The second part of the article sets out that 50,000 votes are required on a specific issue.  By getting our people to sign the double petition we were saving the necessity of two petitions, but at the same time we were hampering ourselves. We were tying our own hands, because we were going to people to sign something which they might not sign.  There would be a class who would want the Referendum, and another class who would want the Initiative, and then there would be a class who would not want Article 17.</P>

      <P>&mdash;we do not support the attempt to remove Article 17, but we do support that part which would establish a Referendum.  There was a suggestion that this matter was settled at the last election.  That very suggestion is a denial of the functions of Article 48 because if everything is settled at a General Election, then the <Col N="1726" /> use of a Referendum simply does not exist.  It is in order to come closer to individual issues that the Referendum and the Initiative are set up.  At a General Election several issues come before the people and people choose their sides in the election for several reasons&mdash;for personal reasons because certain personalities are put up, and for several considerations at the same time. It is quite possible that people might vote on the side of the Farmers' Party and on the side of the Independent Party at the same time.  There might be a substantial majority, I would go so far as to say, who might vote for the Independents and for our side and who would agree that the setting up of the Initiative would be a good thing, but they would not have agreement about Article 17.  Therefore, it would be perfectly easy for people of this House, if they were earnest about it, by agreement to arrange that we could deal with the Initiative and not deal with the question of Article 17.  But we do not believe that there is any sincerity in this matter on the part of the Government; that they simply feel that there are two Articles of the Constitution and that at last they have been brought up cheek by jowl with each other; they have been brought into a position which shows that they are incompatible.</P>
      <P>You cannot have the will of the people and Article 17 of the Constitution there at the same time.  If one has to go it is the law of the people that has to go and Article 17 of the Constitution is to remain and nothing will shake the Government in any attempt to remove Article 17.  If any democratic institution is set up, any democratic institution of any sort which might in any way threaten Article 17 of the Constitution, the Government will come down on it and, with its promiscuous majority, gathered from other Parties who got different mandates before they came here, they will do their best to nip in the bud any attempt to remove Article 17.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the cost being something like £80,000.  On further inquiry I find that the figure was given in answer to a question raised by Deputy Rice and the amount mentioned was £85,000.  I again ask that we <Col N="1727" /> should get in detail the basis upon which that estimate was made.  A proper basis, I imagine, would be that the amount should be calculated somehow on the cost of the election to the Seanad.  People may plead that there are certain arrangements made in the Electoral Act and that they are expensive if carried out that way, but there is nothing to prevent the Government from amending the Electoral Act and putting the cost of the Initiative within reason&mdash;making it a reasonable sum instead of an extravagant sum of £85,000.</P>

This is, after all, an effort on our side to try, as far as possible, to stir the spirit of nationalism again in all parts of the House so that we may get back to the real basis of nationality and attain that unity which will make it possible for us to get the country out of the state it is in at the present time.  We can only do that on national principles.  Here is an opportunity of doing something to mould the Constitution closer to the will of the Irish people, and at a later stage we may hope to get rid of one of the most objectionable elements in the Constitution. It is rather from that point that we appeal to the people who will be open to these arguments than to anybody else.</P>

      <P>What we have before us is, I understand, this proposal that a certain petition, if it be in accordance with Article 48, should be presented to the Oireachtas.  In this matter I submit to you that, because a certain Deputy presents a motion and alleges that it should be accepted as it conforms with Article 48, I do not think, as he is given an opportunity here of demonstrating whether or not it does conform with Article 48, that the mere acceptance of it proves his case for him.  The Constitution stands, and I am an ardent constitutionalist.  At the same time, there are certain parts of it I disapprove of and think should be altered, and that has been adverted to very much.  In that I had the support of Mr. Johnson when he was leader of the Labour Party.  Provisions were made to facilitate changes in the Constitution from time to time when it <Col N="1734" /> was discovered to be unworkable or unsatisfactory.  At the same time, the fact that one proposes to change an Article of the Constitution constitutionally does not make one anti-constitutional.</P>

      <P>The time is extended during which the Constitution may be changed with greater facility than otherwise it might be.  The provisions of the Constitution arrange for representative Government and for the election of Deputies at a general election. At the general election various parties go up and they put down, each of them different, some point of policy. The public have to make up their mind which they think is the more important. On the one hand a party may stand for Protection and also vaccination; an elector may have to say to himself &ldquo;Do I think protection is more important or is my objection to vaccination stronger than my support of protection?&rdquo; The general election demands from the electorate a weighing up of values.  A part of the Constitution I am not enthusiastic about tries to make it easier by allowing individual and definite points of policy and practice to be put separately to the electorate.  That is not a thing I am at all in love with. But one of the means of doing that is by the Initiative.  What I understand was intended to be the object of such <Col N="1735" /> things as the Referendum and the Initiative was this, that a Party elected to power might bring in a thing which was not adverted to by the electorate and which was demonstrably against the wishes of the electorate or, on the other hand, after a general election a situation might arise in the country which makes legislation urgently necessary, the Government in power refuse to recognise that urgent necessity, and the people rise up and say: &ldquo;We demand that this legislation be brought along.&rdquo; Now, the object of these articles in the Constitution is to allow the individual to have two separate items put up before the electorate. Article 48 says: &ldquo;The Oireachtas may provide for the Initiation by the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments.  Should the Oireachtas fail to make such provision within two years, it shall on the petition of not less than seventy-five thousand voters on the register, of whom not more than fifteen thousand shall be voters in any one constituency, either make such provisions or submit the question to the people for decision in accordance with the ordinary regulations governing the Referendum.&rdquo; We are presented here&mdash;and we know how it was done&mdash;with what purports to be a petition, which actually is a petition on two subjects.  Article 48 lays down that the people may gather together to petition on one point, and on one point only.  We know quite well that during some years strong political propaganda has gone around the country urging the abolition of the Oath in the Constitution. We know quite well that the people were organised on that point, that their feelings were roused&mdash;they were misled, of course&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now, these provisions in the Constitution were made to allow one concrete point to be put before the people and for the people to decide on that.  In this petition there are two points put before us, a major and a minor point.  The major point is that the Oath be removed from the Constitution, which means the removal <Col N="1736" /> of the Oath from the Treaty, which means the abrogation of the Treaty, and that is not put before the people. I suggest that the people who signed this document were deceived into signing it on two points.  The majority of them thought&mdash;and what interested them in it was that they thought&mdash;that they were signing a document for the abolition of the Oath in the Constitution. They did that because they were deceived into thinking that that Article in the Constitution was an isolated Article in the Constitution, and because they did not advert to the Article in the Constitution which says&mdash;I do not remember the exact words&mdash;that the Constitution, in so far as it may from time to time be contrary to the Treaty, is thereby null and void.  That was not put before them.  They were deceived on that point.  They thought they were putting their signatures to a request for the removal of the Oath, which they thought could be simply removed, and that request of theirs for the abolition of the Oath from the Constitution is then brought up here as an urgent request from 75,000 voters, who are all enthusiastic for this particular piece of constitutional machinery called the Initiative.  We are presented with that here, and told: &ldquo;Here you have 75,000 voters who are full of enthusiasm for the Initiative and who have presented this petition to you,&rdquo; while the unfortunate dupes throughout the country, as we know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;thought that they were taking steps to remove the Oath from the Constitution.  I suggest that this House is not called upon to receive this petition, because it is not a petition within the meaning of Article 48, because the people who signed did so on two points, just the same as they vote at a General Election. A man may vote at a General Election for the Fianna Fáil Party because he approves of wholesale&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now, do not tell us why a man votes at a General Election for the Fianna Fáil Party, for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, or for any other Party.  The Minister is quite <Col N="1737" /> in order when he discusses General Elections as opposed to the Initiative and the Referendum, but not when he discusses particular General Elections and particular Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only trying to draw a general analogy. I suggest that this petition, as presented, is not in accordance with Article 48.  When it comes to drawing analogies, two points are put before the people; in a general election twenty points may have been put before the people, and a person might vote for one Party because he approves of the Treaty, and against another Party because it is against it. That person might at the same time disapprove of our Licensing Acts, but the people consider what is of the greatest importance to the country, and they make up their minds about that.  When this petition was put to the people one man might have been a fanatical admirer of the Initiative as a constitutional method, and on the other hand the majority, I believe, would not know exactly what the Initiative was.  All they were told was: &ldquo;You do not like this Oath.  Just sign this document, and if we get 75,000 signatures, the Oath goes out of the Constitution and every one can come into the Dáil merely to wreck the Dáil.&rdquo; I suggest, therefore, that this House, far from being bound under Article 48 to accept this petition, is practically bound by the Constitution to refuse it, because it is an attempt to do away with Article 17, and Article 17 is covered by, I think, Article 3:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The said Constitution shall be construed with reference to the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland set forth in the Second Schedule hereto annexed (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;the Scheduled Treaty&rdquo;) which are hereby given the force of law, and if any provision of the said Constitution or of any amendment thereof or of any law made thereunder is in any respect repugnant to any of the provisions of the Scheduled Treaty, it shall, to the extent only of such repugnancy, be absolutely void and inoperative and the Parliament and the Executive Council of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) shall respectively <Col N="1738" /> pass such further legislation and do all such other things as may be necessary to implement the Scheduled Treaty.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this petition has been brought up veiled and garbed in the cloak of constitutionalism.  It is not, first of all, a petition within the ambit of Article 48, and far from being a constitutional thing is a covert act to deceive, first of all, the people and then to deceive the Dáil into destroying the Constitution in its fundamentals and destroying this State in its fundamental of the Treaty, under pretence of admiration and love for a very modern and very advanced method of constitutional practice called the Initiative.  I suggest that it is an attempt to deceive this House, that there has been an attempt at deceit of the people outside, and that there is at this present moment an attempt to subvert the Constitution in its fundamentals under pretence of the most meticulous care for the fulfilment of Article 48.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to explain to the House my meaning of the motion as distinct from the petition if this motion is carried.  The motion reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That leave be given to present a petition prepared in accordance with the provisions of Article 48 of the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very sorry that the demand in the motion has been associated with the reception of the petition for a particular purpose, and unfortunately that places members of this House, especially in view of the President's speech, in the position of voting for the motion and for the reception of the petition as against the President's idea of abolishing the Article altogether. That is my own personal view, and it is unfortunate that members of the House should be placed in that peculiar <Col N="1742" /> position.  On the other hand, we had the President on various occasions through his political career boosting the democratic nature of this particular Constitution.  I hope I am not bordering on any contentious matter when I say that it is well known that the civil war was fought on the issue of the Treaty and the Constitution under which this House functions to-day. The President made that clear in every speech he made, not only during the general election of 1923, but during the two general elections of 1927.  If the general election which followed the framing of this Constitution was fought on the issue of preserving the Constitution or otherwise, and if the cost of the civil war is to be counted on that basis, then the words in this clause of the Constitution have cost the taxpayers a very large sum of money. I wonder if the President would tell us what every word in the Constitution cost the taxpayers, and will he say what was the cost of this particular clause that he now wishes to have deleted. As we are talking about the intentions of those who passed the Constitution, or who framed it, I think it is not wrong to go back on the speeches of those who were responsible for fathering it in this House, or in what was known as the Constituent Assembly. According to the Official Debates of October 5th, 1922, page 1213, the late Minister for Justice in moving this particular Article said:</P>
    <P>I may say it will still further associate the people with the forging of the laws of the country and it puts the power in the hands of the people of even initiating legislation.  If a large section of the people feel that a certain law is desirable and the Parliament fails to introduce the desired legislation the power is given here to the people to initiate legislation themselves.  It is the direct complement of the Referendum and pretty much what can be claimed for the Referendum can be claimed for the Initiative&mdash;that it keeps contact between the people and their laws and keeps responsibility and consciousness in the minds of the people that they are the real and ultimate rulers of the country.  The text of the Article as it stands is permissive. <Col N="1743" /> It is not mandatory.  It is permissive of Parliament to institute the Initiative but it is mandatory if Parliament having failed to introduce it is so requested by a petition within two years.  I think it is better not to speak of the amendments that are on the paper until they are moved.</P>
    <P>The late Minister for Justice is responsible for this particular clause in the Constitution.  I will take the liberty of quoting&mdash;I do not want to detain the House very long&mdash;the Minister for Finance.  According to the Official Debates, page 1215, speaking on the same day he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I do not think in any of these matters which are left to the people that we should make it too easy for a very small body to involve the country in the expense which anything of this nature will bring about.</P>
    <P>He was talking about the number of people who would be entitled to sign a petition in order to implement this particular clause of the Constitution. He goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Every Initiative would mean an enormous expense.  It may be that within two years when the country has had experience of Referendums there may not be any very great desire for an Initiative.  On the other hand if there is sufficient desire it would be very easy to get it.</P>
    <P>I quote in support of the Clause of the Constitution as it now stands, two Ministers, the late Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance, who took the responsibility of introducing that Clause into the Constitution for the purpose of enabling them to say, as they have already said on many occasions, that the people are masters in this country.  Personally, I think Deputy de Valera has adopted the wrong procedure. Whether we like it or not, the law-making authority in this country consists of the Dáil, the Seanad and the Governor-General.  That is a fact whether you want to recognise it or not. Therefore, in my opinion if the proper procedure were adopted, it should have been by some other means than the moving of a motion in one part of the <Col N="1744" /> Oireachtas, if I might put it in that way.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has given very careful consideration to this question. Personally, speaking for myself, I am anxious to retain the Clause as it is in the Constitution to enable whatever body of citizens have the right, to exercise that right, if they wish to do so at any time, in any matter.  I say it is a serious state of affairs for the President of the Executive Council to refuse the petition and to refuse to agree to this motion on the grounds that the clause in the Constitution is in his opinion unworkable. The clause stands in the Constitution and those who are constitutionalists, and I am one, will stand by the Constitution until it is amended in a proper constitutional way.  The Labour Party have given careful consideration to this matter and are of the opinion&mdash; although we will, if forced, have to vote for this motion because we are committed to it, as we want to retain the clause in the Constitution to give the people the rights that have so often been spoken of&mdash;that a different procedure should be adopted.  We framed an amendment to the motion, but the amendment was ruled out of order.  The amendment was on these lines:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the House notes that it is proposed to present a Petition in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution, and resolves that a Joint Committee of both Houses be appointed to consider and report to the Oireachtas upon the procedure required to give due effect to the provisions of that Article, including the procedure for the reception of a Petition, the checking of the signatures thereto, the period within which the Oireachtas should give consideration to the Petition, and the arrangements to be made for a Referendum if the Oireachtas should decline to make the provision contemplated in Article 48, and that a message be sent to the Seanad accordingly.</P>
    <P>That, in the considered opinion of the Labour Party, is the procedure that should have been adopted by Deputy de Valera if he intended the motion to have any real effect.  I do not believe <Col N="1745" /> in detaining the House in considering a motion of this kind.  I am personally very sorry that the motion which stands in Deputy de Valera's name has been associated with the reception of a petition for a particular purpose.  Deputy Little admitted that quite frankly in his speech to-day.  I am very careful, and I will be careful, to see that the Article of the Constitution which gives certain rights to the people of the country will be respected and implemented if, and when, necessary. I hope that the President, who has involved this country in a civil war for the preservation of the Constitution, which was framed and passed in this House, will not try in the way he is doing here on this motion, to ignore a very important clause in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I certainly maintain that the issue at the general election in 1923 by all those who accepted the Treaty was for the Treaty and for the Constitution as against the Treaty and against the Constitution.  Therefore, if this clause was considered essential &mdash;and I believe it is a clause which one can make use of to persuade the people that they are the masters and the rulers and nobody else&mdash;I want that clause maintained for any purpose for which the people of the country may consider it advisable to use it.  I am sorry to say that Deputy de Valera qualified his use of this particular method of procedure.  He is reported &mdash;I am not quoting from the official report because I have not got it here&mdash; to have stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1746" />&ldquo;The whole question was whether they wanted to avoid the obligation of Article 48 or not.  It might be said that it would lead to a hopeless complication of laws, and there was something to be said for that.  That was why he was not in favour of the Initiative for ordinary laws.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I know anything of the  some of those who were colleagues of mine in the Constituent Assembly, and who agreed to that clause, I know they had certain matters in their minds at the time.  Deputy de Valera must admit that he could not stand up in this House to-day and say that there is unity in his Party, for example, on the question of prohibition or temperance reform.  Many of those who voted for that clause in the Constitution foresaw that a time might come when there would be an agitation sufficiently strong in this country to force parties to decide whether there should be legislation for prohibition or otherwise. That is a question which the leaders of the political parties will be glad to get rid of, inside their party meetings.  If I know anything about political parties there could not be unity in any party on the matter.  They would be glad to allow the people themselves to make use of this particular clause in order to be relieved of the responsibility for deciding questions of that kind rather than placing the responsibility on the leaders and members of parties.  That is one of the things I had in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Davin that it would be a monstrous thing for the President or any member of the Government to refuse to honour any clause of the Constitution.  Deputy Little was right in his statement that <Col N="1747" /> our political convictions can be summed up in one word&mdash;reverence for the law.  He is right there.  Remember we want to have this quite clear.  We hold that this is unconstitutional. That is the whole issue.  I agree with the Minister for Defence. He has put his case quite plainly.  He said that not only would it be wrong to receive it, but it would be absolutely unconstitutional, and it is on that we want to vote.  I think I can show to any reasonable man who has reverence for the Constitution that this is an attempt&mdash;an unconstitutional attempt &mdash;to subvert a most important Article in the Constitution.  I might say further, that our political education&mdash;I am speaking now to the opposite benches&mdash;should have gone far enough to realise that there is an authority to decide what is and what is not constitutional.

I say that the Minister for Defence was right that not only have you no right to do it, but in my opinion&mdash;of course it is a matter of opinion which may be tested at any time&mdash;you would be doing something which, is unconstitutional, because, as I say, it was never intended by the Constitution and was never contemplated by that Article that this machinery should be used to carry out what Deputy Little agrees was the real intention of that petition.

I do not know any people who voted for the Initiative, but I accept the Deputy's word.  Other people, he said, voted for the Oath.  He admits it.

It presented a difficulty for me, and I resolved that difficulty by allowing Deputy de Valera to move his motion because it was a point which I could not resolve myself.  It is one that the House must resolve, and the position is that the House is now in the process <Col N="1752" /> of resolving it.  There has been some talk of the motion as proposed by Deputy de Valera.  Nobody could insist that Deputy de Valera should put the motion in these terms, that leave be granted to present a petition purporting to have been prepared in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution. Manifestly, it is the case of the mover of the motion that the petition has been properly prepared.  That point is arguable and is now being argued.  Deputies will get an opportunity of arguing it from both sides, and there is no necessity to import all this heat into the matter.  There is no use in contradicting the Minister for Agriculture on the spot.  Deputies can contradict him later on.</P>

Remember this, we are under no obligation whatever to aid or assist Deputy de Valera or the Fianna Fáil Party in making hay through the Constitution. None whatever.  We do not intend to do it.  We are not going out of our way to facilitate them, and we are going to avail of every constitutioaal right we have to validate the Constitution. We expect them to take that, and not to be looking for help to us. That is what they are always doing. &ldquo;Help us in our weakness.&rdquo;&ldquo;We throw ourselves on the mercy of the House.&rdquo; That is the way with these idealists and soldiers.  &ldquo;Help us; we cannot break the Constitution on our own; come to our help.&rdquo; No, we are not going to do that.

If we happen to be put wrong we will not suggest, as Deputy de Valera did in his speech, that, of course, there are young men outside, and God knows what they would not do&mdash;patriots and idealists&mdash; if such a thing does not happen.  That is a suggestion which I resent, that there are young men who will see that you will do it.  I am here prepared to stand up to any man in the House, but I object to having that argument thrown into the scale.

      <P>The situation arising here is intolerable. The Minister for Agriculture is making a relevant speech and he should be allowed to make it.  It seems to me there is a very deliberate attempt to prevent him from making it.  If he is not allowed to speak I shall have to regard it as gross disorder and adjourn the House, and let the debate be continued in what might possibly be a better atmosphere.  Seeing that Deputies will have the opportunity of replying to the Minister, surely their cause would be better served by making speeches in reply rather than by shouting.  With regard to alleged points of order, these can be abused. Deputies rise and say: &ldquo;On a point of order I ask the Minister so and so,&rdquo; and the Minister proceeds to reply, and in fact the Minister seems to enjoy it. It is not helping to maintain order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not enjoy them. They are ridiculous.  I said the Oath <Col N="1755" /> could not be taken out of the Treaty. If it were I know the immediate reaction to it would be this: I know we shall have puerile talk again about force and about Lloyd George's blue pencil. Why we have not in 1928 grown out of that sort of puerility I do not know. Every Treaty is imposed by force. There was force on our side and force on the British side.  In every Treaty in every country there is force on both sides.  That is accepted in all countries. What was referred to by Deputy de Valera as the Western European standard of civilisation has accepted it.  It is accepted by all nations that have grown up that there is force on both sides in every treaty and contract. For goodness sake let us not be making an exhibition of ourselves before the people of the world by talking in that puerile way about force.  There is a way of doing what the Deputy wants. There is a way of abolishing the Treaty; there is a way of denouncing the Treaty.  It will have to be denounced as a whole.  &ldquo;We hold we have the right to secede.&rdquo; Do so, and take the responsibility of doing so.  So far as I and most of the Deputies are concerned, we will oppose it and will use every constitutional method to oppose it.  I think the Treaty gives us more independence than we would have under a Republic, but that is neither here nor there.  If you want to denounce it there is a way of doing it, but I will oppose it.  First get your majority&mdash;I think this is relevant&mdash; and then you can denounce the Treaty, but this is what we will not stand for: we will not allow the people to be tricked into denouncing the Treaty. This is an attempt to trick them into denouncing it.  People are told: &ldquo;Take out the Oath and everything is right.&rdquo; The fact is that to take out the Oath is to take out a fundamental part of the Treaty, and means denouncing the whole Treaty, and we are not going to allow the people to be tricked or cajoled into voting for taking the Oath out of the Treaty under the impression that that does not mean a complete denunciation of the Treaty.  If the people denounce the Treaty they will do it deliberately, knowing what they are doing, and they will not do so by <Col N="1756" /> a trick.  They will not be tricked into it by anybody.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any Deputy who is going to be tricked by the veneer of legality the Minister for Agriculture has tried to throw over his unconstitutionalism. Either he is tricking the House or the Dáil is faced with a political crisis, and a serious difference in this matter has arisen between the President of the Executive Council and two of the most important of his Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Because every word of the Minister's speech here was in direct contradiction to the speech delivered by the President on the last day that this motion was debated.  As a Deputy who, when this question was raised some time ago, did not hesitate for one moment in describing himself as being only slightly constitutional, the President's speech on Wednesday last, I think, justifies me in claiming him as a colleague.</P>
      <P>I think that a large section, at any rate, of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in their attitude in this matter have shown themselves to be only slightly constitutional as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the President and myself are agreed apparently that the Constitution is an intolerable nuisance only to be obeyed when it suits us, and in so far as it suits us, and be ignored when it happens to be inconvenient.  I strongly suspect that the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Agriculture are with us in our attitude, although, in view of the effect which the President's speech has created they are anxious to give a veneer of legality to their attitude.  Deputies O'Connell and Davin are, of course, constitutionalists. We can afford to ignore those&mdash;we can deal with those.  If we can get agreement between the two big Parties in this House to regard the Constitution as a nuisance&mdash;something of no significance, something that can be ignored when occasion requires&mdash;then I think we will have cleared the way very considerably towards the establishment of proper canons of political honesty in <Col N="1757" /> this country.  We, however, before deciding upon having that particular fact clearly recognised by the people must reckon with the opposition we are likely to encounter.  We have it already indicated clearly that Deputy O'Connell and the Labour Party will oppose our unconstitutionalism.  However logical and reasonable that may sound, their numbers in this House, I think, are not sufficiently great to enable them to impede us in our work.</P>
    <P>There are other Deputies who are likely to be as strictly constitutional as the Labour Party.  We know that the word has gone forth from the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; to those who adopt its political creed on this matter.  In this morning's issue of that paper, you will find that stated in the leading article:</P>
    <P>Mr. Cosgrave's incontinent rejection of it, (that is the petition) therefore, may be interpreted, not unreasonably, as a violation of the Constitution; and such violation must be regarded as a dangerous precedent. We can imagine easily the use Mr. de Valera might make of it if, at some future time, his Party should take office.  The Constitution can be amended by Parliament but, as it stands, it is sacred.  Any other attitude to-day&mdash;especially by Ministers &mdash;opens an alarming vista of irregularity and lawlessness.</P>
    <P>The order is gone forth to the Constitutionalists that President Cosgrave and myself in having this Constitution relegated to the scrap heap will have to reckon with considerable opposition from that quarter.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So gather round, my boys,</P>
    <P>Sinn Feiners scorning,</P>
    <P>Let your voices roll across the floor,</P>
    <P>For the Constitutional movement, now take warning,</P>

We have 15,000 bayonets behind us.  Force is the only argument that counts here.  That Constitution is not worth the paper it is written upon. We know that.  We have got the bayonets.

      <P>He wants to maintain a particular attitude in order to be able to represent himself in the Press and on platforms as an upholder of this document, whereas I do not care a rap what people think of my attitude. It just happens that I am honest and he is not.  Of course, I am prepared to admit that there will not be agreement between the President and myself as to what particular articles of the Constitution are to be scrapped. I would be anxious to preserve these <Col N="1760" /> articles which provide for democratic government, but he is not.  He is anxious to preserve the articles that give to his Britannic Majesty George V., Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India, etc., a certain amount of authority in this country.  I do not.  So far as we can go together, we will.  We can go this far: We can recognise this Constitution exactly for what it is worth&mdash;waste paper.  I and Deputies who are supporting this motion would like to preserve the democratic articles of the Constitution.  We would like to preserve Article 48.  We would like to ensure that power would be given to the people by a majority vote to make their will effective.  That is what that Article provides for.  It provides that in certain cases in which this Dáil does not act the people, by a majority vote, can make their will effective.  We are asking this Dáil to set up the machinery by which 450,000 people, who do not want the oath of allegiance, can find out on a straight issue whether or not they are in a majority in the country. That is what the Government is trying to trick the Dáil into preventing.  We want to ensure that that will go before the people as a single issue, not confused by any personalities, such as take place at election times, not confused as to the merits of one Party or another, but as a straight, single issue, as to whether or not the people want their public representatives to pledge to an outside authority their allegiance before they can take up their duty in the Dáil as their representatives.  The Government are trying to prevent that straight issue being put to the people. I am aware that by emphasising the particular purpose for which we, at any rate, would like the power of the Initiative used, I may be confusing the issue to some minds.  The petition asks the House to implement a particular part of the Constitution which lays down that machinery for the carrying out of the Initiative must be provided on the petition of 75,000 voters, or else that the matter of setting up that machinery be referred to the people by Referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>We make no secret of it.  We are anxious to let you know that.  If this House wishes to implement Article 48 of the Constitution they will not get out of that by the sort of quibbling we have had from the two Ministers who have spoken.  The President has other objections, however.  The Ministers who spoke to-day tried to maintain&mdash;I do not think they convinced themselves&mdash;that in receiving the petition under Article 48 of the Constitution they would, in fact, be breaking the Constitution.  But the President's objections were different. He said first of all there was doubt in somebody's mind as to what is the Oireachtas.  We are told the Oireachtas is the Government of the Twenty-six Counties of the Free State.  But what is it?  Apparently it was impossible to define the Oireachtas under the Constitution in a sufficiently definite manner to enable Article 48 of the Constitution to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three parts of the Oireachtas&mdash;His Britannic Majesty and the two Houses here.  Let us take the illustration of the shamrock&mdash;the old illustration of three in one.  If you wanted to stick a pin in the shamrock you would be faced with considerable difficulty.  You could only stick it in one of the leaves at a time.  We want to present this petition to the Oireachtas, and we can only do it to one House at a time.  I think that simile is quite in order.  It was used on a more important occasion, and it can be used here.  I think Deputies opposite will be forced to admit that that particular argument of the President's is only an attempt to side-track the issue.  If the members of the Executive Council were anxious to implement Article 48 they would have no difficulty whatever in doing so.  We were told that the taking of the Initiative under <Col N="1762" /> the Article would be very costly.  There seems to be some doubt as to the actual cost.  The President said £80,000.  That is about twice the cost of the Seanad election.  The figure the President gave was disputed.  Deputy Davin dealt with that very well.  Apparently because it might cost £80,000 to abolish Article 17 of the Constitution we must not do it.</P>
    <P>We frequently hear from Ministers on public platforms and in this House reference to the amount it cost to enforce the Oath of Allegiance on the country and to ram it down the necks of the people.  How much did that cost?  Was it £30,000,000?</P>

The minority decided that the majority's will should not prevail.  Of course, we do not hear so much about the will of the people nowadays.

      <P>I suggest that every member of the Front Bench opposite was elected because he claimed that he stood for the Constitution.  &ldquo;We are going to preserve the Constitution, come what may.&rdquo; They made fine speeches about it.  &ldquo;No matter who attempts to intimidate us, or what may happen, no matter what forces of lawlessness and irregularity are let loose upon the country we will preserve the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The fact is that no vote cast at the last election showed that the people were in favour of the amendment or abolition of the Constitution in the manner indicated by the President.  I maintain that the Government, in proceeding to amend the Constitution in that manner by the power or by the votes they can get in this House, are acting in defiance of the will of the people, which a few months ago they were urging should prevail.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is an attempt to give effect to <Col N="1766" /> an article of the Constitution.

      <P>In a way, I hope they do.  It will be very useful for this Party if the first step in degrading the Constitution and rendering it inoperative comes from the opposite side of the House.  When we have succeeded in scrapping this Constitution altogether we believe the country will be much better off.  When we have succeeded in deleting those sections of the Constitution which have not at any time received the sanction of the Irish people, or which are not in accord with their wishes or national aspirations, we will be much better off.  The sections of the Constitution which do provide for the democratic government of the people of this country by their elected representatives, which do enable the people's voice to be expressed upon all matters concerning their welfare, will be preserved by the Deputies of this Party irrespective of the consequences and irrespective of the fourteen thousand bayonets.</P>

      <P>The suggestion that the Farmers' Party might not, in certain circumstances, be supporters of the Government in regard to the constitutional issue is one which will not hold water.  At the moment I am not prepared to advance an argument on the general question raised here.  The argument I would be inclined to advance, if I were to debate the matter, would be that used by the Ministers who have spoken on this side of the House.  If this motion for the reception of the petition had been brought forward purely for the purpose of setting up machinery for establishing the Initiative and Referendum in the abstract, it is quite possible that I would have given my support to the motion. But the party opposite&mdash;perhaps fortunately for the House and for the country&mdash;coupled with the motion an addendum.  They state that the intention is to set up machinery which will be used for the purpose of deciding whether or not the Oath shall be maintained in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>If the Party opposite had thought fit to introduce this motion with the idea of setting up machinery for the establishment of the Referendum, it might be accepted as the ideal of ultra-democratic government. But, fortunately for the clear understanding of the issue which we have to face, it is coupled with the idea that the Initiative, if set up, is to be used for one purpose and one purpose only.  The party opposite want to use the Constitution for the carrying out of an operation which, in itself, is an abrogation and a breaking of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>So far as the Party to which I belong are concerned, there is no doubt as regards our attitude towards the Constitution.  We made it plain on every platform on which we stood that, on the constitutional question, we were absolutely at one with the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  We made that plain in the June election, and in the election of August, 1923, and in the election of 1922.  The Farmers' Party never quibbled or hesitated in the statement that, on the question of the Constitution and its maintenance, they stood with and supported the Government. One of the main reasons, though not the only reason, that we are here, side by side with the Government, and in alliance with the Government Party, is in order that the Constitution may be maintained.  The people we represent are not prepared, and we are not prepared, to face the consequences of abrogating the Constitution.</P>
