      <P>Convicted prisoners can earn the privilege of visits by good conduct and industry while undergoing their sentences.  Prisoner James Donnelly had become eligible for a visit in the beginning of May and his wife visited him on the 7th of that month.  Later he refused to work, although warned that by such a course he would forfeit the privilege of further visits.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. I should say that action in a matter of this kind would, first of all, require to be taken in the courts, and if, when such action is taken, it is proved that there has been any negligence, then it would fall to the Minister's consideration to review the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to get information on is this: If the election petition be successful it will involve an additional charge of some £400 or £500 on the ratepayers of the county, and does it not seem unreasonable, if the facts are as stated, that that is the only way that redress can be secured?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It might seem more reasonable to adopt a course of that kind, but, unfortunately, it is not the law, and the Minister has no discretion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The prisoner referred to was sentenced at the Central Criminal Court on the 25th ultimo to 12 months' imprisonment with hard labour.  On his arrival at Mountjoy prison he was required, in accordance with the ordinary prison routine, to divest himself of his clothing and to dress in prison clothes.  He refused to comply with this direction, and was, in consequence, dressed in prison clothes by the prison officers.  In his cell he divested himself of the clothing and went to bed, and later stated that he would not comply with any prison regulations. On the 17th instant the medical officer reported that his continuance in bed in his cell in the present hot weather might prove prejudicial to his health, and the Prisons Board thereupon ordered that he should be dressed in his own clothes and taken out to exercise.  I have ascertained that McConnell dressed this morning and went out to exercise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD - KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Dáil agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 5 (1) the words &ldquo;may by such order give such directions as to costs as they may consider proper&rdquo; deleted in lines 16-17 and the following words substituted therefor: &ldquo;shall order that the costs of the appeal and of the new trial of the accused person shall be paid by the State, unless the court shall be of opinion that the necessity for the appeal and the new trial has been caused or contributed to by the defence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the only amendment to this Bill made by the Seanad.  As the Bill left this House, if there was a new trial of a prisoner, the question of costs was entirely within the discretion of the court.  The Seanad has rather limited the discretion of the court by the insertion of the words:</P>
      <P>shall order that the cost of the appeal and of the new trial of the accused person shall be paid by the State, unless the court shall be of opinion that the necessity for the appeal and the new trial has been caused or contributed to by the defence.</P>
      <P>This amendment is very much in the interest, so to speak, of the person charged, and I suggest to the House that they should agree to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>The only matter that appears to me to call for any consideration is in connection with the <Col N="907" /> words &ldquo;or contributed to by the defence.&rdquo; That is a very wide phrase. It gives a very wide discretion to the judge to say if a prisoner has contributed some way or other.  I wonder would the Minister be able to alter that so as to make it definitely &ldquo;contributed to or primarily occasioned,&rdquo; or something of that kind, which would mean that the defence were really to a large extent responsible.  &ldquo;Contributed to&rdquo; might mean a very small thing or a big thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The judge still has discretion.  In every case the court will still have a discretion, and if it sees that it has been, only to a small extent, contributed to by the defence, of course the court will use its discretion.  I would ask the Deputy to accept the amendment, because the Bill is rather an urgent one.  Until it becomes law, there is nobody who can act for the Chief Justice, and, at the moment, the Chief Justice is not in the country, so that a good deal of business may be held up.  I would ask the Deputy to agree to this amendment.  I think the Deputy will find that in the working of the Bill the court will administer it fairly and justly to the accused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that within a fortnight this Bill might be very pressing, as no lunacy, or matter in infancy in court, can be adjudicated upon.  Until this Bill becomes <Col N="908" /> law the Chief Justice has no power to appoint a delegate.  That is why this Bill is of pressing urgency at the moment.  I am sorry that I must ask the House to accept the Bill as amended, and I would ask Deputy de Valera to consider if the point is not a very small one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, if it were administered as the Minister indicated, it would be certainly a small point, but I am not at all satisfied that it would be administered in that way. After all, the judge, when he will be deciding will see that the law is in black and white, that the cost shall be paid by the State, &ldquo;unless the court shall be of opinion that the necessity for the appeal and the new trial has been caused or contributed to by the defence.&rdquo;&ldquo;Contributed to&rdquo; is much too wide.  The extent to which the defence may have contributed is an important matter, and I think we ought to indicate here, for the guidance of the judge, that the State ought to pay for the re-trial, except in the case where definitely the responsibility for the appeal lay with the defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience, officially, in dealing with civil trials, is that the court always gives costs against the State.  Win, lose or draw, the costs are given against the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we ought to leave a matter of that kind to chance.  It is a very important point. The accused may not have any means. or may have only very little, or even if he has some means he might be mulcted for costs, when the necessity for the appeal was not caused by any neglect on the part of the defendant or his counsel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation came from the Seanad, that body from which no good can come, if we are to take the statements of the other side, and this is rather a recommendation in favour of the Seanad.  It has at least this much in its favour, that this is something that was thought of there which was not thought of here. It took some accommodation to get a recommendation which would pass <Col N="909" /> there and be acceptable here.  That we should proceed to judge this case ourselves&mdash;that is what the Deputy suggests, that the court should not be allowed a discretion in this matter&mdash;the court which has all the elements of the case before it.  The terms that are put down there &ldquo;has been caused or contributed to by the defence&rdquo; were really inserted on the advice of a lawyer, and a lawyer who has had some experience of these matters.  Apart altogether from what the Minister for Finance said&mdash;which has been my own experience&mdash;there is a disposition on the part of the courts to give costs against the State in these matters.  I think that the judiciary, as such, can well merit our confidence in dealing with a matter of this kind in accordance with the best traditions of jurisprudence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>According to this, it would be within the discretion of the judge to ask himself whether it was due to neglect by the State prosecutor, or whether it has been caused or contributed to by the defence.  In other words, if there is some contribution of any kind by the defence, no matter how small, they will say: &ldquo;Very well, you contributed to this,&rdquo; without any regard to the extent of the contribution.  We have to make the law here, and we can set down very clearly what is in our minds as to when the defence should be made to bear the costs.  The time when the defence should be made to bear the costs is, it seems to me, when they have primarily occasioned the appeal by neglect, so that the judge would use his discretion in deciding whether the appeal was primarily due to the defence, that is, that the defence primarily caused the necessity for the appeal.  If I got in the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; to indicate that the responsibility is mainly on the defence, I would be satisfied.  After all, the law as we pass it is what will be interpreted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The President said that we were leaving it to the discretion <Col N="910" /> of the judge.  These words do not leave it to the discretion of the judge. What we want to do is to give to the judge a discretion, and if you were to put in some words like &ldquo;primarily,&rdquo; or &ldquo;substantially,&rdquo; it would cover the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy de Valera and Deputy Little are entirely misconstruing it.  This particular section will only fetter the discretion of the judge to this extent, that it will oblige him to give costs against the State, except he is satisfied on certain things.  It does not prevent his giving costs against the State in every instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister for Finance is not in a position to interpret these words ex cathedra. They lay down here a certain system, and then they use the word &ldquo;unless,&rdquo; which has a perfectly definite dictionary meaning, and in so far as they say &ldquo;caused or contributed to,&rdquo; they do definitely put a pressure upon the judge.  In a case that is a line-ball case these words, &ldquo;caused or contributed to by the defence,&rdquo; do put pressure upon the judge&mdash;that is my reading of the plain meaning of the words&mdash;to say that the costs shall be borne by the defence. The suggestion made by Deputy de Valera seems, on the face of it, to be perfectly right and proper, and the mere fact that it would be some inconvenience, either to the Seanad or this House, to put right what is manifestly wrong in the law is no argument to be offered to this House by any Minister for Justice who has the slightest respect for the House.  I do not suggest that the Minister has, and I do not suggest that the sort of thing which his Party has done within the last few weeks would indicate that he had any respect, either for this House or for the law.</P>

      <P>In spite of the very eloquent tirade which we have just listened to, I ask the House to accept this amendment as it comes from the Seanad.  We are told that this is manifestly wrong and manifestly unjust.  It is nothing of the kind.  The Deputy talked about the prisoner bearing the costs of the appeal.  He is never asked to bear the costs of the appeal; he is asked to bear only his own costs of the appeal.  The State always bears its own costs, except in cases where an order is made by the judge, and the prisoner should bear the costs himself in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if this amendment were not in the Bill at all this is precisely the spirit in which the court would interpret the section, that where there has <Col N="912" /> been a mistake made, to which the prisoner has not contributed, if there was a wrong charge by the judge, if some mistake was made by the prosecutor, then obviously the court would give the prisoner his costs.  Now it is made obligatory on it so to do.  But if, on the other hand, the prisoner, through his defence, has caused the necessity for the new trial, that is to say, if he has not called witnesses, or something of that kind, and now wishes to have them, or if his counsel did not object to some evidence, or put something in evidence, which should not have been put in evidence, it is quite right and proper that he should not get his costs at the expense of the State.  But the State does not ask for costs against him, even where he has made this particular blunder&mdash;where he has contributed. Where it is partly the fault of the State and partly the fault of the prisoner in a great number of cases the court would conclude and, I think, rightly conclude, that since the prisoner is in fault he should bear his own share, but not the State's share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this Bill passes its Fourth Stage, there are one or two points that I should like the Minister for Finance to deal with.  In replying to the debate on the Second Reading, the Minister slightingly referred to what he described as the &ldquo;vague generalities&rdquo; of Deputy de Valera's speech.  Those who have read that speech and have studied it will not agree with the Minister's description of it.  It is as precise and as detailed as a speech could be, dealing with a general question of that sort&mdash;the question of the over-taxation of this country, and the lack of policy on the part of the Government to deal with the declining revenue and to deal with the declining population.  At any rate, whatever the Minister's own opinion may be in the matter, there was one aspect of that speech which was not a general one, one aspect which was dealt with in detail and one aspect which the Deputy substantiated with figures. That was the alarming slowness with which revenue is coming in for the current year.</P>
      <P>No person scrutinising the weekly returns issued by the Department of Finance can now have any other opinion than that the estimate of the revenue which the Minister proposed to this House in introducing his Budget will not be realised.  In order to carry on the services of this State, in order partially to defray the normal expenditure of this State the Minister budgeted to collect from the citizens an extra £1,149,000 this year.  Scarcely more than a quarter of the financial year has gone, and yet we find that there has been a continuous decrease in the rate at which the revenue is coming into the Exchequer.  In the period for the week ending 30th June the amount collected was £870,000 less than for the corresponding period last year.  For the period ending 7th July there was £959,000 less than for the corresponding period of last year, and for the period ending 14th July, according to the returns which we have just received, the amount is no less than £1,212,000 less than it was this time last year.  Just remember that figure, £1,212,000 less than last year, and this although the Minister imposed extra taxes and adopted expedients which would mean that the revenue would come into the Exchequer more quickly than last year.  How is he going to deal with that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That question was put to him very definitely in the debate upon the financial motion and in the debate on the Vote on Account, and the only reply the Minister gave to that question, which must be seriously disturbing the mind of any person who is interested in the trade and industry of the State, and in the prosperity of the country, was a very extraordinary one. He said: &ldquo;I am a long time dealing with these matters.  I have been watching from month to month and week to week these exchequer returns, and they do not affect me in any way.&rdquo;  The exchequer returns do not affect him in any way!  The fact that, notwithstanding the extra taxation imposed for the first fourteen weeks of this financial year, the revenue is less by £1,212,000 than it was for the corresponding period last year, does not affect the Minister in any way!  That is the extraordinary statement which the Minister makes.  As Deputy de Valera showed in his speech, the Minister is faced with a situation which he never <Col N="919" /> had to contemplate before.  The figures which were quoted in that speech on the Second Reading Stage of the Central Fund (No. 2) Bill, prove that conclusively.  Those figures are very important, very alarming, very significant, and, therefore, very well worthy of repetition.  They show that in the first quarter of 1925-26, 25.4 per cent. of the total revenue was collected; in the same quarter for 1926-27, 23.7 per cent. of the total revenue was collected; for the corresponding quarter in the year 1927-28 there was collected 25.5 per cent. of the total revenue, and in the corresponding quarter for this current year only 21.7 per cent. of the estimated probable revenue has been collected.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very striking decline; it is a very significant decline, and it does show that we have already reached the point at which taxation must and will yield for some time to come a diminishing return.  I think that the Minister ought to be very seriously affected by those figures&mdash;the Minister whose duty it is to balance this Budget and to see that the State shall always honour its obligations&mdash; whose duty it is to see that the expenditure upon Government services will never exceed the capacity of the citizens to pay.  The Minister is faced with these figures showing a rapidly declining income, figures which prove conclusively that the taxpayer is being bled dry, and yet the Minister, with Olympian aloofness, declines to think that it affected him in any particular way.  That attitude might be quite all right for a devotee on the banks of the Ganges or a contemplative in a hermit's cell, removed and remote from mundane matters.  But it is not the attitude which a Minister for Finance, charged with the administration of the revenues of this country, and with duties to this State and citizens, should adopt.  It is not the attitude that is going to serve and save the country whose sons and daughters are leaving it at the rate of thousands a year.  It is not the attitude which a Minister for Finance should adopt in a country which, as the very figures issued by his colleague in the Department of Industry and Commerce indicate, is dependent <Col N="920" /> mainly on an industry that is unable to support the number of people who are endeavouring to find sustenance on it.  That is the position as it seems to me.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to labour this matter, but this is the last opportunity, before this Bill goes through, that we in this House shall have of compelling the Government to face up to the situation which is developing. Therefore, we have taken advantage of the Report Stage of the measure to extort, if we can, from the Minister some expression of his attitude towards this problem and this situation, asking him to give us some idea how he proposes to deal with it and how he proposes, in case this decline in revenue should go on, and that these diminishing returns should increase rapidly, in the end to avoid further borrowing and balance his Budget.</P>
    <P>In that connection I would ask the House to remember that already there is a considerable proportion of normal services to be met out of borrowing. The Minister classified in his Budget statement as abnormal, expenditure which in most other countries would be met out of current revenue.  He proposes to meet that expenditure by borrowing.  If, over and above that, he has to borrow still further in order to meet what now looks like a certain deficit on his Budget statement, then it is inevitable that the social services of this country will have to be curtailed or restricted.  We feel that the present Government Departments must be overhauled in such a way as will make further borrowing unnecessary. Already far too great a proportion of the moneys extracted from the taxpayer go to defray the services of the public debt.  That has been increasing every year from 1925 to date.  In 1925-26 there was a sum of £899,000 taken out of the taxpayers' pockets to meet interest and sinking fund charges.  In 1926-27 that amounted to £1,082,000; in 1927-28 it was £1,229,000, and in 1928-29 the Minister estimates that it will be £1,606,490.  But that estimate was on the basis of his Budget statement that the taxes which he proposed to impose for the current year, including the additional taxation which he proposed to impose, and including <Col N="921" /> the concession which he proposed to deprive certain taxpayers of&mdash; upon that basis he still thought that he would have to borrow an additional amount which would compel him to set aside £1,606,490 for interest and sinking fund charges.  If, however, his anticipations are not realised and if the taxes which he has imposed do not yield the anticipated return&mdash;and it looks now as if they will yield something very much less&mdash;is it not quite clear that, instead of having to set aside £1,606,490 for the services of the public debt, we shall have to set aside a very much larger amount?</P>
    <P>What is to be the consequence? There is only one thing that we can see, only one thing which will inevitably ensue if we are to forecast the future of the Government by the Government's past record.  Wherever economies had to be made, wherever money had to be secured, it was secured by a reduction in the social services.  The old age pensions were the things which had to provide the major portion of past deficits.  And though only three months ago, or something less, the Minister did restore to a very small section of the old age pensioners the shilling of which he deprived them four years ago, we know that restoration was made grudgingly and we know that if an opportunity does arise&mdash;I am not saying opportunity, but if the need for it does arise&mdash;that shilling will be taken away and the old age pensioners will be subjected to further reduction.</P>

      <P>I do not know for certain, but I can read the figures and I can read the signs, and I can see that there will be a declining revenue, and I can see the necessity for the Minister to borrow more.  I can see the public debt mounting up and, judging the Government's future by the Government's past, I anticipate that when the money is to be found it will not be found by the payers of super tax or by the payers of income tax, but it will be taken off those who are entitled to secure from this State at least the right to die in decency and comfort after having served the State through 70 years of their lives.  We know that any <Col N="922" /> money the Minister for Finance has to find will be found by him.  There are Parties in this House who might find it in another way.  There are other Parties who would look at certain services of the Government, who would look particularly at the administration of the Gárda Síochána for a saving in expenditure, who can see a force drawing something like £1,600,000 of public revenue, a force that has been severely criticised by the judges of the State, a force which, as was admitted by the Minister for Justice, does not exist for the protection of the citizens, but for the persecution of those opposed to the policy of the Government, a force supposedly to protect the citizen against the house-breaker and the wrong-doer, but which, nevertheless, can set men on one side for the ignoble duty of harassing an honest citizen, seizing him 14 or 15 times in one month, subjecting him to the indignity of a search, violating his home, and all without any excuse or justification being given.  It was alleged as some justification for that, that the person to whom I refer, Mr. O'Donnell, was under suspicion; that he was a suspected person.  The Government took 15 opportunities to justify this suspicion, and they did not succeed in doing it on one single occasion.  Not one single document was found to justify the arrest of Mr. O'Donnell.  Not one single document was found in his house or on his person.  Having failed to find anything on the first and second occasions, they continued to arrest him simply with the idea of carrying on a persecution of that man because he happens to be a journalist who criticised the Government in his writings and who has written things that were rather unpleasant for the Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne asked me where we were to find the <Col N="923" /> money.  I was suggesting one particular branch of the Government service in which a certain amount of money might be saved.  I know that when I suggest that to the Minister he will rise and tell me that no one will save money by putting four buttons on a Guard's tunic instead of five.  I do not know how many buttons are on a Guard's tunic, as I have never come into such close association with the Guards as to be aware of the number. I am not suggesting that there should be four instead of five buttons, but I am suggesting that the Free State should be policed in the same proportion as England and Scotland.  In the Free State the proportion is one Guard to 475 persons, and in England and Scotland the proportion is one to 763. I am not suggesting, as I say, that we should reduce the number of buttons on a Guard's coat, but I am suggesting that we should reduce the number of people who wear those coats.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>The general question which I am putting to the Minister is: having the facts which we put before him, and which he cannot deny, how does he propose to deal with the situation which is developing?  We suggest, as he exercises a certain financial control over every Department, that there are certain Departments to which he should devote his attention.  We are criticising the way in which money is spent on certain Departments, and we suggest, in view of the maladministration of this particular service, that he could secure a sum of about £800,000 a year.  He could reduce the number of Gárdaí by half, and in that way reduce the burden to the taxpayer by a substantial amount. Nothing would be lost.  If there is any person who asks what we are going to do with those who retire, I suggest that industry will be able to absorb them, and, if it were not, it would be better that the shopkeeper and the farmer should be able to employ some of them <Col N="924" /> and be able to use the money put in his pocket to employ some of them so that they would be creating wealth for the State instead of consuming it in idleness, as they are doing now.  If they had to subsist on the unemployment dole, as many honest men have to do, they would be less costly than walking round as leisured gentlemen drawing anything from £2 10s. to £3 or £4 a week.  That is one of the ways we would like the Minister to face up to the situation, to go through every Department and find where economies can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister denies that economies can be found.  The Minister is always able to find reasons, not very substantial, for doing nothing.  He finds a reason for his inactivity in the industrial sphere, or for the inactivity of his Government in doing nothing for industry, by saying that we cannot put anything further on agriculture.  At present agriculture has to maintain too many persons.  According to the returns issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of all occupied persons in the Saorstát, 53 per cent. are engaged in agricultural occupations, whereas the corresponding figure in Denmark is 29.1.  It may be said that 53 per cent. of the population, or almost twice that of Denmark, have to find employment on the land.  They have to give a return for that livelihood, and their work is productive, but if we contrast the exports from Denmark, where only 29.1 per cent. are agricultural workers, with the exports from the Saorstát, where 53 per cent. are agricultural workers, we see, as a matter of fact, that the 53 per cent., who ostensibly get a livelihood on the land, are not working or maintaining themselves on the land, or, at least, the land is not worked at its maximum efficiency, and that if it were the number employed would tend inevitably to decrease.  The Saorstát for the year 1927 exported £2,232,000 of bacon and ham, while Denmark exported £23,398,000 worth.  In the same year the Saorstát exported £4,574,000 worth of butter, and Denmark exported £23,247,000 worth.  I could go through practically every one of these figures and commodities to show that Denmark, more efficiently managed and with a <Col N="925" /> more efficient Minister for Agriculture, is exporting much more per capita of the population employed on the land than the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>What is the moral?  These people cannot obviously live in comfort on the land in Ireland.  The land is not able to maintain the number of people who are compelled to find a livelihood on it. If agricultural processes in Ireland are made more efficient, the number of people who will find a livelihood on the land will tend to decrease, and, unless they are absorbed in industry, they will be forced to emigrate.  That is the problem which the Minister is up against.  He must develop the country in such a way that he must either absorb in industry the population which cannot be absorbed in agriculture, or allow the stream of emigration to continue.  How is the Minister facing up to that problem, and what is he doing to solve it?  The Minister said that he could not do anything because he does not want to impose any greater burdens on agriculture.  He falls back on the old argument that tariffs increase the cost of living.  I hope before this debate closes that it will be shown that the statement of the Minister that tariffs increase the cost to the consumer is fallacious.  When the problem is examined thoroughly it will be found that tariffs do not increase the cost of living.  They provide employment and absorb some of those who have to be maintained by the State in idleness.  So far as they create opportunities for industrial development, and so far as that development ensues, they increase the purchasing power of every person in that industry.  That reacts to increase the purchasing power of people in other industries who sell their products to those engaged in the first industry. If the whole question were examined home it would be found that in a fully-protected country, where full advantage is taken of tariffs, they are able to build up a sound industrial population, able to supply, so far as possible, the needs of the people.  Thus, so far from increasing the cost of living in terms of wealth, it would tend to decline through the operations of tariffs.</P>

      <P>In the debate upon the Second Reading of the Bill, various <Col N="926" /> questions were addressed to the Government in relation to their general policy.  In so far as these questions did draw from the Minister for Finance a general statement of his policy and the policy of the Government, in respect of industrial development, that debate was worth while.  I think that I stated during the course of that debate that I had become convinced that the Government had in fact no policy, that they were working from day to day, dealing with problems which each day brought, without any carefully thought-out plan to guide their actions.  I would like to withdraw that statement.  They have a policy.  They have declared their policy.  They have declared a policy based upon certain facts, and I hope to prove that they have a policy which in itself is wrong in so far as the facts upon which it is based are wrong and are not as they contend them to be.  The Minister for Finance speaking on the Second Reading debate of the Bill, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>We see that for strength and development&mdash;every kind of development, cultural and otherwise&mdash;that the population of the country should be increased.  We see that the population cannot be increased merely on getting increased agricultural efficiency. We see, therefore, that industry must be built up.  We believe, however, that in the beginning industry can only be built up by throwing an additional burden on agriculture. We are trying to increase the prosperity of agriculture.  We are going slowly with our tariff policies because we believe that at the present stage there are other policies as well as tariff policies, such, for instance, as an industrial policy.  Because we believe that at the present time agriculture cannot bear an increased burden, our aim in industry is not to produce everything the country might produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a general statement of the Government's policy.  It shows that in one respect they have a grasp of the true situation, but it shows also that they have lamentably failed to arrive at any correct solution for that situation. Mind you, that is not a casual statement made in debate.  It is a considered <Col N="927" /> statement of policy, and the Minister for Finance was careful to assure us that that was the case.  &ldquo;We cannot,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come to the Dáil and announce half-baked policies which we have not thought out.&rdquo;  We must not take this as a half-baked policy, as something which has not been thought out.  We must consider that the Government is staking its political future upon the wisdom of that policy, and if I can prove, as I think I can prove and prove easily, that that policy is based upon an incorrect interpretation of the facts, then it is obvious that the Government will have to admit that it is going on the wrong road.  The Minister informed us that, in his opinion, the result of any general policy of tariffs, or the result of any extension of the policy of tariffs must be that for a time, in certain instances, an additional burden will be thrown upon existing producers.  He added: &ldquo;It is for these reasons that we have hesitated to plunge into a policy, regardless of cost, of aiming at increasing the amount of manufacturing industry.&rdquo;  If it is a fact that providing protection for industry in this country is going to increase for a time, or permanently, the burden which is thrown upon existing producers in the State, then the Government's policy is right.  If it is a fact that we are unable to develop the industrial arm of the State without imposing such a burden on the agricultural arm that the agricultural arm will be unable to support it, then the Government's policy is right, but I would like to point out to Deputies that the only example given by the Minister for Finance, of the imposition of a tariff resulting in an increased burden upon agriculture was the example of the boot tariff. He said that there were others. He said that in some cases, of course, the tariff had not resulted in an increased burden on the community, but he gave us as an obvious example of increased charges to the community the boot tariff.</P>
    <P>If I can prove that the Minister for Finance had obviously not thought out the problem, had obviously not examined the figures which are available in <Col N="928" /> the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to the problem, then I think I can prove that the Government has embarked upon a policy which has not received in advance that consideration which a Government policy should have received.  I maintain that any person who goes through the statistics which are made available in this country by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the statistics which are made available in England by the Board of Trade, will be able to find out for himself that the statement made by the Minister for Finance was incorrect and that in the particular example which he gave, the selected example of the boot tariff, the imposition of that tariff did not in fact result in an increase in price to the consumer.  If the Minister was basing his statement of general policy upon a fact of that kind, one would have thought that he would have produced figures to substantiate his facts.  One would have thought that he would have produced the wholesale price lists issued by the boot manufacturers inside and outside the State to show that since 1924, since the tariff was imposed, there had been an increase in the wholesale prices of boots.  He did not show that.  He made a general statement. He implied that it was well known and that it needed no substantiation in the manner I have indicated. In regard to boots sold to the consumer and made in the factories of the State there has been no increase in price.  I submit if the Minister examines the price lists of factories in the State he will find that is so.  I submit if he goes into any shop in this city and purchases a pair of Irish boots he will get a pair of Irish boots far cheaper than he will get a pair of boots of similar quality produced in England and imported here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am going to deal with.  He said they will be 15 per cent. cheaper.  He said in his speech on Second Reading that if you impose a tariff of 15 per cent. on the foreign produce the price of the home product will be increased to almost the entire amount of the tariff.  I am going to prove that since the tariff was imposed <Col N="929" /> on boots in this State not merely has the wholesale price of English boots imported to this country been reduced by the amount of the tariff, but in fact England is sending in boots cheaper here than she is sending similar boots to any country in the world. The figures which I am going to quote I prepared before the final trade returns for 1927 were available, and so I based them on the first nine months of the year and the first nine months of previous years.  That fact makes little difference in the conclusions, because we are not dealing with quantities; we are dealing with quantities imported in relation to the declared price of the boots.  In the year 1924, which was the year in which the tariff was imposed, the average wholesale price of boots imported into the Free State from Britain was 9/6; in 1925 it was 8/4; in 1926 it was 8/1½, and in 1927 it was 7/2.  In the year 1924, as I have said, the average price of boots imported into the Free State was 9/6. But in that same year the average price of a pair of boots exported from England to any other country in the world was 7/11¾.  In the year 1924 the British boot manufacturers had practically a monopoly of the boot trade here and were charging us a monopoly price.  They were charging us 9/6 for the boot which they were prepared to sell elsewhere for 7/11¾.  But let us examine the course of prices of British boots exported to every country in the world except the Irish Free State.  In 1924 it was 7/11¾; in 1925 it was 7/7¼; in 1926 it was 7/7¼; in 1927 it was 7/10¼.  In 1924 we found that the price of British boots imported into the Free State was 9/6, and the price of British boots sold to the rest of the world was 7/11¾.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference in price was against us, but in 1917 we find that the average price of British boots sold to the Free State was 7/2 as against 7/10¼, the price which was charged to the rest of the world.  In 1924 we were paying 1/6¼ per pair of boots more than the rest of the world were paying for the same pair of boots.  In 1925, the first year during which the tariff was in full operation, we were paying 8¾d. more. In 1926 we were paying 6¼d. more, but <Col N="930" /> in 1927, not merely were we not paying more, we were paying 8¼d. less.  Let me examine these figures.  The British price to all countries in the world except the Irish Free State, taking 1924 as a base, show that in 1925 there was a drop in price of 4.7 per cent; in 1926 a drop of 4.7 per cent., and in 1927 a drop of 1.5 per cent.  Applying these percentages to the prices charged to the Free State for British boots, taking 1924 as a base, we find the prices which would be charged to the Free State if we had to buy from England boots at the same price which England was charging the rest of the world, would be as follows: 9/6, 9/0½, 9/0½, 9/4½. The actual course of prices was 9/-, 8/4, 8/1½, 7/2.  If we add to the actual prices charged the full amount of the tariff we find that the course of prices in the Free State plus the tariff, the actual prices Irish retailers had to pay for the boots were 10/4, 9/7, 9/4 and 8/3, and by comparing these prices with the prices England charged for her boots to the rest of the world we find in the year 1924 Britain bore 3½d. of the full tariff of 1/4½.  In 1925 she bore 9¾d., in 1926 she bore 1/0¾, in 1927 she paid 2/6, which represents the entire amount of the tariff plus a bonus of 1/1¼ per pair.  Does that indicate that the price charged by Irish boot manufacturers has increased by almost the entire amount of the tariff?  Does it not indicate the contrary?  Does it not indicate that Britain which had a monopoly of the boot trade in this country in 1924 now finds that she has to fight for the very existence of her trade, and has to accept in Ireland prices much lower than she can secure for the same commodities throughout the rest of the world?</P>
    <P>Do these figures not in themselves prove what I have said is correct and that Irish boot manufacturers as a result of the tariff are able to sell their boots at less than what they sold them before they were protected?  Do these figures, even if the agricultural workers of this State still persist in buying imported boots, not prove that they are able to buy them at less now than they were before the industry was protected? How then, has the imposition of a tariff on boots increased the burden on agriculture? The Minister took that industry <Col N="931" /> as an example; he based his whole argument on what happened to that industry, and obviously advanced that argument without having considered the facts, and if, as I think, these figures prove conclusively that his facts are wrong and that the protection afforded to the boot industry did not increase the burden on agriculture, then we trust he will go to his Executive Council and get them to endeavour to change their policy and give Irish industries a chance to survive before it is too late.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputies that in many cases the end is almost in sight. I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce some time ago to supply me with a list of manufacturing concerns in this State which, during the last four years, had been forced to close down.  The list covered three or four pages of foolscap.  Factory after factory, industry after industry, has gone to the wall, and for the last year or a year and a half there have been crowding around the doors of Merrion Street and around the door of the Tariff Commission representatives of important Irish industries asking for the protection they know will mean the survival of their industries and not getting it. And they also are going slowly&mdash;flour-milling, coach-building, woollen mills, the paper mills&mdash;all are going.  The number of factories engaged in these industries now in the Free State is much less than the number engaged when the Ministry first came into office. It is because of their timorous policy that these things are happening; it is because they have not got a fair grasp of the facts and are basing their policy on wrong conclusions that we see unemployment widespread through the country, and twenty thousand to thirty-five thousand of the best of our manhood fleeing every year, seeking in America the employment they are unable to get here.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister for Finance will give these matters his serious consideration, and that he will realise, no matter what he may say to the contrary, that they are, in fact, working upon a half-baked policy which is at variance with the facts.  If we can get a start even now in reviving industrial <Col N="932" /> production in this State, we would be able, I believe, in a very short time to produce a very different set of circumstances from that which now exists. There is still enough vitality left in the State to make a complete revival possible once a start is made, but if we are faced with this non possumus attitude of the Ministry, this timorous dealing with important facts, then the last hopes of Irish industrialists are slowly disappearing.  I hope in time we will be able to convince, if not the Government or the majority in this House, the Irish people, that prosperity for them lies along the same road that the people of practically every other nation took. We are not a nation apart, that the policy which succeeded in Germany, America, Canada, New Zealand and Australia must fail in Ireland.  People who can advance as serious arguments statements of that kind surely should not to be entrusted with the guidance of our national policy.  The economic laws which prevail in this country are identical with the laws that prevail elsewhere, and the solution to similar problems which were found elsewhere should also apply here.  Therefore, I trust, even at this stage, before the House votes on account a sum of seven and a half million pounds to this Government, that they will demand from the Government a statement of policy that will be in closer relation to the situation than that which was given to us.  If they cannot get that policy, I hope they will refuse this vote on account, as an indication of their disapproval of the Government's attitude.</P>

      <P>If there is one person in this House who has a perfectly open mind upon the subject of tariffs it is myself.  If there is one man who comes to the investigation of tariffs purely and simply as an investigator I think it is myself.  I regard tariffs as just one of the bottles on the shelf, one of the packages in the national larder, out of which will be combined by the national chemist&mdash;the national house-keeper&mdash;that food and that tonic which are required to put industry upon its feet.  It is in that spirit of one who has nothing to say for tariffs because they are tariffs, and has nothing whatever to say for any economic expedient because it just happens to be that economic  <Col N="933" /> expedient that I think this House is entitled to resent&mdash;I think this is the first time I have used any language of that kind in relation to financial discussions&mdash;the treatment which the House has received from the Minister for Finance when he was asked for information in relation to these matters. He delivered the bald statement the other day that some commodities had increased in price to the community, due to tariffs, and that some had failed, and I, as one imagining that the Minister for Finance, in possession of the whole resources for investigation of facts in this country, must know his facts in relation to a matter which came precisely under his jurisdiction, asked him for information as to the number of industries in which prices had increased to the community.  I thought I would have got three or four definite articles which had increased, and which he knew had increased, as the result of investigation.  I thought I would have got, and I was entitled to get after that statement by the responsible head of the Finance Department, two or three specific instances where it had not increased.  Instead of that I got a vague general statement on the subject of tariffs, which has opened up this particular discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, what I am going to say is this: that in relation to his statement concerning the boot tariff, the Minister for Finance was either saying what he knew to be false or what he was privatively ignorant in not knowing was false.  Ignorance is of three kinds. Pure nescience, the things you do not know, and privative ignorance, ignorance of the things which, in all the circumstances, you ought to know.  I say that the Minister for Finance said to this House, speaking as Minister for Finance, that in relation to specific articles some had increased in cost and some had not increased in cost.  In making that statement, without the knowledge on which he based the facts, he was speaking in privative ignorance.  I went to a good deal of trouble, exactly in the spirit of an investigator, to try to find the truth in this matter.  I investigated the whole of the facts which were available to anyone examining this simply as a statistical problem, and the facts set <Col N="934" /> out by Deputy Lemass.  If statistical information is to be taken as settling this issue, then the issue is settled in relation to the boot tariff, that not merely has the proportion to the extra profit which was being obtained per unit in Ireland due to their commanding financial position here been taken away, not merely has the amount of the tariff which has been added to the price of the goods been taken away, but that some of the ordinary profit, as distinct from the surplus and bonus profit, due to a privileged position, has been taken away.  If the Ministry were in a position to produce to the House figures as good on the side of the statement that has been made by the Minister for Finance as figures which we have been able to produce on the side of proving the Minister for Finance's statement was wrong, he would have produced them.  As far as the statistical case goes, it goes by default, and it goes to the knowledge of the Minister for Finance by default unless he is culpably, privatively ignorant of the facts in this matter, on which he presumes to speak with the authority of his office in the State and the Government he represents.</P>
    <P>In the &ldquo;Economic Quarterly Journal&rdquo; of June 27, by a very reputable economic investigator there is an article which is within the knowledge of his Department, in which the general tendency which has been developed in Deputy Lemass's speech was shown to be beginning and was carried up to 1927, when the statistical case was against the Minister for Finance.  It is within my knowledge that Government Departments which have come in any relation to these facts are in possession of the developed knowledge which has been offered to them by Deputy Lemass.  All I am saying for the moment is that the statistical case, if you are to rely on it, is overwhelming, and I will not rely on it.  That case I put to a meeting here in Dublin, and, having given those facts and figures, I said that case from a statistical point of view is too overwhelming to be true, and I was driven back to investigate this case actually in the factories and in the shops.  There has been a certain change in the nature of the goods which are brought under this particular <Col N="935" /> heading, and, while the change in the nature of the goods is not sufficient &mdash;I had no evidence that it is sufficient to upset the statistical case as shown&mdash; it is enough to make it necessary for us to try to find, by actual detailed investigation, whether or not it is substantially true.</P>
    <P>My method was to go to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and ask them for precisely the information which ought to be in the possession of the Minister for Finance before he could have truthfully and honestly made the statement which he made to this House, but the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had not got it.  The facts upon which, and only upon which, the Minister for Finance could honestly have based the statement he made did not exist within the knowledge of his Department and of his Government.  So we are up against the fact that, not merely did the Minister for Finance speak in privative ignorance, but that he is openly and deliberately guessing at things he ought to ascertain.  I asked them to get those facts, and their answer was that they had no means; they had no machinery, and the staff were otherwise occupied.  They had not got the facts upon which the Minister for Finance based his statement, and they had not the machinery to get them, but the Minister for Finance could make a statement without the facts and in face of the statistical information which was available.  Is that the sort of way in which you think that you can carry on Government in this country?  Is that the sort of responsibility with which you can envisage economic policy, when those who ought to know do not know and do not try to know, and them, in open, deliberate and blatant ignorance of the facts, misstate the facts in spite of the statistical evidence which is available?</P>
    <P>If that is the kind of responsibility which lies behind the statements that the boot tariff has increased the cost of boots, you know how much reliance to put upon any of the statements of an economic or statistical nature that you get from the present Minister for Finance.  Now what I did was this: I recognised that there were two classes <Col N="936" /> of boots being made by Irish factories, one in which, broadly speaking, they were experienced and had a good deal of knowledge.  That was the general class of working boots for ordinary people.  I knew that they had a good deal of training and a good deal of experience, as well as a considerable output in that matter.  There was another kind of boot which they were not making to any considerable extent, and that was fancy boots for women.  I said that if we find any lack at all it will be on that side, but that here we will take as our test case the worst case from the point of view of the Irish boot manufacturer.  We will take the thing in which he has the lowest output, of which he has the smallest experience, and in which he is up against the greatest difficulty, the difficulty of meeting a variety trade.  I got boots made by firms across the water which were being bought as best sellers, which were being sold even by those factories in their retail shops as the best value that one could buy for money and as good sellers.  I got the same boot made, imitated if you like, by those factories, boots so exactly alike that, apart from my opinion of the difference of apparent quality and finish, no one could have told one from the other.  I got from the firms the actual wholesale prices which they paid for those imported boots, exclusive of the tariff.  I got from those firms the actual price of the boots as they were sending them out to the wholesaler.  I put those in a sealed envelope and brought the whole lot, boots and invoices, to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  I said: &ldquo;Take those two boots as a sample and send them for any examination you like.  We want them cut up and hacked and we want to know whether the Irishman is producing as good a boot and whether he is producing a boot at as good a price.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That investigation went on, with the whole information sealed, in the possession of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  When that investigation was completed&mdash;it is the only information of a detailed kind which, as far as I know, can be in the possession of the Minister for Finance&mdash;this was the verdict: That the Irish boot was built of better quality stuff throughout, and <Col N="937" /> that in every place in which inferior material&mdash;good enough, but relatively inferior&mdash;could be used, the better material was used in the Irish boot, and that the actual price of the boot delivered to the Irish wholesaler from an Irish factory in that exceptional commodity, chosen deliberately to be the most difficult one for them to produce economically, the Irish factory was sending out a boot which was delivered to the wholesaler, quality and price taken together, without any single cent. of the tariff added to the price, and as a matter of fact for a certain amount less than the nett price of equal quality goods imported into this country without a tariff.  This information is in the possession of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I am going to carry this further by bringing to the Ministry for Industry and Commerce the boot on the extreme left of that, the boot which is used by the farmer and the farm labourer in the field.  I will put up against it the best boot that England can produce for the same purpose, and now, before this thing is investigated; I am prepared to back in any sum you like that the statements that I have made in relation to these extreme cases, women's fancy boots, will prove to be true in relation to the Cork factory making boots in relation to ordinary footwear for the ordinary man.  I am prepared to stand over that statement now before the investigation is made in any amount if anyone likes to take it up.  That is a distinctly better line to take than that adopted by the Minister for Finance, who, in culpable and privative ignorance of the facts, chooses for the purpose of bolstering up his political argument, to libel the trade and commerce of his own country.</P>
    <P>We asked him had tariffs increased the cost of blankets?  He did not know. I know.  Has it increased the cost of margarine?  I do not know whether he knows or not.  I do say in relation to these things that are manufactured under a tariff within my knowledge, where I can have access to the books and know what is going on, that to my amazement, having regard to the smallness of the economic unit with which we are working and the difficulties under which we are producing, there is <Col N="938" /> no evidence in relation to Cork-made boots, Cork-made blankets, and Cork-made margarine to bolster up the statement made by the Minister for Finance that the tariff has increased the cost of boots, or increased the cost of tariffed articles.  I would have expected that it would, if I was only engaged in an argument.  I think this House knows that I have never said a word in favour of tariffs as tariffs.  I come to them as an investigator.  I want the facts, and I have gone to more trouble to find out the facts in relation to this than the whole Ministry of Finance apparently has done before it stood over a statement libellous and slanderous.  Deputy MacEntee has painted a very difficult picture of the present rate of the inflow of income.  If we take it statistically, the position ought to give us very great cause for fear.  If what has gone on up to the present continues, the next Budget is going to be calamitous and even more dishonest than the present one.  Perhaps it will be calamitous in both cases, because it will have to be obviously calamitous.</P>
    <P>I say deliberately that I am not going to judge the revenue now.  I hope things are not as bad as they look, and they look very bad, but for the moment we are entitled to hope that there will be such a change as to put a different complexion on the case.  Remember that dragging in assets as income, though it may make things more comfortable for the Minister for Finance at the moment, does not represent any improvement so far as the outlook of the State is concerned.  He is taking in either the proceeds of token coinage, or something in lieu of the proceeds of token coinage, and calling it income. He has no more right to call it income than if he sold the seats in this Dáil and called the proceeds income.  He is anticipating his revenue of next year and calling it into this year.  That is a sort of thing an ordinary clerk would be sacked for.  Even if we do begin to fill up the vacant places in the Budget in that way, it may make things a little more comfortable on the surface for the Minister for Finance, but it will not hide from any discerning man the fact that the position is bad and dangerous, because it is in the hands of those who to-day control.  We had <Col N="939" /> the outlook upon these matters by the Minister for Finance in his speech the other day when he spoke of insurance. He did not want the help of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Faced with a beginning of the tackling of the really serious fundamental economic problem of this country, the problem of getting control of ancillary services, he does not want the help of the Dáil.  He does not want anybody to give him ideas.  He has no thought of any other portion of the House, no consideration, no knowledge.  They may have loyal help they are prepared to give in binding public opinion behind them in the difficult effort with which he is faced.  None of that is required by the Minister for Finance. Alone he can do it.  I do not believe that alone he can do it.  I do not believe that the two front Benches of this House combined, I do not believe the support of every member of this House, I do not believe the organised support of the whole public opinion of this country behind him will make the task he has got easy.  I know he is making the solution impossible when he treats offers of help with impertinence. &ldquo;The land can support no more people.&rdquo;  That is a sentence of death which, under the regime of his colleague the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Finance has delivered on this Budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture and the leader-writer of the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; a very able man, form a combination which stands for this country dependent upon a single industry, and that industry cannot support any more people&mdash;the permanent condition of a little poverty-stricken, hard-driven, small people living upon the verge of starvation in bad times, and just on the right side of it in good times.  But the Minister for Finance does not want any help or assistance.  His Government does not want any help or assistance from any man on these benches, or any man in the country, or anybody outside himself, in tackling the problem of how to get this country out of the grip of probably £60,000,000,000 fighting to keep her where she is.</P>
    <P>The insurance grip which holds this country&mdash;I am not blaming them for it; they are doing their own work&mdash;have <Col N="940" /> behind them £1,000,000,000 of reserves, and the Minister for Finance, who wants to get out of their maw one and a half millions every year, does not think he needs any more help than that of his own two hands.  The man who told the banks of this country that he had a shot left in the locker for them did not look for any help then.  He did not look for the only help which would have enabled him to say it safely, the help of united public opinion, and he comes in here a few hours after, crawling and unsaying all that he has said, and he is crawling since as the price of that impertinence. Their strength was unfortunately greater than his own, and he was prepared to set up a Bankers' Commission to deal with everything that the ordinary commercial man in this community ought to have knowledge of, and he accepted from those banks the definite instruction that no one should appear on that Commission except their own representatives.</P>

Can the policy of the Minister for Finance, that the land can support no more people, stand up to the policy of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, who says that any attempt to do anything outside that&mdash;well, it may happen, but he has nothing to do with it? He wants all the money for agriculture, all the money for that land which, according to the Minister for Finance, cannot perform its primary duty of supporting the people.  The Minister for Finance knows as well as I do that all the twaddle about concentrating on the standard of comfort that he talked was twaddle.  We are coming to a Recess, and during that Recess all the wisdom, all the initiative, and all the capacity to tell the truth which is represented by the Front Bench opposite is to be concentrated upon our problems.</P>

      <Col N="941" /> There is no man in this House who is entitled, upon the evidence which has been offered to him to-day, to believe any statement that emanates from the Minister for Finance.  And, in spite of that, for as long as they do remain there, for as long as they are a Government, in every good thing they attempt to do we will help them; in every problem which they have to face, any knowledge, or information, or ideas, which we have will be freely given to them, careless who does the work, so long as the work is done; careless who gets the credit so long as the work is well done.  It is time that they recognised that a section of this country, however big, can never get this country out of the difficulties into which sectionalism has thrown it.  It is time that this Government recognised that they must get behind and above all unpopular policies which are for the benefit of this country, and again all through that, as long as they are there, we will help them to clear up the mess that they have made; we will give them any assistance they like, and their self-sufficiency, their lack of frankness and their incapacity will not prevent us from doing our share in trying to clear up the mess of which three, four or five years of this misgovernment has reduced this country.</P>

      <P>There is no answer from the opposite benches.  I waited to see if someone would rise to speak, but even the Minister for Finance now leaves the Chamber.  Such is their interest in the crisis with which the country is faced at present.  We are rising to-day for a Recess of some months, and throughout that Recess the emigration, the fruits of rotten government, of unnational government, will continue.  All our efforts in this House are futile from the national point of view; from the point of view of the poor people of Ireland.  It has been pointed out by Deputy MacEntee that there is every indication of a deficit in the Exchequer. How will the Minister for Finance meet that deficit?  Will he explain to us what particular method he proposes to adopt?  Will he come to us in six months', nine months', or a year's time in a state of panic, with some legislation to cut down the social services <Col N="942" /> or to increase taxation, or will he float another loan, on the basis of international finances, which we will have to pay for at exorbitant terms?  Some of those methods he will have to adopt. In the meantime, while the deficit continues he will have to go from month to month working upon short-term loans from the banks.  From his point of view, the best thing that can be said of him is that he is working on a hand-to-mouth policy.</P>
      <P>But surely his knowledge of the history of this country is such that when he sees certain evil fruits produced by a particular system he must argue back to the causes.  If he consults history he will find that in every case, whether in the seventeenth, eighteenth, or nineteenth century, the same economic causes created the same economic results, and behind it was the jealousy and the hostility of the British economic policy.  The key of the present situation is to be found in a phrase of Churchill's which he used about the period of the civil war in 1922.  He said: &ldquo;There are other sanctions besides military sanctions; there are economic sanctions,&rdquo; using the word &ldquo;sanction&rdquo; in its legal sense of punishment.  That is the economic system imposed by England upon this country through the medium of a supine Government.  I wish to speak with all charitableness of that Government. I will go so far as to say that it does not see clearly on this question, because I do not believe that at least some of the men that I knew in the old fight could have changed so much.  A wise man once said that do as he may, a man cannot entirely rid himself of God.  I am inclined to believe that there are men in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party who, do what they will, cannot entirely rid themselves of nationality.</P>

      <P>Or charity.  Charity is a practical thing, and I, for my part, am always willing, if I see a man who did wrong yesterday turning round and doing right to-day, to clap him on the back and forget the past.  If tomorrow the Government was to adopt a really national policy in reference, first of all, to the financial agreements, <Col N="943" /> telling England that we are not able to pay these annuities, which are really an Imperial contribution, and re-open that settlement, reduce whatever extravagance can be reduced, and examine the whole tariff proposals from the point of view of putting an embargo on the entry of everything that can be made in Ireland, shutting out the British competitor at least until such time as we are able to live ourselves, and, further than that, to examine closely what would be a really national policy on the question of credit, we would be prepared to assist them.  They cannot, at this stage, be ignorant of the views propounded by a great authority&mdash;Keynes&mdash;on the question of credit.  It is now some years since he pointed out that, by the restriction of credit, a particular result was produced, and that was that the reduction of initiative and industry had the consequent result of unemployment. That was done side by side with the attempt to reduce wages in England, and at the same time it had a similar effect in Ireland, because it reduced production in Ireland, and in that way was one of the big factors in causing emigration through unemployment. The Government should realise that the farmers in Ireland to-day are in almost exactly the same condition as they were in when they were paying rack-rents.  There was a time in Ireland when rents adjusted themselves on the basis of tithes&mdash;one tenth of the harvest&mdash;and that worked out in a more humane way than the present system, because at least it adjusted itself to the bad years as well as to the good years.  That is not so now.  I have it on the authority of farmers of considerable experience that if you take the outgoings of farmers to-day you will find that what they pay out corresponds almost identically with the amounts that they paid in the rack-renting days of long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are apt to shrug their shoulders at the attitude we take up in pointing out that there is behind this a British economic policy.  But one of the qualities of that economic policy in England is, and has always been, to make it out to be a sort of providence, a natural law, and that this natural <Col N="944" /> law is simply in the ordinary course of nature exhausting the population of Ireland.  If we look back we find it is not the natural law at all.  As I said before in this House, one of the most striking things that occurred at the meeting of the First Dáil was, when each Deputy got up and pointed to his own constituency, where during the nineteenth century so many homesteads had been wiped out of existence, and so many inhabitants driven out of the country owing to the policy of Great Britain in Ireland.  The policy which reigns now is exactly the same, and produces exactly the same results, and unless the Government is prepared to shake off its present attitude, turn around and do the strong thing, the national thing, this country will go on drifting to the very edge of bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>A nation shows itself in its greatest strength when it is on the defence. That was true in Ireland during the conscription crisis.  We are now up against something that is not so picturesque, that is not so nerve-racking, but that is insidious, and that is bad for the nation, and if the Government could take up a proper attitude, could use all its organs of propaganda instead of allowing them to be used for denationalising purposes; if it would co-operate with us in a policy of bringing home to the Irish people the real crisis that is there, and put the nation on its defence we could have a bloodless victory in this country, which would be something corresponding to the sacrifice made by men like Terence MacSwiney.</P>

      <P>There are a few points in connection with Section 2 of this Bill that I want to deal with briefly.  It empowers the Minister for Finance to borrow, and in view of the general fall in revenue this year, and the increased expenditure, it is evident that at the end of a short period the annual debt charges will overpower this State.  It has been already pointed out from these benches that there are ways of finding revenue.  The particular point that I wish to deal with now is this: Is it not ludicrous that the State should give over to the banks a free <Col N="945" /> gift of the note issue of six and a half millions, and go to them then periodically to borrow money at five or six per cent?  My suggestion is that the note issue should be administered by a public board responsible to the citizens, and that the profit should go towards the relief of taxation.  If Churchill in England brought in a Bill in the morning giving a note issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is quite evident from this section of the Bill that there is no financial independence in this State.  When the credit of the State is controlled by powers who are hostile to any advancement here there can be no progress where that is so.  You can have the same form of political independence that Liberia and Nicaragua have, or any of those States whose economic policy is administered through America.  You can have that kind of political independence.  You have it. But until you have financial independence there will be no economic progress here.  I must protest against your ruling in this matter, because the particular things I had to say were very <Col N="946" /> relevant to the whole matter.

      <P>As the Minister for Local Government happens to be present, and as his Department may be considering the question of motor taxation between now and the beginning of the year, I would like to bring to his notice a matter that is becoming more and more important in every country. I refer to the question of allowing some reduction in the tax on old motor cars. I believe that the French Government, some time ago, agreed to allow a reduction of 50 per cent. on cars five years old and over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>It has something to do with the Department of Local Government. My point is that we are wasting important assets, and I suggest it has something to do with the Central Fund Bill, that through the policy of the Department of Local Government very important assets are being wasted.  If I am able to show that thousands of motor cars which are imported here at a very high cost to the State are scrapped after being used for six or eight years simply because of the high taxation placed upon them, while they could give another six or seven years' service if the tax were modified, I submit that is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the French Government some time ago made a reduction of fifty per cent. on cars five years old and over.  The British Government, through the Chancellor, have recently signified their interest in it, and promised to give the question very careful consideration before the next Budget.  It cannot be anything like as important for any of these countries as it is for this, because they are manufacturing countries, and if a car is scrapped it means that their own manufacturers <Col N="947" /> are getting the advantage of it.  We import cars at a very high cost, and it surely should be to the interest of the State to get the fullest possible advantage out of them.  Yet, in spite of the frequent appeals which have been made to the Government, they have never shown any desire to consider that point of view.  At present every garage in the country, as well as many out-houses belonging to private people, are full of cars which are still worth a considerable amount of money for transport purposes, but because of the very high tax levied upon them the owners will not use them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  I might not advocate any legislation in connection with the matter.  I could leave out that part and still deal with the waste of national assets.  To suggest how to avoid that waste cannot be very much out of order.  However, I have brought the matter under notice, and I hope the Government, since they presumably desire to make the fullest use of the country's assets, will give it some attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with transport that ought to receive attention, if the stories which are going around be true, that is, the diversion of traffic from the port of Dublin to the port of Belfast.  Last Thursday, in connection with the Dublin cattle market, several people had to send their cattle to England via Belfast owing to want of boats in Dublin.  One very important salesman refused to do so and insisted upon a special boat being provided. It would be very serious if this is to be general&mdash;if the shipping interests in Dublin conspire to divert traffic which rightly belongs to Dublin, to divert it at great expense, in spite of the great objection of consignors, and to insist upon traffic going via Belfast, which would normally go via Dublin. No one of any Party would hold that that could be right.  That it is going on to a very serious extent is borne out by figures given by the Minister for Agriculture of Northern Ireland in a speech a few days ago in connection with the visit of the delegates to the World's Dairy Congress.  He expressed the pleasure with which the Government welcomed the delegation, and went on to say that Northern Ireland was a very small part of the British Empire, but it was not unimportant as regards agriculture, as their exports of milk and butter were over £3,100,000; live stock, £5,450,000; poultry, eggs and feathers, £3,706,000.  These figures could not be correct if the Six Counties were not getting a great part of the Free State traffic.  It appears to us that <Col N="949" /> they are not entitled to get any part of that traffic, and that, so far from traffic that would be normally for Dublin being diverted to Belfast, it should be the other way about, and that, even where Belfast would be the natural route, an effort should be made to divert the traffic to Dublin port.</P>
    <P>I listened very carefully to the Minister for Finance's remarks on the Second Reading of the measure, and I must say that I thought them anything but convincing.  His defence of the Government's lack of a more intense industrial effort was certainly not borne out by the facts.  His whole defence was based on this: that if industrialisation was forced it would mean a burden on the farmers.  One would be prepared to believe that perhaps if there were not very important facts contradicting it.  There has been a great deal of talk during the past year, for instance, about a tariff for coach-building purposes&mdash;on motor bus bodies, etc.  I think the Minister would not hold that an increased tax on these would seriously affect the farmers.  I think he would not hold, no matter how high the tax was, that it was going to mean any increase of the burden on farmers.  Assuredly, there is no more glaring case at present.  Motoring undoubtedly costs the country a large amount, since practically everything connected with it has to be imported, and it would seem the first duty of any government to examine that matter, and see if there is anything that could be extracted from it for the benefit of the people, so as to reduce the big volume of imports.  They have looked, and apparently have accepted quite contentedly, the system by which probably 70 or 75 per cent. of the bus bodies in use in the country are being imported from Great Britain.  We know that the Minister made an enormous concession in his Budget when he agreed that when the chassis only was imported the importer would be allowed three months' credit, and where the body was also imported he would be allowed no credit. No doubt that was a terrible shock to people like the Associated Daimler Company, who have only a capital of five or six millions behind them.  I have no doubt they had very sleepless nights over that terrible attack on their interests&mdash;that <Col N="950" /> they were deprived of the three months' credit if they imported a bus body with the chassis.  If that is the spirit in which the Government is examining the different industries of the country, I do not think there is much prospect for industrial life here in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>As I said, there would be no possible burden on the farmer.  There was an old-established industry in which Irish craftsmen have shone for years and years&mdash;so much so that they were welcome in every coach-building factory. They are at the head of that industry in Australia, which, loyal Dominion though it is, established the biggest coach-making works in the world by a system of protection.  Notwithstanding all these factors in favour of it, the Government has not attempted to give it a chance here.  It is so with very many more of the industries in the country.  Frankly, I do not think that the House should be satisfied to pass this measure.  I do not think they should be satisfied, especially in view of the Minister's statement.  I hope that the vote will show that the House is not satisfied, because it is clear as the noon-day that the country is anything but satisfied.  The country is anything but satisfied that the best is being done either for the country or the town.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Minister's attempt to plead the farmer as an excuse for his rather slow pace in industrial effort in recent years, I think it could be argued that a lot of the farmer's expenses, and the expenses that he is feeling most at the present time, would be reduced if there was an industrial population in the towns that could contribute towards the social services, that could share in the upkeep of the institutions of the country, and that could share in the national taxes and in the local taxes.  If that big advantage to industry was to be put against the rather shadowy disadvantage of slightly higher prices, I feel sure the farmer would very greatly welcome industralisation.  At all events, it is rather strange to see a Government that claims to be protectionist making a present of the argument that tariffs mean high prices without apparently any real justification, because, as it has been pointed <Col N="951" /> out here, there is no justification for it in the very instances which the Minister himself quoted.  To make a present to the free trade section in this country &mdash;and they are a very vocal and powerful section still&mdash;of the argument that tariffs mean high prices, is the most extraordinary attitude for a protectionist party to adopt.  It shows completely, I think, that the Government is only protectionist from the lips out.</P>
    <P>The real explanation of the whole thing probably is that the Government has a very small majority at present. Its majority is made up, you might say, of six or eight men who favour the old system, who are traders first, and believe in importing everything possible into this country, who have no vision of an industrial Ireland and have no wish to see an industrial Ireland.  Their majority depends upon those people, and, naturally, they have to be influenced by what they desire.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may as well admit, I think, that that is the real explanation as to why industry cannot be fostered and as to why they look on so calmly at huge volumes of goods coming into this country month after month.  The people in the towns in Ireland ought to be producing these goods, and are prepared to produce. We could produce them as cheaply here as in any other part of the world. To me, at all events, it seems that as long as that state of affairs prevails, as long as the people are starving in thousands, when the work they ought to be doing for this country as a whole is done in other countries, I do not see how any Deputy can conscientiously vote for this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add to what I said in previous debates with reference to the yield of revenue during the present financial year.  It is impossible to draw, so far, a conclusion as to what the revenue yield for the entire period of the year will be.  With reference to other matters raised, I just want to say a word or two in regard to the question of boots.  When speaking on the matter previously I was making a general argument.  I was interrupted by a question and I simply quoted boots to illustrate my <Col N="952" /> argument.  I was not purporting to deal with the question in detail and I do not want to deal in detail with it now.  I will just say this: With reference to the figures quoted by Deputy Lemass, if we were to take them on their face value, and if we were to take them, as he suggests we would take them, they prove far too much; they prove so much that anybody would be suspicious, because the imposition of a tariff here clearly could not produce the results that he purports to prove to have taken place.  As a matter of fact they prove nothing. We would have to have very much more complete statistics, and statistics covering factors with which he does not deal at all, to have anything proven.  I think it was admitted by another speaker from the same benches that there had been changes in quality.  Deputy Lemass did not deal with the question of quality at all, and while I could criticise his figures more satisfactorily if I had them in print before me, I am clear that he would have to think a good deal more about the matter and get a good deal more facts together and put them into statistical form before anything at all could be proved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I have personally had experience of the effect of the boot tax in one way.  Contracts are placed periodically for supplies of boots for the Army. These boots are heavy boots, boots of the kind which firms here are well equipped to turn out.  They are very much like the heavy country boot which the factories have been turning out here.  They are, perhaps, better material in many cases, but they are that kind of boot. Prior to the imposition of the tariff, it was our custom to give up to twenty per cent. preference to the Irish manufacturers. It has been our custom, in all cases where Government contracts are given, to give some preference, which is not stated publicly, as a rule, because if it were, it would prevent the tendering being as keen as it ought to be, but it has been the practice to give some preference to the Irish manufacturer. When the tariff came on, it was decided that so far as the boots were concerned, the Irish manufacturer could have no greater preference than <Col N="953" /> the amount of the tariff.  It happened very frequently that cases were brought before me showing that the Irish manufacturers would lose the tender if we simply gave it to the lowest tender, adding 15 per cent. to the lowest outside tender for the purpose of ascertaining the amount which the Department of Defence would have to pay.  The Department of Defence were reluctant to give these tenders to outside firms, and, in many cases before the final decision was taken, they were given to me.  In a considerable number of cases I authorised a line of action which in the ordinary cases of tendering, would be somewhat objectionable. I found what the lowest English tender, plus 15 per cent., would amount to, and if that was less than the lowest Irish tender I authorised the sending of a letter to the Irish manufacturer who had sent in the tender stating that if he saw fit to reduce his tender to so much he would get the contract, otherwise it would be given outside the country.</P>
    <P>More recently the practice has been to act simply on the tenders as received, and if the Irish manufacturers' lowest tender was more than 15 per cent. over the outside tender, to let the contract go out.  Consequently, within the past year or so, I have not seen these cases of boot contracts so very much.  But since this debate was started I asked for what had happened in the most recent tenders.  Within the present year, two contracts for boots have been placed.  In one of them the lowest English tender was 16/7 per pair.  The lowest Irish tender was 18/9 per pair.  That tender was for 11,000 pairs of boots.  In that case the Irish manufacturer got the tender, because if 15 per cent. is added to 16/7 it brings it above the lowest Irish tender, namely, 18/9.  In the other case the contract was for 10,000 pairs of boots.  In that case the Irish tender was 18/2, and the lowest English tender was 15/6.  Now 15 per cent. added to 15/6 would bring it to about 17/10.  Consequently, the contract for those ten thousand pairs of boots went to the outside firm.  The experience all along that we have had in connection with the purchase of Army boots fully confirms what I have <Col N="954" /> said, that the tariff does result in the consumer here having to pay more for the boots than he would have to pay if there were no boot tariff in operation. It is a matter that if we wanted to go into in great detail would require a great deal of consideration, and it would require a great deal of preparation of the cases on both sides.  But as against those general statistics which Deputy Lemass has presented, I submit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister just a question about this 15 per cent. preference?  Does it apply generally, or is it only in boot contracts that this 15 per cent. preference is given?  If it were a contract for iron goods, or steel, or any other Irish-manufactured goods for a Government building, or a building that was subsidised by the Government, would the Irish manufacturer get a 15 per cent. preference, or is this preference only given in the case of boots?</P>

      <P>I really have not a table of statistics before me to argue this matter in detail.  I have given the figures for the last two contracts that were placed.  I am stating now that that has been the position all along, and I am proceeding to argue from that, that I suggest here we have something that is a more effective proof in relation to this matter than the series of figures which Deputy Lemass put forward. I do not know how they were made up and confessedly they have no relation at all to the quality or the type of boot.  They have simply certain average figures, and it is clear that the Irish manufacturer is so small a factor even yet in boot production that the imposition of the tariff could not possibly have had the result which Deputy Lemass purports to show.  There are people who argue that the British manufacturer in certain cases has paid the tariff imposed; that he has really lowered his prices, and that he has sent in his goods at the same price or a little over the same price, that the purchaser here would have to pay had there been no tariff.  But there is no proof of that, and the facts that we have had, the variations that we have seen in regard to prices quoted by English manufacturers for, say, Army boots show that is not so.  Sometimes the Irish firm was not able to get the contract.  More generally with the help of that 15 per cent.&mdash;I should have said not generally, but in the greater proportion of cases&mdash;the Irish manufacturer has been able to get the contract, though sometimes that only happens when the Irish manufacturer had an opportunity of offering revised prices.  I think that those are the only matters that I would wish to deal with at the present time. Deputy Moore did raise the point with reference to the taxes on motor cars that had been in use for a considerable time.  I do not agree with the point of view put forward by Deputy Moore, but a Departmental Committee has been sitting dealing with the taxation of motor vehicles, and it is probable that before the 1st January next proposals will be submitted to the Dáil with regard to the Road Tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I cannot reconcile that.  I was asked to appoint a representative on the Committee for the purpose of doing that, and I appointed a representative.  Further than that I cannot tell the Deputy.  This is a matter that is entirely apart from the question of supply services.  It is a question of whether or not we should impose a road tax with respect to the age and value of the vehicle, and not in reference to the uses of the roads by the vehicle or the damage done by the vehicle to the roads.  I do not agree that it is desirable that the changes the Deputy suggests in this matter should be adopted.  I think that they are matters to be dealt with at quite another time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, it seems to me that the Deputies on the other side in some cases, whether they admit it or not, are by way of being doctrinaire protectionists. They believe protection is always good, that the manufacturer will always play up, and that there will be no unnecessary burden, and generally no burden at all, cast on the public as a result of protection.  The experience that we have had does not show that.  There are cases in which no burden will follow the imposition of a tariff.  That could seldom happen in the case of an industry which is not big enough to supply the requirements of the country, or that cannot quickly be made big enough.  But cases have happened, and may happen, in which no burden will be imposed.  Other cases have happened in which I am most clearly of opinion that a burden has been imposed and in which there is ample evidence of that.  There have been cases in which manufacturers will <Col N="957" /> show themselves extremely alert and willing to take advantage of the opportunity offered, and there are other cases where manufacturers have not stirred at all or taken advantage of the opportunities offered them.  Consequently, the position must be admitted that the effects of imposing tariffs will be very uneven.  Sometimes entirely good results can be obtained by the imposition of a tariff, and in other cases you get no results commensurate with the disturbance and expense thrown on the public.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies opposite have a policy it does seem to be that if a tariff is advocated it must be supported, and if a tariff is asked for one should be granted.  When we entered on the imposition of tariffs we recognised that we had a good deal to learn about the matter; we recognised the thing was experimental in this sense, that nobody could know what response would follow the imposition of tariffs here, and it was in that sense we regarded the imposition of tariffs as experimental. There was at least one of the tariffs imposed early that most of the people who studied the matter, and who were in contact with the industry involved and the effects upon it of the tariff, described as a mistake.  There were other tariffs in connection with which we did not know whether a proper rate was or was not imposed.  It was because of that we thought it necessary to set up the Tariff Commission.  Take the case of boots.  When the tariff on boots was being imposed, my own desire was to make it twenty per cent. People who had been in touch with the boot manufacturers, the people who had been advocating a boot tariff, said that ten per cent. would suffice, and that with such a tariff the existing boot factories would expand and that new factories would be springing up.  A tariff of fifteen per cent. was imposed. It was simply a chance shot.  We could not tell from the way in which we made our investigations whether it was going to be sufficient or too much.  For these reasons we set up the Tariff Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore blames us for not having imposed certain tariffs in connection with coach building before the Tariff Commission has reported.  I <Col N="958" /> think we would have been wrong to rush in and decide one way or the other in advance of the investigation which is proceeding.  When we discovered that it was easily possible to err in the matter of tariffs, it would have been easy for us to say: &ldquo;We will have no more tariffs for three or four years, or some specified time, until the effects of the existing tariffs are clearly seen.&rdquo;  We did not feel the industrial situation in the country was such as to adopt that line.  We realised that industries which had survived until the end of the European War, and which might have survived for a long time if it had not been for the tremendous economic disturbance brought about by the European War and following it, were in great danger of extinction, and for that reason we set up a Tariff Commission.  We did not bind ourselves to accept the view of the Tariff Commission either for or against a tariff, but we did promise the Dáil not to lay proposals before it for tariffs until they had been fully investigated. I cannot think that in connection with industries there can be a sounder policy than that.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that it is a sound policy to rush ahead, having had only one side of the case heard, remembering that you cannot get an impartial statement of any case from one interested party.  If there are delays, if particular factories go out of operation, that is not necessarily a great evil in itself.  It is not necessarily a great evil that some of the weaker factories should go.  As a matter of fact, in many cases the imposition of tariffs will not prevent weaker industries going.  Generally the effect of a tariff in any industry will be to bring more capital into it, to get factories put up in the most favourable positions with modern equipment, and the result of that is most likely to be that the small factory, the closing of which Deputies deplore, will be closed all the same.  I would not rush into a tariff which will affect a whole industry simply to save one or two particular factories going out of operation.  The going out of operation of factories is a cause for hastening inquiries as much as possible, but it is not a sufficient justification for doing that without proper investigation. <Col N="959" /> Because an industry has been here in the past is no reason why we should determine in advance of investigation that that industry should be saved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say it is of no value, but world conditions may so change that an industry may not be potentially nearly as valuable as industries which have not been in existence at all.  It may not.  We know that industry was conducted on a different basis in the world in the comparatively recent past.  There was a form of distribution which does not exist to-day. There was a distribution which could not be maintained without a burden on the consumer and, without a burden on the consumer, lowering the standards of life, of preventing the standards of life developing along the lines on which they develop in other countries. Because there is not that distribution of industry, it is a fact that there may well be industries here which it is not specially desirable to maintain, and the Government neither takes the view that we should manufacture everything here that could possibly be manufactured, nor does it take the view that because there has been an industry here it should be kept here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view it takes is that we should promote industry to a reasonable extent and of a kind that could be economically carried on here.  The real object of our industrial policy is not to be self-contained, not to be able to live within a stone wall, not to be able to make everything which is made in other European countries, but to have sufficient industry to provide variety in economic life and to provide variety <Col N="960" /> of occupation and interest for the people and the means of supporting an increased population.  It we can crystallise the difference between the economic policy of the Government and that of the Party opposite it is in that way.  We do not aim at getting back to conditions which are not compatible with the form that industry has taken in the modern world.  We do not aim at getting a sort of national self-sufficiency that might have been all right when there were not the means of transport and travel that there are to-day. We recognise all these developments and improvements and the value of modern methods, of, even, mass production, and we aim in our own way at getting the advantage of them and using them.  We are aiming, therefore, not at going back to past conditions but trying to shape an economic policy and structure that will enable us to support a population comparable with the populations of other countries, and to support it without having the burden of the maintenance of an industry, which this country is not at all suitable to maintain, and which would really mean that we were going to pay for the mere luxury of making something here, something which was not essential, something which was only one of many things that we require here rather than import it from outside.</P>

      <P>As the President proposes to move the adjournment tonight I think it is very likely that he will be taking the Second Stage on October 10th.  We are not half as anxious to facilitate the President as he is to facilitate us.  We believe an important and serious measure of this kind should be carefully deliberated on and discussed before we vote on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> It is a Bill which should be allowed to stand over until after the Recess, so that public opinion on it can be ascertained and so that the Deputies could come back after the Recess fully informed as to what their constituents think about it.  I suggest to the President that it would be a wise and statesmanlike action to decide here and now to allow this Bill and the other Bills in their present stage to stand over until October 10th, and I am sure if it was in order that I should move a motion to that effect in this Dáil it would be carried almost unanimously. As, however, there seems to be little hope that the President will agree with that proposition we have to proceed with the discussion on the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I was saying yesterday, the issues raised by this Bill are two&mdash;one, should there be an age limit in respect of Senators and, secondly, if there should be an age limit, what should that age limit be?  When we talk of an age limit, of course we mean an age under which persons are not eligible for election. The existing law provides, as some Deputies are aware, that a person must be 35 or over to be eligible for election to the Seanad, and it is proposed by the Government to reduce that age from 35 to 30 years.  Upon the Second Stage the President advanced one argument in favour of it. He said, as he had learned from Deputy Dr. Ryan, a member of this Party, that the average life of an individual in the Free State was 44 years, that to fix the age limit at 35 would be therefore unwise, as it would mean that the average Senator would expire before his term of office expired.  Therefore, in order to ensure that those who are elected will, on the average, be able to give attention to their duties for the full period he considers it advisable to reduce the age to 30.  That statement was made by Deputy Dr. Ryan yesterday, but the Bill was introduced several weeks ago and was probably drafted several weeks before that. Apparently the President, who is responsible for the drafting and introduction of the Bill, had no argument in favour of it until Deputy Dr. Ryan made a speech yesterday on another Bill, because he advanced no other argument on the Bill.  He did not deal <Col N="967" /> with either of the two points the Bill raises.  Should there be an age limit, and if so, what?  Let us take the question whether there should or should not be an age limit to the Seanad.  We should ask ourselves, first, what are the advantages of having an age limit and, secondly, what are the disadvantages? I tried very hard between this and last evening to find arguments in favour of having an age limit for the Seanad.  I have not succeeded yet.  I mean an age limit under which a person is not eligible.  It may be desirable that persons who have not yet reached the age of reason or persons who have passed it should be excluded from the Seanad, but I doubt very much if you are excluding such persons by this Bill, because even though it is impossible for a child under this Bill to be elected, persons in their second childhood are quite eligible.  A number of the Front Bench members of the Government Party would be eligible beyond all shadow of doubt in consequence of that fact.  Are we wise in fixing the age limit at 30?</P>
    <P>Let us look over the history of this country; let us look over the history of the world and find whether any of the great acts that shine out in history and were performed by great men were actually performed by them while they were under or over the age of 30.  I wonder what age was Napoleon when he invaded Italy; how old was he when he commenced his Egyptian campaign? How old was he when he won the Battle of the Pyramids?  I think he was 28 or 29 years old.  If he were alive now the Napoleon who won the Battle of the Pyramids would not be eligible for election to the Seanad: he would not be wanted there; he would be unfit to be a member of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I wonder at what age was Alexander when he commenced the conquest of the world.  He was, if I remember correctly, a very young man, certainly in his twenties.  It would be, perhaps. drawing too much on the imagination of Deputies to ask them to imagine Alexander going forward as a candidate for the Seanad, but if he did he would not be eligible.  I wonder at what age did the President become a political economist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just leave it at that, because it is a moot point.  It might be contended that he has not become a political economist yet.  But when you consider history and the great men who marched through its pages, we find a large number of them who would be ineligible for election to the Seanad if they were here now, at the very age when they were accomplishing the most historic deeds of their lives.  Therefore, there seems to be a strong case against fixing the age limit at thirty, unless it is the intention of the Government definitely to exclude from the Seanad anybody who might be of any use, who might have ideas. and who might be anxious to do something. If that is their purpose, then we think the age limit should be fixed much higher than thirty.  If they fixed the age limit at sixty, seventy or eighty and said only persons over that age would be eligible, they would be able to get a House constituted in accordance with their wishes.  Of course, a number of the Senators they selected might not last for the entire period of their office.  But we can remember that there has been a number of individuals in history who lived much older than eighty or seventy years.  If Methuselah came forward at this stage for election to the Seanad he might be elected several hundred times, running for periods of nine years.  If we were to fix an age limit a little higher, say at seventy, we would have a very reliable sort of Second Chamber.  We could rely upon them not to do anything rash, we could rely on them to do nothing in a hurry, we could rely on them to take a long time to consider any Bills that came before them.  But I certainly think, when we face this difficulty as to whether we should or should not fix an age limit, we realise that a very strong case can be made out for having no age limit at all. Could we fix the age limit the other way?  Could we cut down, could we say that those under thirty would be eligible for election to the Seanad? Would not that be a wise precaution? It would involve, of course, the resignation of a number of existing Senators and would, perhaps. destroy <Col N="969" /> the last political hopes of a number of those people who are annoying us in the lobbies these days.  But at the same time we have got to consider this question from the point of view of general principle and not temporary expediency.</P>
      <P>I have come to the conclusion that the Government Party definitely regard the Seanad as a place into which they can put members of their Party who failed to secure election to the Dáil, and who have become disgruntled in consequence, because we know a number of candidates were induced to go forward at recent elections upon the strength of promises which the Government were not able, or certainly did not try, to fufil in some cases.  Some of those candidates did not get elected and, having taken the serious course now of definitely committing themselves to Cumann na nGaedheal, it is up to the Government to provide for them otherwise and, consequently, this anxiety to preserve the Seanad and to alter the methods of election so that the Government will be independent of the people and will be able to put in there any persons whom they select for the purpose.  You see, you can never rely on the people doing exactly what you want them to do, or what you expect them to do. Occasionally they get an idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, the question we have got to ask ourselves is&mdash; would it not be better if this Bill were withdrawn now and another Bill introduced abolishing the Article of the Constitution which fixes the age limit altogether, and allow any person who can pull the wires sufficiently to get elected, irrespective of whether he is old enough or young enough.  After all, when there is a limited number of Senators to be elected and when it is necessary, in the first place, to get the approval of the Party committees and, <Col N="970" /> secondly, the approval of the majority of the Dáil and Seanad, only those who are the fittest to survive will survive. Only those who are qualified, in the narrow sense of the word, will be elected.  By qualified I mean qualified to exercise the necessary influence to ensure getting a majority vote.  We have found, I think, in the past that that type of person does not necessarily make the best legislator; but, after all, we do not expect good legislation from the Seanad.  We intend them to act in accordance with the wishes of the Government. If they do not do that, no doubt the Government will introduce another series of Bills getting rid of them or altering their constitution. But seeing that we are going to have a Seanad that will be docile, in any case a Seanad the vast majority of whom will be quite prepared to back the Government in any circumstances, I do not think that any useful purpose will be served by passing this Bill.  I do not say that any useful purpose will be served by rejecting it.  It does not make much difference whether the age limit should be 30 or 35, or whether there should be any age limit.  We may propose to introduce a qualifying examination to ensure, at least, that they have passed the first stage in education, so that we could know definitely that they were able to read and write, because that would be an important qualification for Senators.  If we were satisfied that they could read and write, I think we could rely on them to carry out the rest of their work very efficiently, which merely consists of doing everything the Government tells them to do.  They do not even have to make speeches, or at least they seldom make speeches.  If there are one or two individuals who are capable of talking, and if the remainder are able to read the title of a Bill and know what way to vote, then the Seanad is constituted as we would like to see it constituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking all this into consideration, I ask the Government Party to consider this Bill seriously, and the Government to consider whether it would not be advisable to do as I have suggested, namely, to withdraw the Bill and to re-introduce it on the 10th October, of course <Col N="971" /> in a manner that would provide for the abolition of the age limit altogether. If, however, the Government is determined to fix some age limit, I think they should seriously consider the proposal contained here and get one more suited to the situation.  Yesterday, I suggested that persons between the ages of six and sixty should be declared ineligible, and that only those under six and over sixty should be allowed to go forward.  I have considered that matter over night; and now think that we might put the figures higher&mdash;under ten and over a hundred.  We would then be sure of having some people of intelligence in the Seanad, because a schoolboy aged nine or ten would know as much about the political constitution of this State as the average Senator does.  He would certainly be old enough to be able to read the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; to find out all about these matters.  If the President does not consider that suggestion feasible, I think he will find that the next best alternative would be to abolish the age limit altogether. The proposal contained in this Bill is indicative of the fact that the Government did not consider the matter before they introduced it.  Apparently they just said that there should be an age limit.  &ldquo;We had one before and we might as well have one again.&rdquo;  The Committee seemed to think the same, and consequently the proposal was handed over to the draftsman and the Bill was introduced.  The Bill was presented to this House without a single argument being advanced in support of it, until Deputies on this side supplied members on the opposite side with arguments. The Government immediately availed of the arguments that we put forward, and spoke against them, in order to pretend that they were a responsible Government.  The Bill, of course, will be passed.</P>

      <P>One thing, at all events, of which I am convinced is this: that the fate of this Bill is not going seriously to affect the future of this country.  I was not always of that opinion, but I am now.  I have had an <Col N="972" /> opportunity of tapping public opinion concerning this.  I find that 95 per cent. of the people do not know that such a Bill is before the Dáil at all, and the remaining 5 per cent. do not care whether it is or not.  They do not seem to worry whether Senators are over thirty-five or over sixty-five.  I found no one concerned with the fact that there was a Seanad in existence at all.  It is easy, therefore, to understand the indifference with which members of the Dáil take this Bill, in view of the fact that the people are not concerned about it.  Deputies know that no matter how they vote in connection with this Bill it will not affect one single vote in their constituencies.  Perhaps some of the wild and reckless members of Cumann na nGaedheal might decide, when this Bill goes to a vote, actually to go into the lobbies against it.  They would thereby get to know what it feels like to vote against the Government. I can tell them that it is rather an exhilarating experience&mdash;the fact that they know that the fate of the nation is hanging on this.  As they come down the stairs from the Lobby waiting to see the Tellers report the result of the count, they can say to themselves: &ldquo;I wonder did my vote do it,&rdquo; and it might have done it.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Sullivan wisely remarks, it might not.  At any rate they could enjoy the experience in regard to a Bill of this kind because the Bill does not matter a cent.  It makes very little difference whether it is passed or not.  It is possible, of course, that the President or some member of the Government has some particular candidate for the Seanad in mind whom he is anxious to facilitate, and that that is the only reason why the Bill is introduced.  Personally no one who appeared to be under the age of fifty approached me canvassing me for my vote.  They all appeared to be over that age, and some of them seemed to be beyond the years in which one would expect they would take any interest in politics at all.  Recently we had a discussion here about the evils of canvassing.  We are getting a very practical demonstration of that these <Col N="973" /> days.  Whether it is an evil or not it is certainly a nuisance.  Perhaps I might take this opportunity of making myself immune by announcing that I will not vote for anyone who canvasses me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Except by way of interruption. The President, of course, made some interjections.  If Deputies are of opinion that a Bill to amend the Constitution, that sacred document of which we cannot alter a single word <Col N="974" /> or comma, should be passed through the Dáil without discussion just because some members want their holidays, then of course that gives us an entirely new outlook upon things.  It is our view that any Bill should be adequately discussed before it is passed.  I think that a Bill to amend the Constitution might safely be postponed for a considerable period, so that Deputies would have an opportunity of reading up all the authorities on the matter, and so that they could discuss the question with their minds fully informed.</P>
      <P>I wonder if any of the Deputies opposite who have studied the authorities on this matter could tell us if there is an age limit in the United States, or in France, or in any other State in which there is a Second Chamber, and what has been the experience of these countries?  If there is a case to be made in respect of this Bill it should be made in relation to the experience of mankind on this matter, but apparently there is not. Deputies did not know what the Bill is about until I told them, even though it only consists of six lines, and yet they expect it to go through without advancing arguments against it.  If arguments occur to us in favour of the Bill we will support it, and if the balance of the arguments in its favour is greater than those against it we will support it, but in view of its unimportant nature we find it difficult to get arguments either for or against it.  If information were supplied to us, perhaps in view of the fact that our minds are open upon this question, the President or some member of the Government would find it possible to get unanimity concerning the Bill if a case were put forward for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely they must have some case for it.  It must have come before a meeting of the Cumann na nGaedheal, or a Cabinet meeting and have been decided upon, and if decided upon somebody must have said why.  They may have said: &ldquo;We may as well have this Bill.  What harm will it do?&rdquo;  If that is so let us know.  If they have no case in support of it why did they introduce it? We are anxious not to waste the time of the Dáil for we understand there are more important Bills on the Order <Col N="975" /> Paper.  The other five Constitution Amendment Bills the Government hope to pass to-night are of a much more serious nature than this one, and will, I trust, be discussed at greater length. It may be the Government will have some arguments in support of this, and that they will give them.  This Bill is not important and it does not matter whether it passes or not.  If it is possible to secure the withdrawal of the Bill in order to give the Government the opportunity of considering whether there should be an age limit, we will facilitate them.  If we are to have an age limit it does not matter whether it is thirty or thirty-five.  I am speaking to my amendment to the Bill, which proposes that this Bill should be postponed for twelve months. I think in view of the fact that this Bill is by no means urgent an amendment of that kind could be usefully supported by Deputies.  There will be an election within twelve months for one-third of the Seanad, but it does not matter whether the age limit is thirty or thirty-five, for, as far as I can see, they are all centenarians who are going forward.  There are also other amendments to the Bill.  They have not been moved and I understand they are all being taken together.  There is one by Deputy MacEntee.  It is that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Bill be not further considered as it is the opinion of the Dáil that there should be no change in the age of eligibility for membership of Seanad Eireann until a Special Committee of eleven (11) members of the Dáil, to be selected by the Selection Committee, has inquired into and reported on the amendment of the Constitution as a whole.</P>
    <P>We have already stated that in our view it is unwise to treat such a document as the Constitution as the Government have treated it.</P>

A Bill of a similar nature was introduced here, and it was declared by a majority of the House to be immediately necessary for the preservation of peace and order in the Free State.  Perhaps the Government may think the same regarding this Bill, and in that case I would be glad if they said so.  There may be a revolution in several parts of the country at the proposal to reduce the age limit for Senators from thirty-five to thirty, but I cannot think of any district that would be seriously concerned about it.  If it be not immediately <Col N="977" /> necessary for the preservation of peace and order, or if it be not immediately necessary for any other reason, the amendment to postpone it for twelve months should be accepted.

      <P>I am not in favour of reducing the age limit from thirty-five to thirty, but as I understand it was recommended by the Joint Committee, I leave it at that.  We are leading the country to believe that the Seanad is to be a staid, sober body, and to be a check in a way on an exuberant and irresponsible Dáil.  For that purpose I think that people of thirty-five have more mature judgment than people of thirty.  I wish the Government would do something at the other end.  As far as I can see, there is no reason why a centenarian cannot be elected to the Seanad.  I think when we are going next November to put 19 or 20 people into salaried positions the Government might consider whether they should not have an age limit.  I do not want to treat the matter with levity, but I think no one should be put forward for the Seanad after the age of seventy, or should be allowed to remain in the Seanad after the age of seventy-five.  I do not know if the Government has considered that, but it is a sensible suggestion. When we are electing people to the Seanad it should be ensured that they would give some return in service. It is possible for a person to be elected next November and to get £360 a year for nine years, and put in no appearance at the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I rise to support Deputy Lemass's amendment.  Deputy Murphy said that he was not anxious to proceed with a certain amount of jocularity, and I am anxious also to be accepted as wishing to treat the subject with reasonable seriousness.  For the last few days I was very much interested in the Dentists Bill, and the one thing that was outstanding in that Bill, the one thing that the Minister for Industry and Commerce hammered away at, was that to be eligible for the examination men must have attained 28 years of age, subsequently increased to 31, with certain other qualifications, one of them being a certain number of years of service in that profession. Here we have a body of legislators who are getting extra powers under other Bills that are going through the House, and instead of increasing their age qualification we are setting out to reduce it.  We are giving them extra powers and then we are making it possible to put those powers into the hands of younger men.  I believe if we are to have a Seanad at all, and if we are to try to make that Seanad suitable for the purposes that some people think it should perform&mdash;as a cooling chamber for hasty legislation, and for sending to this House new ideas with regard to Bills, an instance of which we had today&mdash;I think we should only expect to get that properly from men who would be above, on the average, the age that is proposed in this Bill, under which we would have Senators of from 30 to 40 years, because they would grow older after they are elected.  I believe some reason should be given as to why the age should be 30.  This House might be better if some of its members were older&mdash;I say that quite seriously&mdash;but unfortunate circumstances in this country have brought about a situation in which young men have had to take on their shoulders responsibilities that older men could not take.  That is the reason why we have men here younger than are ordinarily found in other Parliaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that the Government should give us one reason as to why they want this change from 35 to 30 <Col N="979" /> years, and if they are going to change at all, why they should specify 30 years.  In every walk of life you will find certain age limits set for certain responsibilities, and if the Seanad is going to be all that the President suggested it will be after this change is brought about.  I believe that that would be more likely if the Senators were not under a certain age.  If there is to be a change at all, it should be upwards rather than downwards.  I will go this far: I say that if a reason was put forward for this change, a reason that they could stand over, the opposition on this side might be withdrawn. This is not a matter that could properly be described as one of political contention; it is a matter of common sense.  Give us a reason and we might consider it.  But you are putting through a Bill without giving us any reason for it at all.</P>
    <P>I believe that the age limit of thirty-five was really fixed because you could not ordinarily find people under that age who would have lived long enough to give the services to the State which would entitle them to be elected.  We now have abolished election and we are practically coming down to selection, and still we try to pretend that only persons who have rendered service to the State will be put into that body. Yet we are reducing the age.  I believe that if you want to get a proper body of men they should certainly be over thirty-five years of age on the average. I invite the President or the Minister for Local Government to say what the reason for this change is.  If they were to do so they might save a great deal of time and get the Second Reading passed.  If they would give us a reason we would be able to consider it in some light.  At present I oppose this Bill because I believe that Senators would not be properly qualified if you bring the age limit down to thirty years, keeping in mind the type of body that the Seanad is supposed to be.  You have had the same request already from Deputy Lemass.  Who has invited you to put before the House reasons as to why you consider there is any necessity for altering the Constitution in this way, and I would seriously ask the Minister for Local <Col N="980" /> Government, if the President does not wish to do so, to give us some reason for this proposed change in the age.</P>

      <P>The only argument in support of this Bill which I gathered from the President&mdash;apart from the argument which he picked up in passing from Deputy Ryan&mdash;which he considered in any way important was that Deputy de Valera had suggested an age limit of thirty in the Committee.</P>

      <P>Well, there is a thing called a monkey gland, which you will have heard of.  It is a very valuable and a very useful thing.  But supposing you apply it to the wrong person? Supposing you apply it to somebody who is a public nuisance instead of to somebody who would be of great utility, what is your attitude on the question?  Monkey gland in your case is being applied to the wrong person. It would be an excellent thing if the Seanad were a valuable body.  Then if it were a question of reducing the age limit it would be all right.  But it is not the Seanad which we envisage; it is not the Seanad which Deputy de Valera envisages.  This is simply giving greater vitality to what we consider is a burden on the State.  I am speaking seriously, because it is a burden on the State.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with my friend, but he is arguing in the other <Col N="981" /> direction.  He is arguing upwards towards 90, but I am arguing towards 30. In fact he is with me.  It is true that men like Gladstone were up to 80 or 90 years of age in complete command of their faculties.  If the Seanad were a serious Seanad I would put that as an argument in answer to Deputy Sheehy. But dealing with the matter in a serious way, take the contrast that occurred yesterday.  In the debate one of the matters that arose dealt with the question of pensions for teachers.  Some ex-teachers are living on £50 a year after giving their whole life's service to one of the greatest professions to which one could devote one's life.  Yet there they are, paupers in this State.  Is it not a terrible shame to think that there are rich men in the Seanad getting £360 a year added to what they have already?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The opposition we are putting to the age limit depends on several other things.  If the Seanad were a proper and an efficient body, which added to and did not impede the march of the nation, then we would be in favour of reducing the age limit to 30 and perhaps lower.  It is conceivable that even younger men would have given such service as would make them suitable persons to be members of such a Seanad.  But it is not on that aspect that we oppose this Bill.  When dealing with the age limit one is entitled to contrast the remuneration of that body and the remuneration and work done by teachers and what they get in return. In any case, I have sufficiently indicated my attitude of mind, and I am not particularly anxious, if I can avoid it, to go outside the ruling of the Speaker in that matter.</P>

If you pass this Bill it will be possible to give doles of £360 a years to men of 30 years of age and upwards who need never attend the Seanad, who may have other sources of revenue, who need not do a day's work for the country, but who may continue to draw £360 yearly for nine years.  That shows what a complete farce this thing is from the social point of view.  The cynicism of it! Here we are doing a thing with laughter, doing it indifferently, while there are people who have given real service to the country starving.  Really I am surprised that men already in the Seanad are not ashamed of themselves. I am sorry for those who are in the Seanad who are persons that one has respect for, because a Seanad might have been a very useful body, and so far as a few of the members are concerned they do the best they can.

My contention is that by reducing the age limit you are accentuating the evil.  Perhaps, on the whole, it is better that the evil should be accentuated.  Perhaps, on the whole, it is the best thing that could be done, because the country is realising more and more what a farce the whole Seanad is.  They are really realising that they are feeling the pinch of taxation themselves, and they are very angry that this farce should be imposed on them.  As this Bill is increasing that evil, perhaps, on the <Col N="983" /> whole, instead of opposing this, it is just as well we should allow the evil to come to a head.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment for the Summer Recess, I desire to raise a question of very vital national and of local importance to my constituents&mdash;the <Col N="984" /> question of the Barrow drainage.  I am not satisfied that the Government are speeding up matters as they should on that river.  This matter has been debated both in the British House of Commons and in this country for over a century.  Thousands of pounds have been spent on engineering work and in other ways in connection with that river, but the unfortunate people there are still suffering as a result of the acute flooding and, according to the reply I received yesterday to my questions, it appears that they will have to continue suffering for the next couple of years.  Yesterday I put the following questions:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that in the areas affected by the flooding of the river Barrow&mdash;Monasterevan, Portarlington, Garryhinch, Mountmellick and Rosenalis&mdash;grave dissatisfaction is prevalent amongst the people regarding the progress of the drainage work being carried out, and that they are seriously concerned as to whether sufficient work will be carried out this summer and autumn to reduce flooding to a minimum in the coming winter; whether the Minister will state now much money is available for expenditure on this river in the present year; and whether he will urge on the Commissioners of Public Works the necessity of employing larger gangs on the river between Portarlington and Mounmellick, and other places where large obstructions exist.</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance whether he will state (a) the amount of money expended on the Barrow drainage work in the half-year ended March 31st, 1928; (b) the quarter ended 30th June, 1928; (c) the number of men employed and the number of gangs at work during that period; (d) the approximate period which it will take to complete the work at the present rate of progress; and (e) whether he is aware that several farmers, whose lands are flooded for more than half the year, are unable to continue paying annuities and taxes on land which is rendered useless to them by flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> This is the reply I received from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance:</P>
    <P>I will answer these two questions together.  The expenditure for the half year ended 31st March, 1928, was £37,061 and for the quarter ended 30th June, 1928, £9,580.</P>
    <P>About 250 men were at work during this latter period.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to indicate how long it will take to complete the scheme as, apart from anything else, the successful carrying out of drainage works depends to so great an extent on the weather; but probably at least three years after 1928 will be required.</P>
    <P>£75,000 was estimated for the year 1928-29 to cover anticipated expenditure.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out in reply to previous questions, it is an engineering necessity, in order to prevent loss and damage, that the work should proceed from the lower to the upper reaches of the river. As has already been pointed out, the Barrow drainage is not a relief work, but an engineering scheme, the estimated cost of which is based upon the use of the most economic methods of execution, apart from any other consideration, in the interests of those occupiers of the flooded and injured lands who will ultimately be called upon to pay their proportion of the whole.</P>
    <P>When you look into the figures given and the amount spent&mdash;£9,580&mdash;during the quarter ended 30th June, 1928, which was a very favourable part of the year for drainage work, there must be something wrong.  Any practical farmer, or anyone with a practical knowledge of drainage work, knows that the best and most economical time to employ men on drainage work is in the summer, and that in winter the staffs could and should be reduced.  I have an intimate knowledge of the Barrow river and its effects in my own area, as I live within a couple of miles of it. At present you can practically ford the river anywhere in the area that is most affected by flooding.  The river is practically dry at some points where there <Col N="986" /> is room for a good deal of clearing work to be done.  Later on, when the weather begins to put on its winter appearance, and the floods begin to rise, the banks will be covered and you cannot get near the river.  I contend that gangs of men could be usefully employed at present in my area from Rosenalis in Mountmellick parish on to Portarlington.  As a result of any work that these gangs might do possibly more water would be let flow on towards Monasterevan.  In that area as well extra work could be done that would cope with the extra amount of water that would come down At any rate, from an economic point of view, I am satisfied that the best part of the year is being neglected.  As regards the employment of men on this work, we have heard of rubber boots being procured for them.  In winter that is necessary, but at the present time, and until the harvest, I think men would not mind working while standing in the water for some portion of the time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Estimates for 1927-8, there was mention of the acquisition of a bucket dredger at a cost of £15,000.  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether that dredger has been procured and whether it is at work in the lower reaches of the Barrow.  Again, in 1926-7, £20,000 was voted, but the expenditure to 31st March, 1927, was only £17,604, leaving £2,395 unexpended at the end of the year.  In a footnote it is stated that that was due to delay in the delivery of heavy plant. I should like to know if the plant which was considered necessary has been procured, because I contend, in putting up the case for our area, where the people suffer most from the Barrow flooding, that we should not be held up for the next two or three years and left as we are to facilitate people further down on the river; that it should be possible so to regulate things as to allow the water to flow on.  Even if a little extra water goes down the river, as the result of work done between Rosenalis and Portarlington, there will have to be a policy of give and take.  If that policy was put in practice, I think no one could grumble.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary reminded me in his reply that this is not <Col N="987" /> a relief scheme.  I agree that it is not, but from a national and economic point of view, I contend that in an area where you have hundreds of men unemployed and a good number drawing unemployment benefit, it would be wise to take on some of those men, when you have the power under the Barrow Drainage Act, and put them at useful national work of the kind, especially in fine weather.  I have met several such men in Portarlington. Garryhinch and Mountmellick who asked me if there was any chance of their being taken on, as they had heard so much about this scheme and the work it would open up.  I do not contend that it is relief work, but I submit it can usefully employ a number of men.  Again, at this time in the Garryhinch area, between Mountmellick and Portarlington, there is a large number of men who have a lot of spare time on their hands, between the end of the turf cutting season and the harvest, and some of these men could be usefully taken on.  I was reminded to-day that in the Athy area last year during the harvest farmers found a difficulty in getting men, because they were employed in the drainage work there.  There is no reason why extra men could not be taken on now in the summer time and released afterwards for the necessary harvest work.  I think that if we approached this from a practical point of view and got the co-operation of the engineers in charge, such an arrangement could be made to work out in practice.  The area on the mountain side a couple of miles from where the river starts is very badly affected by flooding.  According to the reply I received, it will take three years after this year before the work can be completed, and the people living there will have to exist for the next couple of years in the misery under which they have been suffering, which means that for five or six months of the year their holdings are half covered, if not completely covered with water, and their homes are inaccessible.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the work should be so arranged that in various places the engineer could take on men and remove some of the bigger obstacles in <Col N="988" /> the river&mdash;dead timber and growing timber and sandbanks that accumulate behind fallen timber.</P>
    <P>Let me give an instance of what could be done.  An enterprising and enthusiastic Committee, in Mountmellick, about three years ago collected money from the tenants and others interested in the Barrow Drainage in that area and district, with the result that they cleared the river for a distance of three or four miles.  What was the effect?  The road between Tullamore and Mountmellick, as a result of a day or half a day's rain prior to that drainage work, was flooded to the depth of a foot or more.  They completed the work, and the road is dry ever since.  Except for about 20 or 30 yards that road is dry ever since, even after serious floods in the river, because the water is able to get away, whereas before that it was submerged in time of flood for 100 yards or more. I believe that if the bigger obstruction &mdash;timber and the occasional sand-banks&mdash;were removed all along the river, and if that kind of work was done in that area, it would not cause any inconvenience to the men engaged in the work lower down, and would not cause any extra flooding in other districts.  I am not satisfied that, at the rate at which the money is being spent up to the present, the money voted for the work for 1928 will be spent in the year.  I think there is room for the Parliamentary Secretary to interfere and to urge upon the engineer in charge the necessity for speeding up the work and for using the money that has been voted for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I would stress the point that in the area I speak of there are people at the present time with decrees hanging over their heads for annuities and rates.  I know some of these people intimately, and I am satisfied that they are not able to meet their annuities and their rates as a result of the flooding going on in their area, because, in the first place, their tillage land is covered with water or is too wet to work in the spring time, and, in the next place, their meadowing is liable at any time to be destroyed by the floods which sweep across their land <Col N="989" /> when the river is in flood.  This is a matter that should receive the consideration of the Land Commission, and something should be done for these people.  I have spoken to these people as regards the payments of the drainage cost afterwards, and they are perfectly satisfied to pay in order to get the work done.  They will not grumble provided the work is done.  They certainly cannot be satisfied to allow this scheme to drag on and to continue to suffer from the floods in the hope that some time something will be done.  I need say no more.  I have spoken to other Deputies from Leix and Offaly and from Kildare, and I understand they all look upon this situation in the same light as I do, namely, that there is great necessity for having the work done.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that credit is due to the Government for tackling this scheme, but it is one thing to tackle it, and it is another thing getting it through.  This work was tackled two or three years ago and, according to the answer that I received yesterday from the Parliamentary Secretary, it will not be finished before 1932.  The Barrow is the second biggest river in Ireland, and this is a big scheme and a big national question.  The flooding of the river does immense damage to the country, and it is not too much to expect the Government to tackle it earnestly and to vote all the money necessary to get the work done.  There is no reason why it should not be finished in a couple of years instead of extending it to almost four years.  I ask the House to urge the Parliamentary Secretary, as representative of the Government, to do his utmost with the engineers to speed matters up.  I have been asked to voice the plight the people are in before the House adjourns, and I feel confident that I shall get others in this assembly to do the same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was quite clearly understood by Deputies here at the time the Barrow Drainage Bill was introduced that the actual drainage work, when started, could not be completed inside a period of two, three or four years.  I fully realise that at any rate. I am satisfied, however, if it is possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to justify the expenditure <Col N="990" /> of £37,061 for the last three months of last year, and the first three months of the present year, and that most of that money went in wages, it should be reasonably possible for his Department to spend at least the same amount of money, and to employ the same number of men, in the period of the year we are now in.  Any ordinary layman, apart from the engineer responsible for the carrying out of this important work, would, naturally and rightly, assume that a greater number of men could be usefully employed in the summer than in the winter portion of the year.  What do we find from the figures that the Parliamentary Secretary gave us yesterday?  They show that there has been £9,580 spent for the first three months ending June, that is, the first three months of the financial year, and that during that period the number of men employed was 250 all told.  If the same rate of progress is to be made for the remainder of the financial year it will mean that instead of spending the whole of the £75,000 this House voted for the drainage, roughly we will only spend half the amount of the money which was voted in the Estimate.  At the rate of expenditure for the last six months of the financial year it would be right up to the margin of the £75,000 voted for this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is entitled to know on what grounds the Minister justified this go-slow policy for the first three months of this year and why a smaller number of men is apparently being employed during the summer than during the last three months of last year and the first three months of this year.  We are all aware that last winter was remarkable for very bad weather and that naturally had its effect both on the people who were responsible for carrying out the work and on the men who were employed on the work.  From the point of view of the latter, the effect was much worse.  Are we to understand that some of the machinery, such as dredgers and other things that it is proposed to get, is to be purchased out of the £75,000, or is that amount to be left aside purely for preliminary drainage work?  If so, how do you propose to spend it, if you do not employ more men and go quicker on the <Col N="991" /> job than at the present time?  Deputy Gorry appears to think that the men should be taken on for three or four months during the summer and when it comes to harvest time the services of a lot of them should be dispensed with simply because the farmers might require them.  I would prefer that there should be a minimum number employed on the preliminary work during the winter and the summer and that these men would get continuous work rather than be in the position of casual employees, one day doing Barrow drainage and the next day hoping to get work from the farmers there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Davin is doing an injustice to what I said. It is quite possible to employ a certain number on the drainage work and keep them on permanently, but where men leave farming employment and go to work on the river, at slack times, it would not be unreasonable to have a certain amount of co-operation so that the men would be allowed to go back to farming work if that were necessary and if they were really required.  That is what I meant.</P>

      <P>I do not want to encourage the Minister to take men on the preliminary work, pay them at the rate of 29/- or 30/- or whatever miserable sum they do get, and then when it comes to September say to them, &ldquo;You must go because the farmers are willing to pay you 8/- per week.&rdquo;  I will be quite frank with the Parliamentary Secretary and with Deputy Gorry on that point.  If the Deputy really wants a minimum number employed during the summer season and during the winter season I am in agreement with him on that matter, but I do not want semi-casual employment to-day on the Barrow and to-morrow looking for farmer's work at a quarter of the wages that they are offered on the Barrow drainage scheme.</P>

      <P>I would be pleased if the Deputy would give me privately some information in support of the statement he has made.  I desire to support his appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, namely, that a larger number of men could be usefully employed at the present time.  The local engineers, men who have qualifications in regard to drainage work, are of the opinion that this preliminary work could be carried out all over the area that Deputy Gorry has referred to.  It is quite clear that along the river trees are causing obstructions, and particularly is this so on the upper reaches.  It would be well if these trees could be removed.  That is the opinion of qualified engineers.  The engineers previously expressed that opinion when deputations waited on the Minister for Finance some twelve months ago. These deputations were accompanied by Deputies from the area.  The engineers were of opinion that the work that has been mentioned could be carried out without interfering with the very valuable work that is undoubtedly being done up-river from Athy.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister came to the House two or three months ago and presented an Estimate for £75,000.  We must reasonably assume that they were satisfied that this money could be usefully spent within the financial year.  If the present rate of progress is to be maintained, not fifty per cent. of the £75,000 will be spent.  I am quite convinced that Mr. Challoner Smith and his engineers would be prepared to employ a far greater number of men than are now employed.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have stated that £37,061 was spent in the very bad part of last winter carrying out work of this kind.  If that is so, a far greater number than is now employed could be employed, and it is only reasonable to assume that a similar number could be employed, during the summer as during the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must pay a tribute to the engineers and to whomsoever is responsible, who <Col N="993" /> deserve credit for the very valuable work that has been carried out.  The preliminary work carried out last year has had very good effects in the Monasterevan area and down the river.  It has considerably relieved flooding. Before the work started, if there was a heavy rainfall, the floods would remain around Monasterevan for two or three weeks.  This year, as a result of the work that has been done, the floods were carried away in two or three days. I desire to pay a tribute to the people who deserve credit for that work.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see his way to accede to Deputy Gorry's reasonable demand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPatrickAird" hpid="Mr. AIRD Mr. AIRD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIRD</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this matter, because Deputies Gorry and Davin have gone over the ground very well.  A sum of £37,000, roughly, has been spent in six months of last year, and about £9,500 was spent in the quarter ending in June.  I would like to say that very much more than £75,000 should be allocated for the drainage of the Barrow annually.  It is a matter of vital importance.  It is really a national question, and Deputies who live in the area can realise the hardships the people have to suffer.  It is getting worse every year, especially in the areas of Portarlington, Mountmellick, Clonbulloge, Bracknagh, and Garryhinch.  In the course of my business I often have to travel that portion of the country, and it is not an uncommon sight to see the roads covered to a depth of eighteen inches with water, and in some cases more.  Very often that portion of the country is flooded for four or five months.  You cannot see any land whatever.  The whole place is simply submerged, and of course the land is absolutely useless. For that reason it would be really a national asset if the land were improved. If the land were drained it would be of great benefit to the nation as a whole.  In the Barrow valley alone there are, roughly, 300,000 to 500,000 acres affected.  Probably there might be more.  In the immediate area of the river the only crop that the farmers can grow is hay.  They can put in no other crop, because it would perish.  It is computed that the farmer gets one crop in every three.  Deputy Gorry will <Col N="994" /> bear me out in that.  For the last four or five years, a great many farmers have not got a single crop of hay.  On last Tuesday I was setting meadows in the Barrow area, and I set some for 5s. an acre, and the prices went from 15s. to 25s. and in some places 35s. an acre. This was a good year, too, on account of the scarcity of hay.  I have often set meadow there for 3s. or 4s. an acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>They are usually set with a provision as to flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPatrickAird" hpid="Mr. AIRD Mr. AIRD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIRD</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is a three weeks' provision for floods in the conditions of sale.  If they have not removed their hay, and cut and saved it. they can look out after three weeks.  I only mention these facts to bring before the Government and to impress upon them the urgency of the matter. In Portarlington and Mountmellick the conditions and losses from flooding are considerable.  In these two towns the people have to leave entirely one side of the town, and clear out at times and take refuge in another part of the town.  Sometimes there is as much as two or three feet of water in their part of the town.  One could scarcely believe that the conditions are so bad. Referring back to what I was saying a moment ago with regard to the hay crop, it happens that if they get one or two or three wet days in midsummer it is inevitable that the hay crop will be lost.  I would like to congratulate the Government on having brought in that valuable Act for the drainage of the Barrow.  The only thing I will impress on them now is to try to expedite the work and hasten the drainage of this particular portion of the river.  I know that the engineers have a lot to say on this matter, in fact, everything.  They are working from Kildare up to Monasterevan, but in the meantime the areas above will, until they are reached, be flooded. There is the section in Garryhinch, and between that and Portarlington, in which, I understand, there are over 300 trees blocking the river.  Some of these trees have been there for thirty or forty years.  When the floods come down these trees block the river, hold back the water, and the whole country is flooded for miles around.  If the <Col N="995" /> Government could do some preliminary work in clearing that, it would be a great matter for the people in that area.  I want to impress that very strongly upon the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDwyer" hpid="Mr. DWYER Mr. DWYER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DWYER</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal has been said by the Deputies who have spoken on the flooding of the upper portions of the river.  The portion of the river between Portarlington and Mountmellick requires the consideration of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.  The area around there is suffering from these floods.  The local engineers say that that could be easily remedied.  If the obstructions caused by the trees in the river were removed the flooding there would be got over, and the upper portion there, as regards the land that has been flooded up about Mountmellick and Garryhinch, would be relieved.  I would like to stress on the Parliamentary Secretary to make an effort to put on more men in that section so as to remove the obstructions in that part of the river.  One could scarcely believe until one went down there the hardships that are caused to the people there owing to the flooding of that portion.  The Government from time to time made promises here to the people of that area.  Since I became a Deputy I have myself introduced several deputations to the Government with regard to these obstructions, and promises were made that these would be cleared out.  I am sorry to say that nothing much has been done there, and nothing is to be done at present.  I want to press on the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity to have the work there carried out at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputies for Leix and Offaly have made a good case for the carrying out of preliminary work in order to relieve the obstructions in their area in the upper reaches of the Barrow and its tributaries.  I have called the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to this matter as regards Kildare on several occasions, and I was told that there were engineering difficulties in the way.  No doubt there are engineering difficulties, but still I think the engineers should not be so hide-bound in their professional <Col N="996" /> practice as not to strain a point and to relieve the distress that exists where flooding is caused by small obstructions in the river.  I know that a clearing of the river for a distance of 200 years or so would, in many places, give great relief to large areas of land.  When dealing with problems like this the engineers find that in certain areas the ground remains covered with water for a long period after each heavy rainfall before it is drained away.  The clearing away of the obstruction in the rivers works out in such a way that the flood is over in two or three days.  Around Rathangan I know that great hardships have been suffered by the people, but I have been told that they are the last reaches of the river to be considered. I do not see why the Government should permit that, and why the engineers should not break away from this practice and do some of the work that the Deputies and the representatives of the area are asking to be done at once, so as to relieve the flooding in the Barrow delta.  Surely the representatives here should have some say in the way this money is to be spent.  Very little of that £425,000 has been spent yet.  What the people want now is immediate relief from the flooding of their lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>And work.  I have asked the Parliamentary Secretary on several occasions to put on more men at Kildare at the Barrow drainage work. He has told me that he has to keep within the estimate and that the estimate was cut down to the minimum.  I quite understand that.  But still the problem of expenditure should be one for the Government to consider carefully. When a Bill is brought in for schemes of public utility like this and passed by the Houses, surely there is nothing unreasonable in asking the Government to do their duty in getting on with the work in that way.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will break away from Departmental routine, and give instructions that this work must be carried out according to the wishes of the Deputies representative of the counties affected.  I have nothing to say with regard to the management of the Barrow Scheme.  I am sure that we <Col N="997" /> have the best engineer that we could get to carry out the work.  As I have already said here, I am very glad he is an Irishman, and an Irishman who has gained his experience here in this country.  I have no doubt that he has an able staff.  But he is working for economy.  He wants to keep the work within the estimate which he has made out himself.  I do not blame him for that.  Still if he could manage to put on a few more gangs of men under able overseers I do not think there would be any loss of money on this scheme.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is considering those areas of Leix and Offaly I hope that he will not forget the Kildare area and that he will also put on a big number of men there and do something for that unfortunate county of ours. He has not so much to show for the last two or three years.  Perhaps it is not his fault.  But I think he could send several gangs of men and spread them all over the county, and give our unemployed something to do in the rural area.</P>

      <P>As I am one of the Deputies concerned with this work of the Barrow drainage, I suppose I would be expected to say something also.  I have just this to say, that this scheme of the Barrow drainage is being carried out by the Department concerned on a par with the method by which the government of the country is being carried out by the Executive.  That is, that it is merely tinkering with the job. They are only tinkering with the work of the draining of the Barrow.  Since this work commenced, I am satisfied that half the rivers in the country could have been drained, if they had gone about the work in a thorough manner, as it would be gone about in any country but this unfortunate country.</P>

      <P>In spite of what the last speaker has said, I think it is generally allowed that the work done on the Barrow drainage has been well done.  I think that has been allowed on all sides.  Every Deputy who has spoken except the last Deputy has admitted that the work on the Barrow is of value and being well done.  The only thing I have to find fault with is that the work is proceeding too slowly, and I suggest that during the summer months more money should be spent and more men employed than are employed there at present, and men who are idle could be put to work there.</P>
      <P>If that can be done I think it would fill a great necessity.  The summer period is, of course, the time to do what work should be done, and it is the time when it can be done best; but to say that the work is not being done well and is being tinkered with is rubbish. I think everyone in the district and adjoining counties will agree in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another county affected, more affected than some of the other counties.  We, in Carlow and Kilkenny, would impress on the Minister the necessity of clearing away any obstacles in the lower reaches of the river.  The Minister will, perhaps, be met by individuals who will complain that if these obstacles are cleared the water will come down earlier from the upper reaches.  I do not agree with that.  It is true it will come down a few hours earlier, but it will also go away a few hours earlier, so that it really makes no difference. This plea is being put up on the Nore and the Barrow, but the only thing I ask is that any obstacles in the lower reaches of the Barrow should be dealt with.  While money is being given away for unemployment to people who will not work on farms I think it is a great waste of money to spend it in that direction while there is work of utility to be done.  While there is work of utility to be done people can be employed there and made to earn the money which they would otherwise get in unemployment.  If you gave them a shovel to keep back the tide and to shovel the sand along the beaches it would pay you better than paying <Col N="999" /> them while they are idle.  It does not need speeches to demonstrate the fact that once people become chronically idle for three or four years they will not work.  They will not do so.  It is against human nature.  It is better to have them doing some work than having them idle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not for choice.  In fact, I do not know how these people could get to the river to do effective work during last winter.  I am not going into the wisdom of paying for work during the winter as I have not got first hand information.  I do not know how they could work at the river and give an effective return for the money last winter.  People ought to get it out of their heads about twenty-nine shillings being a miserable wage.  Agriculture cannot afford to pay that.  That song has been sung on platforms and in this House frequently and it is time to change the tune.  I want to repeat what I said before in regard to the question of objections being made because the Ministers and others are being met with the objection, not only in regard to this but in regard to other rivers and in regard to minor schemes of drainage, that the water of the river is being let down too quickly and flooding the lands below.  That does not bear examination.  You will hear many complaints about that but I hope that no attention will be paid to that plea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons given why the work cannot be gone on with.  One, in regard to engineering difficulties.  I have no knowledge of the actual work which is being carried out but I think it is sufficiently long in hands to enable the engineers to have their schemes thoroughly understood and to know exactly where they stand. I cannot see where the engineering difficulties occur.  If the work is being done piecemeal and if changes are being made necessary by the engineers now and again they would, of course, create complications but if the whole thing is being done in that good way we are led to believe and if there are competent engineers in charge I cannot see where the delay occurs.  The other reason given is the weather.  It is extraordinary that the expenditure in winter is greater than that in spring, and the only conclusion to which one can come to is that expenditure really does not represent wages.  If it represents wages is there anything to show for it?  The expenditure seems to have gone largely on the maintenance of the staff.  We must take it that in winter a staff and other people must be kept there.  Now, however, since the weather is likely to hold good, not only this scheme but every other scheme should be gone on with the greatest expedition.  We know that in Galway the drainage of the Corrib was taken up and that when the upper reaches were drained the lower ones were flooded.  It was a bad engineering scheme.  I agree with Deputy Gorey that there is nothing to show why the work could not be proceeded with all along the river, at any rate work which does not present engineering difficulties, such as removing obstacles.  The sooner the work on the upper reaches is done the sooner will the lower reaches benefit, but a certain amount of work should be done all along the river if it is one, single, engineering scheme.</P>

It is because of this cross-fire that I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to remember that no matter what differences there may be about the condition of the river we are all agreed that something should be done, that he should look on it as work of national importance and not allow any Party to claim credit for it.  When the Barrow scheme is finished, he will have to listen to ten times as much talk from Galway Deputies when we come along with the Corrib, and we will not be long about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies representing different opinions in the Dáil had an opportunity of voicing their grievances, I expect that this debate has served its main purpose, and I should say the reply is of minor importance. There was one point stressed by Deputies on the opposite side, and lest I might forget about it later I will refer to it now.  They asked how was it that we have spent only £9,500 during the first quarter of the present financial year.  That can be easily accounted for by the fact of the very bad spring we had.  It was one of the worst springs for many years in Ireland, and accordingly the amount of work carried out was much less than the average.  You may take it from me that I will be very much surprised if we do not expend the amount we have estimated for, £75,000, this year, and the work will be carried out on a much more rapid basis as the season proceeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various objections of Deputies fell mainly under three heads.  First of all, Deputies raised an objection to the fact that the work was not carried out in places where they would like to see it carried out.  Secondly, they complained of the small number of workers employed; and thirdly, there is a general grievance that the work is not proceeding rapidly enough.  Deputies ought to look at a question of this kind with a proper sense of proportion.  It is a very big scheme, one of the biggest engineering schemes that has been tackled in this country at any time. The problem of the drainage of the Barrow has been one which confronted engineers in this country for over a century.  It is a problem that has tempted the ablest engineers and a <Col N="1003" /> problem that baffled them until the present Government undertook it.  Deputies should bear in mind that a scheme of that sort cannot be carried out in a haphazard, free-and-easy, give-and-take way, as one Deputy expressed it.</P>
    <P>Before a spade was stuck in the ground in this scheme the operations of it had to be thoroughly planned out in advance.  The work proceeded along a plan that had to be matured very carefully, and in the utmost scientific precision one portion of the work fits into another.  Work that is being done today is going to have a definite reaction on work done to-morrow, and if you upset that scheme to please a Deputy here or there, if it is not going to result in upsetting the whole scheme, it certainly is going to result in upsetting the finances of the scheme.  I can very well understand that the Deputies who today would like to bring pressure to bear upon me to have this work carried out in a way that would ultimately entail increased expenditure on the Government and on benefiting the land occupiers are the very Deputies who would voice the grievances of these occupiers later on when the bill is presented and when they will be called upon to pay up, because we know from experience that no matter what amount they have to pay, even though they may get good value for it, their grievances are going to be voiced and a general clamour will be raised.  As I say, it is a very big undertaking.  It is something on a par with military operations. The whole thing fits into one prearranged plan.  It would be just as reasonable for a Deputy in the French Chamber during the war to get up when Marshal Foch was carrying on a grand general offensive in France and seek to have that offensive modified in one way or another, in order that the particular farm of some constituent of that Deputy might be cleared of the invader before another&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We ought to face this thing with some sense of proportion, and we ought to take into consideration the difficulties that these engineers have to contend with in tackling this problem.  With regard to the question of employment, I am afraid that I cannot hold forth any very great promises to Deputies on this point either.  We have already reached the peak point as regards giving employment on the Barrow.  There were 600 men employed in August of last year, and I do not expect to see that figure reached again.  In the early stages of this scheme the work was of a superficial character.  We had practically no machinery and, accordingly, most of the operations were carried out by hand labour.  As the work progresses we will be dispensing with hand labour and going in more and more for machinery.  There is very good reason for that the reason being that work by machinery is very much cheaper and more economic than hand labour. The estimate for the drainage of the Barrow is £425,000, and the main item of cost is the cost of excavating soft material.  The excavating includes actual excavations of the material and running into spoil.  The cost of doing the work by hand labour amounts to something like 6/3¼ per cubic yard. The cost of doing that work by machinery works out at something less than 2/- per cubic yard.  Up to the present the work carried out by machinery and hand labour has been so proportioned that it works out on an average of something like 5/0¾ per cubic yard.  Our estimate is based on the estimates that were given of excavating that material at 2/6 per yard.  That will give Deputies an idea of the amount of leeway that we have to make up, and how in the future it will be necessary for us to go in more and more for the use of machinery every month.</P>

      <P>I have not got it at the moment, but I can get the Deputy the information afterwards.  It will be seen that if we are to carry out this big national scheme within the estimate, it will be necessary to go in, as I say, more and more for machinery. As regards the slowness of the work, I was glad to see that Deputy Davin very fairly admitted that the beneficial results of the work carried out have been very noticeable up to the present.  Indeed, without paying a visit to the works at all, anybody standing on the bridge at Monasterevan or Athy who knows how that district was flooded a couple of years ago could not but be impressed by the different conditions that meet the eye there at the present time.  In carrying out this work, the engineers, for their own reasons, came to the conclusion that the main district to be attended to, and the first district that required attention, was the stretch of river running from about six miles below Athy to about two miles below Portarlington&mdash;that is, the main stretch of the river&mdash;that comprises about twenty-five miles.  Preliminary works have been carried out all along that stretch of the river, including the deepening of shoals, the removing of timber, the cutting away of sharp bends and various superficial works of that kind.  Similar work has been carried out also along the Figile River for a distance of six miles.  So much for preliminary work. The key stretch of the Barrow River&mdash; the really important stretch&mdash;where most of the obstructions are and where, as a result of lack of carrying capacity, the water is headed up so as to flood a great portion of the country, and also so as to cause flooding in the various tributaries, is a fifteen mile stretch between Athy and Monasterevan.  It is here the engineers are concentrating at the present time.  In order to realise what they have done and what they are doing here, it is necessary to know the kind of obstructions they have to deal with.  Roughly speaking, they fall into two classes&mdash;natural obstructions and artificial ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1006" /> The natural obstructions are shoals, islands, narrows and sharp bends.  The artificial obstructions include bridges with insufficient water-way, mill dams, eei weirs, fords and navigation weirs. Taking the worst of the natural obstructions in order, going up-stream from Athy, there is, first of all, a long gravel shoal at Athy.  There is a shoal and there are narrows at Barrowford, a rock shoal at Bert, one of the most important points on the Barrow and a very difficult problem to handle.  It is being successfully handled, as I saw when I was down there a few days ago.  There are shoals, islands and narrows at Reban and Kilberry, at Ballymanus and at Vicarstown.  There are restricted and obstructed channels at Sallow Island and at Portmurraghan Island.  There is a rock shoal at Monasterevan.  These are the main natural obstructions on the river, but, as well, the whole stretch lacks carrying capacity and will have to be broadened or deepened.  Upon the whole of these obstructions work on the main scheme has begun.  In some places, the work has been done almost at full depth and width and in others the work is not yet in an advanced state.  As regards artificial obstructions from Athy upwards, there is a navigation weir at Ardreigh to be part diverted and lowered.  There is an insufficient water-way at the Grand Canal Horse Bridge at Athy.  There is insufficient waterway at Crom-a-boo Bridge, Athy, and underpinning is also required.  There is a great obstruction at Duke's Weir, Athy &mdash;the head race to Duke's Mill.  There is an eel weir at Barrowford.  There is a mill weir at Bert&mdash;a great obstruction. There is an eel weir at Vicarstown, an eel weir and ford at Portmurraghan Island, a pass bridge at Monasterevan with insufficient waterway and perched almost on the summit of the Monasterevan shoal.  Of these items, the following is the present position:&mdash;Ardreigh Mill has been purchased, and work on the alterations is in hand.  The Horse Bridge at Athy has been rebuilt, with ample waterway.  Crom-a-boo Bridge has been underpinned and inverts put in, so that no obstruction occurs even in heavy floods.  Duke's Mill and weir have been purchased.  The weir has been removed and the mill is being used as offices, stores, and the general headquarters <Col N="1007" /> for the whole work.  The eel weir at Barrowford has been removed. The mill weir at Bert has been purchased and temporarily sluiced.  It is being used as a control for the up-stream waters during the excavation of the rock at this place.  The eel weir at Vicarstown has been purchased and removed. The eel weir and ford at Portmurraghan Island have been removed. Nothing has been done to Monasterevan Bridge as yet, nor can anything be done until the excavation is complete.  A new bridge will be required.</P>
    <P>This is only a very general summary of the work that has already been carried out but I think it is a sufficient answer to Deputy Buckley's statement that we are merely tinkering with the job.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Colohan pay a compliment to the engineer in charge of this work.  I think we should be proud, irrespective of party, that we have Irishmen in the country capable of tackling big important engineering works of this kind and of carrying them out successfully.  A little more of that kind of argument would do more to help us than some of the carping criticism we hear from time to time.  There were some minor objections raised.  Deputy Gorry spoke about the dredger.  That is a point of detail.  I am not familiar with the various places where the different dredgers are working at the present time.  We have a great amount of plant at all times working on those rivers and I cannot tell him at the moment where the dredger is operating. As regards the Garryhinch and Mountmellick obstructions or the amount of <Col N="1008" /> trees in the river and all that, I can bring that point before the engineers, but I cannot promise they will deal with that before the time allotted in their programme for carrying out the work.  All those operations are in a big general scheme.  It has been visualised in advance, planned and mapped out in advance, and it is very unfair to ask them to hasten up a particular job before they are ready to tackle it, before the plant and machinery are moved so as tackle it in a proper scientific way.</P>

His claim to old age pension was determined by the local pension committee on 22nd May, 1928, when a pension <Col N="900" /> at the rate of 10/- a week was awarded to him to commence on 25th May, 1928, i.e., the date on which he was to leave the county home.  Mr. Murphy was duly discharged from the home on 25th May, 1928, and an old age pension order book with effect as from that date was delivered to him in accordance with the decision of the Committee.
