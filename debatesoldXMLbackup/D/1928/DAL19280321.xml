      <NameTxt>Mr. M. BRENNAN (for Mr. A. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) the number of civil servants who have retired owing to the change of Government under Article 10 of the Treaty, discriminating between males and females; (b) the number of civil servants who have been discharged from office under the above Article discriminating between males and females; (c) the total amount of the enhanced compensation to each of the above classes awarded under the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council restoring Mr. Justice Meredith's judgment in the case of Wigg and Cochrane versus the Attorney-General of the Irish Free State; (d) the number of unreleased civil servants, discriminating between males and females, <Col N="1502" /> who have lodged their applications for retirement and consequent compensation under Article 10 up to 23rd February, 1928; and (e) if he will state why the Treaty pensioners residing outside the Free State have not been paid their bonus pensions at the Free State rate instead of the British rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of civil servants who retired in consequence of the change of Government effected by the Treaty is 978, i.e., 837 men and 141 women.  The number (including petty sessions clerks, resident magistrates, Crown solicitors, court officials, etc.), who have been discharged from office with compensation under Article 10 is 530, i.e., 484 men and 46 women.</P>
      <P>Compensation, if awarded in these cases in accordance with the opinions expressed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Wigg and Cochrane case, would entail an immediate expenditure of £48,000.  The annual compensation charge would, in addition, be increased.  It has not been possible in the time available for preparation of this reply to apportion the increased charge among the classes referred to.</P>
      <P>The number of pending applications to retire in consequence of the change of Government received prior to the 23rd February, 1928, is 301, including 261 men and 40 women.  The compensation charge in respect of these retirements cannot be assessed pending a determination of the applications.</P>
      <P>As regards the concluding part of the question the change to payment by reference to the Saorstát Cost of Living Index figure in the case of persons resident outside the Saorstát, has not been made pending a final settlement of the general issues raised in the course of the Wigg and Cochrane litigation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is a fact that John Sullivan, late of Dromod, Waterville, County Kerry, who resigned from the Royal Irish Constabulary on August 9th, 1920, because of his national sympathies, applied for a pension to the Department of Finance in December, <Col N="1503" /> 1922; if he will state why no reply was sent to the application; and if he is now prepared to consider Mr. Sullivan's claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>An application for the grant of a pension was received from Mr. Sullivan.  After the Committee of Inquiry into resignations and dismissals from the constabulary had examined his claim and had reported that it was not satisfied that his resignation from that force was caused by his national sympathies, the case was in due course reviewed by me, and I saw no reason to disagree with the unfavourable view formed by the Committee. Mr. Sullivan was, accordingly, informed on the 7th October, 1925, that I was unable to authorise the grant to him of a pension.  I can see no ground now for re-opening the claim.</P>

      <P>The grant made towards the heating and cleaning of national schools is a combined one, and it is not possible to give separately the amounts that may be allocated locally (a) to heating or (b) to cleaning of schools.</P>
      <P>The amount of the heating and cleaning grants paid from State sources to the schools in Clonbroney parish during the financial year ended 31st March, 1927, was £12 5s.</P>
      <P>The grant for heating and cleaning of National Schools is based on a maximum scale according to the number of pupils in attendance at the school, and is also limited to a maximum of one-half the total contributions from local sources for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. HASLETT</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that the fees for gun licences prevent a great number of tourists desirous of visiting the Free State from doing so; and if, in view of the advantage to this country of the development of tourist traffic, he will consider the advisability of introducing temporary licences to encourage sporting tourists to come to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence that any appreciable number of tourists have been deterred from visiting the Saorstát because of the amount payable for a firearm certificate.  The present system introduced by the Firearms Act, 1925, and the Finance Act, 1925, whereby a full licence for a gun can be obtained for £2 with the right to shoot game was adopted after full consideration and is an improvement on the old system.  The Deputy should remember that prior to the Firearms Act, 1925, and the Finance Act, 1925, a full game certificate cost £3 and the minimum amount for a game certificate was £1, these amounts being fixed when money had a much higher purchasing power than at present.  The all-round fee of £2 in the light of this is obviously not <Col N="1506" /> of a character to deter tourists who desire to come to the Saorstát in the game season.</P>

      <P>This explanation will only take a moment.  I have heard a rumour regarding my resignation from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It has been stated that I resigned because of certain proceedings that took place at meetings of the Committee. I desire to contradict that. What led up to my resignation was: I was a nominee of the group known as the Independent group on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I acted on another committee in the same capacity.  When the Joint Committee dealing with the question of elections to the Seanad came to be decided upon by the Committee of Selection, it would appear they considered that the Independent group were not entitled to representation on that Committee.  It appears a name was sent forward&mdash;I think it was my own name&mdash;from that group to act on that Joint Committee. The Committee of Selection concluded that the Independent group were not entitled to representation on that important Committee dealing with the Constitution of the Seanad in the future, and, that being so, I considered I was wrong in acting on behalf of the Independent group on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I therefore resigned.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That the Vote be reduced by £1,000,000.&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Ruttledge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will remember, we were engaged somewhat broadly in discussing the reduction by £1,000,000 of a sum of £7,898,061 and we had got so far, at any rate, as to the examination of the reasons put forward, and the history of the reasons put forward by certain interests in this House in favour of continuing expenditure upon a huge scale <Col N="1514" /> Though I believe, without doubt, that the expenditure, which is now being taken for the purposes to which it is now being put, is extravagant and is above the capacity of this State continuously to bear, and though I desire to see, and I believe it is possible that we should see, a very considerable and significant reduction in that sum, I do not for one single moment stand for the reduction of expenditure upon productive work below the highest price which we can, looking broadly at the matter, see our way to pay.  The difficulty is that we have huge establishment charges and relatively small productive charges.</P>
      <P>I would take, merely as an example, a Ministry in which I am very sympathetically interested, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  I have been through the figures and I find that the salaries for which that Department is responsible amount to about £215,500&mdash; salaries and bonus.  When you contemplate a figure of that kind and contemplate the amount of obvious result which we are getting, or not getting. from that it seems to be an outrageous sum.  I have been through that, merely as a sample Vote, to see whether I could separate in some form the reproductive or primarily productive or development expenditure from expenditure on enforcement and other statutory work, or in other words, development expenditure as distinct from overhead charges.  Giving the largest and most liberal allowance, including portion of the expenditure on Foreign Affairs in London, New York and Paris, I cannot make at the highest estimate more than £25,000 of that £215,000 which is allocated to development work.  If those figures are correct, it puts in somewhat better perspective, from the point of view of the Minister for Trade and Commerce, the activities of his Department, but it seems amazing that so small a proportion should be devoted to primarily productive work by that department and, probably, nearly nine times as much to overhead charges of one kind or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see the proportion between overhead and development expenses in every Ministry in the State increased. If we are to save at all, we ought to save upon enforcement and statutory <Col N="1515" /> work and upon what I call the molluscs. This Department is practically new in the sense that I do not think it took over many of the old staff.  It had to start work again and build from a new basis and it has not had the time nor, I think, the intention to employ unnecessary, supernumerary people, but there is no question that the amount of development work being done by it is quite inadequate for the necessities of this State.  As you know, a few years ago this House entered on a system of what was called experimental tariffs. Those of us who have been used to making experiments, for one purpose or another, have one very definite outlook upon experiments, namely, that we shall carefully and in orderly manner fully record the results and reason from the implications of such experiments. You have had these tariffs now in operation, some of them for quite a few years and some, I think, like the boot and other tariffs, extending over a considerable area of industrial effort. When I went to the Ministry of Trade and Commerce and asked for particulars which would enable me, as a Deputy of this House and as one eagerly anxious to get the truth on economic matters, for the recorded results of that experiment, I found that there were practically no such results available. I also found that there was practically no machinery in existence to get them, even when they were asked for, and though the Ministry of Trade and Commerce did, with great courtesy and great kindness, their best to give such information as was at their disposal, in relation to no single tariff were we in a position to get the information upon which, judged merely as an experiment and for the purposes of information, could we have founded sound conclusions as to the correctness or incorrectness of the particular policy adopted in that case.  To the extent to which they were enabled to make that experiment or begin to report the results of that experiment, practically new machinery had to be set up, and set up, I believe, at the cost of putting upon the skeleton organisation for development work, work for which they were not then properly equipped.  In <Col N="1516" /> relation to industry and commerce it is essential that there should be the most careful, the most critical, and the most open examination of the whole of the facts, the most intimate facts, surrounding some particular tariffs in order that we may get some sound information. That has not been done.</P>
    <P>If it has not been done because the Ministry of Trade and Commerce has not tried to get a proper staff for that purpose, if it has not been done because the Ministry of Trade and Commerce has not transferred as much as or more than it has from enforcement and overhead charges to development charges, then the fault is very definitely at the door of the Ministry of Trade and Commerce. We ought to be able to know now from their records, from their experiments and their investigation what exactly is occurring in relation to the particular tariffs with which we are concerned.  That we apparently are not able to do.</P>
    <P>I, for one, am not moving a reduction of this Vote in the direction of reducing development work on industry and commerce.  I find that that Department is loaded with a whole lot of things which might just as well be put somewhere else.  In this £215,000, for which they are responsible in one way or another, is included the Statistics Branch which, in my opinion, is doing excellent work and which is certainly under a very competent man, but a very small proportion of that wages and salaries cost is really and properly attributable to industry and commerce.  For instance, we had a very remarkable publication, a credit to that Department and a credit to the man who is personally responsible for it&mdash;the Report on Agricultural Statistics.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture might very well take responsibility for costs of that kind.  I think that one of the things that we might look for is a better segregation of the charges which are laid down here and in the estimate, so that we may know how much of the revenue which is expended by the State is rightly attributable to the development of manufacturing industry and how much to the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am now going to take up some of <Col N="1517" /> the points which came to the surface in the debate.  Honestly one feels, merely looking over the notes, that we must have covered a very considerable amount of ground.  Deputy Cooper wanted to know if we want to repudiate something.  Does he want to repudiate the Wigg and Cochrane decision?  He wanted to know did we want the British to continue to collect certain funds and hand them over to us.  We most certainly do not want this House to collect certain funds and hand them over to the British.  If this House did not include in its estimates a Department for the purpose of collecting revenue from this State which it does not owe, to be handed over to those who have no right to it, there would not be the necessity to move the Vote which we now are moving here.  He told us that the Secret Service Vote was small. Is the Secret Service Vote small? Where does the Secret Service end and where does the patronage Vote commence? That we would ascertain if some independent professional authority went through a Department, say like the Post Office or some other Department, and segregated out definitely every man who is doing his work, set down exactly what he was doing and what the doing of it was worth and set down on the other side the patronage and the merely unemployment relief bodies which undoubtedly have accumulated in some of those Departments. Deputy O'Connell said that there is no case for a reduction.  I was down in Achill the other day and I heard them laughing when I was nearly a mile away&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I do not think the Deputy has quoted what Deputy O'Connell said.  He did not say there was no case for a reduction, but he did say that there was no case made for a reduction on this amendment&mdash;quite a different thing altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that is so.  I accept it.  Deputy O'Connell had been down in front of us.  He told the people there how he had given back the shilling to the old age pensioners&mdash; 13 of them against 117, I think, had given back the shilling and no one else had anything to do with it.  He said <Col N="1518" /> there was no case made for a reduction &mdash;naturally.  Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Morrissey, Deputy Anthony, and a few others have turned their backs pretty definitely upon national Labour and in so doing have turned their backs upon any human prospect of ever being responsible for finding the funds which will run this country.</P>

They know that they will never have to foot the bill, that as long as they are in their present orientation towards nationalism their Labour is a thing which will always leave them in ineffective opposition.  If that came from national Labour in this House, if it came from the particular men who have an outlook upon national Labour, who see a future for the re-co-ordination of the Labour movement with the democratic movement in this country, then it would be a much more serious matter. But at present it is simply the talk of four or five or eleven out of 150, who never had, and who never will have, the responsibility for finding the finances of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>He also wanted elaborate social services.  He also wants high nominal wages with a large amount of unemployment.  He also wants restrictions on the building of <Col N="1520" /> houses, which will prevent the building of houses at a price at which the poor people can live in them.  Deputy Morrissey wants &ldquo;brass-hatted&rdquo; Labour on top, and the real workers living 8, 10 and 12 in a room in a slum in Dublin. That is not what we want.  We want houses for the people at a price at which they can afford to live in them.  I have a letter here from a poor man in Cork&mdash;there are such&mdash;who complains bitterly that money which ought to have been used for the building of a town hall&mdash;it is not Sir John Scott&mdash;has been used for building houses, and building houses of such a character that he cannot live in them&mdash;they are too dear. Before the Unemployment Committee there came up a statement on housing which ought to be burned into the mind of every member of the House&mdash; a quarter of the population of Dublin living in one-roomed tenements, and in the opinion of responsible witnesses, speaking for the Ministry opposite, no human prospect, as far as we can see under present conditions, of building houses which these people will be able to live in.  If that is the policy of denationalised Labour, if it is their policy to keep in existence restrictions, to keep in existence difficulties, which will make it humanly impossible for the poor people to pay the rent for the houses in which they can live, then the sooner denationalised Labour gets out of the road, and leaves the road clear for someone who will build these houses, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am going to suggest in relation to houses is this: that we take a house such as those people could live in, that we find the price at which that house could be built if there were no restrictions of any kind&mdash;if there were no restrictions of capital, if there were no restrictions of ground rent, if there were no restrictions of labour&mdash;I mean no avoidable restrictions in all cases&mdash;if there were no restriction of a Local Government Department's specification; and when we had found what that house would cost, what that class of house was in which the people could live, then we would segregate that house. That house will never be built under present conditions; it will never be built under the supervision of &ldquo;brasshatted&rdquo;<Col N="1521" /> Labour; it will never be built under the present restrictions.  As far as those houses are concerned we should put all restrictions out of bounds, and we should build those houses as cheaply as we can with the best labour and the best material available, without taking into regard anybody's preconceptions. I believe upon that policy we can build houses in which the people can afford to live.</P>
    <P>We have put down an amendment here to reduce the expenditure by one million.  Of course that is only a beginning. We are not allowed, I understand, under the rules to connote that saving very strictly against any particular Vote here.  But I suggest that, at any rate, for this year a capital sum equivalent to £234,000 can be found by not electing the outgoing Senators who are due for election this year.  That is a fairly decent contribution towards the million pounds.  I voted in this House the other night for an increase in old age pensions.  I did not do that lightly and I did not do it willingly.  I did not willingly take the responsibility of putting one penny more on the cost of this State than was required, but I did it because it was just, and I did it because I was prepared myself to find the sources of revenue which would provide the money which was required for it without repudiating anything and without putting one single penny burden upon any legitimate activity of any member of this community.  Broadly speaking, when I vote for increased expenditure I shall do it with, at any rate, in the back of my mind the responsibility that we upon these Benches, either immediately or proximately, will have to stand over that expenditure, not merely for a year but for a considerable period, and that it is our business to envisage responsibly the duty and obligation of having in our mind, at any rate, the sources of supply of revenue before we vote them.

      <P>So long as nobody is under the impression that I am running away from defending my position it is quite enough for me.  Broadly speaking, the ignorant, uneconomic policy of those who degrade the name of Labour by parading themselves as a Party as such, is that you must get everything done, but that you must not do anything to get it done.  &ldquo;No straw shall be given to you,&rdquo; you say to the industrialists, &ldquo;but yet ye shall deliver the taille reckoned.&rdquo;  I know that the burden upon industry in this country is too high.  I know that there are temptations, quite legitimate temptations, in other directions for the use of their capital.  I know no way of forcing fluid capital into any industry. I want fluid capital working in the industries of this country, and, for that reason, I say that the only way to do it is to give it definite inducement. We might not have to move the reduction of a million or a penny if there was in operation in this country an industrial and economic policy which would make for production.  I believe the very best way in which you can tend to get rid of the necessity for moving a reduction of this kind, and the very best way you can get industry going, and get production going to the extent that it can bear highly developed social services, is by a very large reduction of every burden which to-day lies upon enterprise and initiative in industry in Ireland.  I think the greatest and best of all these is the abolition of all income tax earned on money invested in the employment of Irish labour in Ireland.</P>

Nor do I wish to go through the many questions which were discussed yesterday afternoon in an extraordinarily discursive and wandering debate, but I would like to deal with a couple of the salient points made by Deputies on the Benches opposite when they suggest the reduction of this Vote by one million.</P>
      <P>The speeches of Deputy Ruttledge and Deputy Lemass, and of some other Deputies on the Benches opposite, yesterday, were characterised by another attack in the vituperative campaign which they are steadily and consistently carrying on in this House against the Civic Guards.  Time and again they make charges against that force.  They went into them yesterday also.  I do not know what objects Deputies opposite have at the back of their minds when they make these charges against this fine, well-ordered, well-disciplined, thoroughly efficient force.  It may be that they think by repeated attacks they will be able to shake the morale and undermine the discipline of that force.

      <P>Deputy Lemass informed us yesterday that he got complaints at his information bureau, of which I understood him to say he was in charge.  I will give a specimen of what these complaints are like and the reckless fashion in which they are made.  The other day not one, but a whole series of Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches, all shouting together, informed the House that information as to the whereabouts of the defendants in a certain case that came from Waterford had been asked for at the Depôt and was refused.  I knew nothing about the facts on that occasion.  It was the first time I heard the charge made, and I asked that a question should be put down.  Of course no question was put down. What were the facts?  On February 15th the solicitor for the plaintiffs wrote to the Civic Guard Depôt asking for information, and on the 17th of the same month they got the information they asked for.  That will show the reliability of the sources upon which Deputy Lemass and other Deputies in his Party rely.</P>
      <P>The Civic Guards were attacked.  I believe that in making that attack Deputies had not the sympathy of a single law-abiding citizen in this country.  I do think that when two Labour Deputies spoke yesterday and expressed their high appreciation of the Civic Guards and their efficient work and of all the good they have done for this country, they were voicing the true belief of every respectable citizen in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked for certain particulars as to the number of Civic Guards.  Deputy Lemass had given them, but, of course, again Deputy Lemass's information bureau was slightly at fault&mdash;to the extent of 800 men.  The actual number of Guards at the present moment is 7,210.  That takes in the entire Guard; it takes in the Metropolitan Division and takes in all the ordinary Civic Guards in the <Col N="1525" /> country.  Of this 7,210, 1,200 are employed in the Metropolitan area.  The figures for the Metropolitan area are practically the same as they were in 1913, when Dublin was policed by the Metropolitan Police.  The figure in December, 1913, was 1,211.  Everybody knows, and must know, that the duties of the police, especially in large cities, have enormously increased, but this year we are asking for 1,860 fewer police than there were in 1913, and 1913 was the low water mark of numbers in the Royal Irish Constabulary.  If you leave out the large towns, leave out Dublin, Cork and Limerick, you will find that there has been a reduction in the number of police in this country by 25 per cent.  We heard some little information about the barracks the other day.  I may inform the House that there are 836 Garda barracks in the Free State now, leaving out the cities again, as against 1,100 Royal Irish Constabulary stations in the year 1913.</P>

The duty of the police force is to prevent crime as far as it is preventible, and the duty of the police force is to detect crime when crime is being committed.  Their duty is to enforce the law and to see that every person inside the State obeys the law.

      <P>That is the grand attack with which I would like to deal this evening, but I will go on and for a moment or two deal with what has always been the great outcry on the part of the Fianna Fáil Deputies and their great cure for everything&mdash; reduce the high salaries and everything will be safe; reduce the salaries over <Col N="1527" /> £1,000 and everything will be all right. Well, Deputy Cooper gave figures to the House yesterday as to the amount of savings that could be effected by this means.  But I would suggest to Deputies that there is another way of looking at this too.  There can be no better expenditure of money than in getting the best brains of this country to do the most important work of this country, and this country cannot thrive, cannot flourish, cannot progress unless you have the best brains in the Civil Service which you can attract into it.  It is absolutely absurd to say that you should reduce salaries, do away with your efficient men, drive them out of the Civil Service and get in inefficients in their places.  That is what it means.  If you want a good man you must pay for his services. There are rival professions; there are plenty of professional men in this country who are getting much higher incomes than those earned by civil servants. There are plenty of men in business who are making far and away larger incomes than any civil servant is earning.  If you make the Civil Service so unattractive that men of first-class ability will not come into it, you will do irreparable injury to the country. You must make it attractive.  At present we have a Civil Service which is staffed by men of first-class ability and men also whose abilities have been developed to the fullest by the highest form of university education obtainable in this country.  It is these men and men like them that you require in the higher posts of the Civil Service and if you drive that type of man out and get uneducated men at a cheap rate to take their places and muddle the work, then, far from having a saving, you will be doing the greatest injury which you can do.</P>

      <P>The point made by Deputies who have spoken on the Government Benches is that Fianna Fáil Deputies are responsible for the over-taxation in the Twenty-six Counties.  That argument has been made full use of, not alone by Deputies here, but by the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation in the Twenty-six Counties, and their supporters, <Col N="1529" /> for the past five years.  That is a line of argument that is not alone threadbare but is dishonest.  The plain people of this country realise that it is the Deputies opposite, and they alone, are responsible for the extra taxation. What power have Deputies on this side of the House to raise taxation?  They have none.  The Government in power is solely responsible for the raising of taxation, and if there is blame for taxation being heavy and unjust, would it not be better for the Government to admit their responsibility, and not seek by subterfuge to blind the issue and use the Fianna Fáil organisation as a scapegoat? I submit that the real reason for the overtaxation is that when the Free State Government set up its institutions under the Treaty in 1921, it set up all these institutions on an Imperial basis, and on a lavish scale.  If the people of this country had the revenue of the British Government behind their backs they could afford to have all these Imperial institutions and employ a host of officials to serve in the Departments.  If the people of this country had the revenue and the wealth of the American Government behind their backs they could well afford to set them up on this colossal scale, but the American people would not be such fools as to tolerate the setting up of such Departments, and would not pay such large salaries as are being paid in this poor country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government in its day never spent such sums, and never overstaffed the Departments here, as the Government are doing to-day.  For instance, take the Local Government Department. The Estimate for that Department last year was £561,889.  That is for the Twenty-six Counties.  In 1918 and 1919 the expenditure on the Local Government Board was £129,861. The Local Government Board had to deal with 32 counties, with over 159 unions, hundreds of rural district councils, while to-day the Local Government Department deals only with one board of guardians, and one rural district council, as against hundreds there were in 1918-19.  The expenditure to-day on that one Department alone is more than four times what it was in 1918 and 1919.  Still it is said that the Fianna Fáil Deputies are responsible for the overtaxation. <Col N="1530" /> Are they or are they not responsible for this Department? Who is responsible for an expenditure of £561,889 now as against £129,861 in 1918 and 1919?  The salaries then paid amounted to £64,401 as against £85,422 to-day.  That is one Department.  If I had time to go into each of the Departments in detail, it could be shown that not alone could this £1,000,000 be saved upon these Departments, but millions could be saved for the Irish people.  Deputy Wolfe stated yesterday that the Department of Justice is under-staffed.  Perhaps it is.  I do not know, but I do know that the taxpayers are fast approaching bankrputcy in trying to keep up these Imperial institutions.  An opportunity should be given for reducing this taxation, to let people live in this country, and not have them flying from it as if they were flying from a plague.</P>

      <P>Now that the House has recovered from the flood of oratory of Deputy Hugo Flinn, now that he has told the brass-hatted Labour Party how to construct houses, now that he has told us that he had in the back of his mind a way to find the money for the increase in the old age pensions, that caused him such considerable qualms of conscience before he could vote for it, we were waiting to hear how that money was to be found, and the manner in which Deputy Flinn proposed to find it.  But I regret to say that the scheme is still at the back of his mind, and it looks very like as if it is going to remain there. Deputy Flinn mentioned a sum of, I think, £150,000 for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  He told the House that that was a huge sum to spend upon the industry and commerce of the country.  He did not tell the width, ramification and the important duties of that particular Department, and he did not tell the various questions that that Department has to deal with: statistics, industrial production, transport and marine, trade and industry, geological survey, unemployment, railways, and I might mention finally, the initiation of the Shannon scheme. It has been suggested by some of the best brains in this country that the work at present devolving on that particular <Col N="1531" /> Department is far in excess of what it can carry.  It has been suggested by some of the best brains in this country that there should be an additional Minister to deal with the transport question.  Anyone familiar with conditions prevailing in transport in the city of Dublin at present&mdash;and I think I might apply that to provincial districts as well as to the metropolis&mdash; knows that it is a matter of pressing, urgent, and immediate necessity.  Deputy Flinn, the new apostle, who spoke on behalf of the working class, whose panacea to help the workers of this country is the abolition of income tax, did not tell the House, as he should have done, how he proposed to find the three or four millions of revenue that is at present derived from such taxation. I presume, just like finding the money for the old age pensions, it is still in the back of his mind, and that it will still stay there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hugo Flinn in a prolonged, weary and boring speech, continued in a sort of serial form&mdash;begun yesterday and concluded to-day&mdash;told us that this State of ours should be run upon business lines.  Now, being an ordinary, commonsense, plain business-man myself, I watched very carefully the business lines upon which Deputy Flinn proposed to travel.  Deputy Hugo Flinn told us about some mythical concern on the far side of the Channel.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hugo Flinn told us about the firm of Vickers, how an accountant was brought in, how all the various departments were organised and how various schemes of reform were inaugurated.  These schemes of reform, summed up briefly, amounted to the relegation of the unfit to the scrap heap.  The scheme Deputy Hugo Flinn propounded was simply this: that in that business concern anybody who did not earn for the firm a measure of income in proportion to the wage he drew out was at once thrown upon the scrap heap.  That may be all very well in private concerns, in private business companies.  We are all <Col N="1532" /> aware that private business companies are run for profit.  They have no concern with the needs of the people; they have no duties cast upon them such as the Government Party here have; they do not profess that all-embracing doctrine that Fianna Fáil professes&mdash;that it is the duty of any Government Party who may happen to run this nation to find a means of subsistence for every man in this State.  How can you square ideas of that sort with the running of an ordinary private commercial concern?</P>
      <P>Deputy Hugo Flinn did not tell the House, if it was Messrs.  Vickers he was dealing with, that the share capital of that company has been written down by something like half.  Are we to act upon similar lines in carrying out the affairs of this nation?  The thing is as absurd as it is ridiculous.  Does Deputy Hugo Flinn suggest that we ought to scrap old age pensions?</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Hugo Flinn suggest that we should refuse to pay pensions to retired civil servants?  Each and every one of this class has done his bit for the State, and I presume they earn, or they have earned, what they are now receiving? According to Deputy Hugo Flinn, those people who are no longer in a position to bring in any income for the State, no matter what they have done in the past for the country, are to be thrown ruthlessly aside and are to receive no consideration from the hands of the Government.  I fail to see how such a doctrine as that can square with the Fianna Fáil doctrine&mdash;that they, if they come into office, are going to take on the cardinal duty of finding means of subsistence for every citizen of the State.  All I can say is that, listening to Deputy Hugo Flinn, I did think his aspirations lay more in the direction of finance than in the sphere of industry and commerce.  As far as industry and commerce are concerned, and as far as sound political economics are concerned, Deputy Hugo Flinn has not the slightest conception of their meaning. <Col N="1533" /> Deputy Hugo Flinn has one very remarkable bent.  If Deputy Hugo Flinn turned his talents to the realm of romance, I think in time he would outrival Jules Verne or Alexandre Dumas. I do suggest that it will be a very evil day for this nation, that it will be a very evil day for the old age pensioners, a very evil day for the workmen of this country, and a very evil day for the common everyday individual of the State, if this abolitionist of the income tax, Deputy Hugo Flinn, should ever have the handling of the finances of this nation.  I do think that we are perfectly safe in believing that that day will never come.</P>

      <P>Two calm and reasoned speeches were delivered, if I may say so without any impertinence and with the greatest respect.  Two very sensible speeches came from the front Opposition Benches.  One was delivered by Deputy Ruttledge and the other by Deputy Lemass.  Both of these Deputies endeavoured to deal with the subject in a fair, reasonable, commonsense way, and they are entitled to the respect of this House for the manner in which they dealt with the subject.  Deputy Ruttledge said the present expenditure of the country was extravagant; that it was beyond the means of the country, and that the country was being run on an imperial scale.  In looking at a proposition of that nature, the first thing one would reasonably ask oneself is this: what has been the financial policy of the Government within recent years?  Has it been a policy of reckless expenditure? Has it been the policy rashly to embark upon various wild-cat schemes? Anybody who has given the slightest consideration whatever to financial matters is perfectly well aware that the Government policy in matters of finance has been one of extreme caution.  It has been one of deliberate, regular, persistent retrenchment, and that retrenchment is shown by the very fact that within the past five years <Col N="1534" /> the bill of the taxpayer has been reduced by the gigantic sum of almost twenty millions sterling.  The figure in 1923-24 stood at £42,278,000, and to-day we are asked to foot a bill for £22,423,000.  I think, in view of those figures, that the contention of Deputy Ruttledge that we are running this nation upon imperial lines is one that cannot be sustained.</P>
      <P>If one looks for a moment at the present expenditure of the country, it may be divided under two heads.  The first head is essential services, and by essential services I suggest is meant the spending of money upon the actual social wants and needs of the people; upon such things as primary, secondary and technical education; upon such things as old age pensions, insurance, unemployment relief and housing schemes, and various other matters which come under that head.  If we look for a moment at what may be termed essential services, what are the figures that are being spent by the Free State Exchequer?  The bill for these services amounts to almost ten and a half millions.  For Old Age Pensions we have £2,317,000; for Education, £4,350,000; Health Insurance, £342,000; Agriculture, £607,000; Posts and Telegraphs, £2,500,000; Fisheries, £85,000; Unemployment £225,000; Relief Schemes, £32,000, totalling in round figures about £10,500,000.  What I ask Deputies on the opposite side, who are really animated by a desire to contribute to this debate in a spirit of helpfulness and good-will in the interests of the nation is, which of these particular services can be reduced?  I know the Deputy on my left, with a semi-idiotic smile, and who has made no contribution to this debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I withdraw it. The Deputy with the smile on his face can give us no contribution to this debate.  We expect something better from the Deputies sitting on those Benches.  The real problem the Government has got to face is not the question of increasing expenditure; it is really a question of keeping expenditure down. The Minister for Finance told us, when we were passing the Vote at Christmas <Col N="1535" /> for the relief of the unemployed, that that was the maximum amount he could find for that purpose.  There was scarcely a single Party in this House, including our own Party, that did not use every possible argument to persuade the Minister that such an amount was hopelessly inadequate.  Recently we had here a very long debate upon the old age pensions question, and it was urged upon the Government to increase existing pensions by the sum of £500,000.</P>
      <P>I may say, speaking on that particular matter, that I was one of the individuals who, in an individual capacity, endeavoured to get the Minister for Finance to come forward and increase the old age pensions to these old people.  But I knew that this money had got to be found.  The Minister for Finance is the man who has to find it. It is all very well for Deputies to talk in an airy and polite fashion of what we have in the back of our minds.  That will not fill the Free State Exchequer coffers, and if the money is not forthcoming something serious will happen. The Minister for Education told us that so far as his particular Department was concerned there was not the slightest hope of a reduction.  What I want to ask the Deputies on the Opposition Benches, those of them who are really interested in running the country in as sane and economical a fashion as it can be run, which of these services are we going to reduce?  Is it suggested that we can afford to reduce the Vote for Education?  I have had some experience of the differences in education between the child educated in the Saorstát and the child educated at the other side of the water, and there is absolutely no comparison in the educational standard between the child educated here and the child educated across the water.  The handicap of lack of education has been hampering the children of this country for generations past.  I, myself, know what it is to suffer from this lack of education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>For that reason I do say that we cannot possibly afford to reduce the expenditure on this essential <Col N="1536" /> service.  Deputy Lemass, a speaker to whom we all listen with the very greatest attention in this House, has suggested that this country could be run upon a figure approximating to £12,000,000 or £13,000,000.  I have taken the figures carefully and calmly from the Estimates.</P>

      <P>I have used no rhetoric in laying these figures before the House.  Each of these figures is perfectly accurate, and I have shown to the House that on essential services at the present moment we are spending £10,500,000.  I have endeavoured to place these services before you as briefly as I possibly can.  In this £10,500,000 there is no possible hope of a reduction in this coming year.  This sort of talk that we have heard here on these Estimates is all very well for propaganda on the hustings.  But when we come into this Assembly we ought to forget all such airy nonsense.  When one is on a platform one can say things to what sometimes may not be a very intelligent audience, but in this House we ought to expect reason and logic and common sense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The setting up of this Saorstát as a separate political entity has involved the creation of certain indispensable services which run into a figure amounting to practically £6,000,000.  We have on the Vote for the Oireachtas a sum of £116,000, for the Army £1,804,000, for the Governor-General £6,800, temporary commissions £10,000, property losses compensation £548,000, broadcasting £27,000, beet sugar £274,000, public works £1,022,000, Gárda Síochána £1,621,000, railways £82,000, External Affairs £46,500, Army pensions £96,000, all roughly coming to about £6,000,000. What fact can we deduce from this brief examination of the summary that I have placed before you?  We have on the one hand to spend upon the essential services of the country a sum of about £10,500,000, and we have to spend upon new services that I have enumerated over £6,000,000.  These two figures together amount to about £16,623,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimates are something like £22,000,000.  So that we have a balance of about £6,000,000 to run the whole remaining services of the State, including the Department of Industry and Commerce, which, according to the Deputy who has been criticising it very adversely, is badly run.  I do respectfully suggest that it is time, in the interests of the nation, that the position with regard to talking, silly propaganda from the Benches opposite should cease.  I will venture to say that in the matter of one particular Vote, the Vote for the beet sugar industry, of which the Estimate this year is £274,000, this expenditure has actively circulated into many other Irish industries, including Irish railways, Irish manufacturing firms and in wages to the men employed in it. The first item that we have in connection with the sugar beet industry is £100,000 in the way of wages; the second item, £68,000 to Irish railways; the next item is £30,000 paid to Irish insurance companies; then we have £30,000 to Irish manufacturers for Irish material.  There is a total of £228,000 spent amongst these particular <Col N="1538" /> sections of the people as a result of that particular Vote.</P>

      <P>I have also to add the figure of £255,000 which has been paid to the Irish farmers for their beet.  Anybody who has listened to these debates, especially when the Deputies on the opposite Benches were criticising that particular Vote, could see how the farmers, who sit on both sides of the House, appreciated the spending of that particular sum of money.</P>
      <P>I think I have shown that the proposed reduction of £1,000,000 is an utter impossibility, and that Deputies, no matter on what Benches they may sit, if they are disposed to treat the matter in a fair and reasonable way, will agree that we of the Government Party have been acting in the best interests of the country.  We have done that in the past, and as we intend to do the same in the future, I propose to vote for the motion introduced by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I am afraid members on both sides of the House have been more anxious to score points against each other in debate than to find ways and means of educing, as we consider it, this very heavy expenditure.  It is all very well to say that this Vote on Account cannot be reduced, and to endeavour to score points against opponents, to attempt to make out a case for the retention of this very heavy expenditure. The people in the country, unfortunately, cannot take that point of view. They are being crushed under the weight of this heavy taxation.  I think it is up to each and every one of us to do all we can to reduce it, and to try to meet the wishes of the people. I do not want to criticise in detail a lot of what has been said on the other side of the House, but I hold that a case has been made for a considerable reduction in this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the fisheries, anyone who has read the debates that took place here during the last few years on the Vote for that Department will see that members on the opposite Benches took very strong views indeed as regards the expenditure under that Department. Reading through the report of the Fisheries Conference, one can see that the expenditure has not been justified by results, and that the criticism levelled against the Department was well justified.  Though this Department has, I understand, been in existence for about five years, the position with regard to our Irish fisheries is really deplorable. The Department has had charge of them during the last five years, and yet the position as regards them is one of utter hopelessness and no progress. I think it is desirable to scrap that Department absolutely, and thereby save the country a sum of £50,000 a year. That is the approximate figure for that Department this year, and personally, I cannot see any justification for the proposed expenditure.  I think if the <Col N="1540" /> Department were scrapped and some other body formed to take over its work that expenditure could be reduced. In connection with the Civic Guards, I appreciate the point made by the Minister for Justice, that the number of men has been reduced since 1913.  We hold, however, that the number is still too large.</P>

      <P>The number of Civic Guards in remote country areas where the people are quiet and peaceable and where there is no crime whatsoever, is still too large.  In these remote areas, too, very expensive barracks costing, in some instances, £1,500, have been built in the last few years. The building of them is still going on. I do not think it is necessary to have these expensive buildings put up in remote areas, or to have maintained there large bodies of men who really have very little to do.  With all the goodwill in the world, and granting that the men were anxious to do all they possibly could to earn the pay they are getting, I think some of them find it hard to get enough to do.  I think there is no case whatever for retaining these men in remote areas of the country which are in a peaceable condition.  Another way in which to bring about a considerable reduction in the strength of the Civic Guard would be to stop recruiting for it.  That should be done until its strength was brought to a level that would be quite sufficient to meet the needs of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one Department to which I wish to refer.  It does not cost a very large amount of money, but its work is causing a considerable amount of criticism in many of the towns in the country.  It is known as the Local Authorities Combined Purchasing Department, and comes under the Local Government Department.  I have had complaints from firms in the city of Waterford to the effect that this body interfered very severely with their business, and that it practically prevented them contracting for stores to local institutions.  These firms hold that they could supply goods at as cheap or even a cheaper rate than the <Col N="1541" /> firms listed with the Department.  The Department did not approve of their tenders, and the result has been that while they are local ratepayers they have lost contracts, and the ratepayers have not benefited to any extent.  This complaint may be justified or it may not.</P>

      <P>I refuse to believe that the speech delivered here this evening by Deputy Flinn represents the considered judgment and opinion of the Party with which he is now associated. If the Labour Party, which he has attacked in such eloquent language, is as anti-National as he now seems to think, will he explain, or will those who follow him in the debate explain, why the leader and members of his Party were prepared to go into the division lobby in August last and, by their vote, if they secured a majority, make it possible for the members of our Party to form the Executive Government of this country?  I would like the members of Deputy Flinn's Party who are to speak after him to say how, if the <Col N="1542" /> Labour Party is so anti-National as Deputy Flinn now seems to think, they can explain their attitude on that particular occasion?  I am not concerned in this debate with giving an advertisement to Deputy Flinn, but the Deputy in his discourse went out of his way apparently to make an attack upon his colleague, Deputy Anthony, a member of our Party who represents the City of Cork with him.  Deputy Flinn talked about the Labour Party being anti-National, and referred particularly to Deputy Anthony, but what are the facts?  The facts, as far as I can find them out from the results of the last General Election, are that Deputy Anthony polled 5,668 first preference votes in that election, whereas Deputy Flinn apparently only secured the votes of those who want no income tax, He only secured votes to the extent of 1,236 and got in by a short head.</P>
      <P>These figures speak for themselves. We are, of course, asked here now to picture Deputy Flinn in a different position from that in which we knew him when he was Mr. Flinn and before he came into this House.  I knew of him only from what I read in the newspapers, and from the knowledge so gained I regarded and looked on him as the champion of rich people, those who live on the dividends they receive from their incomes and want to increase their incomes, unearned, by refusing to pay income tax.  Now the Deputy comes into the House and takes up a dual role, that of representing people who want to pay no income tax and therefore refuse to provide money for the building of houses, and at the same time saying that he rather unwillingly voted a few days ago to restore the shilling cut to the old age pensioners. Now I think anybody who gives the matter any consideration will come to the conclusion that Deputy Flinn cannot occupy the dual role, representing those who live on interest and dividends they receive from their money and who are claiming that they should pay no income tax, and at the same time claim that he represents the poor and the people concerned with the restoration of the shilling cut in the old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been given three reasons, but we have not been given the detailed figures which go to make up the amount <Col N="1543" /> of the proposed reduction in this Vote. A reduction of £1,000,000 is asked for, but no details have been given as to how that is to be made up.  If we are to follow the debate and disregard figures or details in support of the claim for reduction, it will be found it can be done by doing away with the Army and reducing what has been called a political force known as the Gárda Síochána.  In addition, we have the suggestion from Deputy Flinn that the Seanad should be abolished, or reduced by that number who are in the ordinary way bound to seek re-election this year.  My main complaint against the Vote on Account is that the Minister has not in certain respects provided sufficient money to carry on productive services to help to relieve unemployment. We all admit the necessity for relieving unemployment as expeditiously as possible.  As to the speeches of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have spoken in favour of the reduction of the Vote by £1,000,000, I am forced to the conclusion, having read the debate which took place in this House on 15th November on the unemployment motion by Deputy Morrissey, that they have forgotten what they said on that occasion.  If the speeches made by Fianna Fáil Deputies on that motion are a correct version of their considered judgment as to what should be done, and how it should be done, to relieve unemployment, then we should not be reducing this Vote by £1,000,000, but increasing it by £4,000,000 or £5,000,000.  I say to the Fianna Fáil Deputies: &ldquo;Look up your speeches and do not forget what you said on 15th November.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I served my apprenticeship in this House for a considerable time, and I agree that Deputy Briscoe cannot be allowed to drag a red herring across the debate at this particular stage.  We are asked to <Col N="1544" /> agree to the abolition of the Army. People on the Government Benches talk of the necessity for maintaining the Army at a certain strength for certain reasons, or until such time as they are satisfied there is no further fear of civil strife.  Again, Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches with a military outlook say they would not do away with the Army altogether, but they would have an army of a different type. I think I know sufficient of what has happened in the last four or five years to realise the army that Fianna Fáil Deputies would have if they got control. It would not be an army that would give their services freely and for nothing.  It would cost something. Let us hear from them when they talk of an army what, in their opinion, the defence forces of the country would cost under any Government set up by the Fianna Fáil Party.  We would then be able to judge as to the difference in the cost of the present Army as compared with the army under the Fianna Fáil Government.  When people talk about having an army composed of a certain number of men forming fours in barrack squares and at the same time talk about defending this country, one has to laugh.  With regard to the defence of this country, surely that should consist of submarines and air forces?  It is on such forces that this island country would have to depend when defending itself against external aggression.  Coming to the Gárda Síochána, I deeply regretted to hear Deputy Lemass, who is rightly one of the accredited leaders of his Party, talk of the protective police force as a political force.  That is a dangerous way for Deputy Lemass to talk when one realises that he may yet be in the position of being head of the police force.  How would he like, if Minister for Justice in a Fianna Fáil Government, to hear the police force under his administration referred to as a political force?</P>

      <P>If the Fianna Fáil Party come into power, the citizens of this country are not going to stand to attention and carry out all orders shouted at them by Deputy Lemass or <Col N="1545" /> Deputy Smith.  There has been too much demoralisation created as a result of the political strife in the past few years to imagine that we are going to have an ideal state of affairs when the Fianna Fáil Party come into power.  I think we should refrain from talking of the police force in existence as a purely political force.  There may be side lines.  I suppose Deputy Lemass has in mind people who go about at election times and do a certain amount of bludgeoning, but I ask him to realise that such people are not members of the protective forces known as the Gárda Síochána.  As far as I know they are not, and I know there is no necessity for them.  I admit that I would vote for a reduction which would deprive us of the services of these people. We have seen evidence in connection with this on matters that have appeared in the Press on quite recent occasions.  I criticise the Ministry in this Vote for their failure to find sufficient money under the heading of Local Government for housing, and similarly, so far as the Ministry of Finance is concerned, with regard to drainage works.  The Land Commission, in my opinion, does not provide all the money it should for carrying out improvements of estates which would give a good deal of productive employment.  With regard to the Board of Works Vote, what is the position as to drainage as compared with last year?  A sum of £50,000 was provided in the Vote last year for carrying out arterial drainage schemes. What is the amount this year under the same heading, a year in which one would imagine more productive work would be done than has been done in the past?  This year we have a sum of £28,000 as against £50,000 last year. Deputy Boland and Deputy Gorry, who represent the Fianna Fáil Party, and who are colleagues of mine in the same constituency, know perfectly well that there is a justifiable demand from that constituency for the carrying out of schemes submitted by local authorities to the Board of Works three or four years ago.  I am at one with Deputy Boland and Deputy Gorry that these schemes are useful, inasmuch as they make land which is useless valuable and give <Col N="1546" /> an amount of employment, but money will have to be found to carry out such work.  I criticise and condemn the Government for not having found more money this year for that purpose.  The Arterial Drainage Act was passed nearly three years ago, and so far as it affects one county in my constituency, not even one of the schemes submitted three or four years ago has been carried out.  Can these schemes be carried out by reducing this Vote?  Are Deputies Boland and Gorry going to walk into the Division Lobby in favour of reducing this Vote by £1,000,000 and at the same time say that they want arterial drainage schemes carried out?</P>

      <P>Now, as regards housing, in connection with the Estimates of the Local Government Department, in so far as they provide money for carrying out housing schemes under the Housing Facilities Acts of 1925 and 1926, under which grants were given to individuals for the building or reconstruction of houses, we have a reduction of the remarkable sum of £85,000.  Think of all we heard about a national housing scheme from Deputy Flinn.  This Deputy, who spoke so long and eloquently but with very little common sense, is going to walk into the division lobby and vote for a reduction in the Vote of one million pounds, and thereby prevent this money being spent in that direction.  I realise for the first time that Deputy Flinn wants the workers in the building trade to work for nothing, if necessary, and to build houses for the people whom he wants them built for.  He talked about removing the financial restrictions and restrictions from the labour side, but he never said a word about removing the rent restrictions.  He was willing <Col N="1547" /> to erect all the houses that could be built by cheap, almost by slave, labour, and allow thousands of citizens to fight in the open market for houses and pay whatever the landlord could get for them.  That is Deputy Flinn's policy. If Deputy Flinn and the people for whom he speaks could abolish income tax they would increase their own incomes, but when he talks about the abolition of income tax he is not much concerned about the thirty thousand people in Dublin who are looking for houses under the best conditions they can get them.  He has not said much on behalf of the thousands of workers in the building trade in Dublin who are out of work.  If he has his way they will work on his conditions.  There is nothing between him and Deputy Good so far as the conditions in the building trade are concerned.</P>

      <P>There was a good deal of criticism of the Land Commission on a recent occasion here regarding the division and acquisition of untenanted land and the carrying out of necessary improvement work on estates when they are divided and handed over to suitable allottees.  There was a good deal of criticism during the debate on the Estimates last year in regard to the same matter, but I notice that the Estimates this year for such improvement work on estates, which, as Deputies know, gives a good deal of employment, is only for a sum of £323,000.  Are Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Derrig satisfied that that figure represents the limit of the sum which they would fix, if they had responsibility, for necessary improvement work on estates when divided all over the country for one particular financial year?  Are they of opinion that that sum is too large?  Is that one of the reasons that they are going into the <Col N="1548" /> division lobby in favour of reducing this Vote?

Deputy Lemass is an expert on the question of annuities.  He knows that the annuities to which he refers and which are exported are annuities collected under Acts previous to 1923. The complaint I have to make&mdash;and I have to make it in common with other Deputies of the Labour Party&mdash;is that the Government, under certain heads, have not provided all the money which we think should be provided for carrying out national works which would give valuable employment.  The Fianna Fáil Party say: &ldquo;Do away with the Army.  Throw fifteen thousand men on the scrap-heap.  Add fifteen thousand to the list of unemployed.  Do away with a certain number of the Gárda Síochána&rdquo;&mdash;I do not know how many. Their policy is to add to the list of the unemployed without indicating where these men can be employed.</P>

I would like to be in Deputy Anthony's position, to be a Deputy for Cork, so that I could make use of the speech that Deputy Flinn made in the House this evening.  It is a very valuable speech from the Labour point of view.  Do not take it that I am blaming <Col N="1550" /> him in any way for having made that speech.  On the other hand, we have here in the Relief Scheme Vote&mdash;a Vote which provides employment of a temporary nature, unfortunately I admit&mdash; a sum of £32,000 as against £150,000 last year.  Surely we are not to understand from the speeches made here this evening that that sum is too large. Then let us, before this debate concludes, have the details that go to make up the million pounds.  You cannot take it in rough noughts if you are to have any responsibility for running the country or for relieving the position of the unemployed.</P>

In my remarks I want to point out, and I hope I have given good reason for it, why I should criticise the Government for not giving more money than they are asking for on this occasion, money which, under the headings I have enumerated, would go a long way towards the relief of the unemployment that exists in every constituency, without adding in other ways, to <Col N="1551" /> the unemployment that now exists in our midst.</P>

      <P>I am not going to devote any portion of my speech either to the personal consideration, which would be a great deal, or even to the consideration of the argument of the Deputy from Cork who does not speak with a Cork accent.  As I am on the subject of the Cork accent, I think it is only fair to Deputy Anthony to say that when there was a little cooing from the top Benches opposite he would not like to acknowledge that the accent came from Cork.  Therefore he did not make any reference on that occasion to the Cork accent.  What is this amendment?  A reduction of a million on the Vote on Account?  Remember, it is not to be justified by saying how you could make a reduction of one million pounds on the total Estimate, but how you can make a three millions reduction on the total Estimate.  I think that there has been a certain confusion on the Benches opposite as to what precisely they are asking for, not on the part of the Deputy who moved the amendment, because he made it quite clear that what he demanded was a reduction of one million on a third of the Estimate. Therefore they demand three millions on the whole Estimate.  In the course of the argument, it began to be quite clear that Deputies should not have limited themselves to a reduction of three millions.  They should have demanded a reduction of twelve or thirteen millions.  In the speeches made, this argument seems to have faded completely away, because it was repudiated more than once.  They began the argument on certain statements, and also on the taxable capacity of this country and Great Britain and the amount of taxes levied in Great Britain.  They began to argue that on that basis the taxes raised here in the Free State should be twelve millions. They went on to make the very definite statement&mdash;I think it was made by Deputy Ruttledge, and more or less repeated by Deputy Lemass afterwards&mdash; that twelve millions is the ouside amount which we can afford to spend on the machinery of Government, and <Col N="1552" /> that we are spending double that, and more than double that.  They said that thirteen millions is wasted in unproductive Government services&mdash;thirteen millions that might be saved for the building up of industry.  If Deputies are really serious, why do they limit themselves to two millions or three millions?  Why, if they are not merely throwing dust in the eyes of the people do they not demand, as they have done on outside platforms, that the taxation of the country should be reduced by thirteen millions?  Why stop at one million or three millions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You can keep quiet occasionally.  I have listened to the meanderings of the Deputies that all of that thirteen millions was an expense on the Government of this country.  These are the statements of Deputies who made use of that particular argument.  The Deputy who has interrupted has not spoken up to the present.  He can explain how you can expend that thirteen millions on the Government.  On these particular estimates, we have listened undoubtedly to speeches that meandered and which have certainly the outstanding characteristic of vagueness.  I thought that at times Deputy Lemass must have striven very heroically to convince himself and the House that he was really dealing with the motion under discussion.  I confess&mdash;possibly he may not think that I am impartial&mdash;that I am not surprised that Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Davin thought that there was no case made for the reduction mentioned in the amendment. Could any person listening to this debate come to any other decision?  The Government admit that taxation is high and they would like to reduce it.  Not merely do they admit it but they have proclaimed it.  They have proclaimed it and said it on occasions when it was unpopular to say it.  They have had to insist on it when there was a demand made for expenditure of money that would be popular.  It is true that some Deputies, when it comes to taxation, take the popular side and demand a reduction in expenditure, and then when it comes to spending money, they <Col N="1553" /> take the equally popular side of putting in a demand for more money.  That has been done by the Deputies opposite. Only very rarely has it been done by the Labour Party.  They have at least been consistent.  They have always been consistent here.  They have realised that you cannot have a decrease in the total expenditure and an increase in every item, which is practically the tale we have listened to every year here. We listened to it before the Fianna Fáil Deputies came into the House.  They have not, possibly, much experience here, but they have at least learned to make that particularly hearty demand for less expenditure and at the same time and in almost the same breath, a demand for more expenditure.  You have Deputies who went into the Lobby last week for the full restoration of the old age pensions, now crying out against an increase in taxation.  When speaking in the debate on old age pensions last week&mdash;I was dealing with a suggestion made to do away with army pensions&mdash;there was an interruption which, if it meant anything, meant more pensions for people who had given the country military service of a certain kind.  In the Official Debates that interruption was attributed to one of the Labour Deputies, but it actually came from one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies. There is this demand for increased expenditure where the demand is popular, and a demand for decreased taxation where that demand is popular.  That is what one Deputy, facing up to the situation, meant when he said they would never do popular things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going into the question as to why taxation was high.  I think it was Deputy Hogan suggested that the amount of money spent was altogether attributable to the previous or other activities of the members of his Party. As to whether they in any way contributed to it, it is for Deputies and the people to judge.  He said they are not responsible for increased taxation. Why are they not?  Because they did not impose it.  You are not responsible for increased taxation unless you impose it!  The fact is that you are responsible for increased taxation if you make the imposition of that taxation by the Government necessary.  It is <Col N="1554" /> very like the question, &ldquo;Who started the civil war?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Will Deputies consider the proposal to reduce these particular items of expenditure and show how it can be done?  Comparisons with the amount roughly estimated to be spent in this country by the British Government in pre-war times and before the truce may have some use, but they are not very useful unless they are accompanied by an examination, and I hope, when the opportunity comes, when these items are being discussed in detail, that Deputies will show where the extravagance is and how the economies can be effected.  We had a brilliant suggestion of economy outlined in connection with the Department of Industry and Commerce, to divide the Vote into a productive portion and non-productive portion and give the productive portion of it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and transfer the rest elsewhere. Is that economy?  Does that help to save the State any money?  If the Department of Statistics is put under one Minister and not under another Minister, does that save the cost of that particular sub-Department? Is it not trifling with the whole situation to bring forward an argument of that kind in a deliberative Assembly such as this?  Comparisons as to the cost of government, unless you compare the services rendered, do not lead anywhere. One Deputy said that Deputy Cooper put his finger on the point when he stated that there were responsibilities and services undertaken when this became a free country that were not debited to this country formerly. That was misunderstood in the most <Col N="1555" /> extraordinary way, though the Deputy gave very little ground for misunderstanding, because he enumerated actual services that have now to be undertaken which were not, so to speak, debited to the account of this country in pre-Treaty days.  Nothing is easier, as long as you confine yourself to vague statements, than to promise a reduction, even though you have not made up your mind whether the amount of the reduction is £3,000,000 or £13,000,000.  After all, what is a million more or less, or ten millions more or less, to Deputies who speak in that vague fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been accused of endeavouring to run this country on a grand Imperial scale&mdash;that they are maintaining services entirely out of keeping with what is proper and efficient for this State.  One or two instances were mentioned.  The Board of Works and the Land Commission, I think, were mentioned.  What are the complaints?  Here again Deputy Davin was consistent, because he has done nothing in the debate that he and the members of his Party, and even the other Party opposite, have not been doing at question time, and at other times, practically every day since the House has assembled.  What is really behind all this is, that there is delay in the work of the Departments, even though these Departments are now doing very much more work and accomplishing certain work for the advantage of the country at a quicker rate than ever before.  The complaint is that they are not going fast enough.  Yet the people who make that complaint, and who incidentally waste a great deal of Departmental time by asking useless questions, now complain of the over-staffing of the Departments.  Either they are serious in demanding that certain work shall be done by Government Departments or they are not.  If they are, they should not come along and complain that a demand is made by the Government for the particular staff necessary to carry it out.  There were a couple of interruptions when Deputy Davin was speaking which suggest that Deputies have not looked at the Estimates we are discussing.  Does anybody seriously suggest that the business of <Col N="1556" /> the Land Commission is confined to the collection of annuities?  Even if a Deputy has not read the Estimates if he looks at the Question portion of the Order Paper any day he will see that the Land Commission deals with a great many other things than that.  I wonder if Deputies ever heard&mdash;I imagine from the questions put that they must have heard&mdash;of such things as the division of estates, improvement works, and unemployment works of various kinds which are carried out by the Land Commission.  I see one Deputy is hardly able to restrain himself from interrupting.</P>

Is there one of these highly-placed men, as the Minister for Justice pointed out, who would not get a much higher salary if engaged in some profession or business outside?  If these men brought the same amount of <Col N="1557" /> ability, earnestness and hard work to a profession or business in the country they would earn a great deal more than they get as members of the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>What are the savings?  Where are we as regards these savings?  The Fianna Fáil Party have not spoken with one voice on this question.  As regards civil servants, even Deputy Ryan, in an interruption of the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, said he would deal with all salaries over £1,000 a year.  Another Deputy would go much further.  He did not actually adopt the economic policy of &ldquo;sacking the lot,&rdquo; but he, more or less, suggested that of the head officials at least half could go.  He suggested it&mdash;he did not state it&mdash;so that he could get out of it; of the 800 in another Department possibly 200 would be pensioned off, and all in the sacred cause of economy! Deputy Cooper was criticised because, to use the words of one Deputy, he &ldquo;put his finger on the spot&rdquo; and said that we had undertaken new obligations. Deputies scoffed at that and did not pretend to understand it.  I quite believe they did not understand it.  The obligations that we undertook in 1922 referred to by Deputy Cooper, were the obligations of freedom, and I quite believe that Deputies opposite do not understand what freedom involves and what it is worth.</P>

      <P>Is that one of the Imperial services?  There is an item of £1,200,000 for agricultural rates.  Is that one of the expenses of the &ldquo;machinery of government&rdquo; that is to be cut down?  Then there is the sugar beet industry and so on.  Is it suggested seriously that these things can be cut down?  Deputy Byrne, in the course of his speech, pointed out that if you tot up items of that kind, which are items collected by the Government and given back&mdash;I am speaking of the money that goes back to the people, not the cost of administration&mdash;you get well over £10,000,000. Still the whole of the Budget is to be cut down to £12,000,000.  Reference was made to the expenditure of £1,000,000 on public works.  Have Deputies asked themselves why that expenditure is necessary?  Why is it necessary to build Gárda barracks? Why is it necessary to have big expenses for other items?  If they had even gone to the trouble to read what is included in the Estimates, they would see that the one million there is wanted for public works.  Are they confusing as one sum, and interpreting as one Vote, the Vote for the Department of Public Works and the Vote for the money to be spent on public works and buildings and various other matters of that kind?  In the same way, you can go through all these items.  It has been pointed out more than once that if you leave out of account the Post Office, which is run, to a large extent, as a business that pays for itself&mdash;remember <Col N="1560" /> if you saved you would save at the expense of the ordinary rural community, not at the expense of big cities &mdash;the machinery of government, that is, the cost of the Civil Service, with all the salaries included, comes, not to £12,000,000, but to two and a half millions. How you are to save three millions or thirteen millions out of that I cannot see.  Of course the real issue, when you come down to brass tacks, is the abolition of the Army and the Gárda.  If you abolish the Army that owes allegiance to this State and to the Government elected by the people of the State, you do not get rid of armies. There is, I understand, another army there.  This is really an attack upon these two services.  That was the real, solid contribution made by Deputies opposite, in the way of showing where real savings could take place.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for Deputies on other Benches, and it is a matter for the people of this country to make up their minds whether or not it would be good economy to risk the undue weakening of these two forces, because, remember, that if there is a mistake made in that direction it would be a mistake, as everybody knows, that could cost the country dear.  The Army has been maligned and abused in various ways. The Army is there for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is, to carry out the wishes of the people of this country.  The Army should be reduced to a much lower and less costly level, according to Deputy Ruttledge.  He did not say how, or even hint how. When we listened to the speeches of other Deputies we might be excused if we could not make up our minds whether the Army was to be cut down in pay, reduced, or abolished altogether. As I say, it is a matter for Deputies of all Parties and for the people to make up their minds as to whether or not they can take the very serious risk, even from the purely economic point of view, if from no other, of tampering in the way suggested by Deputies opposite with the Army or with the police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have we normal conditions?  There is not an excess of ordinary crime in the country.  We have normal conditions in that sense, certainly.  But if <Col N="1561" /> that is so, no small portion of the credit &mdash;I do not by any means say all because the people deserve credit, too&mdash; for that can be attributed to the two forces that are now attacked, to the Army on one occasion, and to the Guards at present.  It is a great mistake to think, as we might gather from listening to the speeches of Deputies on the opposite Benches, that whilst we may be an island of scholars we are an island of saints, in the sense that everybody is a saint and that you have only to remove the police force and there will be perfect order and happiness in the country.  In fact, listening to the speeches of Deputies opposite, one is forced to the conclusion that if there is any disturbance, any breach of the law, it is the Guards who are responsible, that if the Guards were not there the law would be accepted and everybody would do what everybody ought to do.  That view of the situation is about as solid and as real as most of the other views expressed by Deputies opposite on the situation in this country.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the police force, according to one Deputy, is not the suppression of crime, unless we are prepared to consider as crime the actions of the man who does not accept our political point of view.  Everybody knows that nobody has interfered with other people's political opinions.  But whatever political opinions a man holds that does not entitle him to murder his neighbour.  Merely because a man has his own political opinions does not entitle him to break the law when the law is there.  That seems to be forgotten. There is ordinary crime in this country.  There would be more ordinary crime were it not for the action of the Guards; but there is another kind of crime, occasionally actuated by what are perhaps called political motives. That does not make it a lesser crime.  It is not merely an attack upon individuals in that case; it is an attack on the State as well.  Instead of having a lesser crime you have a greater crime; you have two crimes added together.  The Guards are for the suppression of all crime, crime of every kind.  Everybody in this House ought to know that, and I think the Minister for Justice has <Col N="1562" /> made it quite clear, apart from the tributes that have been paid to the Guards from the Labour Benches.</P>
    <P>The supporters of the amendment, as they put it in one of the speeches&mdash;and this really sums up the whole situation on their side&mdash;are asked to support the doctrine that we are a people subservient to a foreign power, and that is the reason why Deputies are asked to support the amendment.  That about sums up the value of the arguments on the economy side brought forward by Fianna Fáil Deputies.  It throws the whole economic case overboard, and we are asked to believe what everybody knows we are not, though some people still seem to insist on it, namely that we are subservient to another people. Because we refuse to believe that, because the majority of the people and the majority of Deputies refuse to believe that we are a servile and a subservient people, you are asked to diminish this Vote on Account by £1,000,000 and the Estimates by £3,000,000.</P>
    <P>A point was raised by Deputy O'Connell which happens to touch my own Department&mdash;the question of school buildings.  We are anxious to get on as quickly as we can with the question of school buildings.  The actual amount put down in the Estimate is what we think, with the resources at our disposal and at the disposal of the Board of Works, and whatever payments remain over from this particular year, we can spend. Speaking from my own experience, if we can spend more money in that respect I do not anticipate any difficulty in getting a Supplementary Vote from the Department of Finance for that purpose.  There is one thing, however, on which I cannot quite agree with Deputy O'Connell, because though I am quite sure he does not intend it, it cuts at the root to some extent of our whole primary education system&mdash;that is, when he speaks of getting rid of the one-third, or the local contribution. Merely because there is no machinery for doing that is no reason for getting rid of it.  The view from which this matter is looked at is that there must be co-operation between voluntary effort and State aid.  That is the fundamental view, not merely from the <Col N="1563" /> point of view of the Government but from the point of view of a large number of people and, therefore, I cannot accept the proposition that there is no more reason why schools should not be built entirely out of public funds than that, say, police barracks should not be built out of public funds.  However, that is a controversial point that can be raised at another time, but so far as actual buildings are concerned we are anxious to get on as quickly as we can.  The Deputy himself will realise more easily the various difficulties that crop up in undertaking any particular building, either a new building or the improvement of an existing building.  Certainly I cannot accuse the Department of Finance of putting any obstacles in the way so far as school buildings are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education went out of his way to confuse the issue from our point of view. <Col N="1564" /> It is impossible from the Opposition Benches to state a full programme for the reorganisation of all the Departments, showing exactly how much could be reduced here and how much could be reduced there.  But Deputy Flinn pointed out that there is a general method which could be adopted, and he took the example of the way in which the Vickers Co. was reorganised by putting in experts to go through the Departments, experts who would be persons quite independent of the influences such as would necessarily bear upon a Civil Service Commission.  That adequately, I think, dealt with the point of our having to state in what particular respect a reduction should be made. The Minister for Education also put out a challenge to us to say how we would reduce expenditure.  The answer which can naturally be put forward to that is that there can be a reduction made, even by the Ministry as it is, of at least £3,000,000 if they set themselves to doing it.  But they have made it impossible to reduce it any more than that, because they have made such agreements on the head of partition and on the head of the Financial Agreement that we are at the loss of that area of taxation included in the Six Counties, and we are suffering for the luxury of the extra Government there, which is costing something like £10,000,000; and as well as that, we are losing, roughly, £5,000,000 as a result of the Financial Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an adequate answer to the challenge of the Minister for Education when he wants to know how a £13,000,000 reduction might be made. It might be made by a Government sufficiently strong to deal with these questions, but it certainly cannot be made by a Government which is responsible for the mess in which we are at present.  On the one hand, you have this enormously extravagant system of Government owing to these two agreement, and on the other hand you have the people, who are being plunged more and more into poverty.  It is with these facts before us that we have to face the present expenditure on Government services.  It will not do <Col N="1565" /> merely to say that a man who assumes office might be able to make £5,000 a year if he was somewhere else.  We must have regard to other circumstances; we must have regard to the general poverty of the people, and we must have regard to the fact that a man can live fairly comfortably on £1,000 a year, no matter how responsible the office he holds.</P>
    <P>Of course it comes naturally from certain Deputies on the opposite benches to say that you cannot get people to serve you unless you pay them extremely well.  That is the attitude of people whose only consideration in life is money.  But I submit that is not the right attitude of mind of people who honourably enter public service or take part in the life of the State.  There are plenty of people serving their country, either in a professional capacity or a public capacity, who are happy to do it with moderate remuneration, who would not change their position to get ten times that remuneration in other lines of life for which they would have contempt.  Therefore, it is not merely a question of money.  You could get the very best service from men who are inspired with public spirit for £1,000 a year.  But it will be a long time before we break away from the evil traditions of the past.  Even our education system has not broken away from that.  The attitude of mind expressed by the Minister for Education is also expressed by the Education Department, which even still&mdash;perhaps not so much as formerly, but to some extent&mdash;educates the best brains for export purposes and not for the purpose of building up this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Land Commission.  He said that the Department for collecting the annuities was not the only one in the Land Commission. As a matter of fact, it is about the only Department in the Land Commission in which a speeding up has taken place.  A regular, radical reorganisation was brought about in that Department to speed up the collection, but that did not take place in other Departments dealing with the speeding up of the distribution of land.  The Minister for Defence went out of his way to say, in the course of his speech yesterday evening, that there was no question of <Col N="1566" /> our not agreeing or not being satisfied with the Treaty which was being contemplated or was rejected by Egypt. He said it was as good as Document No. 2.</P>

      <P>I feel we are bound, when statements are made by responsible Ministers, on a discussion where a question of foreign policy is raised, to refer to it, because there is a Vote here for the Department of External Affairs. When the Minister makes the statement one feels that that cannot be allowed to pass as a final statement of the attitude at least of the whole of this House, and that we are entitled to know what the truth is with reference to that particular Treaty.  After all, in the struggle of the smaller nations against empires it has always been a source of great encouragement to the small nation to find that another nation takes notice of its struggle and that it is inclined to back it up and to help it.  I would remind the Minister for Defence that in the old days we were very glad to find other countries like Brazil passing votes of sympathy with us in our struggle, votes that were an encouragement to us.  The foreign policy of the first Dáil had a great amount of influence at the time because of the sympathy it got for us from other countries. It is really like a matter of a labour organisation, where the weaker is organised against the stronger.  After all, the Government must admit that we have not arrived at the goal of full <Col N="1568" /> freedom.  We have not unity in this country, and we have not complete independence, and even if the Government take up the attitude that we have the best that we could have, they ought to show solidarity with other nations that are struggling to get a greater amount of freedom.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice went into the matter of the Gárda Síochána in considerable detail.  The Gárda Síochána are costing this country £1,600,000 odd, and the number of Gárda, he told us, is 7,210.  That means that per head they are costing £230 per annum.  If you compare the number of police in Ireland with the number of police in other countries you will see that the number here is much larger.  In parts of Germany there are no police at all, and they are not required. There are parts of England where there is one policeman to an enormous area.  We really do not require all these police in this country. Anybody who had experience of the time when the police were withdrawn from the rural parts of Ireland&mdash;it was just previous to the Black and Tan period, and the police were withdrawn from outlying areas&mdash;will realise that you had large areas of the country with no police at all, and at that time we had perfect peace in the country&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have been through a period of civil war which has created an atmosphere of anger, an atmosphere where human nature was not showing at its best.  To maintain the police and army conditions of that period now is simply to maintain that atmosphere. Everybody admits, even the other side of the House admits, that the Irish people are peaceable.  We have got an <Col N="1569" /> unsullied testimonial.  It is admitted that we are not a bad people nor an immoral people, and that we do not require a great deal of policing.  It is perfectly true that, compared with any area in England, the number of police required is very small indeed.  Apart from the political conflict, the number of police required in Ireland would be very small.  As for their other duties, one cannot discuss how they should be carried out without discussing several other Departments, including the Education Office.  One cannot discuss the question, for instance, of the best way of getting people to come to school. Certainly it is not the best way to put the duty of driving the children to school upon the police.  Nor is it the best way to collect statistics to put the collection of them on people who are trained as policemen and not trained on economic lines.  Whether, in the course of time, we may be able to develop, through our technical education and through our co-operative movement, persons who will be so educated that they will be able to get for us very much more valid statistics than we get at the present time is a matter that cannot be adequately discussed on the Vote now before us.  But the police are not the people to carry out these duties.  The police should be purely police for police purposes.  Probably in that respect the cost of the police would not amount to more than £300,000 at the very outset if they were purely used for the purpose of preventing crime.  Deputy Davin challenged us as to how it was that we were willing to support Labour in a Government some months ago, and he complained that at present members of this Party spoke with dissatisfaction of the Labour Party.  I do not like to criticise Labour.  I have always felt that a strong Labour movement, provided it is on lines which are sensitive to nationalism, is a tremendous asset to the country.  At the same time, one cannot help expressing disappointment when, on a Vote like this, Deputy O'Connell gets up and asks, &ldquo;Can we make our speeches after the Fianna Fáil amendment has been disposed of?&rdquo; That conveys to my mind that he wishes to dissociate any criticism he has to make on the Vote on Account as far <Col N="1570" /> as possible from the criticism made from the Fianna Fáil Benches.</P>

      <P>I do think that when Labour is on national lines, if it has the outlook that Connolly had and is not merely a craft outlook, or the outlook of a particular craft with the financial interest of a particular craft&mdash;if it has the outlook of James Connolly, it would be a valuable asset to the country. On the whole one cannot see how the Labour Party has acted in such a national way in any of these debates. Beyond saying that, I do not wish to pursue the discussion because we shall get plenty of time to deal with that question when we are dealing with other votes, for instance, on the question of the prisoners.  The Minister for Justice mentioned the matter of the prisoners being maltreated by the police force down in County Waterford. He challenged the members on this side to state the facts about the disappearance of the police and he said that it had not been done.  Other methods were taken by us and we thought that another course was the proper course and the result has been that the Minister has been forced to supply the information we asked for.  Judgment was given against those policemen as far back as last November and it took the solicitor acting for the civilians in Waterford all the time up to February to find out where those policemen had disappeared to and up to that time the solicitor had got no assistance from the Department of Justice.  When the matter was brought under public notice the next letter sent by the solicitor produced the necessary result.  Apparently now we have been able to find these gentlemen and to get the money which was decreed against them in November last.  The Minister for Education was at pains to point out that we were responsible for the expenses to which this country was put in the way of <Col N="1571" /> extra taxation on the ground of our previous history, which, of course, he is always harping back upon.  He is harping on the question of who made the war and we must always answer that question by asking &ldquo;Who broke the Pact?&rdquo; The answer to that is that they broke the Pact and they are responsible for the extravagance and the expenditure which followed and for the weakness in this nation and for the breaking up of this nation which made it possible for the British to impose Partition upon us.</P>

      <P>Since we are debarred from going minutely into the different Estimates on the Order Paper, I shall endeavour to follow most of the other Deputies through their speeches. I do not intend to delay the House very long but I have a few comments to make in connection with the remarks made by some Deputies and I have some observations to make on one or two items.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper, the new apostle of the virtues of the Government, in the course of his remarks, said that this year everything was lovely in the garden in so far as the numbers of officials were concerned and also the cost of same.  Last year Deputy Cooper voted on Deputy Baxter's amendment for the reduction of the Vote on Account because, as he said, the total cost and the number of the civil servants did not appeal to him.  Last year, also, the case for the appointment of a Committee of Inquiry into the reasons for the increase in the Estimates was very strong.  Now that Deputy Cooper has joined the Government Party, there is no necessity for a Committee of Inquiry established on independent lines and everything, so far as the figures and the numbers of the staffs are concerned, is correct.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper spoke of the wonderful freedom we had secured, with the necessary services established as a consequence. One of the services referred to was the revenue collecting service.  The Deputy forgot to mention, in connection with that service, that the land annuities are collected from the people of this country and are handed over to the British Government without even deducting the cost of collection.  I think Deputy Cooper might have at least referred in brief to that little point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy spoke also of the importance of the Department of External Affairs and was very troubled lest our representation abroad might be handed over to somebody else.  In that connection, I note in the Estimates for this year an increase of £1,714 in the Estimate for this Department.  In connection with a question asked recently in the House by Deputy Esmonde, the Minister for External Affairs answered that in countries where we have no direct representation a Minister of the British Government acted when requested by the Saorstát Government to safeguard the interests of Saorstát nationals.  Would it not be much better, and would it not be a saving to remove this useless Department that serves no really good purpose except, as Deputy Cooney, I think it was, said, to solidify imperialism and to solidify the imperial idea?  Would it not be more conducive to the moral uplift of the people of this country and an improvement in the social services to which that money could be devoted, if the British Ministers in countries where <Col N="1573" /> we have direct representation were asked to assume responsibility for Saorstát nationals openly, and end this fraud of a Department of External Affairs representing a partitioned nation, representing portion of a nation which, in spite of what some Ministers on the other side say, is only a subservient State?</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass asked, at the start of the debate, for a declaration of national policy, and I think none of the Ministers so far has replied to that.  I ask for a declaration of policy in connection with the Gárda Síochána and the Detective Division attached to that force of which we have heard so much to-night.  I think it was Deputy Shaw, in a speech yesterday, who said that if the Party on the opposite Benches condemned violence, then there was no doubt but that taxation could be reduced. Deputy Shaw, as well as every other Deputy on the other side, knows that we on those Benches have loyally respected the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; order of 1923, and he knows very well that provocation in the direction of violence since 1923 has not come from this side of the House but from the other side, in the shape of Treason Bills, Flogging Bills, right up to the last Bill which it was hoped would create a state of civil war in this country last August.  Every provocation has been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MULLINS</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is talk of murder, both sides can talk.  What I would like to get from the Minister is a declaration of policy, or, at least, some information on the point.  I put this, not in any spirit of antagonism or bitterness, but in the spirit in which the President made his appeal to this House the week before last.  What is the attitude of the C.I.D. and the Gárda <Col N="1574" /> Síochána, and on whose instructions are they acting in connection with the present persecution of Republicans in this country?  Only two days after the President's appeal here during the course of the debate on Army stores, the Civic Guards and members of the Detective Division were present in a graveyard in West Cork where was buried one of the men who assisted in putting this Government in the position which they occupy to-day.  They were present, so far as we could see, in the hope that some action would be taken which would enable them to make a coup&mdash;in the hope that the honours which should be rendered to a soldier would not be rendered and could not be rendered.  Is that the policy of this Government?  That is one thing I would like to know.  It has happened on three occasions lately that men who served faithfully and well, and who helped to put the Government in its present position and secured even the little bit of freedom they have so much talk about, are denied the military funeral which is their due because of the fact that they are Republicans.  Is not that provocation, and is not that a continuance of the policy started, after the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; order, in this Dáil by the introduction of Treason Bills, Flogging Bills and all sorts of other provocative Bills by which they hoped to induce the young men of this country to resort again to arms?</P>
      <P>There was a statement made by Deputy Anthony, that before the advent of the Gárda Síochána in Cork no man with £1 in his pocket was safe going through the streets.  Deputy Anthony evidently has forgotten that there were in the City of Cork in the days before the advent of the Gárda Síochána, or the National Army either, a Republican police force under the command of the late Commandant Denny Barry, and on the admission of even the merchants of Cork, who are largely Conservative, that police force was as efficient in safeguarding the rights and property of the people as any police force that has followed it in the city since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Deputies appear to be under the impression that a reduction of this Vote by £1,000,000, as set out in <Col N="1575" /> the amendment, would involve a reduction in, or the abolition of, social services or a reduction in the wages of the workers.  Since we came into this House we have never advocated a policy of that nature.  Deputies, I think, should realise that a policy such as that is not part of our programme, nor would any of the things occur which Deputies seem to suggest in their speeches if the Vote were reduced by the amount stated in the amendment.</P>
    <P>There is another point in connection with the activities of the Gárdaí and of the detective division on which I would like some information.  We have been told that the peaceable condition of the country is due to the activities of the Gárda Síochána and of the detective division of that force.  Yet we find in the Estimates a sum of £10,000 for secret service.  Before the debate concludes, I would be glad if some responsible Minister would give us an indication as to what exactly that secret service means.  Is it a continuation of the policy of which I have already spoken&mdash;an attempt to drive the young men of this country back into a condition of arms, or does the Government think that by these provocative measures and actions, these threats and all that, that they are really going to kill the spirit of independence in the hearts of the young people of this country? If they think that, they are sadly mistaken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe, from my own constituency, in the course of his oration said that we did not want to go back to the days of terror and of anarchy. Probably the Deputy has a very good reason for not wishing to go back to the days of terror and anarchy.  Every citizen to-day, we have been told, is a free man.  Deputy Wolfe evidently has not heard of one or two men who, at the present moment, though they are good and honest citizens of this Nation and fought to make it free, cannot return to their homes down in the County Cork because of the persecution carried on by the detective division in that county for no reason except that they would not bend the knee to them after the cease fire order in 1923.  We have been told that every man is a free man in this country and can walk about in <Col N="1576" /> peace.  The Deputy also said that no one in the country wanted to have the strength of the Gárda Síochána reduced by a single man.  Deputy Wolfe, apparently, forgets the speeches he made during the general election campaign in June last.  In these speeches, he advocated economy all round.  One of the methods by which he hoped economies would be brought about in this country was by a reduction in the numbers in the defence and police forces.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of the abolition of a police force in this country.  I am not saying that we are a nation of saints that can do without a police force, but what I do maintain is that this small, partitioned country does not require the enormous forces that the present Government has at its command at the moment.  It certainly does not require, as Deputy Davin said a few moments ago, the gentleman in the Criminal Investigation Department, which is in reality not a criminal investigation department, but a political secret service machine.  Deputy J.J. Byrne talked a lot about business.  He criticised Deputy Flinn's suggestion that if the Government do not want the Departments run on business lines they could run them on the lines of outdoor relief.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne appears to be in the same state of mind as most of the other Deputies who spoke on that side of the House.  They all seem to forget the fact&mdash;Deputy Coburn, I think, was the only one who stressed it&mdash;that this small country cannot afford the extravagance of a Government which is costing twenty-three millions a year. If the Committee of which Deputy Heffernan had so much praise a short time ago, the Committee of independent investigators, could not see ways and means of reducing the total Estimate of £23,000,000 to something like £20,000,000 a year, then there is something wrong or some facts are concealed which should be opened to their view and inspection.  We maintain that this country does not require an expenditure of the enormous sum of £23,000,000 per year.  That is the sum estimated for running the services for the next twelve months.  It is because we believe that that proposed expenditure is too high that we are moving to reduce <Col N="1577" /> the Estimate by £1,000,000.  We maintain that, in spite of the statements made on the other side of the House, especially the statement made by the Minister for Defence with regard to the Army.  We believe that the Army is not necessary on its present lines.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the normal cost of the Army in due time could be reduced to about one and a half millions. He stated further that they should have at their disposal a large body of men trained in the bearing of arms and pledged to the defence of the country against foreign or internal enemies.  We maintain that they could have at their disposal a large body of men for a far less sum than that already voted, for that particular purpose. They could have such a body of men at their disposal on a territorial basis, and a force on that basis would give far more efficient and better service to the State and nation than any paid army on the lines of the present system.</P>
    <P>We maintain that if the amendment to reduce the Vote by £1,000,000 is carried it will not affect any of the social services of the State.  It will not necessarily mean any reduction in old age pensions, in unemployment insurance benefit or anything of that nature, of which some of the Labour Deputies have spoken.  The Minister for Education was engaged for a period in throwing bouquets at the Labour Party, and Deputy Davin was engaged for another period in throwing the bouquets back at the Government Party.  It appears to me that a new line of demarcation is beginning to make itself evident in this Dáil, in that the Party which Deputy Flinn described as the de-nationalised Labour Party will soon go back to their original position.  They should be on the Government Benches.  I support the amendment, and hope it will be carried.  The people of the country, if they have any intelligence, will, when they read the result of this division, know on which side the campaign of bluff has been carried on.</P>

Those persons who accompany Ministers are armed and authorised to be armed.  They did not accompany Ministers until a very regrettable outrage took place last July. No Minister of State desires to have armed persons accompanying him anywhere.</P>

      <P>I will not keep the House long.  I did not intend to intervene, but I want to make it clear that arms must not be carried by persons unless they are authorised to do so by the State.  In all sincerity, I would put it to every person in the country that there cannot be order unless that be the accepted rule.  Any other rule is bound sooner or later to have unfortunate and deplorable results.  I am not at all satisfied that the discussion I have listened to this evening is likely to satisfy the people or induce them to accept that view.  The police officers are not used for provocative purposes, and persons have not been interfered with since 1923 for any overt act committed pre-1923.  There was an amnesty, which, I think, has been very generously dispensed in all directions, and it must be for some act committed since the date mentioned by the Deputy, or an act which did not arise out of the armed conflict at that particular time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The terms of the amnesty related to any act committed between September, 1921, and May, 1923.  As I had not the opportunity <Col N="1581" /> of addressing Deputies on the opposite side when I announced that to the House, may I remind them of the way that was taken outside?  It was said by some of their supporters that it was an act of weakness on our part because an election was pending.  It had no relation to that&mdash;none whatever &mdash;and it was so explained in the House. May I say with regard to some of the remarks that I heard about independence, that I congratulate Deputies on the opposite benches in being present to Vote £7,000,000, as it is the first time they have had the opportunity of voting so much money?  They have never been asked to consider such a considerable sum.  Even those of them who were in the first and second Dáil and who, in their addresses this evening, remarked on the limitation of our independence, had by no means the same independence in the first Dáil as they have now&mdash;neither in their representative capacity nor in their capacity as citizens.  I would advise a little sober reflection on these things.  I heard references by Deputies on the opposite benches to &ldquo;free citizens.&rdquo; Do we do any honour to our State or nation by fouling our own nests?</P>

      <P>And I am sure the Deputy was much wiser than he was previous to studying them.  With reference to the amendment to reduce the Vote by £1,000,000, it struck me that the child is slightly disordered who put down this amendment.  £1,000,000 cannot be saved on this Vote, no matter how you try to do so.  No Deputy has shown, item by item, where it could be deducted.  It is nonsense to say you could save it on the Army.  We passed an Army Act.  The Deputies on the <Col N="1582" /> other side were here when we passed that Act.  The soldiers are serving for a certain time.  Will a change of Government break a contract of that kind made by their predecessors?  Not at all. The comparison between 1913 and 1928 is childish and ridiculous.  Only people would make that comparison who have no admiration for anything except the administration that was here in 1913. It might be possible to take a few hundred pounds off an estimate here and there, but estimates such as those for sugar beet, the agricultural grant, education and the old age pensions grant will not admit of a reduction. This proposal to reduce the Vote by £1,000,000 is merely spectacular.  I suppose those who made that proposal wanted to show they could do big things when they could take £1,000,000 off an estimate of £7,000,000.  I have seen no case made for a reduction on this Vote, and I will vote against the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>The President asked us to feel a thrill at the thought that we were voting a very large sum. Of course we all feel a thrill, but our case is that the ordinary working farmer and producer in the country are also entitled to an occasional thrill. <Col N="1583" /> We submit, if we could agree that a reduction of £1,000,000 could be made, it would be a considerable thrill, would be a thrill that would have a tremendous effect on the future of the country, and would react here and elsewhere to bring about better conditions. Notwithstanding the devastating speeches made from the Front Benches, particularly the very contemptuous speech of the Minister for Education, we are still satisfied that this million pounds could be saved if there were a desire to save it.  I think, in considering whether it is desirable or not, we should not regard it merely from one point of view.  We should not consider it from the point of view that these services are there and that they cost so much, but we should consider it&mdash; surely the Minister for Education, who is a great philosopher will admit this&mdash; from the point of view of the people who have to pay whether they are in a position to do so or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every day in the week you read, in this connection, statements from leading public men, like the Chairman of the Meath County Council, who is no ordinary ranter, I take it, but a responsible man.  Speaking a short time ago in connection with the estimates for local government for County Meath, Mr. Quinn, the Chairman of the Meath County Council, said: &ldquo;Local expenditure, national expenditure, the burden on the ratepayers and taxpayers had reached such dimensions that he thought it time they should call a halt. There was no stemming of the tide of public depression, and, as day succeeded day, that depression became more acute, yet there was no diminution in their standing charges.&rdquo; Is it not our business to take statements like that into account and see if nothing could be done to meet such a situation?  Will that man, and the thousands of those who think like him, be consoled on learning from the Government Benches that there is no possibility of reducing the Army, no possibility of taking off a single Civic Guard, that the Government offices must remain as they are, and that every Government service is being run at a minimum?  I think that is a very callous attitude to adopt towards the <Col N="1584" /> very deep discontent which prevails in the country.  I think it was a pity that the President was not told, when he complained that nobody had attempted to go through the items and show where a saving could be effected, that that was ruled out of order early in the debate.</P>
    <P>Now that we seem to have come to the position where particular items can be remarked upon, I would call attention to the fact that there is an Estimate of practically £2,000,000 for pensions for the coming year.  The defence for that huge sum is, I suppose, that those pensions are part of the Treaty and that they cannot be got over.  I do not think that that is a sufficient defence. To tell the farmer who is unable to pay his way, to tell any producer or anyone who is doing useful service and who cannot meet his obligations that we are indebted for £2,000,000 for pensions&mdash; a lot of which is admittedly absolutely wasteful and to which, if we had been given an opportunity, we would never agree&mdash;to tell a man that he must subscribe to these pensions, irrespective of his means, is hardly a good line to adopt, hardly a satisfactory method of bringing about improved conditions. Further, in regard to pensions, this point could also be raised&mdash;namely, how far have the Government endeavoured to insist that pensioners live in the country, that pensions be spent in the Saorstát, and that, as far as possible, they should go back in some way to Irish producers?  In other words, even while they have to pay, at least Irish enterprise should get the benefit of as large a portion of the pensions as possible.</P>
    <P>I think, when discussing a huge sum such as that mentioned in the Vote, we are, at least, entitled to consider whether we could not get greater advantage out of this money than we get at present.  When the Labour Party look at this list, knowing the poverty and privation which prevail at present, it amazes me to see them passing over every item and saying: &ldquo;It is all right; we have to put up with it.&rdquo;  Such an attitude will not get us very far on the road to economy.  Let us regard the pension list in another way.  Let us turn it into cattle.  At £8 a beast, it represents 224,362 cattle.  We all know <Col N="1585" /> that store cattle for large numbers of small farmers are the principal source of income, and that £8 for a beast is a big sum with a lot of small holders.  It represents two years of care and labour in many cases, yet we have 224,362 small holders having to provide a beast valued £8 to pay the pension list due by this State.  That is a pretty considerable item.  I suggest that a Government that felt a real responsibility to the people would try and get over it in some way.  There are other items, such as Temporary Commissions and so on, that, while their cost may not amount to much, indicate a looseness and carelessness about money and a certain indifference, or want of knowledge of the actual conditions prevailing in the country.  There is another matter I would like to know something about, namely, why the promise which the President made regarding the revaluation of the loans to fishermen has not been fulfilled and whether it is intended to fulfil it.</P>
    <P>There is another very important question on which I think we might have a chance of getting some information before we vote money for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. That is, that we should know their policy regarding transport.  Are they satisfied to allow the present chaos in transport to continue, the present competition between roads and railways and between so many different interests on the roads?  Have they no remedy for that?  Have they no thought for the complaints that are prevalent all over the country by ratepayers who use the roads that have been made at such a terrific expense to them, that these roads are being ploughed and are going to pieces day after day, owing to the great number of competing buses?  Have they no suggestion to make for bringing more order into that little bit of the world? Is it their policy to allow the dozen or more interests that are competing between here and Dalkey to continue to do so, or to allow the number of other interests that are competing on the other roads of the country to continue their competition?  Have they no thought of remedying that, or are we to look on such a spectacle as I saw last <Col N="1586" /> Saturday, on a road where the population is not more than six to every square mile, of three big buses racing after one another in the space of twenty minutes?  Is that their efficiency in the matter of motor transport?</P>
    <P>Again you find that although the Railway Tribunal has been in existence for four years, there is no change yet, I think, in the matter of freights. Farmers and others all over the country are complaining very bitterly that practically all the profit on live stock is going in freights.  There is no effort made to cut down shipping freights. Railway freights remain at least 100 per cent. more than they were in pre-war days, while everybody knows that the price of agricultural produce is not 30 per cent. more than it was pre-war. Surely it is time that we had some announcement of policy on that matter.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that requires to be made clear.  It has been asserted by more than one speaker, and implied by several others, that we here are very much opposed to, or have a special animus against, the Civil Service. I want to make it very clear that that is not the case.  If there was such an animus in the Party, I would probably have more responsibility for it than anybody else, inasmuch as I was the only member of the Party who worked in the Civil Service, and I suppose my opinion would have particular weight.  I think, in fact, we can make out the case that we have a great deal more respect for the Civil Service than Government Deputies have, in this way &mdash;that we hold that civil servants do not look for extravagant pay for their service.  We hold that the best men in the Civil Service do not consider their pay as the first thing at all, that they have an enthusiasm for their work which is altogether irrespective of the reward they are getting for it, and that it is an insult to many of them to say that any salary would pay them for their services.  We know that there are men in the Civil Service who are worth their weight in gold, metaphorically speaking, but there is no good in talking about that if there is no gold with which to pay them.  We believe that the Civil Service, and every public service <Col N="1587" /> in the country, would be very glad to respond to an appeal from the Government to consider the terrible plight of the people at the present time and to accept a reduction where a reduction can be made, where there is room for reduction, to respond to an appeal for a more simple kind of government, for a government that would be more in accordance with the desires of the people in the very low circumstances in which the people of Ireland are at the present moment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reduction in the army and the Civic Guard, I think there was a curious plea put forward by Deputy Cooper and Deputy Davin when they said that if you disband the army you are throwing them out on an already over-loaded labour market. That is a rather curious reason to give for keeping the army in existence.  If that be a good reason for maintaining an army, then I think a reasonable deduction would be that a good way of employing the unemployed population of the present time would be to set them to work in building battleships, to destroy them after being built and keep on building.  I think that would be about as reasonable as to suggest that the army should be kept as an army simply because to disband it would overload the labour market.  There would be no overloading of the labour market if Deputy Davin and his colleagues had a more serious view of production.  I might remind them that when they spoke of the necessity for increased social services and all that sort of thing, they seemed to have forgotten the necessity for an increased expenditure on social services when the tariff motion was debated here a week or ten days ago.</P>
    <P>You had an instance where their own speakers admitted there was a need for speeding up.  They fully admitted that tariffs were a means of stimulating production and that it was necessary that more should be got out of the Tariff Commission.  Yet because <Col N="1588" /> one little amendment of theirs was not accepted they went into the Lobby against the motion to speed it up.  There will be much less money for social services until a great deal more of the goods used by the people in the Saorstát are made in the country.  If that were being done, if all the things we can make were being made in this country, there would be a great deal more money for social services and there would be, generally, greater welfare amongst the people.  I hope, although I do not expect it, that there will be a substantial vote for this reduction of £1,000,000 in the Estimate for the next few months.  I believe that the country would welcome it.  I believe that the response to it from every section of the population would be such as would gratify every part of this House.</P>

      <P>On the last evening this debate was in progress I went through, one by one, the cases which Deputy Ruttledge had mentioned in his speech.  I reviewed the cases which he put forward as cases which required reconsideration.  I also went through the cases which he referred to on which he grounded the charge, which I think I have already demonstrated to be entirely groundless, that there was a licence to murder.  I will now go further and mention a few of the cases in which members of the National Army have been sentenced by courts and are still serving sentences, and I think they in themselves should be sufficient to demonstrate to any fair-minded person how utterly groundless were the charges and how utterly reckless was the manner in which the Deputy made them.  I might instance James Murray, who was condemned and is now serving a term of penal servitude for life; Joseph Butler, who was condemned for the shooting of a man in Limerick in August, 1922; he was duly tried, found guilty, was sentenced to death, and is now serving a life sentence.  Take, again, John Ryan, <Col N="1592" /> who, whilst serving in the National Army, shot dead a man with whom he was on friendly terms, while Ryan himself was greatly under the influence of drink.  This took place on the 16th May, 1923, just the period of the expiration of the Amnesty.  He was duly found guilty, sentenced to death, and is now serving a life sentence.  Contrast that case with the case that Deputy Ruttledge put forward&mdash;the case of John Hogan.</P>
      <P>Hogan shot a man with whose family his family had been on bad terms, because this man, when ordered to put his hands up, refused to do so.  Compare that with the case of Ryan.  Ryan, under the influence of drink, shoots, not an enemy, but a friend.  Surely the moral guilt of Ryan is far less than the moral guilt of Hogan.  If Deputy Ruttledge's contention had any foundation in fact, then Ryan should have been released long ago.  Ryan must be, in common sense and justice, released before Hogan.  Yet Deputy Ruttledge comes to this House and asks for the release of Hogan.  So much now for the cases which Deputy Ruttledge has put forward here.  But his motion goes a little bit beyond merely what he calls political prisoners.  I take it we have had an exhaustive list from him, and I think I have showed what curious things he considers to be political crimes.  He mentioned in this House that he, and other Fianna Fáil Deputies, had an interview with me upon this matter some months ago.  He mentioned twenty names.  He has mentioned some of them in this debate. Others he has not mentioned.  I do not know whether he has or has not abandoned the other claims, but they certainly are the nearest things he could think of or his Party put forward, and I shall proceed to deal with the cases with which he has not already dealt.</P>

      <P>There were ten of these already dealt with. I should like to review them one by one. I want to show that there is no substance in the charge that there are political prisoners kept in prison for political views.  A great number of them have now passed.  One was Riley.  He complained he had not yet been tried, but the trial has taken place.  Another was the case of two men about whom there was rather a muddle.  They had been admitted to bail, but they had not perfected their bail bonds; they have since perfected them, and there is no question about them now. Then there was a case which was rather interesting, that of a man named McCarthy.  I have made a very exhaustive search to discover who McCarthy is, and I find there is no Mr. McCarthy.  He is entirely an imaginary person.  That shows the splendid information which the Deputies have and the splendid information upon which they act when they ask solemnly that a man who does not exist should be released from a prison which, if I may use a bull, he is not in.</P>

      <P>Russell and Price, I think, I have dealt with.  McCool, another man mentioned, has served his term of imprisonment, as has also Downey.  There is another man&mdash;Joseph O'Keeffe.  O'Keeffe was a man who held up a Guard in November, 1923, stole the Guard's clothes and, in addition, took from him a watch and chain and a sum of money.  However, as far as that man is concerned, he has served two years in prison. There was reasonable ground for thinking that if released he would abandon his evil ways.  I had a definite undertaking from a Deputy in this House that the prisoner would conduct himself if released, and upon that undertaking the man has actually been released.  With McPeake, with Downey, with Hughes, with Hogan, and with Kavanagh we have already dealt.  Other cases which were put forward included that of John O'Brien, who was serving a sentence for breaking and entering a store of the Grand Canal Company and stealing goods therefrom.  That was an ordinary case of burglary, nothing else, and that was put forward here by the Fianna Fáil Party as a case with a political aspect.  Unless ordinary robbery is to go unpunished because the person who committed a crime is an adherent of the Fianna Fáil Party I cannot understand how the term &ldquo;political&rdquo; can be applied to an offence like that, an offence which was committed in December, 1923.  Another case which was mentioned was the case of O'Rourke, who, in 1925, entered the post office at Athy with another man, and took £346 worth of stamps and £102 in cash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Fagan was a man who shot his officer.  This is one of the cases which was put forward. The evidence in the case was perfectly clear.  He was seen by the sister of the officer&mdash;Miss Moran&mdash;to draw back the bolt of his rifle and shoot his officer.  He went further away and met the officer's brother some time afterwards in the streets of Ballina and threatened to give him the same fate.  That is a case Deputies put forward as one in which there should be reconsideration.  This man Fagan was sentenced; a Committee is to be set up to investigate, and it would be within their power, at any rate, to recommend the release of a man who put up his rifle to his shoulder to shoot the brother of the man he had already shot, and only that a lieutenant of the Republican Army, as I will call it, said <Col N="1597" /> to him: &ldquo;If you attempt to fire, Pat, I will blow your brains out,&rdquo; he probably would have shot the other brother as well.  Those are the whole of the prisoners that the Party opposite can suggest had committed crimes of a political nature.  To show that these are political crimes, it would be necessary for them to take up the attitude that a crime committed by an adherent of their Party is of necessity a political crime.</P>
      <P>Let us go on and consider the terms of this motion, and the nature of the committee which Deputy Ruttledge suggests should be set up.  He asks that a committee of eight members of this House be set up to review those sentences, and to recommend the release of these prisoners.  How are they to review the sentences?  Some of the cases have been reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeal already.  Certainly one of them has.  This committee is asked presumably to set aside verdicts found by juries.  They have no power to call any witnesses before them.  They do not even ask, as a motion of this nature usually asks, for power to get documents.  Probably the Deputy was right in not asking for such powers. Seemingly certain Fianna Fáil Deputies are to go into this committee, if it is ever set up, with their minds entirely made up.  They are to decide on the canons laid down for them by their leader.  They are to find such facts as would suit their Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is from the Official Report of March 1st, page 646, dealing with the Larkin motion.  A definite canon is laid down by the leader for his Party to follow. They are to decide on strict Party lines matters of fact, and what this House is now asked to do is to set up a committee consisting of eight members, every one of whom who is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party is to find the facts that suit his Party.  That is what their leader told them to do.  That, I presume, is what the Deputies would do, and that is why, I suppose, this committee is not asked to have power to summon witnesses or call for documents. Why should they, if Deputies opposite are to go in with their minds completely and entirely made up, determined to find, not facts on evidence, but upon such lines as suit them and are helpful to their Party's interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt now, I think, with not only the nature of the cases, but also with the constitution of this suggested tribunal.  What does it all work down to except this, that the Deputies have been making statements on platforms again and again that there are political prisoners in prison who have been wrongly sentenced.  Certainly, Deputy Ruttledge, the only speaker opposite so far in this debate, has not shown that there was any foundation for that charge.  What does it really come down to except this, that the Party opposite, on platforms, have repeatedly and consistently been making use of as unfair political propaganda and as untrue political propaganda as has ever been used by any Party.  They come here now with this motion.  What is it except a motion to save their faces?  What else is this motion but that?  They have made charges.  They must see now that there was no foundation for the charges they have made.  There is one course open to them undoubtedly, the strong, manly course, the course of saying: &ldquo;Well, we did make charges; we believed them at the time; we now know them to be untrue.&rdquo;  That is not the attitude which the Party opposite naturally adopts.  One does not expect very much moral courage from the <Col N="1599" /> Party opposite.  What one finds again and again is that when challenged on issues of this nature Deputies do not express themselves.  They have been asked again and again in this House what is their attitude towards political murder, what is their attitude to the taking of human life?  They have never answered.</P>

When are we going to have an end of the doctrine that because a man belongs to a political party he can commit any crime that he likes?  Will any Deputy tell us at what particular period amnesty is to begin?  Might I ask the Deputies if they believe that crimes which are to be committed in the future in this country are to be excused and are to go unpunished because of the political views of the men who commit them?

      <P>I must certainly congratulate the Government on its discovery <Col N="1603" /> of the Minister for Justice.  He is certainly a gem of the first water. He requires from this Party accurate and definite information on all points. He, with a very efficient Department at his disposal, is able to give us some information which is certainly most inaccurate. I suppose I had better not say he deliberately misled the House, or tried to do so; but he certainly tried to mislead the House, and, whether deliberately or not, he misled it in one sense.</P>

      <P>There was one case in which the Minister said that a certain man named Hughes was tried for an offence which he committed in 1926.  Deputy Allen and I questioned him about it.  He was getting away with it all right when I asked him was this man tried in 1926 for an offence committed in 1922.  The Minister was quite definite in stating that the crime was committed in 1926, but when he was pulled up he admitted the crime was committed in 1923.  That was a slight inaccuracy on the part of a gentleman with such a fine Department at his disposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. BOLAND Mr. G. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accuse the Minister of infallibility.  The Minister wants to know from us the sources of our information.  The Minister is a gentleman who never had experience of the sources of information which were considered good enough by his colleague, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and by Deputy Gearoid O'Sullivan, who was one time A.G.&mdash; sources of information which would be quite good enough for any member of the old Sinn Fein movement.  In spite of all the Minister's attempts to seal up these sources, they are still available. I contradicted the Minister when he stated emphatically certain things in <Col N="1604" /> regard to one prisoner, the important prisoner in this case, George Gilmore. I definitely said that Gilmore was treated in a most inhuman manner. We are asked to produce our sources of information in order that those sources of information may be dealt with in the same manner as the prisoner who was allowed out on ticket-of-leave &mdash;a prisoner named Kavanagh&mdash;was dealt with.  Kavanagh may have been one of our sources of information.  I do not want to have him put into what was called in slang terms the knocking shop by saying here and now that he was one of our sources of information, because they have got the man again.</P>
      <P>Any Minister who took part in our fight for independence before the split would have accepted the sources of information we had, but a gentleman of the traditions of the Minister certainly could not.  We are told that Kavanagh was released and that if he had behaved as a well-behaved citizen he would still be at large.  What was Kavanagh's offence?  Simply putting up posters describing the treatment meted out to some of his fellow prisoners.  I will not go any further into the question of the sources of our information, for the reason that I do not want to have other discharged prisoners put back into jail or, perhaps, some officials shoved out of their jobs. I think the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has a pretty fair idea, and so has Deputy O'Sullivan a pretty fair idea, of the sources of information we had at the time when probably their colleague was very much against the whole movement.  I think that will dispose of the question why we should not be courteous enough to disclose the sources of our information. I am going to state deliberately here that Gilmore was treated in a most inhuman fashion.  I could give you some of the details and, too, if there was any chance of getting immunity for our sources of information, I could prove it to the hilt.  He was dragged from the top to the bottom of the stairs in Mountjoy.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will please let me proceed.  The question that does arise is the question of prisoners who were sentenced or who are in prison, and why their cases should go to a Committee with a view to their release.  The whole question of the treatment of prisoners in prison is a different question, and it has not been dealt with so far.  I have said it was not relevant to this motion and, plainly, it is not, and, plainly, I could not let Deputy Boland deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I want to point out that the question arises out of whether a particular person is a political prisoner or not. George Gilmore's treatment was meted out to him because he claimed to be a political prisoner; because he claimed to be a political prisoner, he was treated as an ordinary prisoner, and the struggle that took place and the torture that was imposed upon him was in the course of an attempt to beat him as an ordinary criminal.  He claims he is a political prisoner, and the matter arises on the question of whether he is a political prisoner or not.</P>

      <P>In this particular case I have read through the Minister's speech.  I am not quite sure if he did refer to it, but you pulled me up when I was coming to it.  I was one of a deputation who went to see the Minister on one occasion on this matter. Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee were with me.  We were half an hour with the Minister and we made a very definite case about the treatment of George Gilmore.  I am not going to insist on the idea of putting up a separate Committee at all in that matter, but I am going to ask the Government if they are going to make any effort to meet the situation.  We interviewed the Minister and we made certain very definite statements about the treatment of this particular man.  He denied it and we asked him on what grounds, and he told us that his officials had assured him that that was the case; he, being of the type that will accept an official's explanation without investigation, thought that should be sufficient. Then we asked him would he first of all let one of our Deputies go to the prison and see Gilmore; or failing that, would he even allow an independent doctor, who had no connection with the Government, to go and examine the man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask to be allowed to intervene for a moment.  The Deputy has stated that I came to the conclusion without any investigation.  The charges which the Deputy made to me I very carefully investigated, and concluded they were not justified; and the Deputy should not now say that I came to the conclusion without investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. BOLAND Mr. G. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be unjust.  The Minister said he had investigated the cases fully.  We said we had no confidence in the people that he had put to investigate this matter, and <Col N="1607" /> we asked that one of our Party be allowed to go and see the prisoner; we asked that the prisoner should be allowed to write to his mother or father.  He had not written for twelve months to his mother, and we asked that he be allowed to see his father or his mother, or failing that, that the Minister would allow an independent doctor, whom he himself could nominate, and in whom we had confidence, to see the prisoner.  The Minister would not agree.  I submit, in these circumstances, there is a case for the setting up of an independent tribunal.  I do not care what it is.  I do not care whether it is a Committee or a Commission, but I ask that somebody independent of the Government should be allowed to investigate that particular case.  I just want to say that I could never convince the Minister for Justice in the matter of the sources of my information, for the reason that he is of the class or type that never took part in any of these struggles, and that he had no sympathy with them and never had, and I could not expect him to understand these matters; but surely his colleagues had, and they were quite satisfied to accept those sources of information at one time.  In the case of Kavanagh, I have not got the details.  There is a question here of the agent-provocateur having been engaged in this case, a gentleman named Hardy, and I promised the Minister to give him some information; and I say this now, that if he will put the means at my disposal to go over the whole thing I could prove it that this man was what we alleged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go back to the year 1922 and I can tell the House definitely that this particular gentleman organised an attack on a military post, a Free State post in Glendalough.  He was with us in Blessington.  I put him in charge of an outpost there.  I was in charge of the area.  This particular gentleman organised an attack on a Glendalough post on the Free State troops.  He informed the military and actually cooperated with them and actually got some of those he had lured into this thing arrested.  That may be all right in war-time but surely the Government is not going to stand over that thing <Col N="1608" /> now.  As a military man, I would not of course blame any officer for taking advantage of that but when it comes to taking up again a gentleman after he had been convicted of bank robbery it is a different matter.  I am not going to object to clemency to any prisoner. I do not object to it if the Government show clemency to the Free State side, but now that there is a cool atmosphere in the country and if they are to be treated leniently and if people on our side are to be treated leniently, I am not going to complain.  But this man was caught red-handed in Portobello and he is released immediately and the excuse given&mdash;a very thin excuse for such a gentleman&mdash;is that it was a case of mistaken identity.  That is a very thin excuse for a Minister who is so fond of particularity and formality. He said:&mdash;&ldquo;I can show that Hardy's case was a case of mistaken identity.&rdquo; The Minister has not proved that yet, and perhaps he will take the trouble to prove it if Hardy is in the land of the living.</P>
    <P>As regards Kavanagh's crime, I state here&mdash;and if I am wrong let the Minister contradict me&mdash;that Kavanagh was sentenced for this robbery and he was released.  The Minister stated here in the Dáil:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Kavanagh was, as a matter of fact, released on licence but he did not carry out the terms of his licence. Instead of conducting himself as a law-abiding citizen he took a completely different course and his licence was in consequence revoked.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say in answer to that matter that the conduct unbecoming a law-abiding citizen was that he gave information about the treatment of a prisoner.  They have him again and I suggest that he may be punished again for that now.  Anyway the charge was that he gave this information about some of his fellow-prisoners who had been badly treated. He also put up posters describing that treatment.  That was what brought this unfortunate man into jail again.  He is punished for a crime that there is every reason to believe, at least if we are allowed to prove it, was provoked by a person who has been certainly very leniently treated by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> I come now to another class of prisoner and here is where the value of the present Minister comes in, the value of the Minister to his Party.  Happy man.  I was in jail for four years. He was never in jail.  He tells us here about two men who are in jail for the last four months, to wit Michael Price and Sean Russell.  I wonder would the Minister for Local Government and Public Health who sat on the same Council with Sean Russell during the Black and Tan time, come here and say that Sean Russell is a criminal.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is, that the Minister tells us that these men are not prisoners at all.  What are they?  They are not prisoners?  No, they are only in gaol.  If the Minister ever had the experience of being a prisoner himself, especially of a prisoner awaiting trial, he would know that that period is really the worst part of the imprisonment. I was in that position myself a couple of times, and I can tell the Minister that that period is really the worst, because during it a man is stuck in and gets 22 hours solitary confinement.  These men are now there four months.  The Minister says, I suppose in his innocence&mdash;perhaps that is the mildest way of putting it&mdash; that they are not prisoners at all.  I refer him to his own speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now qualified it.  This brings me to another case, of one who is a prisoner now.  This man has been referred to as a prisoner, and, therefore, I think I am in order in speaking of him.  It is the case of my friend, Ned Reilly.  We had occasion previously to raise the case, amongst a number of others, of this man.  I do not think the Minister opposite would call Reilly a criminal.  I would not like to hear him call him a criminal, any way.  The Minister said this man was not a prisoner at all, but he was in gaol for practically twelve <Col N="1610" /> months.  During one of my usual interruptions I accused the Minister and the Government of trying utterly to break Reilly.  He was a man who lost his health in the struggle against the British.  He was one of the best men in Tipperary, and was suffering from neuritis.  I was assured by the Minister, when I referred to this case on a previous occasion, that the man had gained in weight and improved.  I met this man when he came out, and I can say they fairly well succeeded in breaking him.  The man is a physical wreck, I regret to say.  He was twelve months in gaol as a prisoner.</P>
      <P>In the name of common sense, does the Minister think we are all as innocent as he is?  I wonder are his colleagues as innocent as he is?  There is another principle that I think seems to have been accepted, because the defence put up for a certain Vote the other day was that the thing was over and that the Minister who was involved at the time made some extraordinary sort of defence.  He spoke about absorption, and said that the absorption of this year should not be the absorption of the year before.  I would like to know, will the privilege that has been extended to this Minister of being in the position to pass from the absorption of one year to the absorption of another be extended to these prisoners, practically everyone of whom is suffering for offences committed at least four or five years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were prisoners mentioned by Deputy Ruttledge and the Minister, but there are some men in gaol at present who were not mentioned by either of them.  I think the Minister will remember that, when I had an interview with him, I put up to him cases for sympathetic consideration by the Government, the cases of men who were on the run at the time, who were hunted men, particularly the men rescued from Mountjoy in 1925.  A good number of those men were awaiting trial at the time they were rescued. Advantage was taken of the fact that the gates were open.  There is scarcely any man of spirit in the House who, if he were in gaol and in their position, would not take advantage of the gates being open.  In view of the fact that <Col N="1611" /> the gates were open, it is questionable whether some of the prisoners would have got any sentences at all.</P>
    <P>I have in mind one particular case, that of an old man who was awaiting trial.  Naturally when he saw the gates open he went out.  That man is most anxious to go home, but the Minister in his innocence asks &ldquo;Cannot they surrender?&rdquo; There was certainly a sort of hint given by me to these people, though I certainly had no grounds to give it, that they might surrender, and that perhaps they would get some sort of humane treatment.  Acting on the hint, and being forced out by economic causes which of course are going to tell in the long run, all these men who were really prisoners did come out. One of them, a man named James Donnelly, got nine months' imprisonment.</P>

      <P>No, I did not say that.  He came out in the hope that the Government, in the altered circumstances of the country, due to the changes that have taken place in the Republican movement, somehow or other might possibly have their cases favourably considered.  To use a slang phrase, one of them &ldquo;got it in the neck.&rdquo;  He got nine months' imprisonment. I do not know what the original charge was.  He was not tried at the time.  The others are going to keep as they are until they are beaten. On the occasion that I refer to, I also suggested to the Minister that the practice of hounding down these men on the run, as well as the incident that occurred a couple of days before in Clonmel, when one of those escaped men was fired on and wounded by the Guard, would inevitably, if the Government did not take a decent line in this matter, lead to somebody amongst those prisoners firing back on the Guards.  I am forced back to the statement I made in the debate on the Supplementary Estimate when I said that every effort that had been made by this Party here either to forget the past or to get the country into a decent line of ordered government again has <Col N="1612" /> been simply turned down, and that one attempt after another has been made to stir up strife again.  As regards the men on the run who, one may say, are to all intents and purposes prisoners, I say there is a case for investigation by someone, whether it is by this particular Committee or some other body. If the Government is going to take up an adamant attitude on the matter, as they have done in most things, I do not know what to say as regards the prospects of ultimate peace.</P>
      <P>This has only just occurred to me: Suppose we here do not insist on our Committee, would the Minister give an undertaking to have the whole thing reviewed by the Government if we do not put this motion to a vote.  What I suggest is that all these cases should be reviewed.  Let the case for all the people concerned be stated.  I want to put this straight to the Government: that if they really want goodwill in the country, and if they want peace here, they will only get it in one way, and that is by doing what they have never done up to this&mdash;doing something decent.  They have never attempted it yet.</P>
      <P>I think I have gone pretty far in the matter now.  This is a serious matter, and I want to tell the Government that it is absolutely up to them to make some move, and not to be satisfied with sending 48 of 57 Deputies on this side into one Lobby, and marching with their own followers into the opposite Lobby.  I tell them that they must make one attempt at least.  I may tell the Government this, that the attempts that we have made to make the Republican movement a constitutional movement have been met with scorn by them. They have tried to side-track it again. If it does come to that, let the blame be on themselves and on those who are remaining adamant on this.  There is one point that I want to insist on.  It is that you are not going to make criminals out of men like Gilmore, Seán Russell and Mick Price and several others whom the Minister has conveniently glossed over, although the Minister himself accused Deputy Ruttledge of hurrying over some of the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He did not hurry over them, because he did not even refer to them.  One <Col N="1613" /> case over which we can stand best he did not refer to at all.  I think I have dealt with the reason why we will not reveal our source of information.  I have made that clear.  I do not want the House to infer that it is not because we do not reveal it that we have not got it.  In spite of all attempts to seal them up, we have still our sources of information, and they are just as reliable as they were when the gentleman opposite was the head of our forces.  There is a chance, I think, if it is taken in the proper way, to stop the strife and warfare which have been so often talked about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not anxious that the House should be turned into a super court of appeal, as it were, but at the same time I am voting for this motion, and I will state the reasons why I intend to do so.  I believe every Deputy, regardless of Party, should do his part to remove the bitter memories of the civil war period.  I think the intention of the mover of the motion was not very well served by going into the facts of certain cases and mentioning particular names.  I am anxious to find out what the Fianna Fáil Party mean by constitutional political activity. I think that cannot be done any better way than by agreeing to the setting up of this committee, before which Deputy Boland and others, speaking for the men whose names have been mentioned, will be asked to come and will have to put down in black and white their view of the charges that have been preferred against particular individuals that have been mentioned in the House.  We will have on the one hand the advantage of hearing the case on behalf of persons in prison for political or criminal offences, and we will have the advantage of hearing the Government side of the case in reply.  I think that will be an education to members of the House who are not prepared to waste time going into each case.  We will have on the public records of the country, for the benefit of all whom it may concern, and who may wish to make use of them, the real ideas behind the minds of the people who are speaking for those who are in prison to-day for alleged political offences <Col N="1614" /> when in reality some of them might be crimes of the worst kind.  I made up my mind to vote for this motion for the reasons given by Deputy Boland in the latter part of his speech.  I do not think we will be helping to remove the bitter memories of the civil war period by employing forces to chase after men who escaped from prison under circumstances cited by Deputy Boland.  Some believe those men who walked out when the door was open for them are not guilty of any great offence.  If the committee is set up it will have the benefit of having the cases made by both sides in regard to those persons. There is a man who had long associations with the pre-truce strife, and who was a T.D. for my area.  He escaped from Mountjoy Jail when he found the door was open, and he would have been a fool if he had remained in under the circumstances.  I made representations to the late Minister for Justice to allow that man to go home and get the benefit of the amnesty, and to forget the bitter memories of the past, but that was not agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from Deputy Boland that a similar appeal was made to the Minister on a recent occasion when a deputation from Fianna Fáil waited on him.  I am sorry the Minister cannot take the long and broad view in regard to these cases, because I believe that if a case can be made to this House and to the country there should be no further harassing of the men who escaped.  I am anxious to find out what is the real meaning of constitutional political activity.  I listened to many of the speeches with great interest made by Fianna Fáil Deputies since they came into the House, but I have not been able to make up my mind as to where they stand.  They will, in the natural course of events&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;come into power in this country, and they will then have to determine to what extent political activities are confined to constitutional activities or opposition to their own Government.  I am not the sort of person who believes that we are all going to become saints and scholars when the Fianna Fáil Party occupy seats on the Government Benches.  Deputy Aiken may get it out of his mind that when he sits in the seat of the mighty and <Col N="1615" /> issues orders as Minister for Defence that the people have reached that stage of civilisation or political commonsense as to stand to attention and say, &ldquo;We bow to the rule and dictation of Deputy Aiken as Minister for Defence.&rdquo;  Too much demoralisation has been created as a result of the Civil War to hope that we will come to an ideal state of affairs when Deputy Aiken and Deputy Boland take control. The day may come when they will have to sit in the seats of the mighty and dictate to the common people, and they may find that they are up against the same kind of alleged political activity as the Government is at present. I cannot decide for myself, as a result of the discussion, as to who is a criminal offender or a political offender, or a semi-political or semi-criminal offender.  That is for the Committee to do.  I believe it would be a good day's work for the Dáil and will save a good deal of discussion to set up this Committee, and I hope to learn, as a result of the Committee's deliberations, the real meaning of constitutional activity as interpreted by the Fianna Fáil.</P>

We are perhaps open to the definition of a constitutional party, but before anything we are a Republican party.

      <P>Five years ago the methods we adopted were not the methods we have adopted now.  Five years ago we were on the defensive, and perhaps in time we may recoup our strength sufficiently to go on the offensive. Our object is to establish a Republican <Col N="1616" /> Government in Ireland.  If that can be done by the present methods we have we will be very pleased, but if not we would not confine ourselves to them.  The attitude the Minister has taken up on this is one which I regard more in sorrow than in anger.  They have taken a narrow view and adopted the attitude that if they can justify their detention of the prisoners in jail and their chase of the men on the run in a manner sufficiently glib to convince the majority in this House their duty is done.  Their attitude on the concrete facts of the prisoners is in direct variance with the words they used on other occasions when they asked us to forget the past and co-operate with them in building up the economic strength of the nation. Are we to take it that the speeches we have listened to from President Cosgrave and other members on the Government Benches were just cute devices to get the Government out of an awkward situation, to avoid discussion on matters that were unpleasant to the Government, that there was no meaning behind what they said, but that they were just giving a demonstration of general hypocrisy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to take it that when President Cosgrave was speaking on the Army Vote, speaking in the manner which Deputy Boland has mentioned when he asked us to let these bitter memories die out, if we could, that he did not mean it, that they were only words he was speaking, and that when he is given an opportunity of putting these sentiments into practice he immediately tears off the mask and show, himself to be unchanged and in the same position which he always occupied? The Minister for Justice has given us a number of details with reference to prisoners.  He has mentioned why such-and-such a man is kept in, and why somebody else is let out.  He told us, for instance, that McPeake, who deserted from the Free State Army with an armoured car, was unworthy of our consideration because he was a deserter.  In the years we have passed through, there have been many deserters from the Free State Army, and quite a number of deserters from the Republican Army.  The deserters from the Republican Army were, in fact, <Col N="1617" /> unique in number, and many of these deserters are occupying seats in this House.  There were, as I say, a number of deserters from the Free State Army to the Republican Army.  After the attack on the Four Courts&mdash;I was on active service then&mdash;I remember one night there came out of the town of Carlow three Crossley tenders packed with deserters from the Free State Army.  They brought their tenders and arms with them, and many, after participating in the campaign, were arrested and afterwards released.  The amnesty seemed to apply to them. There were many other cases.  Some of those who deserted were executed, but others were not executed and were released.  Why was exception made in the case of McPeake?  After all, what he did was done by hundreds of others. He deserted with an armoured car. That may be particularly galling to members opposite, but it only in a degree affects the case.</P>
    <P>The men who deserted in Carlow did not desert with an armoured car, because they could not get it.  They took what they could, and if they could have thrown in an armoured car they would have done so, and we would have been very glad to receive it.  These men were released, but McPeake is in jail.  Is it necessary for the maintenance of the State, for the maintenance of the Treaty position, that he should still be in jail?  Is it necessary in the interests of the nation&mdash;if we may refer to the nation here&mdash;that this particular case should be picked out from thousands of others and that this man should be retained in prison?  There was the case of the men who escaped from Mountjoy. There was a rescue of prisoners from Mountjoy.  The operation was carried out successfully, and nobody was injured.  I am sure that the Minister for Local Government, who has some experience in these matters, will admit that it was a nice job, neatly carried out.  The men escaped.  Did the incident shake the foundations of the State so severely that it was necessary to inflict punishment at any cost on everyone connected with it?</P>
    <P>Was the incident of such a nature that to-day, three years after it occurred, if the officers of the law put <Col N="1618" /> their hands on any of the men who escaped, they must be sent to jail and sentenced to months of imprisonment for having anything to do with it. When the Public Safety Bill was going through this House I remember reading in the Press&mdash;the Press may have as usual misreported the speech&mdash;a statement by President Cosgrave that at that particular time, towards the end of 1925, I was Minister for Defence in the Republican Army, and Mr. Aiken was Chief of Staff.  I do not know where President Cosgrave got his information. A number of these sensational disclosures which were made here were wrong and were founded on false information, and, possibly, this information was of the same kind.  But, if the information was correct, then Deputy Aiken and myself must have had knowledge of the Mountjoy incident and have sanctioned it, and, if the incident was of such a nature that three years after the event everyone connected with it must be punished to save the prestige of the State, it is strange that Deputy Aiken and I are here if we had anything to do with it, while those who were actually engaged in it are prisoners in Mountjoy.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Defence says, &ldquo;hear, hear.&rdquo;  Either it is not correct to inflict this severe punishment or else President Cosgrave's statement is not correct.  I do not want to go to prison.  I am not inviting the Government to arrest me and put me on trial.  Surely in this year, 1928, it is possible to draw a veil over events that happened in 1925.  A lot of water has flown under the Liffey bridges since then.  Many developments occurred in the political life of this country since then, and the situation which now exists bears no resemblance to the situation in 1925.  I think, if those on the Government Benches, who spoke of the need of co-operation and the need for unity of effort amongst all parties meant one iota of what they said they would see the advisability of that incident, at any rate, being forgotten and of those connected with it, either members of the rescue party or prisoners rescued, being allowed to return to their homes.  If it <Col N="1619" /> is punishment you want I think that those who took part in it have been punished enough.  A man cannot be three years on the run, away from his home and family, living from hand to mouth on the countryside, without meeting with considerable hardship.  If it is merely a desire to punish which is animating the Government, they can rest assured that that desire has been gratified. If they want to make unity of effort possible they must remember that the men on the run are a constant source of danger to that achievement. They are desperate.  They are being hunted down like madmen, like lunatics at large, preaching the gospel of desperation. They are carrying the creed of violence into the homes they visit and amongst the people they meet and finally, sooner or later, if the Government persist in their present policy that creed of violence, that spark of violence which they are fanning to flame, will burst into flame, and this country will be driven back to the position it was in a few years ago.  I move the adjournment of the debate until Friday next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. BRENNAN Mr. BRENNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to make my case an impersonal one, and any reference I make to a personal or individual case I make for one purpose and one purpose only&mdash;the purpose of illustrating the general application of what I consider an unwarrantable desire on the part of the Minister for Local Government to deprive local authorities of the obvious rights which have been conferred upon them by an Act of this House.  I do not want it to be inferred that I am caoining over patronage or for the sake of the patronage which has been taken from local authorities.  My complaint is that an important privilege having been conceded to local authorities under the Local Authorities Act&mdash;and I think that privilege must have behind it some very good and serious consideration at the time it was conceded&mdash;is now <Col N="1620" /> being nullified by the Local Government Department.  The consideration behind the granting of this privilege appears to be an admission on the part of this House that local authorities were in a better position to judge the efficiency of their staffs than any Selection Board would be.  In consequence of the knowledge which this House had of that, local authorities were allowed under Section 5, of the Act to fill vacancies in a particular manner without referring these vacancies to the Appointments Commission, the appointment when made being subject to the sanction of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The contention of the Local Government Department now is that unless the Minister for Local Government gives his sanction to the procedure&mdash; that is, prior sanction to the proposal&mdash; the local authorities cannot make the appointment.  The local authorities make no claim on the Minister's right to sanction the appointment or to refuse sanction of the appointment when made.  We admit that.  The Minister for Local Government has a right to say when an appointment is made: &ldquo;This man does not fill the bill; he is not qualified,&rdquo; or for some other reason he can say: &ldquo;I cannot sanction him.&rdquo;  We admit that.</P>
      <P>Now let me give you the particular section which deals with the matter.  It reads:</P>
      <P>An appointment of a person to fill an office to which this Act applies may, subject to the sanction of the Minister, be made by a local authority without requesting or obtaining a recommendation from the Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all of the section that concerns me.  I do not know what meaning the legal advisers of the Local Government Department put on these words, &ldquo;subject to the sanction of the Minister,&rdquo; but in ordinary, common usage the meaning of, and the interpretation put on, these words would be that the Minister had the right to withhold sanction to the appointment when it was made.  If the Minister contends that some other interpretation can be put on that, I propose to show that at least the spirit of the Bill when it was being put <Col N="1621" /> through this House was as I say.  The original draft of this section read:</P>
    <P>Whenever an office to which this Act applies becomes vacant, the local authority, with the consent of the Minister, may within a certain specified time make the appointment.</P>
    <P>An amendment was tabled to delete the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister,&rdquo; which apparently meant prior consent&mdash;the consent of the party to the Act, consent to the procedure. An amendment was tabled to delete these words, &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister,&rdquo; and as a result of the tabling of those amendments the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Burke, deleted the whole section and substituted this other one, which reads, as I pointed out:</P>
    <P>An appointment of a person to fill an office to which this Act applies may, subject to the sanction of the Minister, be made by the local authority...</P>
    <P>Compare that with the original, which stated:</P>
    <P>Whenever an office to which this Act applies becomes vacant, the local authority, with the consent of the Minister...</P>
    <P>Because the Minister had met the amendments they were not moved. Further, sub-section (4) of Section 5 reads:</P>
    <P>Whenever an office to which this Act applies becomes vacant the local authority, if satisfied that the circumstances of the case so require, may, with the consent of the Minister, appoint any person to fill such office temporarily.</P>
    <P>No member of the House objected to the consent of the Minister in that case, because it was a temporary appointment. Consequently, the Minister for Local Government still retains that power under the Act.  That is, with regard to a temporary appointment. With regard to a permanent appointment, the wording is that &ldquo;The appointment of a person to fill an office to which this Act applies may, subject to the sanction of the Minister, be made by the local authority without requesting the Commissioners, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They &ldquo;may elect or appoint any person who held a pensionable office <Col N="1622" /> under the said or any other local authority or any two or more local authorities, the duties of which related to matters the same as, or similar to, the matters to which the duties of the vacant office relate.&rdquo;  They can also appoint a pensioner who is receiving an allowance from any other local authority, and so on.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite clear that it was the intention of this House and the intention of the previous Minister for Local Government, Deputy Burke, that the words subject to &ldquo;sanction&rdquo; should mean, as we knew in usage, post-sanction. Consequently, he deleted the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister,&rdquo; which would have meant prior sanction.  If further proof is needed for that, I will quote from the debates on the Bill when it was before the House.  Deputy Dalton, who was opposing the passing of the Bill, made this statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You may get an assistant secretary of a county council who has a better knowledge of the work than any man who can be appointed through this system of examination in Dublin, for he has acted for years in that capacity.  In all such cases where a man has a record it should be a question of promotion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke, the then Minister for Local Government, stated immediately: &ldquo;Why not promote him?&rdquo; Well the contention now is that he cannot be promoted without the Minister's prior consent.  Further, in the debates we find the Minister for Local Government making this statement, which is very significant and very important:</P>
    <P>In fact one Deputy suggested that it was merely transferring patronage from the local authorities to the Minister for Local Government.  I do not see how any Deputy who has read Section 5, could say that.  That section gives local authorities absolute power, as regards the promotion of suitable officials at present in their service, and power to elect suitable pensioners who had experience of similar work in the past.  There is absolute power to make those appointments without any reference to the Commissioners.  It is only in cases where they fail to make these appointments <Col N="1623" /> that the machinery of the Commissioners comes into operation at all.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say that the Minister for Local Government is a fit and proper person to interpret Acts of Parliament, but I do say that is the spirit in which he got his Act through the House, and that is the spirit in which it was interpreted all over the country.</P>
    <P>I think I have quoted quite enough to show what the spirit of the Bill was. To my mind, the Bill was a means of selection for public offices where there was no chance of promotion.  That was what the Bill appeared to be, and what the Act appears to be.  My contention then is that the Local Government Department, knowing the spirit of the Bill, and the spirit in which it was put through the House, is acting ultra vires in seeking to put a legal interpretation on certain clauses of the Act which was never intended, and which is absolutely immaterial to the working of the Act. On the other hand, it will have a deterrent effect on the incentive to efficiency which the anticipation of promotion holds out to officials.  What chance, for instance, has a man, say, of 47 or 48 years of age, who has spent his life in a public office, of getting an appointment through the Appointments Commission against a man fresh from school with academic qualifications?  He has absolutely none.  My claim then is that the local authority has a perfect right within the Act to promote this man, and the Minister has the power to withhold or grant sanction, whichever he thinks it right to do.  My point is that the Minister has no right to say, as he said to Galway and Roscommon: &ldquo;You cannot promote without my prior sanction.&rdquo; My contention is that that interpretation is wrong.  It certainly was not the spirit in which the Bill went through the House, and it is not, to my mind, the proper interpretation to be put on the Bill from the point of view of efficiency in local administration, because if you remove the incentive to efficiency, which is promotion, nothing else remains as an incentive to efficiency.  What prospect has any man in the office of a local authority if, according as vacancies arise, either at the <Col N="1624" /> top or in the middle, or anywhere else, there cannot be promotion?  There can, of course, be promotion with the prior consent of the Minister, but I hold that is absolutely and entirely wrong, and that it was never intended that that interpretation should be put upon it. If we can only have promotion with the expressed consent of the Minister for Local Government, where does this absolute power, mentioned by Deputy Burke when he was putting the Bill through the House, come in?  Was he entirely wrong in stating: &ldquo;It is only in cases where they fail to make these appointments that the machinery of the Commissioners comes into operation.&rdquo; He may be wrong, but that was the spirit in which the Bill was passed and in which this House interpreted it.  To my mind, it is the spirit which will lead to greater efficiency in local administration.</P>
    <P>In Roscommon quite recently the Board of Health had a vacancy for a doctor for the county hospital, and they asked the Minister for Local Government to send down an inspector to consult with them at their meeting in order that they would be unanimous in the manner in which they would select a doctor.  The inspector attended the meeting, and as a result the following advertisement was drafted:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Board will at their Meeting at Roscommon on Saturday, 18th February, 1928, commencing at 10 a.m., proceed to fill, subject to the sanction of the Minister, the vacant office of Medical Officer and Surgeon of the County Hospital at Roscommon, by appointing a person who satisfies the Board that on the 17th December, 1927, he either held a pensionable office, or was in receipt of an allowance in respect of his having ceased to hold an office under this Board or any other local authority or any two or more local authorities the duties of which related to matters the same as or similar to the matters to which the duties of the vacant office relate; that he possesses all the qualifications for the office prescribed by Article 36 of the General Regulations, 1924, and produces a certificate obtained from a visiting surgeon of a clinical hospital recognised by the <Col N="1625" /> Minister that he has had at least not one but three years' practical experience in surgical work, including the performance of major operations, and shall also have a practical knowledge of x-ray technique and, be conversant with the application of x-ray and its various uses.  The person appointed will be a whole-time officer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That advertisement was sent to the Minister for Local Government after consultation with his inspector and his reply was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, forwarding a copy of the advertisement proposed to be issued by the Roscommon Board of Health and Public Assistance inviting applications for the position of Medical Officer and Surgeon of the County Hospital, I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to point out that the effect of the Board's proposal would be to confine the position to medical men who had already been in the Poor Law service and having regard to the qualifications prescribed for the office and the nature of the duties, the Minister considers that it is not in the interests of the service to impose this limitation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For this reason the Minister is not prepared to approve of the Board's proposal.  The vacancy should be reported to the Local Appointments Commission, so that the appointment would be open to highly qualified medical men, who may not have been in the Poor Law Service, and the Board would have the benefit of special advice at the disposal of the Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the same day that the Board decided to issue the advertisement a notice of motion was handed in by one of the members to this effect:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hereby give notice that I will move, or cause to be moved, at our next meeting on the 18th February, 1928, that the vacancy in the office of Medical Officer and Surgeon of the County Hospital be filled in accordance with Article 30 of the General Regulations of 1924, by transferring thereto, with the consent of the Minister, one of the permanent medical officers in the service <Col N="1626" /> of this Board, provided that he or she satisfies us by testimonials and otherwise that he or she possesses the necessary qualifications for the office as laid down by the Minister in Article 36 of the said Regulations.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That a copy of this notice of motion be sent forthwith to each of our permanent medical officers to enable those of them possessing the necessary qualification to apply, if they so desire, to be transferred accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister refused to allow the advertisement to go.  When the Board met they acted on the notice of motion and appointed one of their own medical officers who, they believed, would fill the bill.  On the day that the appointment was made the Chairman of the Board apparently got into communication with the Local Government Department and asked the Local Government Department if the Board had the right to promote one of its own officials. This was the reply of the Local Government Department:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Promotion would not be in order without prior sanction by this Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hold that that was never contemplated. How does that fit in with the section of the Act which I read?</P>

      <P>I am very sorry, but I will not be half way through by then.  However, that is my case roughly.  As I have only one minute left, I cannot finish my case, and all I can say is that, if the Minister insists that his interpretation is right, I am afraid it is not making easy the thorny path of the Commission, and, what is more, I know that the local bodies all over the country will not be pleased.  If he insists that his interpretation is right, and that that is the only proper and legal interpretation to be put upon it, the matter must be brought before the House in a different form, at some time other than on the adjournment, so as to get an expression of opinion on it.  If I do that, I hope the Minister will see his way to <Col N="1627" /> leave the matter to a free vote of the House, so that we will see where we are exactly.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan has spoken a lot about the spirit of the Act and the intentions of the House, the obvious rights and important privileges that this Act enshrines and the particular spirit and attention that it was supposed to get for public bodies. He talked a long time, and he talked a lot about these things, but he has left us absolutely devoid of any idea as to what objective he has in mind, what objective the public bodies have in mind, or what objective this Act was supposed actually to carry out in the public service whether for the public bodies themselves or the people for whom the public bodies are working. Deputy Brennan goes back to some old Dáil debates and some draft copies of Bills, but what I have to deal with is the Act if the Act is properly worked, and I subscribe, to some extent, to what Deputy Brennan says: that a legal point here and there of minor importance is immaterial to the working of the Act if the Act is properly and effectively worked.  As far as the legal position goes, I am advised that a public body proceeding to make a promotion must have the Minister's prior sanction.  That is a legal point.  But let us get on to the practical thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much has been talked about promotion that we are left to understand that the intention of people who speak about promotion is to give an opportunity to persons in the public service already, and who have given satisfactory service to get promotion, to get transferred to better positions in the service on their merits and as a result of their service.  If that be so, let us face what the actual position is.  Let us take the Roscommon case.  Let us say, at the beginning, that a Minister <Col N="1628" /> attempting to carry out this Act is restricted by many things.  In the first place, he has no power under the Act to make any regulations that will either help himself or will help the public bodies to achieve the objects for which the Act is intended.  The Minister has no power to make a local body advertise in case they are proceeding with his sanction under Section 5.  He has no power to make them advertise.  I just mention that to show the disability under which a Minister who wants to get the best effect out of the Act labours.  Let us take the Roscommon case.  The running of this case from the Roscommon Board of Health point of view was not so simple or straight as the Deputy says.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. BRENNAN Mr. BRENNAN">

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me have the ten minutes at my disposal, at any rate.  The Roscommon Board of Health wanted to appoint a county surgeon to their County Hospital, and they asked that an inspector would be sent down to attend their meeting.  The inspector attended, and it was decided that an advertisement would be issued.  That decision to advertise was enshrined in a motion which did not restrict the field to persons already in the employment of local bodies.  A copy of that resolution reached the Department of Local Government on the 3rd February, coming from a meeting held on the 21st January.  But three days previous to that a draft advertisement came in for the sanction of the Minister proposing to advertise for the position and to restrict applicants to persons who were in the employment of local bodies already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. BRENNAN Mr. BRENNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They had not a right to advertise otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the advertisement as it is.  The Roscommon Board of Health, bearing in mind the spirit of the Act, and the intention of the House, proceeded to ask permission to advertise to all the medical officers in the employment of the medical bodies throughout the country, for applicants for the position of county surgeon in the Roscommon County Hospital.  There are twenty-five county hospitals in the country, and there are 52 district hospitals <Col N="1629" /> in the country.  There are about 650 or 700 dispensary medical officers. Let us take the county medical officers alone.  There are many county medical officers throughout the country that are not as well paid as the Roscommon Board of Health propose to pay their county medical officers.  One or three or four, or half a dozen might desire to transfer to Roscommon.  Of the 52 district hospitals that are in the country, some are hospitals where local dispensary officers are in charge.  These are districts where there is already a county hospital.  That would be in counties where there is a county hospital. There are others where there is no county hospital, but there are a certain number of district hospitals of a higher class than district hospitals would be in a county where there is a county hospital.  Some of those in charge of district hospitals, some of the 52, may desire to be applicants, apart altogether from the dispensary medical officers that might apply.</P>
      <P>What machinery has the Roscommon Board of Health at its disposal to decide in the interests of giving the best man the job and the best services to the people of Roscommon which of the many medical men that might come forward for this position was the best? The Minister responsible for the administration of this Act, as well as for giving the poor of the country the best possible service he can give them, must certainly take cognisance of the fact, that if the Act gives a supreme right and an obvious right and important privileges to the Roscommon Board of Health to select a man from among those many applicants, they have not the machinery to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I just say this?  I have no power to define in regulations what classes are kindred, shall I say, for the purpose of Section 5 of this Act.  I have no power to arrange machinery for the Local Board of Health to make selections from among men of high technical qualifications as to which is the best. What we have done, in the circular issued on the 12th August, 1927, is that we have asked the local bodies that in future, when they apply to the Minister for his sanction to proceed under <Col N="1630" /> Section 5 that the application shall be accompanied by a clear statement of the ground on which the application is made.  In the short time at my disposal I want to say this.  Employees of local bodies have a very efficient and strong organisation.  The dispensary and medical officers have their own organisation.  The local bodies are fairly well represented and can get their voices heard through the General Council of the County Councils.  I have not had a single complaint that the employees of the local bodies were dissatisfied with the way in which the Department is administering this Act. If there are any representations to be made by those particular bodies on behalf of employees or by the General Council of the County Councils on behalf of the public bodies, the Department and myself are only too anxious to hear what they have to suggest, as to how the spirit of this Act is to be given effect to.  We have already had a case in which a dispensary medical officer from an out-of-the-way place in West Cork was being appointed in another Board of Health area without reference to the claims of other officers in that particular area, or any other area, nearby, and even as far as the Department of Local Government is concerned without any information being before the Board of Health as to what kind of service that officer really did give in the other area.  But as regards the one case of how the Roscommon Board of Health were to get the best possible man as County Surgeon, very little contemplation of that one case will help Deputies to realise the difficulty of the position from the point of view of the Minister.  As far as I am concerned, and as far as my Department is concerned, what is enshrined in the last paragraph of our circular of 12th August, 1927, was the best possible contribution we could give to local bodies in the matter of finding out what exactly the position was in each particular case so that on the merits we could help the local body in the best possible way we thought it could be helped.</P>
