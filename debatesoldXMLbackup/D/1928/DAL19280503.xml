    <P>These figures do not include compensation stock, of which £1,446,000 had been issued up to the 31st March, 1928, by way of compensation for damage to property in the post-Truce period. Neither do they include payments made from the Army Vote or the Vote for Public Works and Buildings; nor do they include the full cost of restoring destroyed Government property.  Moreover, no provision was made for compensation in respect of consequential loss in the post-Truce period.</P>
    <P>As regards the third part of the question, the total amount actually received in cash from the British Government in respect of pre-Truce compensation was £3,217,543, but, in addition, substantial liabilities of the British Government were discharged by way of set-off in the course of financial adjustments between the two Governments. No payment was received from the British Government in respect of post-Truce compensation.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for the current financial year will be found in the volume of Estimates.  The extent of the liability outstanding on the 31st March, 1929, will depend on a number of factors over which the Department of Finance has no control, and I hesitate at this stage to offer an estimate of what the amount will be.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that great hardship is inflicted on the people of Graigue-Cullen, Carlow, by the periodical flooding of the River Barrow; that a nine-inch board has been placed over the weir at Mr. Shackleton's mill, over which is placed a gangway supported by cement piers, the object of which was to raise the board at flooding times; that this board is never lifted when water is high, and, as a consequence, holds all rubbish; and whether, in view of these facts, the Minister will undertake to have inquiries made in the matter at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Seumas Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Flooding at Graigue-Cullen, Carlow, is rare; it happened in 1925 and 1926, which were years of exceptional floods, but has not happened during last winter.  It appears to be due rather to the choking-up of an old drain than to the weir, though no doubt the weir has an influence upon it.  The question of the alleged enhancement of the weir had already been brought to the notice of the Commissioners of Public Works, and inquiries are being made.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware of the inconvenience caused to residents of Ballincurry district, Thurles, by the present arrangements for the delivery of letters, and whether he will consider the advisability of restoring a daily delivery in the district.</P>

      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy refers to the Ballincurry Cross to Tarsna rural post on which Ballincurry is served, and on which there is a delivery at present on three days a week.  The existing postal service is maintained at a loss to revenue.  It is regretted, therefore, <Col N="798" /> that the additional service asked for by the Deputy cannot be granted owing to the expense involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps before the business on the Order Paper is taken, you would allow me to mention a matter of which I have given you notice.  The matter is the presentation to the Dáil. as a first step in the presentation to the Oireachtas, of a petition prepared in accordance with the provisions of Article 48 of the Constitution. The petition is signed by 75,000 voters and upwards on the Register.  In fact, it is signed by over 96,000, of whom not more than 15,000 are voters in any one constituency, urging the enactment of legislation providing for the Initiation by' the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments.  The relevant sentences in Article 48 are the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas may provide for the Initiation by the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments. Should the Oireachtas fail to make such provision within two years, it shall on the petition of not less than seventy-five thousand voters on the Register, of whom not more than fifteen thousand shall be voters in any one constituency, either make such provisions or submit the question to the people for decision in accordance with the ordinary regulations governing the Referendum.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas has failed to make such provision within two years.  I am now asking you as Ceann Comhairle to receive on behalf of the Dáil this petition requesting that provision be made for the Initiation by the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments, and in particular the constitutional amendments that are recited.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has given me ample notice of this matter.  It raises a new and somewhat difficult point and has been given a good deal of consideration.  The general question of the presentation of petitions to the Dáil was considered some years ago by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Committee reported to the Dáil that, except in certain cases mentioned in the report of the Committee, the practice of presenting petitions should not be allowed.  That report was adopted by the House on the 27th February, 1924, and the decision is binding so far as ordinary petitions are concerned.  The petition referred to by Deputy de Valera does not seem to me to come within the category of ordinary petitions.  The decision which I mentioned, therefore, does not apply to the present case.  With regard to petitions purporting to have been prepared under the provisions of Article 48 of the Constitution, there is no machinery available for the verification of the facts, such, for example, as to whether all the signatories are voters on the Register and, if they are voters, whether not more than 15,000 of them are voters in any one constituency.  That is really a machinery point.  The request, in effect, made to me is that leave should be granted on behalf of the Dáil to present a petition purporting to have been prepared under the provisions of Article 48 of the Constitution.  If no objection is taken I am prepared to receive the petition on behalf of the Dáil without prejudice and without expressing any view as to whether the step now being taken on behalf of the petitioners would constitute any fulfilment of the requirements of Article 48 of the Constitution. If the petition be received, it will be delivered to the custody of the Clerk of the Dáil.  Is there any objection taken?</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a Joint Committee consisting of five members of the Dáil and five members of the Seanad be appointed to consider and report on the &lsquo;Rules of the Circuit Court&rsquo; made by the Minister for Justice under Section 66 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 (No. 10 of 1924), and presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the 25th day of April, 1926.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like if the Minister for Justice would make this point clear&mdash;whether the Committee it is proposed to set up will have power to take away certain rules without rejecting the whole lot.  The Minister has made the statement here from time to time that you cannot take away one rule without rejecting the lot.  I do not know who the Rule-making Authority are, and I do not think it is worth while inquiring, because it seems to me that they have lived far away from the facts of life and of any legal knowledge for a considerable time.  They have brought in a whole batch of rules which are entirely ultra vires, giving to County Registrars certain judicial functions.  If they had been even reading the newspapers they would have known that that question has been decided three times within the last three months by the High Court, the decision of the High Court being that no one except a judge appointed by the Minister for Justice can exercise judicial functions in the Saorstát.  What I want to get clear on is this: if certain particular Rules are rejected, does that mean that the position will still obtain <Col N="809" /> which the Minister has already stated, namely, that all the Rules will have to go back?</P>

      <P>The question which the Deputy puts, I think, can be answered in this fashion: The Rule-making Authority is, by a section of the Courts of Justice Act, the Minister for Justice.  He makes the Rules, but before he can promulgate them he must get the concurrence in certain cases of the Minister for Finance.  He must get the concurrence in all cases of the Rule-making Authority, and before the Rules made with that concurrence can come into force they must receive the sanction of both the Dáil and the Seanad by resolution. The question which the Deputy has put to me is one upon which there is a difference of legal opinion.</P>

      <P>The Joint Committee, I take it, intrinsically will have no powers, but the Committee will make their report to the Dáil and the Seanad as to whether, in the first place, the Rules should go through without alteration, and secondly, if they think there should be an alteration, they will report to both Houses on the nature of the alterations which they think should be made in the Rules.  Then the question will come before the Dáil and the Seanad as to whether they will ratify the Rules. Personally, I hope there will be very little difficulty about the matter, because the Rules have been drawn up with great care, and are the result of very hard work on behalf of the Rule-making Committee.  As I said in another place, I venture to hope that this Joint Committee will not be too keen on finding defects, or what may appear to be defects, in the Rules, because these are new Rules regulating the procedure of what is a new Court. In cases like this some Rules that a priori appear to be very good may in working appear defective, and sometimes amendments which would appear to improve the Rules may in working <Col N="810" /> prove to be a disimprovement.  The real test is experience.  Let these Rules come into operation and let experience show where they are good and where they are defective.  I do not, of course, mean to say that you should start off with any class of Rules.  What I mean to say is that when a Rule-making Authority has been working hard and done its best, when it is a competent authority chosen from competent people, that its Rules should receive a considerable amount of respect from any committee set up to inquire into them.  This is entirely, as I have already stated in this House, a non-Party matter.  I think everybody on every side of the House is most anxious that our courts should carry out their operations successfully, and that the administration of justice shall give satisfaction to all litigants in our courts.</P>

      <P>I think it would be very unfair to this Joint Committee to have to decide on certain matters.  In the first place they would not have an idea as to how the country people stand as regards facilities for attending the courts.  For instance, they are centralising in the cities.  In County Cork there is no Circuit Court outside Cork City.  That is not fair to people who have to travel 40 or 50 miles to attend these courts without remuneration. On previous occasions I have pointed out to the Minister the terrible inconvenience to which people in the rural districts have been put.  I think it is very unfair to have a certain section of the people putting Rules into operation without having regard to the facts in the case of people who have to travel long distances.  I believe this is a matter that could be considered by a small committee of the Parties in this House.  I believe we could arrive at a solution that would be satisfactory and facilitate everybody.</P>

If I am right, that difficulty will be before the Committee, and it will be open to them to report on, because it is part of the Rules to provide accommodation, and the fixing of areas for the holding of Circuit Courts would be one of these matters.  I think that would get rid of the difficulty of Deputy Carey and Deputy Murphy.  It will be one of the matters that would come directly before the Joint Committee, and on which the Committee will be entitled to inquire and report.  That difficulty, so far as West Cork is concerned, is very real and substantial.  It is one to which, possibly, there may be <Col N="812" /> two sides.  It is a question into which the Committee ought to be careful to make local inquiries.  The Committee can do that with the assistance of local representatives, such as Deputy Murphy and other representatives in the Cork area.

If a position like that is taken up, the Committee, appointed by this House, is not going to function properly because the position gathered from the viewpoint expressed by the Minister for Justice would seem to be that this Committee would be taken <Col N="813" /> only into minor consideration as compared with the considered opinion of the Rule-making Authority.  As Deputy Gorey said, and I think everyone with any little experience of the House will agree, the fees under these Rules are exorbitant.  There is a most outlandish question of costs.  As I pointed out, in the amendments I have in, to the Minister for Justice, they are generally too high and, in many instances, exorbitant.  There is a similar position with regard to other matters under these Rules, and unless this Committee is going to have power to alter drastically these Rules&mdash;the Minister has already said that you cannot alter the Rules, but you can reject them&mdash;the House cannot alter or amend them.</P>

As I said, I do not think it is of much importance in this case, because, as the Minister said, it <Col N="814" /> seems to be a non-Party matter.  But very frequently in such Committees it has been the habit to name five members from the Dáil and five from the Seanad.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading.  The main object of this Bill is to secure uniformity with regard to the testing of meters through which gas is sold to the public.  Any regulations which exist at present depend upon the Act of 1859, and while the provisions of that Act were fairly satisfactory the application of that Act is entirely unsatisfactory, because there was this peculiar limitation put upon the operation of that Act: By the terms of the Act itself it could only become operative in the areas of whatever local autho- <Col N="815" /> rities definitely established it as operative within a certain period after the passing of the Act, and, in fact, the only two authorities in this country who took advantage of it were Dublin and Cork.  The local authorities in Dublin and Cork alone adopted the 1859 Act, and the result has been that since the passing of that Act consumers of gas supplied by all but two gas companies in the Free State had no statutory provision made with regard to the testing of meters.  Another Act followed; the Gas Regulation Act of 1920 was passed with the idea of bettering the position which was found to have occurred here owing to the peculiar limitation of the 1859 Act.  In fact, the 1920 Act also failed to improve matters in this country as far as meter-testing was concerned, but it improved it in other respects; in so far as meter-testing was concerned it made no improvement, because it gave no legislative power even to local authorities which had adopted the 1859 Act to test meters except meters for use in the area of the particular local authority, so that the joint effect of the 1859 and the 1920 Acts was that only two local authorities had adopted the 1859 Act. They were the only two who had compulsion with regard to the testing of meters, and even these two could not test meters brought in from other areas for use outside these areas.  The Bill proposes to remedy all that while requiring that every meter through which gas is delivered for sale shall be properly verified and stamped, and it further requires, in order to get away with the impediments to the 1920 Act, that every inspector appointed by the local authority shall test any meter presented to him no matter where the future use of the meter is intended to be.  I should not be taken as saying that the gas companies have availed of the peculiar provisions of the 1859 Act. Quite a number of smaller companies have, in fact, voluntarily kept meters tested, and the authorities of Dublin and Cork, although not bound, have in fact tested meters for these people. It only means now that all the other undertakers will be put in the same position as certain companies have put themselves voluntarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> The second section of the Bill enables extensions to be made in the number of meter-testing stations if ever it be found necessary.  It is expected that it will be found necessary, and as the establishment of a station of this sort is a rather expensive matter it has been decided to limit the possible extension to country boroughs.  Sections 3 and 4 impose obligations with regard to the verification of stamps which has been spoken of as being the main object of the Bill.  Sections 5, 6 and 7 are for the purpose of making it clear that the Saorstát Eireann stamp on gas meters will alone be valid, and this provision is necessary by reason of the fact that there is a practice whereby a number of companies have imported into this country meters stamped in England or Scotland, and the claim has been made that on account of a certain obscurity in the law that stamp should be counted as being sufficient without any further stamp in this country.  Sections 5, 6 and 7 will clear up whatever obscurity there has been said to be in the law and will make it essential for the future that in order to enable a meter to be valid the Saorstát Eireann stamp will have to be on it.  There is a provision in Section 5 that meters already in use will have to be stamped within a period of twelve months.  The usual representation has been made to me that the twelve months period does not give enough time.  I have had certain representations made on that matter and I think interviews are bound to follow.  If the period is not found suitable it will be a matter of meeting the exigencies of the situation.  It may be found necessary to have the period extended, but twelve months is thought, at the moment, to be a proper period It may have to be extended.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives additional security; it enables inspectors to ascertain whether meters have, in fact, been stamped or not.  Up to the present the only duty laid upon a gas inspector was the examination of such meters as were presented to him.  It is necessary that we should have some means of ascertaining whether all meters in stores or in the premises of gas companies have, in fact, been tested.  Section 9 deals with the testing of gas as opposed to the <Col N="817" /> testing of meters by the extension of the expression &ldquo;gas undertaker&rdquo; which is provided in Section 3.  Gas undertakers will have to apply for an order under the 1920 Act authorising them to adopt the thermal system of charge.  There are sixty-eight undertakers&mdash;gas companies&mdash;and of these forty-six are non-statutory and the extension of the term in Section 3 will enable these people to apply for an order under the 1920 Act enabling them to adopt the thermal system instead of the system previously in use.  Section 9 also takes away certain small limitations that were imposed in respect of charges for gas and which have been found unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is one of these sections of legislation by reference.  The reference in this case is simply to the first two lettered paragraphs of sub-section (1). It simply substitutes &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; for &ldquo;quarter sessions,&rdquo; enabling the particular Minister to act in lieu of quarter sessions in regard to the appointment of gas examiners.  The next two lettered paragraphs, C. and D., substitute days which have been found, in fact, to be more convenient to gas companies in relation to the dates for the fixing of the rate of charge and the payment of contributions to the gas fund.  The last lettered paragraph of that sub-section is to correct an error in the 1920 Act by which Ireland is entirely omitted from the provisions of the section.  The other sub-section is to enable certain expenses incurred by the Minister under this Act or the Act of 1920 to be payable out of the gas fund.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is an important section. It is set out here to remove a particular anomaly.  In Dublin there are, in fact, two Acts in operation.  There is a private Act obtained by the Gas Company in 1874 and in addition there is the Act of 1920.  Under the private Act of 1874 it was required that the Board of Trade should appoint a special gas examiner.  Under the 1920 Act it was laid down with regard to the country that appointment should be made by local authority and that the examiner should act under direction of the Board of Gas Referees.  The 1874 provision was not repealed by the 1920 Act with the result that up to date it has been <Col N="818" /> compulsory to appoint two examiners in Dublin.  It is quite clear that only one is required and this allows for one in the future.  That person appointed by the Dublin authority will continue to act under direction of the Gas Referees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make it appear that I am opposing this Bill, because I recognise that it contains many useful provisions.  At the same time, I would like to have certain reassurances from the Minister in connection with some of the sections of the Bill.  I may say, in passing, that while we have in Section 1 several terms used in the Bill defined&mdash;for instance we have the expression, &ldquo;the Minister,&rdquo;&ldquo;The Act of 1859,&rdquo;&ldquo;The Act of 1860&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Act of 1920,&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;meter&rdquo; all defined&mdash;we have no definition of the word &ldquo;gas&rdquo; itself.  I do not suggest that it will come about.  It may be, if Yankee slang, perhaps Cockney slang, or even Dublin slang, becomes common and accepted as many other words have passed into the English language, that gas will have a different meaning from the meaning which was attached to it fifteen years ago.  Commonly the expression &ldquo;gas&rdquo; used in Dublin does not mean the stuff that passes through tubes and which we light occasionally. The term &ldquo;gas&rdquo; has not been defined. I am not going to make a great point about that, but at the same time I think it would be useful to have the word defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 secures that all meters now in houses and shops shall be re-tested within twelve months.  The Gas Company may endeavour to extend this period, but in the future the term which all those engaged in the industry of making those gas meters would suggest would be at least two years, for the very obvious reason that if there is a large demand in the near future for gas meters, as the result of the passing into law of this Bill, it is quite possible that the Dublin makers of gas meters may not be able to deliver the goods in a short period.  If the period were spread over two years it would enable the people engaged in the industry to supply all the meters required in Dublin, and perhaps outside it.  However, <Col N="819" /> I understand that the people engaged in this industry in the Saorstát will be able to supply all the meters required for this purpose, if they get two years, at least.  That is one of the things upon which I would like to have some reassurance from the Minister in charge of this Bill.  In that connection, I would like to say that quite recently a number of these meters were supplied on the order, I understand, of the Dublin Alliance Gas Company, and these meters were taken from the stock of a London Company, having a depôt here in Dublin which, of course, incidentally deprives a number of Irish workers in this industry of employment.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, this London factory was able to accumulate stocks during the summer, and when the order was placed by a Dublin company for gas meters they were supplied out of the stocks in London and dumped here. That is a state of affairs which I hope will not be repeated, and I trust that the Minister will see that the effect of this Bill will not be to increase further importations into the country.  I also suggest that there should be a limit to the time for re-testing meters.  It is common knowledge that there are two classes of meters in ordinary use, the dry meter and the wet meter.  The prolonged use of a dry meter usually tells against the consumer, whereas the prolonged use of the wet meter generally results in favour of the consumer. The tendency, therefore, is to substitute dry for wet meters, and for that reason I suggest that there should be a limit to the time in which these meters should be tested.  As the makers guarantee these meters for five years, I suggest that that should be a limit of time for testing them.  In answer to a question put by me on the 27th of April last, in which I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to state the number and value of gas meters imported into the Free State for the periods 1st of January to 31st of March, 1927, 1st of January to 31st of December, 1927, and 1st January to 31st of March, 1928, the Minister replied that the following were the quantities and values of gas meters and gas <Col N="820" /> meter fittings imported in each of the specified periods: 1st of January to 31st of March, 938 cwt.  I am not sure that that is the right term.  I think it should be 938 gas meters each weighing one cwt.  However, the value is given as £9,478.  For the period 1st of January to 31st December, 1927, the figures given are 2,502 cwt., and the value £24,562.  From the 1st of January to the 31st of March, 1928, the figures are 1,126 cwt. of a value of £13,076.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the necessity of having some effort made through the provisions of this Bill to provide that, as there will be large numbers of meters ordered as a result of the operations of this Bill, the period should be lengthened to, at least, two years.  The time mentioned in the Bill is twelve months.  Another point on which I want information is as to the qualifications of the inspector, the conditions he will have to fulfil, such as his training, and the reading of meters.  In my opinion he should possess a somewhat mechanical or professional knowledge of meters.  I suppose we are all agreed that it is very necessary to save the public, the consumers of gas, from, I will not say fraud, but certainly defective meters, and that the system of inspection as well as the qualifications of the inspector should be such as would provide the best possible safeguards under this Bill.  I would also like to be reassured on this point, namely, that the Minister would see that Irish-made meters would get a preference in the new corporation and urban district council houses when gas companies get permission to instal meters there.  As I have already indicated, I do not want it to appear that I am opposing the Bill, which in my view contains some useful provisions, but I am making suggestions in the hope that the Minister will make some provision by inserting a clause which will ensure that these meters will be made in the Saorstát in order to provide for the requirements of its citizens.</P>

      <P>I think it is not likely that there will be opposition to the Bill at this stage.  As the Minister has said, it is merely bringing existing legislation up to date, and we will be able to discuss the different sections in detail on the Committee Stage when, perhaps, it <Col N="821" /> will be thought advisable to insert some of the amendments to which Deputy Anthony has referred.  There is one matter, however, which can be mentioned as affecting the principle of the Bill and which would not arise directly on the Committee Stage, namely, the matter of meters in use in the country.  I think it would not be too much to ask that any of the meters which will bear the new stamp enacted in this measure should be produced in factories in this country.  There are, I think, two plants in Dublin, each capable of turning out from 300 to 400 meters a week.  Deputy Anthony was correct in the information he has concerning one factory.  It is a branch of an English concern.  In August last there were forty tinsmiths employed in making gas meters.  The firm received an order for 5,000 meters but they imported them from their English headquarters, with the result that there was no work for the forty tinsmiths, who were dismissed, and now there are only six men employed.  We are competent in this country to turn out all the gas meters that we require.  I believe that the operations of this measure will give slight encouragement to the manufacture of gas meters here, but I think it is better to have a specific provision that meters stamped under this Act and passed for use here should be produced here, and I would like if the Minister would consider an amendment to the Bill to that effect.</P>

      <P>I had an opportunity of listening only to the tail end of Deputy Anthony's speech.  I know something about the operations of gas concerns in Dublin and I can say that it is their wish to provide as much work as possible here and to obtain local meters if they are economically made. I assume that we will have an opportunity later of discussing the Bill clause by clause, and at this stage I will simply indicate that there is an objection to Clause 5, which deals with the stamping of meters.</P>

      <P>We would all be anxious to see that meters used in Ireland are made here.  I would like to get a guarantee that this Bill which gives the Minister powers to inspect meters will not be allowed simply to rest there.  In provincial towns we believe that we have suffered by the lack of inspection, not alone through the measurement of the gas consumed but also through the quality of the gas provided. There is no gas-testing station in provincial towns as there is in Dublin where the quality of the gas as well as the meters can be tested.  I believe that this Bill will get support all over the country and I hope that the powers given to the Minister will be used and that there will be some system of periodical inspection, not only of the meters but of the gas to see that the consumers are getting what they are paying for.  In Dublin you are all right, but in provincial towns there is a feeling&mdash;it was most pronounced during the war&mdash;that there is a very bad quality of gas provided.  Now that we are in normal times I hope, as I have said, that the powers given to the Minister will be used.  I have pointed out that, in my opinion, this Bill does not deal with the question of gas meters being made here.  We are all agreed that they should be, but the Bill is concerned only with seeing that consumers get proper measure and are adequately safeguarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like Deputy Lemass, Deputy Anthony and other speakers, welcome this Bill, but I am sorry that the Minister has not, apparently, examined the question more fully.  A great many things remain to be done so far as gas undertakings in this country are concerned.  It is certainly very desirable that inspectors should be appointed by various local authorities, by the Minister, or whoever is going to appoint them, to see that meters installed in people's houses are functioning properly.  Another question of some importance to the country at present <Col N="823" /> is that of the supply of gas through slot meters.  It is only the very poor who have slot meters installed, and we find that all over the State a person who gets gas through the medium of a slot meter has to pay anything from sevenpence to a shilling &mdash;it varies in different parts of the country&mdash;per thousand cubic feet more than is charged to a person with an ordinary meter.  I think the Minister ought to pay attention to that aspect of the situation.  I would ask him to try to get statistics from various parts of the country, and to amend this Bill to enable him to deal with the conditions in so far as that aspect of the situation is concerned.  Like Deputy de Loughrey, I am of opinion that something should be done to test the quality of the gas supplied all over the country.  In a great many gas works to-day, the gas is not purified.  The gas is being sent out through pipes to the houses, and it is neither cleaned nor purified.  That is a very undesirable state of affairs.  Everybody knows that where there are not proper purifiers in gas works, a very bad quality of gas is supplied, and it is injurious to people's health.  In every gas undertaking in which there are no &ldquo;scrubbers&rdquo; a very dirty kind of gas is sent out through the pipes.  It is most injurious to health, and it corrodes the pipes in people's houses, which is a great danger to everybody on the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Anthony referred to the difference between a wet and a dry meter. I would say that the Minister ought to prohibit the use of wet meters altogether, because I have no hesitation in saying that a wet meter is a very dangerous thing in a house.  I hope that before very long dry meters only will be used in every house in the country.  Anybody who has any great knowledge of gas knows how dangerous a wet meter is in a house if it is not attended to properly, and consumers of gas do not know how to treat wet meters properly.  I hope that they will disappear altogether in the very near future.  I would like the Minister to examine the question of the different charges to the poorer consumers of slot meters as distinct from <Col N="824" /> people who have the ordinary quarterly meter.  I hope that those matters will be examined from the point of view I have expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdmondCarey" hpid="Mr. CAREY Mr. CAREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CAREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the complaints made by various Deputies in this matter are universal all over Ireland. Those who have been brought into contact with gas companies, more or less privately-owned, have a number of grievances, but of course the time will come later when we can express them.  I believe that there should be proper testing stations of some description in every urban district so as to ensure that a proper quality of gas is supplied.  I believe that the regulation of the price of gas is necessary and that the price should go hand-in-hand with the price of coal.  If you allow a certain amount for expenditure in the production of gas and a fair profit to the companies, I believe it would meet the situation in that respect.  In regard to meters, I find that, in the urban districts especially, gas companies, for the last fifteen or sixteen years during which I have been connected with public life, have never looked after the meters supplying gas to the urban councils.  I think it is not a bit too soon to bring a Bill of this character into force, not alone to regulate prices, but to see that a proper quality of gas is supplied.  Those who will be charged with administering the provisions of the Bill will, I am sure, be men of ability and will know their business.  It is necessary, where gas companies are privately owned, that there should be inspection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the points that were made on this Bill could be very definitely answered by what Deputy de Loughrey said.  This is a Bill &ldquo;to make further and better provision in relation to the stamping of gas meters, to enable the Sale of Gas Act, 1859, to be brought into force in the county boroughs in which the said Act is not now in force, and to amend the Alliance and Dublin Gas Act, 1874, and the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.&rdquo;  It is purely, as I said before, a Bill to make provision with regard to the stamping of meters and the <Col N="825" /> sale of gas.  Anything else is a trade matter.  If it were proposed to bring in certain regulations in regard to enforcing the use in this country of meters, made in this country, it would not be done in this Bill.  It would not form part of the Bill.  It would be entirely a different matter.  I doubt even if the draftsman could be got to draft a Bill which would contain this type of regulation&mdash;a regulation enforcing the use of meters made in this country. The two things are entirely apart and the considerations that would operate to make a regulation enforcing the use of meters made in Saorstát Eireann are entirely different from the considerations that would operate in regard to the stamping of meters and in regard to the sale of gas in a particular town.  In regard to Deputy Anthony's point, there is a definition of gas somewhere. I would not like to say in what particular Act it is defined, but I can get the Deputy reassured on that point before we meet again.  The extension of time to which I refer is in fact given in Section 5, sub-section (2).  On that point representations have been made to me, the full effect of which I have had not time to consider.  Any amendment with regard to the enlargement of that time-period will be brought forward in due course if, for instance, I consider it is necessary, from my point of view, that it should be done.  It is open to Deputies to bring forward a similar amendment to any other clause for the enlargement of the time-period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy touched on an important point with regard to the re-verification of meters and, now that it is raised, it is a matter to which more consideration can be given.  It was previously under consideration and, in fact, it appeared in an earlier draft of this Bill but was taken out because the whole construction of the measure was thrown into another form which, it was thought, rendered unnecessary any provision with regard to re-verification.  But it may seem essential and it would be a better security to the public if there were some provision with regard to re-verification after a certain period.  One finds that ordinarily companies themselves will insist on re-verification after a certain period, but it might be as well <Col N="826" /> to insist on re-verification at definite periods.  The average period would be about seven or eight years and one could insist on a maximum of that sort being legally enforced.</P>
    <P>With regard to what two Deputies have touched upon, the question of wet and dry meters, I had a correspondent who wrote at great length on the question of wet meters.  I had enquiries made and I find the situation is very nearly approaching what Deputy Corish would like to see established.  That is to say, the wet meter is definitely going out of use.  Out of 20,400 meters tested last year only 70 were wet meters.  The wet meter is almost entirely disappearing. It is disappearing for a different reason from that put forward by Deputy Anthony.  Deputy Anthony thought that the wet meter if left alone for a certain period told against the seller.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer.  I said the wet meter operated against the consumer when it went out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not when it went out of order, but it could be so manipulated by raising the level in a particular way that it definitely told against the consumer.  If it was not attended to by the company it went in favour of the consumer, so that the suspicion is rather the other way to that in which the Deputy put it.  However, it is a small matter because the wet meter is going out of use.  There is not much use in bothering about that and, at any rate, for the future there will be inspection.  If we attend to the question of re-verification then there will be a much better inspection than ever before.  A Deputy then asked about inspectors.  There is a provision under the 1920 Act setting out that the Board of Trade shall provide for the holding of examinations for the purpose of ascertaining whether applicants for the post of inspector possess sufficient practical knowledge for the proper performance of the duties, and for the granting of certificates to people who satisfactorily passed the examination. The Board of Trade is now substituted by the Department of Industry and Commerce and there is provision for examining the qualifications of those who wish to be tested for the post of <Col N="827" /> inspector.  That administrative duty being imposed on the Department, attention can always be called to any failure by the ordinary method of question and answer in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Corish raised the point with regard to slot meter consumers.  On that point there is no legislation directly dealing with the matter, but under the Gas Charges Order there is power to regulate the charges under the slot system.  In all cases but one that matter has been attended to and has been regulated On the question of the quality of gas and the price of gas, I would like to have it recognised what the full force of this Bill is.  Let us take Section 3. There we find certain expressions occurring in an earlier Act, and it is set out that Section 18 of the Act of 1920 is amended by the deletion of the words &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;gas undertakers&rsquo; or &lsquo;undertakers&rsquo; means any local authority, company, body or person authorised to supply gas by any Act of Parliament or any order having the force of an Act of Parliament&rdquo; now contained therein and the insertion in lieu of the words so deleted of the words &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;gas undertakers&rsquo; or &lsquo;undertakers&rsquo; means any local authority, company, body or person engaged in the business of supplying gas.&rdquo;  The real scope of the Bill is shown by the extension indicated in that phrase, and it is set out that hereafter any body, company, local authority or person supplying gas is going to be brought under the terms of the old Act, and it will be necessary for the future to have it absolutely and definitely laid down that any meter sold for the purpose of supplying gas to consumers will have to be verified, tested and stamped.</P>

      <P>The old Act said that an undertaker, a gas undertaker or any undertaker, means anybody authorised to supply gas.  Now, instead of people authorised, it substitutes the local authority, company, or body of persons engaged in the business of supplying gas.  That is very definitely limited, and that will bring about a widening of the whole scope of the thing by that phrase.  It brings everybody supplying gas in future under control.  There is definite regulation as regards the verification and stamping. Deputies anxious as to the quality of the gas supplied, and who would like to see some improvement, would, if they read Sections 1 and 2 of the 1920 Act, which talks of the composition and pressure of the gas supplied and what is laid down there with regard to the composition of gas, feel more satisfied.  Also for the future there will be compulsion with regard to the testing of meters, and there is <Col N="829" /> going to be a provision facilitating people who apply to have their charges regulated on a particular basis.</P>
      <P>As regards the composition of gas, if Deputies will refer to Section 9 and collate it with Section 3, they will find their objections answered.  The two sections will enable a certain amount to be done with regard to the regulation of prices.  It is not taken over completely, and one cannot say that prices are to be definitely regulated by any definite Department, but a certain amount is done by the reaction of Section 3 on Section 9.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first section of this Bill is purely a definition section.  The second section is one of the most important sections in the Bill. The principal Act referred to in the second section is the Forestry Act of 1919.  Under that Act there were provided compulsory powers for the acquisition of land for the purposes of afforestation but the machinery for the exercise of these compulsory powers it appears was somewhat complicated and moreover there was no provision in the Act of 1919 to deal with two cases which time has shown it is essential to deal with.  One of these, strange to say, is where there is no owner for the land.  Deputies must remember that forestry land is often mountainous land and land of little agricultural value, and there have been cases, notably the Fort Mountain in Wexford, where it is <Col N="830" /> almost quite impossible to decide who the owner of the land is, and some provision had to be inserted to meet some cases like that.  Also some powers had to be taken to deal with grazing rights, turbary rights and easements. Forestry lands are usually in mountainous districts.  The system in this country with regard to such lands is that they are held in common sometimes or in fee with commonage rights and turbary or with rights to grazing by the people in the district.  Some of these original rights have lapsed and new rights have been created, and at this stage, with regard to very large areas of mountainous land in this country, it is quite impossible to decide accurately, or in a reasonable time, who is the owner of the rights of commonage and grazing.  It is essential to get rid, once and for all, of these two difficulties if the Forestry Branch is to be put in a position to acquire sufficient land within a reasonable time for the purposes of afforestation.  It is to meet these cases that Section 2 has been inserted in the Bill.  It provides that an application shall be made to and heard and determined by the Irish Land Commission exclusive of the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
      <P>Under the Forestry Act of 1919 application was to be made to the Development Commissioners, but the Development Commissioners are no longer in existence.  Application has now to be made to the Land Commission. It is to be made first to the Commissioners, with an appeal to the Judicial Commissioner and with no appeal from him.  The procedure is exactly the same as in the acquisition of lands by the Land Commission for the purposes of the relief of congestion.  The powers taken here to acquire land for forestry purposes are practically identical with the powers to acquire land for the relief of congestion.  This section sets out in sub-section (4):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;No such application shall be refused unless the Irish Land Commission, exclusive of the Judicial Commissioner or, on appeal, the Judicial Commissioner is of opinion that the land to which the application relates comes within the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 7 of the Principal <Col N="831" /> Act or it is required for the purpose of relieving congestion under the Land Purchase Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the Forestry Branch or, rather, the Department of Agriculture, for the Forestry Branch is a branch of the Department of Agriculture, may acquire lands compulsorily for afforestation purposes unless the land is a home farm, demesne, town park, or one of the various other classes of land of little importance set out in that Act and that form exceptions to the law which allows the Land Commission to acquire land for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (5) deals with the point which I just mentioned&mdash;that is the cases where the owner of the land cannot be definitely ascertained.  Section 1 (5) sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Irish Land Commission (exclusive of the Judicial Commissioner) or the Judicial Commissioner as the case may be, is satisfied that after diligent inquiry the owner of the land to which an application or appeal relates cannot be found or cannot be ascertained such application or appeal may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the said Section 7, be heard and determined in the absence of such owner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That may seem an extraordinary provision, but the fact is that there are rather big forestry areas which we have been anxious to obtain, and of which it has become extremely difficult to decide the ownership.  This is sometimes land that is of very little value for agricultural purposes, mountain land left for a long time derelict, grazed in common, and with certain turbary rights and the rights of grazing in favour of certain people in the neighbourhood.  Under this provision the Land Commission may proceed to acquire land, and the rights of anybody will be preserved as against the purchase money which will be lodged in court.</P>
    <P>Further on there is also provision to deal with the second point, namely, the extinguishment of easements, grazing rights and turbary rights.  &ldquo;An <Col N="832" /> order made on such application... shall operate to distinguish as from the date of such order all grazing, turbary and other rights in the land to which such order relates subject to the payment by the Minister to the owner of such rights or compensation which shall in default of agreement be fixed under the Act of 1919.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, that these rights may be extinguished subject to compensation being paid under the Act of 1919, which is the appropriate Act for deciding the compensation in such cases. That is a fairly drastic provision.  It is not as drastic as the provision which we had in the Land Acts.  It is not quite as drastic as these provisions, which enable the Land Commission to acquire land compulsorily for the relief of congestion.  At the same time it is a fairly drastic provision, but it is essential if a forestry programme, and a necessary programme which, I think, there is very little dispute about, is to be carried out.  At any rate it is absolutely essential to provide some machinery by which any definite right can be extinguished subject to compensation. The procedure, of course, will be regulated.  The procedure for making applications by the owners or would-be owners of such rights will be laid down by the Land Commission under the powers given them under sub-section 7 in the same way as they laid down the procedure for owners of easements or rights of any kind over land which is being acquired by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>The fact that the land is to be acquired is to be advertised locally in the papers.  Due notice will be given in the official gazette and in the daily and weekly local papers to the effect that anybody who claims to have rights over these lands may bring forward his claims and prove them before the Land Commission or the Judicial Commissioner within a certain time and make arrangements about fees and the distribution and lodgment of the purchase money in court, in the event of there being any difficulty in deciding who is entitled to the money or to any part of it.</P>
    <P>The third section is quite simple, and <Col N="833" /> speaks for itself.  It is necessary in the event of lands which are subject to a Land Commission annuity being acquired to apportion the annuities over various parts of the lands.  The fourth section is also a drastic section. It sets out that no tree or trees may be cut down without a licence except a tree that is uprooted for the purpose of transplanting; a tree growing or standing in a county borough or urban county district&mdash;that is a city or town &mdash;a tree growing or standing within 100 feet of any building occupied as a dwelling-house, or used for housing domestic animals; if a tree shows signs of falling over a house it may be absolutely essential to cut it without waiting two, three or four days to get a licence; or unless such tree is cut down under Section 34 of the Local Government Act, 1925, which gives powers to cut trees on the roadside, or Section 98 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, of 1927&mdash;for the erection of poles and standards for the Shannon scheme &mdash;unless &ldquo;such tree is not necessary for the ornament or protection of the holding upon which it stands, and is cut down with the intention of using the timber thereof for the construction or repair of buildings, fences or other structures on the said holding.&rdquo;  In this connection I would draw attention to the fact that Section 32 of the Irish Land Act of 1909 is repealed in the Schedule and Section 3, sub-section (3) of the Land Act of 1927.  These two sections are the ones which deal with trees growing on land subject to a land purchase annuity, and the Act of 1927 sets out that no such tree that has value as ornamental timber or as a shelter bed can be cut down without the consent of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>This goes a step further in two directions. If you like, it goes two steps. First of all, it applies this prohibition to all land, whether subject to land purchase annuities or fee-simple lands not subject to land purchase annuities. So far as the exception mentioned in sub-section (F) is concerned, it is also dealt with in the Act of 1927, which provides that even trees which are not ornamental or required for shelter may not be cut down unless they are required for use on the holding for repairs. The position is, if this section <Col N="834" /> be passed, that no tree or trees on any land, fee-simple land free from all charges, or lands subject to a land purchase annuity, or tenanted land, may be cut down with a few unimportant exceptions, except on licence from the Minister for Agriculture.  The Bill also transfers the power of giving licences from the Land Commission, as set out in the Act of 1927, and previously in the Act of 1909, to the Department of Agriculture.  That is a very drastic section.  There is no doubt about that, but the question is: Is it necessary, and is there any better way of dealing with the situation?  It is really meant to prevent the country being denuded of its woods.  The problem in our minds when we considered the section was not the case of a farmer cutting one tree on his land. What we really want to look after is the case of woods of 15, 20, 100 or 200 acres being cut down, and I do not see any way of dealing with that situation except by such a section as this.  If you try to draw a distinction between two, three or four trees and a wood you are up against almost impossible difficulties in drafting, as to when a number of trees become a wood, when they cease to be a wood and so on.  I see no way of giving the Department of Agriculture sufficient powers to stop the wholesale cutting down of woods throughout the country except by giving the powers to the Minister&mdash;really to the Department of Agriculture&mdash;to prohibit the felling of any trees, with these few trivial exceptions, except under licence.</P>
    <P>The next section deals with the method of giving licences:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, grant to any person a licence in the prescribed form to cut down or uproot any trees specified in such licence.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every application for a licence under this section shall be in the prescribed form and shall contain the prescribed particulars.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A licence granted under this section shall operate to relieve in respect of every tree mentioned therein the licensee and any person authorised by him from any prohibition against cutting down or uprooting and so on.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A licence granted under this sec- <Col N="835" /> tion may, if the Minister so thinks fit, contain a condition that the licensee shall, within a specified time after cutting down or uprooting a tree under the licence, plant one or more trees of a specified kind on the holding....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I imagine that, even in the minds of people who own woods and forests, there is not very much hesitation about giving such a power to the Department of Agriculture, but that what would really occur to people on these two sections is: How are these powers going to be administered?  First of all, remember that Section 5 says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, grant to any person a licence in the prescribed form to cut down or uproot any tree specified in such licence.</P>
    <P>I can imagine a man who has three or four different forests, who has been planting trees and cutting them as they are mature, selling them for commercial purposes.  He is, of course, carrying out an absolutely legitimate transaction, but the sort of man who plants trees on his own land, cuts them down when mature, and re-plants, the first question he asks is: &ldquo;How am I to get a licence to cut these trees?  Have I to count all the trees in the wood, and send an application to the Department of Agriculture asking them for a special licence for each tree?  When I get the licence, how long will it last, and so on?&rdquo; I am advised legally that as the section stands it would cover a licence of this sort.  Such an owner would apply to the Department of Agriculture for a licence to cut trees growing on an area marked in red on the map accompanying, and it would be open to the Department to send back the licence in that form.  Similarly it would be open to the Department, if they thought it right so to do, to make a condition that trees shall again be planted on such area marked red on such map.</P>

      <P>No.  I am merely quoting one case that I say would be typical of many cases which would <Col N="836" /> occur to the mind of many people on reading this.  I am suggesting the way the Bill should be administered in such cases, and I am stating that as a matter of fact there is legal power within the terms of this section to adopt the procedure I suggest.  To a man who owns woods, who cuts them regularly, and who has a perfect right to cut them, when he wants a licence the procedure is simple.  He applies for the licence.  He need not count the trees. He need not say how many trees he will cut in one or two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot say for certain.  It is not necessary to specify each tree.  The procedure is as simple as this: apply for a licence to cut the trees on the area marked red on the map.  You can adopt any other means you like, but I suggest that if that very simple procedure is employed the legitimate grievances of people who are cutting trees in that way are fully met by this section.  Another question would arise on that section, and it is this: the owner of a wood has made a contract, say, last year, with a timber merchant or a sawmill owner, selling him one hundred acres of woods, with the right to take away this wood for four years and to pay him each year. He has taken away a quarter of the wood.  This timber merchant, in his turn, of course, has made certain contracts; he has arranged to supply that timber to somebody else, and this other person has arranged to make use of that timber himself.  Everybody is bound by contract.  Say that this has been done last year.  It could be pointed out under that section that it is possible that on the application of the owner of the land&mdash;the former owner of the woods&mdash;for a licence to continue to sell the three-quarters of the timber which is still standing, a licence could be refused and consequently the contract which the owner had made last year would fall through, and the contract which the timber merchant had made for the next two or three years in respect of this timber would fall through, and there would. therefore, be very serious economic and <Col N="837" /> trade reactions to such a state of affairs.  That is so.  It may very well be that the contract would have been made last year, that half the timber would have been cut, and the Department of Agriculture could refuse under that section to give a licence to cut the balance.  What is the remedy?  The obvious suggestion, of course, would be to insert a provision that a licence shall not be required to cut timber which has been the subject of a contract made before the passing of this Bill.  I considered that at great length, but I saw very obvious objections to it.  Everybody admits that land purchase is going on.  There are a number of people selling demesnes and timber lands, and they are anxious to get rid of them quickly.  It is the fashion at the moment to cut timber. It is not as bad as it was in 1920, 1921 or 1922, but still there is an undue felling of timber going on, and there is a spirit which leads people to cash in on an asset of that sort as quickly as possible.  If such a section as that were inserted I think it is quite certain that a number of contracts would be made within the next three months, and that it would be almost impossible to administer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 is another strong section, but it deals with a real problem.  You have to consider that a very big percentage of forestry land in this country is in mountainous areas, areas in which gorse, heather, bracken, and plants of that sort prevail, and a tremendous amount of damage is done by mountain fires, by people who quite wantonly set fire to a mountain without taking the slightest care to see that it does not spread into young trees or young plantations. As a matter of fact, considerable damage is done regularly, not only to forests of the Department of Agriculture but to forests of private owners, by people who carelessly&mdash;sometimes with good reason, in order to get rid of furze, and so on, sometimes quite wantonly, but in all cases quite carelessly&mdash; burn gorse, furze and heather within half a mile, one hundred yards or even ten yards of plantations.  The fire spreads in and it does a tremendous amount of destruction to the trees.  This section sets out that it &ldquo;shall not be lawful for any person to burn any <Col N="838" /> shrubs growing within one mile of a wood which is not the property of such person unless such person shall... have given notice in writing of his intention to burn such shrubs to the owner of such wood.&rdquo;  That leaves it open for the owner of the wood to object.  That is sub-section (3).  It would look, if you read the section down to that, that the owner could object and that he would have the last word&mdash;that he was judge and jury.  That is not so, because sub-section (4) enables the person who wants to burn the shrubs to go ahead and do it, but he will do it at his own risk, and ensures that if he does it he has got to take precautions to see that the fire will not spread into the wood.  It reads:</P>
    <P>If any person burns any shrub either in contravention of this section or after serving the notice required by this section and receiving a counter-notice under this section all injury occasioned by such burning to any wood in respect of which a notice ought to have been or was served under this section shall be deemed to have been caused by the negligent act of such person and damages to the extent of such injury shall be recoverable accordingly from such person by the owner of such wood.</P>
    <P>There is a problem there.  This thing is occurring.  It will occur very much more if the Department of Agriculture goes ahead with its forestry programme and plants large areas on mountain sides.  A mountain fire spreads very rapidly in the summer time.  Gorse and heather when dry burn very rapidly. Even with the present area and even with the limited opportunities for doing harm, it has resulted in a considerable amount of harm to the young plantations of the Department of Agriculture and to the young plantations of private property owners who were enterprising enough to plant big areas.  This is being done considerably.  It will be a very much bigger problem as the area under woods increases.  If the problem is to be dealt with, I know of no better way than this.  It is difficult to deal with. A man has a perfect right to burn his furze or to burn his gorse, that is to say, notwithstanding that gorse and furze are often burned quite wantonly <Col N="839" /> by young fellows just to see a blaze. Apart from that, a man has a perfect right to burn furze and gorse and to get rid of it in that way, but we must put some sort of duty on him to see that he will take the necessary steps, when he does so, which are quite simple, to prevent a fire spreading into a plantation belonging to his neighbour or the State, and I cannot see any better way of doing that than what I have suggested.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is quite simple.  It attempts to force people to fence woods they own.  It looks an extraordinary provision, but all I will say about it is this: the fact of the matter is that tremendous harm has been done by careless owners who allow all sorts of animals to wander indiscriminately through woods which are being cut away.  I am informed by people who are in a position to know that a good deal of natural forest would be reestablished, that a considerable amount of timber would grow quite naturally, but for the fact that while the wood is being cut away, and after it has been cut away, no one takes the slightest trouble to get it fenced or to keep gates closed, with the result that all sorts of stock stray into it and kill the seedlings.</P>
    <P>Section 8, sub-section (1), reads:</P>
    <P>Every proprietor of any sawmill or factory in which timber grown in Saorstát Eireann is sawn or converted from the round or rough state shall furnish in the prescribed form to the Minister, within twenty-eight days after being required by the Minister so to do. such information as the Minister may require in relation to the source of supply, volume, and variety of such timber so sawn or converted in such sawmill or factory.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is any objection amongst sawmill owners to that provision.  It is for two purposes, for statistical purposes and also to get some idea of the timber resources of the country, and, more important, to enable us to operate Section 4, to keep a check on the section which prohibits the felling of trees without a licence. The other sections are unimportant.  I explained the repeal of Section 32 of the Land Act of 1909 and of Section 3 <Col N="840" /> of the Land Act, 1927.  In addition to that, Section 3 of the Forestry Act, 1919, is also repealed in part so as to take away certain limitations which existed in that Act in making loans or grants or in giving financial assistance to persons, being corporations or municipal authorities or individuals, for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>That is the Bill as it stands.  People ask where is the forestry programme in the Bill.  That is due to a misunderstanding.  This Bill is simply to provide the machinery to enable the Forestry Department to carry out any programme which the Dáil agrees to.  If the Forestry Department gets the powers contained in the Bill the programme of forestry need only be limited by one consideration&mdash;the amount of money that the Dáil will vote every year for the purpose.  Discussing a forestry programme with regard to this Bill is, to my mind, irrelevant.  The proper place to discuss that is on the Estimate for that programme for the year.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is a drastic Bill, but the need is rather urgent.  The history of forestry in this country is rather peculiar.  It is generally stated that there was a considerable area under forest, say, in the time of Elizabeth, not to speak of very much earlier days.  I do not know whether that is so or not.  I believe the best information on the point is that a considerable amount of it was what is known as scrub, but undoubtedly there was a very much larger area than there is now.  For one reason or another that timber was all cut away, and you had a revival in or about the middle of the eighteenth century.  Timber was grown very largerly from 1700 to 1800.  The landlords, for instance, had settled down on their land and they had a certain amount of security of tenure during that period, so that there was a very considerable increase in the area under forestry.  From 1880 on, the forestry operations consisted of cutting the wood grown in the previous 100 years.  That is the history of Irish forestry in a nutshell.  The woods, so far as we have any authentic information&mdash;we need not go back to the time of Elizabeth or the Middle Ages&mdash;<Col N="841" /> were planted from the middle of the eighteenth century down to the middle of the nineteenth century.  The forestry operations since then consisted, in a very large part, in cutting away these woods.  There are only 220,000 acres of woods in the country, and if we are to supply the amount of timber used in the country which could be supplied from home sources we would want at least 500,000 acres. The percentage of timber in the country is very small compared with other countries.  The percentage is something like 1.4, whereas in Denmark it would be about 9 per cent. of the land, and in Holland, 5 or 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Unless the State takes a very active part in afforestation work nobody will do it.  It is an enterprise which cannot be carried out except by a man who has plenty of capital and who is in a position to wait for a long time for his return.  There are very few such people here.  As a result of the operations of the Land Acts most of the land is held now by small farmers.  Some landlords in this country did very well in regard to afforestation, but the number of such people is getting less and less.  The small farmer will not do any afforestation, could not do it as he does not own big areas of land, has not the capital, and cannot afford to wait for his return.  Therefore, if the problem is to be solved, if we are to deal with this extraordinary state of affairs under which we have such a very small percentage of our land in woods, then the State must to a very great extent do the work itself.</P>
    <P>So far as the State is concerned the first real attempt to do anything for forestry was in the year 1908 and the first provision made for forestry work was after the report of a Departmental Committee on forestry which sat, I think, in 1908.  As a result of the committee's report, £6,000 per year were voted for the purchase of woods, which had come or were coming into the hands of the Land Commission as a result of the 1903 Act.  Between 1908 and 1916 out of this money 5,774 acres were purchased, of which about one thousand were in Northern Ireland. These were, I think, all actual woods. <Col N="842" /> In 1910 the British Treasury sanctioned a loan from the Development Grant for the purpose of buying a certain area of land, and out of that loan 8,656 acres were acquired between 1911 and 1914. So that up to 1914, with the exception of some small areas, I think, in Wexford and Wicklow, the State's part in forestry was to purchase 5,774 acres of woods and 8,656 acres of land for planting.</P>
    <P>That work practically stopped during the European War and in 1920 it began again.  In that year forestry work was transferred to the Forestry Commission of the United Kingdom.  During 1920 and 1921 there were 2,830 acres of additional land purchased and about 3,648 acres leased on a long lease of 150 years. The leased land happens to be in Northern Ireland.  At that time the programme of the Commission was to acquire and plant about 2,000 acres per annum.  That is the recent history. There is only recent history in this matter, because, as I said, forestry operations began in any real way in 1908.  There were about 5,000 acres of land purchased out of the annual grant provided by the British Treasury, of which four thousand odd were in the Saorstát.  There were 8,656 acres purchased between 1910 and 1916, as a result of the grant out of the Development Fund, and about 2,800 purchased in 1920 and 1921.</P>
    <P>The present position is as follows:&mdash; The area acquired by direct purchase or through the Land Commission is 25,369 acres.  That was acquired by direct purchase and the fee simple of it bought.  The area leased is 7,570 acres, and an area has been transferred from the Department of Defence of 6,817 acres, making a total of 39,756 acres.  Of that area there has been either planted or replanted up to the 1st April, 1928, 16,608 acres.  The present annual planting programme is from 3,000 to 4,000 acres, and the plantable land which has been acquired but not yet planted or replanted is 10,120 acres. I said that we had acquired about 40,000 acres; 16,000 is planted or replanted, but of the lands which are acquired there are 10,000 which may yet be planted.  That is 26,000 acres, and the difference between 26,000 and 40,000 is <Col N="843" /> land which is either unplantable or in forests.</P>
    <P>Last year the Vote for forestry was £156,505.  3,000 acres were purchased, 1,400 were leased, and 3,200 planted. So that, in fact, there has been a rather rapid increase in forestry work since 1920.  That, however, is not sufficient. It is necessary not only to continue that programme and to expand it, but it is absolutely essential to protect the 220,000 acres of woods that we have. If we cannot expect very much actual planting from individuals, the least we must expect, and in fact the least we must insist upon, is that the existing woods be treated somewhat differently from the way in which they are being treated.  It is not the intention to make a radical change or to interfere unduly with the right of the owner of woods to cash his timber when ripe.  There is going to be no drastic change of that sort.  We are not going simply to issue a ukase to the effect that nobody is to cut any wood&mdash;whether ripe or not&mdash; nothing of the kind.  We could not do that, because it would interfere with trade, it would be unfair to the owners, and generally would be undesirable. But everybody can visualise for himself cases where there is the most wanton cutting of woods, and the policy of the Department of Agriculture will be to interfere in such cases, either to prevent such wanton cutting of woods, which have a special value, or. if they are allowed to be cut, to make some conditions about planting, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to ask for a little information on some points that I do not quite understand and which it may be necessary to amend.  I believe a Bill like this is necessary.  I agree with the principle; we should restrict the cutting of trees as much as possible. There are a few points which I think the Minister did not make clear, and I would like if he could give us some more light upon them.  For instance, paragraph F of clause 4 says:&mdash;&ldquo;Such tree is not necessary for the ornament or protection of the holding.&rdquo;  Who is to decide in that case?  There might be a dispute whether the farmer in cutting down trees cut down ones not <Col N="844" /> necessary for the ornament or protection of the holding, but the Minister for Agriculture might not hold that view.  Also timber will be allowed for the repair of fences and buildings, but will timber be allowed for fuel or a certain class of timber that would not be of great value for anything else? What is the meaning of the last couple of lines in Section 5 (3): &ldquo;But shall not operate to give any other relief or to confer any further or other authority in respect of any such tree&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-section (5), it appears to me that one or two trees might alter the value, but I think the Minister made it clear that he was speaking of a wood rather than of special trees.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (1) says: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of the owner of any wood to take such steps as may be necessary by fencing or otherwise,&rdquo; and so on.  It seems to me that as that section stands at present, especially if it were applied drastically, it may be almost impossible for a man to protect any wood against certain animals belonging to another man.  How is he to protect it?  There are certain stray animals that no fences would keep out.  How is a man to protect himself against the entry of such animals?</P>
      <P>I might also mention that it was only to-day I got a notification from a certain organisation of timber merchants and they seemed to make a good case for themselves.  I would like to have an opportunity of going into that, and I would ask the Minister to give time, before taking the Committee Stage, for going into these matters, and particularly into this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. GEORGE WOLFE Mr. GEORGE WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GEORGE WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is general agreement in the country as to the need for a Bill dealing with afforestation.  It is a good thing that something is being done.  I think we are all agreed that it is necessary to deal with the matter.  Anybody travelling through the country, whether by bus or motor, must be conscious of the fact that throughout a great area of the country there has been a wholesale cutting down of timber to the great detriment of the appearance of the <Col N="845" /> country.  I observed myself, having made a motor tour some years ago right round Ireland, that there were also many cases where there was a vast amount of timber far past its maturity and which should be cut down, and that case is almost as bad as the other.  The reason this over-mature timber is not cut down is that the expense of it is too great, the damage in having it taken down to the land and removing it, the very small amount frequently got for it does not compensate the owner for the trouble and bother of cutting it down and the bad appearance it gives to the place when this heavy timber is removed.  But it is a necessity, if the country is to be kept timbered in the future, that the over-mature timber should be cut away. It is just as important that that should be done as that the place that has been cleared of timber should be re-planted.</P>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned that in the middle of the eighteenth century planting began and was continued into the middle of the nineteenth century. I have in my possession a rather interesting book dealing with the afforestation of Ireland during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  It would appear that when the turnip was introduced into this country from Holland the return it put into the pockets of the owners of the land, and their being able to keep their stock fed during the winter, brought them in a very considerable amount of money, and with this money they set about beautifying their demesnes by putting down timber. That was the beginning of it.  This book I have gives the acreage and the names of a number of people who during that hundred years or so went in for planting timber, of which a great deal remains in certain places still, but with the coming into force of the Land Purchase Acts in 1885 a different idea seemed to possess the minds of the occupiers and the owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear that there is a great deal of timber being cut down without, in many cases, much judgement being shown in that regard.  In many cases I suppose that could not be avoided, but the effect of it has been very detrimental, as regards the appearance of the country, in many places.  The <Col N="846" /> County Kildare, of which I have the honour to be one of the representatives here, has always been foremost in this matter of timber-growing.  I think it is only right to say that the amount of tree-planting done through the instrumentality of the Kildare County Council was pushed forward to a great extent by the knowledge and energy displayed by the first chairman of the Kildare County Council, Mr. Stephen Brown, who is well known throughout Ireland as one of the leading men in matters relating to arboriculture and everything connected with agriculture. The good work was helped on to a great extent by the late Lord Frederick Fitzgerald. Through his influence and effort large tracts of woods belonging to the late Duke of Leinster were given over to the Kildare County Council without any charge whatever.  In connection with these woods, two nurseries were established, which supplied young trees for planting the additional woods acquired by the County Council from other people.  In very few cases had the Council to buy any land at all for planting.  In spite of all that, the quantity of timber in the country is being greatly reduced.  I saw it stated in a newspaper that, with the cutting going on at present, twenty years would see the end of all the timber in the country.</P>
    <P>This question is not altogether a national one.  It is international, because within a hundred years or so, a period that is nothing in the life of the world, the quantity of timber in the world will be nearly exhausted.  That is due to a very large extent to the enormous fires which have destroyed millions of acres in the timber-growing countries of the world, especially in Canada.  I have seen one of these enormous fires burning away for months.  It practically burned itself out, having destroyed untold numbers of trees. That, as well as earthquakes, has lessened the number of trees in the world available for use.  The number has been lessened to an enormous extent, while planting has not kept pace with the destruction going on.  There was nothing done during the war, and that period has to be made up for.  For that reason I think that we will do well to go on with planting here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> Planting, of course, is a thing that will not yield us much fruit in our lifetime.  The motto of the planter of trees is the old Latin one, &ldquo;Sic vobis, non vobis.&rdquo;  We have to look forward to the future, otherwise there will be no trees for those who come after us. We have benefited by the work done in this connection by those who have gone before us, and therefore we should not be selfish in our time.</P>
    <P>Apart from all that, the planting of trees gives a great deal of employment. If it was possible to have land available for timber planting in every county, it is a class of work that would give a great deal of employment in the winter time.  Numbers of men who are now receiving home help could be employed working on the plantations.  It is in the winter, in the fall of the leaf, that planting should be done.  That, of course, will cost money, and we have not heard what amount of money is going to be placed at the disposal of the Forestry Department for this purpose. The more that can be spared for it, the better.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill, I think that some of the sections in it are extremely drastic, and might I say some of them are rather grandmotherly.  It is right, of course, that those paying Land Commission annuities should act under the direction of the Land Commission as to what should be done about trees.  It is rather drastic, however, that this measure should apply to landowners who are not subject to the Land Commission and who, it is supposed, will have sense enough themselves to realise what is suitable to be done.  Section 7 provides that it shall be the duty of the owner to keep beasts, such as horses, asses, etc., out of these plantations.  I think that is rather a grandmotherly sort of regulation.  Most people, with any sense in their heads, would do that, and I think there is no need to have a special section in the Bill dealing with it.</P>

In my opinion, some of the sections in the Bill are extremely drastic, and I hope that on the Committee Stage some alterations will be made in them. There is another section in the Bill which provides that anyone who cuts down a tree must plant two to replace it.</P>

      <P>I think not.  At a time when people were extremely rich, especially in the case of demesnes, the owners planted trees all over the place. They planted so many of them that they made the demesne land useless for any purpose except ornamentation. That kind of thing would not suit in these days.  If, as the Bill stands, a person were to cut down one of these trees, he would have to plant two in place of it.  That seems rather hard, because already the number of trees on demesne land is really a nuisance.  I speak feelingly on this matter, because it applies to myself.  If I had to plant two trees for every one that I took down in my own park, I should create what one might call a holy mess.  I think the same thing applies to a good many other people.</P>

One of the effects of it, I believe, will be to help in beautifying the country.  It will also be the means of providing much-needed employment for a number of men now out of work.  Not only will employment be provided in the planting of trees, but there will be a lot of work to be done in the cutting down of timber that is over-matured and in the re-planting of young stock.  In regard to <Col N="849" /> that matter, I think that people who are compelled to cut down over-matured timber should be given, free of charge, trees to replace those cut down, as well as some help to meet the expense involved in cutting down these over-matured trees.  The owners will certainly make nothing out of trees of that sort.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to give us a little more information regarding the trees referred to in the Bill.  Are they trees that may be used only for commercial purposes, or is every class of tree that grows included? I can foresee where the Bill would have very harsh effects on the ordinary man in the country.  There are various tracts of land covered with trees that are of no commercial value, and very often the farmer who owns the land would find it advantageous to clear the timber and make better use of the land.  If that becomes necessary he has to apply for a licence.  If a person applies for a licence for the purpose of cutting trees that he owns, we presume the Minister has the power to say whether or not he shall get that licence. If we are to assume that every person who applies for a licence shall get it, then there is no restraint on the cutting of timber more than there has been heretofore.  On the other hand, if we are to assume that in many cases the Minister will refuse to grant a licence, there will be restrictions put on the cutting of trees.  If that is so, we are up against the position that the farmer who wished to clear away waste timber which was useful only for firewood may be refused permission to cut the trees, which are of no value except for the purpose I have mentioned.  If he were allowed to cut these trees the land could be put to some useful purpose.  If restrictions are justifiable, and I am satisfied they are, still it is putting a certain amount of restriction unnecessarily on the man who owns the timber, and who has a perfect right to dispose of it in the best market possible.  If people of that kind are to be prevented from cutting trees, not alone are the owners restricted, but the men employed in cutting the timber, the saw-mill owners, and other industries, are affected.  That is a matter to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> Where timber is cut certain precautions are taken that the trees must be replaced.  I am not satisfied that that method is suitable, as I do not think it would ensure that the planting of trees would be effectively done.  I have only a little experience of the planting of trees, but I have sufficient to know that it is one thing to plant trees and another to get them to grow.  Planting should be done in a practical way and requires special care if the plants are to have any chance of growth.  I do not agree with Deputy G. Wolfe that timber grown on lands owned by the Land Commission should be subject to restrictions. I think the position should be the opposite.  Where farmers have timber growing on their lands we can assume it was planted there by them or their predecessors, and that they are the absolute owners of that timber. Placing restrictions on these persons would be most unfair, for the ordinary farmer with thirty or forty acres is generally careful of the timber, the value of which he understands for shelter and ornamental purposes.  He often has the necessity to use it in seasons of the kind we had two or three years ago, when no turf was saved in parts of the country where they are entirely dependent on it for fuel.  If these trees were not available he would have had no fuel.  Deputy Wolfe says that these people should be subject to the control of the Land Commission, but I think the ordinary farmers should be exempt from the restriction proposed. The trees on their land are preciously guarded by them, and they hardly ever make use of them for commercial purposes.  There is no danger of abuse in their case.</P>
    <P>This Bill, unless I get a better explanation of it, does not quite satisfy me.  I would like to see the whole scheme of forestry the Minister has spoken of before the House.  If he produces a scheme on a scale the country requires, and he is prepared to push it vigorously.  I am satisfied the House will give him all the assurances and guarantees he thinks necessary to safeguard the existing timber for the wellbeing of the State.  We feel that a vigorous effort is needed on the part of the Government to deal with the question of afforestation.  So far the <Col N="851" /> Government have been very dilatory. I cannot see why it should not be possible for the Minister to put before the House, with the Bill, his whole programme as regards afforestation.  There is not a county in Ireland&mdash;and that is particularly true of Leitrim&mdash;that could not offer thousands of acres for planting purposes.  I was told by a gentleman who had long experience in Leitrim in connection with the Land Commission that it is ideally situated for the growing of timber, but that it was badly adapted for maintaining so many farmers as it has at present.  The climate and appearance of the country can be changed immensely for the better by a big scheme of afforestation. We should insist on the Government submitting their whole scheme to the House before they ask us for the drastic powers outlined in the Bill, which, I am afraid, will react rather harshly as regards certain farmers and small property owners.</P>

      <P>I admired Deputy Wolfe's speech, and especially I admired the ingenuity with which he succeeded in making a speech on this Bill which would be perfectly in order on the Estimate for the Forestry Department. When he came to the latter part of his speech he dealt with the Bill.  I cannot help thinking of a story I heard of a man who married a widow.  After the wedding he was introduced to his step-son for the first time.  He naturally wished to please his wife and said he was very pleased she had a boy, but could not help remarking that the boy's appearance was very unprepossessing and his habits revolting. Deputy Wolfe naturally wished to please the Minister.  Deputy Wolfe was very pleased that there was a Bill.  Any Bill was better than no Bill, but in details it struck him as being drastic, grandmotherly and unnecessary. I agree that they are drastic.  I will go half-way with him that they are grandmotherly.  Then it comes down, I suppose, to tender motherly care on the part of the Minister. I am not sure that they are unnecessary. Deputy Wolfe is not going to cut down every tree on his demesne any more than I am, but knows that <Col N="852" /> there are many cases, possibly tens, possibly hundreds, of people who shut down their houses and go away having sold the timber standing to some contractor to cut it down or take away. Anybody who goes around Dublin, who goes to the Dublin Mountains or Rathfarnham or goes down to Wicklow sees widespread clearances which it is the purpose of this Bill to prevent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drastic powers are necessary.  You cannot do it without drastic powers, but the application and use of these powers are very important.  When I read the Bill I felt the same apprehensions as Deputy Wolfe that it might be used to make the position of any man, growing or planting timber and hoping to get some return on his capital, impossible.  The Minister was reassuring. I am speaking now in the hope that he will be even more reassuring when he concludes the debate. One point he left rather open.  He said he had legal advice, that under the Bill there was legal power to adopt the procedure he suggested.  He did not say it was his intention.  That was very possibly an accidental omission, but I hope he will say that is the procedure that the Forestry Department intend to apply, because on the policy of the Department and on the machinery by which licences are issued will really rest the success of the Bill in the long run.  I was glad when he said that people who had planted in the past, hoping to sell in the future, may be granted licences.  I myself, twenty years ago, planted 10,000 young larch, thinking to make provision for my old age.  I should have put the land to more profitable use if I put black-faced sheep on it and grazed them, because I have sunk my capital for, roughly, forty years, have been paying rates on that land all the time and getting no return.  There is little hope now of very much private planting because of the costs.  To begin with, all the costs are gone up.  Labour, for instance, is paid a good deal more than it was twenty or twenty-five years ago.  Planting costs have gone up.  Then again your land is lying idle.  You have no return on it, and you have to pay rates.  I believe if the Minister has any hope of encouraging private planting his best plan would be a remission of rates on <Col N="853" /> land planted with timber.  I believe that would be more of an incentive than anything else.  I gather where planting, cutting and re-planting are carried on on a commercial scale that the Minister will not be disposed to refuse licences.</P>
    <P>There is another contingency.  Numbers of Deputies are not familiar with forestry.  I may say planting trees is like a general election under proportional representation.  You put up more candidates than you expect to see come up when the poll is declared. In some cases you are lucky.  You have planted your trees closely.  I do not know how the licence procedure will apply to that.  Will it be permissible to cut, say, 500 trees on an area coloured red on the map?</P>
    <P>Provision may be made for that. Otherwise trees will grow too closely together and not as well as they should. When planting you have to have a shelter belt of older trees.  When young trees are growing up that shelter belt becomes unnecessary.  I hope provision will be made by which licences will be granted to cut down these.  I hope, also, the Minister will take into consideration Deputy Dr. Ryan's suggestion about firewood.  There are dangers that if you put that into the Bill you may use if not only for mending fences and structures but also use it for firewood.  A man might denude his whole place for firewood.  On the whole, I think the advantages are greater than the disadvantages.  There is in every plantation of any size a certain amount of timber that is cut for firewood.  There may be trees that had better be cut for firewood, partly because they may interfere with young trees.  They had better be cut down, and firewood is one of the best uses to which they can be put.  I am not very hopeful that the Minister's policy of compelling a man to plant one, two, three or more trees instead of any others that he may have cut down will be a great success.  While you may compel a man to plant a tree you cannot compel him to tend it.  There is some use in the Minister's power to compel a man to make a fence.  He may make a fence to keep out cattle, goats, sheep, pigs and so on?  I deprecate Deputy Gorey's wrath at the <Col N="854" /> suggestion that hares were the enemies of young trees.</P>

      <P>Rabbits are bad, but I think hares are worse, because hares can get over any fence.  If you do not fence your young trees with hare-proof wire fences you will have very little result.  I do not see how the Minister can compel every person who has to plant trees also to put an expensive wire fence around them.  That, however, is a discretionary provision.</P>
      <P>I want to go back again to the machinery for granting licences.  At present the staff of the Forestry Department is small.  There are about seven in the office, not counting typists and so on.  There are five inspectors. Will they be able to deal with the applications for licences, which will be numerous in a reasonable space of time, because, if not, the inconvenience to people owning saw-mills will be considerable? Before the war I had a saw-mill which I worked, one day a week, for my own needs, for fence work, gates, planks, and so on.  Other uses are contemplated under this Bill. After the war, when wages had risen, I did not want to turn off the men.  I found there was a considerable demand from my neighbours for such uses as I mentioned, and I gradually built up a certain trade which suited my neighbours and suited me.  I am quoting my own case, but unless I had an assurance that there was a steady supply of timber not merely for my own repairs and structures but also for my neighbours, unless one could get an assurance that the licences would be granted regularly and without undue delay and would cover a substantial amount of timber, I am afraid I should have to shut down my saw-mill, which would mean throwing from four to six men out of employment.  I know there are a good many people in the same position. The purpose of the Bill is excellent.  It all rests on the policy adopted and the machinery employed in issuing licences. The Minister has reassured me very much in his opening statement, but I hope he will extend the matter a little further, and touch some of the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Cooper for the very interesting lesson in afforestation that he has given.  I happen to come from a part of the country where a considerable trade has been done for years in the exporting of round wood.  I got this morning the circular to which Deputy Ryan referred with reference to the exporting of round timber.  They give as an illustration Irish beech.  A very valuable little industry has been worked for years dealing with Irish beech.  The beech was cut into rough shapes for the manufacture of clog soles used in Lancashire by the operatives in the factories and it gave steady employment for years to about 20 men in a small district.  As a result of some difficulty with the owner of the timber the mill had to be closed and the operatives have cleared out.  That timber at present is being exported in the rough; the probable price for it would be 25/- a ton, whereas if it was turned out partly finished it probably would be worth £4 a ton, and the greater portion of the money realised for it would go in wages.  The work given in the district at the time the mill was in use was very valuable and the amount of wages was very helpful indeed.  I take it such provision would be hardly included in this Bill but it would be well worth while considering the suggestion made in this circular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper dealt with trees that are only fit for firewood.  I know a considerable area containing such timber, but if the timber were cut it would destroy the scenery.  The timber is really useless for anything but firewood, but it would be a serious loss and would spoil one of the most beautiful places in Ireland if it were cut. Even in the case of such trees the Department should be loth to grant licences wholesale.  It would be a good idea if local nurseries were established. I have in mind a local nursery where some years ago farmers got seedlings for practically nothing.  I am afraid that they would not be got so easily at the present time.  It should be made possible to have seedlings bought more cheaply than at present.  Farmers should be induced to see the value of planting shelter beds.  If the Department's experts could endeavour to persuade <Col N="856" /> them to plant such beds and give them seedlings at a considerably lower price than the market price it would help considerably.</P>
    <P>With reference to the planting of a tree or trees instead of those that are cut, the Minister stated that such provision is not mandatory.  I am sorry it is not, because it is one of the things that is really necessary to prevent a repetition of what has taken place in the past.  Trees have been wantonly cleared away in many places where there was no necessity for it, and such a clause should be made mandatory.</P>

      <P>A more unfair suggestion. It is quite true that woods are beautiful, but would not timber that would be of some use afterwards be just as beautiful as the old scrub that Deputy Goulding refers to.  The Minister made an effort, I think, to differentiate between plantation timber, hedge timber or casual trees about a homestead. In previous discussions here on the Land Acts the same distinction was made, but in reading Section 4 of the Bill I can come to no other conclusion than that this is meant to deal with timber about homesteads and not outside timber in plantations.  The Minister has told us there would be no necessity for anticipating any drastic results with regard to timber that ought to be cut and timber that is not growing in plantations, but once the Bill is an Act it will depend altogether on the viewpoint of those who are administering it. We may have different viewpoints from different Ministers.  I do not know that Section 4 ought to be so drastic as it is. Sub-section F of Section 4 states &ldquo;such tree is not necessary for the ornament or protection of the holding.&rdquo;  I agree <Col N="857" /> that this Bill is very drastic indeed but I can see that drastic provisions are necessary if you want to have your scheme of forestry a success in the country, but the smooth and commonsense working of it will largely depend on the Forestry Department.  I admit that you must have certain drastic definitions, so as to protect every interest but a good deal is left to the discretion of the officers and heads of the departments.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the destruction of young timber.  Deputy Cooper referred to the damage done by hares and rabbits.  It is very necessary in dealing with forestry to deal with the pests especially in the early stages of your timber plantation.  I do not know very much about the damage that hares do to plantations, but there is a pest to which no reference has been made and which does considerable damage to growing larch, and that is the squirrel.  I have seen a plantation destroyed by squirrels ringing the bark for eight or nine feet high to a with of an inch or an inch and a half.  It is very necessary that provision should be made to deal with all these pests.  Of course we may have some old maids in the country as we had in the case of the Protection of Wild Birds Bill who will say &ldquo;do not touch the poor little squirrel.&rdquo;  We do not want to be squeamish even though the hare were concerned.  If it is necessary for the forestry of the country to deal with pests I hope the squirrel will be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I would want to have an assurance from the Minister as regards the application of the provisions of this Bill to hedge timber.  I know that Deputy Wolfe in his very long speech said one very sensible thing at least, and that was the felling of timber at a certain age, because when timber goes past a certain age it is best that it should be felled.  In my opinion, this Bill is not introduced because of the things that are apprehended but because of the vandalism of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministry dealing with this Bill is animated with the knowledge of the many undesirable things which took <Col N="858" /> place in the past.  I suggest to the Minister that nearly all the vandals have operated and that any timber that is there is due to the fact that it was cared for by people who have some respect for scenery and who did not desire to make the most money they could out of it. During the war timber was at peak prices.  It is a pity that this Bill was not introduced nine or ten years ago. Woods were destroyed by people who wanted to make the most out of timber when high prices prevailed, and who can only be described as vandals.  In regard to the section stipulating that scrub cannot be burned within a mile of a plantation, I think it is very drastic. In my opinion a mile is an exaggerated distance.  I can visualise places like a mountain-side where that would be necessary, and for that reason I am not prepared to question it, especially in regard to new plantations.  I am not sure that the Minister should not take powers to deal with fires originating in another way.  Every day we pass through a county which is represented by a namesake of mine on the Opposition Benches and we see tracks of burned wood which originated in a fire caused by sparks from a train.  Some protection ought to be afforded to plantations bordering on railway lines.  I think the same remark applies to the line running from Maryborough to Limerick Junction and Thurles where you see traces of forest fires which originated in sparks from an engine. On one occasion I heard a law case decided on evidence given by so-called experts that fires could not take place through sparks from an engine as there was a contrivance attached which prevented the possibility of fires.  The judges accepted such evidence, but there is no greater fallacy than the idea that a fire cannot be caused through sparks from an engine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to show the Minister the necessity of making provision to prevent fires on plantations originating through sparks from an engine.  In regard to the fencing clauses and the making of provisions <Col N="859" /> to exclude trespass, I desire to state publicly that the greatest offenders in that direction will be the employees of the timber merchants engaged in cutting down timber.  When removing timber from a wood these are the people who do most harm to the young natural timber growing there.  I do not say that they do it intentionally, but it is done through carelessness, and the necessity of doing as little harm as possible to young growing timber should be impressed on the timber merchants and their employees.  That, I think, should be made one of the conditions of the Bill.  Trees are thrown down without any regard as to where they fall or what they are going to destroy in their fall.  Employees often take an axe and cut down&mdash;I have done it myself&mdash;whatever is handy to them, even if it be the best young plant in the immediate neighbourhood.  The timber merchants and their employees could help considerably by exercising a little more care in cutting down and removing timber.  I think my suggestion is a good one.  One would be inclined to look at this Bill as being unduly severe.  It certainly carries with it the possibility of undue severity, and a good deal will depend on the commonsense shown by the Ministry, the staff and the head of the Department. It can be made very objectionable and very drastic if people who have not commonsense are entrusted with enforcing its provisions.  It may, in fact, be necessary in Committee to tone down some of its provisions.  The people who have timber are not, as I say, the worst offenders.  The worst offenders have already done their damage, gone away with the swag, and have made as much as possible out of it.  I think that the people who have timber to-day should be complimented upon not having taken advantage of the times when they could have got enhanced prices if they were inspired by greed.  They were not inspired by such motives, and they are to be complimented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the circular that has been sent out.  It is very instructive.  It states that the whole stock of native timber should be held over for the operation of native timber manufactures. <Col N="860" /> They use the word &ldquo;manufactures&rdquo; and that is the reason I use it, but I do not think it applies.  It is mentioned that beech logs are worth 25/- a ton f.o.b. I do not know what the price would be if we had not a steamer to put this timber on.  What price would the timber merchants pay in that case?  I wonder what the price would be in the wood.  It would, in my opinion, range from nothing up to 12/- a ton to the grower.  Twelve shillings would be the extreme limit.  If the ton were only partly manufactured, as it is in some cases, it would be worth £4.  You need not bring it to the steamer, you need only put it on the sawmill, make a few cuts through it, and make it partly-manufactured and it gets a value of £4 a ton.  Perhaps that timber took a hundred years to grow.  It is worth at the very outside 12/- a ton to the grower but after ten minutes on the sawmill its value is £4 a ton.  In this, as in every other case, the producer is the last man to be taken into consideration. The grower of wood timber must, of course, be put on a different footing from the man who grows timber on good land.  Woods, of course, are given over to timber, but in the open country the damage that could be done to a big ornamental tree, ash, beech, or horse chestnut, is extraordinary.  I do not know what they would pay the grower for timber which happened to be on his land from sixty to one hundred years.  When it is cut down it is worth practically nothing for shipment but when it is ten minutes on the sawmill it is worth £4 a ton, and after further operations such as shafting, it is worth £10 a ton. Even now there is considerable traffic in timber to my own knowledge.  That traffic is on estates which have been broken up by the Land Commission within the last two or three years, and the people who gave it to them, some of them imported counts, have left nothing but stumps in the woods.  The land is in the possession of the Land Commission and it is on these lands that most dilapidation has been done.  On an estate near my residence I have seen these things happening.  It would be no harm if we had a better intelligence department.</P>

      <P>Yes.  At present a fair price is being paid for soft timber compared with the prices people have been getting.  Ash timber is worth from 15/6 to £1 per ton, but what is other timber worth?  What is oak, elm or beech worth?  It is worth practically nothing at present.  In the neighbourhood of towns you might get people who would take it away, but there is some timber which you could scarcely get people to take away.  Deputies do not appear to know that.  The best buyer of wood in the country today is the firewood merchant.  He is a very much better buyer than the timber merchant.  I am sure, from what I have been told, that the policy of the Department is to concentrate on growing soft timber. There are a few other timbers that are very useful, especially ash, but soft timber is worth infinitely more than hard timber.  A lot of the timber that was fashionable fifty, one hundred or two hundred years ago is useless today. These timbers are a drug on the market, and the growing of them would seem to me to be bad business, except on bad land.  Soft timber is the only timber for which you can get a price, such as deal, larch and spruce. I hope that in Committee we will be able to take the sting out of some of these provisions.  It would appear to <Col N="862" /> me, however, that we should adopt the attitude on the Committee Stage that these provisions are necessary to deal with possible abuses.  Although we may have only to deal with a few individuals in the State, it is necessary to have these provisions there to deal with them.</P>

      <P>I only intervene in this debate for a few minutes to deal with some of the objections which have been put forward to some clauses in this Bill.  The first objection which was made was put forward by Deputy Wolfe.  He has had several followers who object to the section which makes it obligatory on the owner of a plantation to have his plantation properly fenced against domestic animals.  I quite agree with Deputy Cooper that rabbits, hares and deer do more damage to timber and to plantations than domestic animals, but it does not follow from that that domestic animals do no damage, because they most undoubtedly do.  On the other hand, for practical purposes, I may say that it is impossible to fence against rabbits.  You get a certain amount of rabbit-wiring and at tremendous expense you put it down three or four inches in the ground. You think you are safe, but afterwards you go down there and you discover that the rabbit has gone a little deeper and has entered with his young family and your plantation is attacked.  It is almost impossible to protect a plantation against rabbits.</P>

      <P>I have never seen a plantation in a place in which rabbits were plentiful into which rabbits have not succeeded in getting.  I think you possibly could do it if you tarred your fence or put on some of the patent things that are used which will keep rabbits out, but for all practical purposes it would be impossible, and it would be an unnecessary hardship if the section were enlarged to make it essential that every owner of a plantation should put up a fence against rabbits. Deputy Gorey has correctly said that if a person plants trees now for anything with a commercial view in his head he will undoubtedly plant soft wood.  Hard woods&mdash;oak, ash and beech&mdash;are practically unsaleable and are very slow in giving a return.  If you want any return from trees you must plant early-maturing trees, such as larch and Corsican pine.  These are the trees which you must plant for practical purposes.  The person who is putting down a plantation of that nature will, you may be practically certain, take the necessary steps to safeguard it as far as he can.  But there was another way in continental countries, a very well recognised way of replanting, which is allowing nature to do its own work.  You cut down the large belts, and you allow those to be re-sown with natural-growing timber. Natural afforestation in this country is unfortunately rare.  None of the conifers re-seed or plant themselves, and in the case of natural plantations, like that in the wooded parts of the country, the only trees you will see of any value will be the ash and the beech.  Still the ash and the beech are trees of some value.  Beech is a tree which grows under shelter much better than almost any other tree grown.  You see places in which a considerable number of trees have been cut down, and there are isolated ones here and there standing. There are big gaps in these places, and if the land is fenced these will inevitably replant themselves with the ash and with the beech.  Some of these young trees will be, no doubt, very poor and very scrubby things, but you will <Col N="864" /> get some very nice straight-growing ash poles there, and then, as Deputy Gorey points out, some night one of your neighbours who wants a handle for his spade gets it, and your nicest ash sapling will have disappeared in the morning.  I am afraid that this happens in all parts of the country. It is not confined to Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going on a little further, Deputy Maguire talked about a licence to cut trees of no value.  I take it, of course, he means cutting trees for the reclamation of land.  I think it is pretty obvious, if you look at the Bill, that mere scrub does not come under the head of &ldquo;Trees.&rdquo;  That is to say, whitethorn, or blackthorn, or hazel, except in cases where it grows to the dimensions of timber trees.  In a great part of the country this would also apply to birch.  A great part of this would not come under the head of timber trees at all, and there would be no necessity to get a licence to clear your lands of them.  Deputy Maguire also said that this Bill would be a hardship upon the smaller tenants.  He said the small tenants would never cut their trees and that therefore there is no necessity for anything where they are concerned.  As a matter of fact, the small tenants had never, at any time, power to cut trees upon their own holdings except in very rare cases.  There were old timber Acts in the time of George III. passed in this country, whereby the occupier could register, if he liked, with the Petty Sessions Clerk a list of the trees planted and where he planted them, and then they became his property.  Otherwise all trees were not the property of the occupiers, but always the property of the landowner, who always could cut them down.  The Land Act rendered it impossible for him to cut down a certain class of tree on a tenant's holding; he had to compensate the occupier.  Subsequently the Land Commission was given power to prevent the sale of timber on lands that had been purchased outright already, as has been pointed out by the Minister.  So that this Bill is not really putting the small tenant purchaser in a worse position than he was in already. I certainly have seen myself, in a great number of cases, the small tenant purchaser cutting down woods in which <Col N="865" /> there was a considerable amount of trees growing, and cutting down every single tree.  In most parts of the country, at any rate, the small tenant purchaser did not recognise the economic value of small shelter belts. They did not see that those shelter belts pay and that the small amount of land under the shelter belts may improve the value of the rest of your holding out of all recognition.</P>
    <P>It was also said that this section about re-planting is rather foolish and that it could be made ineffective.  That is to say, the replanting of two trees where there was one tree already.  That is a very common provision in continental countries.  I know it exists in Switzerland, where no one can cut down a tree without planting another tree, and it seems to me that it is a very good and wise provision.  Deputy Wolfe said that he has got trees scattered over his demesne and that there are other people in the same position, and that these trees overshadow too much ground for grazing and that they prevent the tilling of the place entirely.</P>
    <P>He said that if he cut down these trees he will have to plant two trees for each tree cut down.  That does not follow.  If he cuts down trees in a particular place he may not be compelled to plant in the same place.  Certainly he will be compelled to plant in some other part of his holding, not in the particular place where the trees were cut.  If he cuts down twenty trees in the middle of his land he can make a little circle somewhere else and plant forty, of which a small number will mature.  He also said that it is very difficult to plant trees effectively.  I have myself some little experience of tree planting, and I have dscovered, so far as I am concerned at any rate, that the planting of small nine-inch trees is very much more effective and much cheaper than the system of planting where you dig a big hole and where you have to put in the roots of the trees with very great care.  I am talking of planting in the open country.  The question has been raised about the burning of scrub and heather and that sort of thing.  Well, that does not seem to be a very unfair or drastic provision in the Bill.  The section simply says that if you are going to have a fire, if <Col N="866" /> you are going to burn things, that you should give notice of it.  That prevents any burning except by the owner, and it prevents those wanton burnings which do so much damage through the country.  We have all of us seen from time to time mountains and bogs on fire, and a tremendous amount of damage done in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an old saying that some people cannot see the wood for the trees, and I think that as far as some of the critics of this measure are concerned that saying applies to them, because, to my mind, the drastic element in this Bill is its sole value.  But for the exceptionally drastic proposals made I would consider this a worthless measure.  I welcome the Bill from many points of view, but I welcome it principally as seemingly an earnest on the part of the Government of their intention to proceed with some form of re-afforestation scheme on a greater scale than heretofore. If they are about to proceed on such a scheme, such a measure as this is undoubtedly necessary.  This Bill provides protection for existing plantations, and it also provides that if a large amount of money is to be expended in future on new schemes, that that money will not be wasted; at any rate, that it will not run the risk of being entirely wasted by not having the plantations properly protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Bill is drastic.  The Minister has candidly admitted so.  It is quite true that in some respects it may require certain slight alterations.  In Section 4 (1) (f) I think that there should be some provision dealing with the cutting down of trees for fuel.  There is nothing in that section to provide that if fuel is required, and if it is necessary to cut down a tree for that purpose, that it will be within the right of the owner of the land to do so.  As far as Section 5 (4) is concerned, it has been stated that when a person gets a licence to cut a tree he will have to plant another or more trees in its stead.  I do not read that interpretation at all into the sub-section.  It says that such a condition may be imposed, but that is a very different thing from saying that in every case that condition shall be imposed.  As far as Section 6 is concerned, it has also been <Col N="867" /> stated that the meaning of that section is that no one can cut a tree, or a shrub, rather, within a mile of a plantation. Of course, the section means nothing of the kind.  Anyone may cut a tree upon his own land within a mile of a plantation, but he will do so at his own risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Burn a tree. He will, first of all, have to send a notice to the owner of the plantation, and if the owner of the plantation objects and he proceeds to burn the shrub or shrubs, then he will do so at his own risk, and that simply means that he will have to take all proper and necessary precautions and steps to see that the fire does not spread to the damage or the detriment of the neighbouring woods.  I do not think that in any way can be considered an excessively drastic suggestion.</P>
      <P>As far as the Minister for Justice's statement is concerned about not being able to protect plantations from rabbits all I can say is that he can know very little about the County Wicklow.  Most of the forestry operations that have been going on here&mdash;and unfortunately they have been pretty limited in the past&mdash;have been in the County Wicklow, and the County Wicklow is entirely over-run with rabbits and no such operations could have proceeded if they were not able to protect the plantations from the incursions of the rabbits.  They have done it by many means, including that suggested by Deputy Gorey.  The Bill, therefore, as a whole appears to me from the point of view of a step in the right direction of a future reafforestation scheme.  I sincerely hope that when it is passed the Government will seriously consider the expenditure of considerably larger sums of money upon afforestation in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the long time that we have been waiting for this Bill and the high hopes that were placed upon it.  I think most Deputies must be very disappointed with its provisions. It is true that it follows the line of most of the legislation being passed through this Dáil, inasmuch as <Col N="868" /> it places immense power in the hands of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture. Practically every Bill that comes in here, it seems to me, has as its centre-point that the Minister shall do so and so and the Ministry shall be entitled to do so and so.  In this Bill the principal feature is that the Minister shall say if there is to be another tree cut in Ireland in this generation, how many trees are to be cut, will all the trees be cut, and the particular persons that are to cut them.  That seems to me a rather extraordinary way of legislating&mdash;I mean from the point of view of a democratic assembly.  Assuredly it should be our aim to draw up schemes for dealing with this problem of restricting the cutting of trees, rather than to say: We will just pass it on to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture and his Department, and it will be quite safe in their hands.&rdquo;  It seems a lazy way of doing things, and I am sure most Deputies will agree that it may turn out to be a very dangerous way of doing things, because, I suppose, Government Departments are as liable to sin, and as liable to influences of various kinds, as anybody else in the world.  Of course, the Minister must not think that I am attempting to make particular points or to speak in anything more than in general and theoretical terms. To my mind it is very undesirable that that should be the principal feature of the legislation passing through this House.  This is one of the most remarkable cases of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other features in the measure, too, that are disappointing. On the question of licensing we are really taking the Bill on trust, because we have nothing in it to guide us as to who is to get the licence, what the expense of getting the licence will be, whether there are to be inspections on each application, whether there will be any general system of dealing with them, whether each application is to be considered apart from any other application, and so on.  Further, there is this very curious provision about the burning of shrubs.  I do not think that that can ever be put into operation. I think the Minister knows enough about country life, and everybody else here does, to realise that in nearly all cases these fires are started by urchins <Col N="869" /> who have no responsibility and whom it would be impossible to train to recognise that this is a dangerous practice. I do not know how the owner of a farm where a fire breaks out amongst the furze is ever to be held responsible unless he is actually caught setting fire to the furze.  It would be quite impracticable, I am sure, to put that clause into operation, and, though it may be useful as a sort of warning, its effect for the purpose of its own terms will be entirely useless.</P>
    <P>The biggest difficulty in the Bill, in my opinion, is that it means making two bites of a cherry.  We will some time or other have to link up the question of afforestation with the saw-milling industry, and I think it is a great pity that the Minister did not see his way to do that in the present measure. There are very many responsible people in the country who are alarmed at the big export of timber that is going on at the present time, and I refer particularly to those engaged in the furniture trade and the coach-building trade.</P>
    <P>I have heard many of them say that things were reaching a very dangerous point, that unless action was taken to stop this export trade that was going on, industries would be in a very serious plight in the immediate future. In that respect, I think, Deputy Gorey was badly informed when he said that there was no demand at present for timber.  So far from that being so, there is an overwhelming demand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will remember, I referred to hard wood.  With the exception of beech and sycamore, I named hard wood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not remember that that remark was made and, of course, I accept the correction.  But for the soft woods, at all events, there is an overwhelming demand, and nobody has to think that the 105 shilling mentioned in the saw-millers' statement is any guide as to the amount that is being obtained by growers for this timber.  As a matter of fact, I believe that excellent beech is being sold at 2/6 per ton for export.  We can see no reason why that trade should be continued, especially when saw-milling is so widespread an industry in the <Col N="870" /> country, and there is a prospect of getting much more out of this timber than by merely exporting it in the raw state.  We do not see why the Minister would not have gone the whole way by putting in a clause prohibiting the export of timber except in manufactured or semi-manufactured form.</P>
      <P>To come back to licensing for a moment, I do not believe the Minister meant that literally as it stands, and I think it will be capable of abuse.  In any case, I can say this, that any farmer who wants to cut down a tree is not going to be deterred by this Bill from doing so.  He can very easily cut it down at night.  Many a tree, as the Minister knows, has been cut down at night, and it will be done in the future wherever the owner desires to do it.  I would really invite the Minister to consider it between this and the Committee Stage.  We do not intend to vote against the Bill, but we would be very glad, and would certainly not claim it as a Party victory, if the Minister between this and the Committee Stage would consider the linking up of this measure with the requirements of the saw-milling industry.  After all, the facts set down there, that most Deputies have read, are very striking and important facts, and some time or other we will probably have to face them and make the provisions suggested. We think the time has come to do so.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  I do not accept that statement except in a general way.  I did not mean to say that we agree with every detail in it. Apart from this statement altogether, the Minister will remember that only a month ago, I had a question on the Order Paper asking him if he would take measures to stop the export.  That question, I may tell him, was prompted by people engaged in the industry, people who have no axe to grind, except that they take a very serious view <Col N="871" /> of the depletion of the woods that is going on at present, all the more because that depletion is bringing so little profit to the country.  Between this and the Committee Stage, we would urge the Minister to consider whether he could not introduce at least a provision such as I suggest into the measure.  I am sure that if he does the Bill will be a lot more useful.  To me, at least, the system of handing over to the Government Departments such big powers and duties as are given in this Bill is not altogether to my liking.  I do not think it is a good principle, and I think it will eventually lead to great danger.</P>

      <P>I desire to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill and I am only sorry that it was not introduced sooner.  The amount of wood that has been felled in Ireland for some years must arouse anxiety in anyone who takes an interest in one of our most valuable national assets.  If this Bill had not been introduced, I am afraid that in a very short time we would have nothing left as far as my part of the country&mdash;Waterford&mdash;is concerned but gorse and some brambles.  Coming to and going from Dublin I pass through a fairly extensive tract of country, and even there one can see on every side of the railway line tree after tree felled within a very short time.  In fact, from here to Waterford there is scarcely a tree standing now in close proximity to the Great Southern Railways line.  It seems to be forgotten by people who cut down trees what a great value they are to any nation.  They forget that it takes years and years before a tree reaches maturity.  Apart from the various uses that the wood can be put to, it seems to be forgotten that trees exert a great influence on the climate of the country, and I am fairly sure that the wholesale destruction of trees has helped to bring about a change of climate in Ireland. And not only that, but it helped in no small degree the floodings that we had in Ireland, especially within the last four or five years.  Apart from the uses that the wood can be put to, other nations take a great interest and have very drastic laws in relation to their forests and woods.  Take Scotland. Scotland has a tremendous turnover on <Col N="872" /> account of the way in which it preserves its deer forests and grouse moors for tourists.  I do not see why we in the Saorstát could not do the same as Scotland does.  It would be a great source of revenue to our people, and in various directions it would create employment. The word &ldquo;grandmotherly&rdquo; and other words have been used by some Deputies when describing this Bill.  I do not see anything grand-motherly about it.  I think it is a sound Bill.</P>
      <P>I think that is very clear, even though it may be in some clauses very drastic.  As to Section 5, sub-section (4), dealing with the replanting of trees, the only adverse criticism I have of that is that it is a pity the Minister did not insist that half a dozen trees should be planted where one was cut down.  I do not see that any great harm will be done to the wood industry by the export of pit wood, provided more trees are planted.  I am not going to proceed to criticise this Bill.  I suppose I got a copy of the Bill before, but I only saw it a few moments ago.  I wish to congratulate the Minister and hope that, if necessary, it may be the precursor of more drastic Bills dealing with our forests and woods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present during the greater part of this debate, and therefore I intend to deal only with one of the clauses and that is in connection with the burning of plantations and furze.  I probably would not have spoken at all on this subject only for the fact that I was present on last Sunday evening when twenty acres of furze and plantations belonging to Major Halliday, Cleaboy Stud, Mullingar, were burned.  I do not know what caused the burning of these woods. Probably it was an accident, but the fact remains that thousands of young trees were burnt and that thousands and thousands of eggs were destroyed &mdash;ducks' nests, snipe nests, pheasants' nests, and ordinary birds' nests.  That is a matter that possibly the Minister for Justice, when introducing his very much overdue Game Laws Bill, might be able to deal with.  I agree with Deputy Moore that damage like that is probably caused by urchins, because I know and have myself seen young <Col N="873" /> boys going through the mountains and bogs and setting fire to the dry heather simply for amusement, but doing damage the cost of which to the country it would be very difficult to estimate. That devastating fire that I spent three or four hours looking at reminded me of the times when I read about prairie fires.  Because the evening was rather rough, the fire blew right across these twenty acres, the flames went up into the air and the entire place was destroyed. I am very glad that the Minister has introduced this clause requiring people who are going to burn anything at least to give notice beforehand. I am sorry that the Minister for Justice has spoken before me, because that is a matter he could deal with when he introduces what I have said is the very much overdue Game Protection Bill which he has promised to introduce before the Summer Recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the House for very long. I wish to oppose the Bill on account of Section 4.  I opposed a similar section in the Land Act some twelve months ago.  I think this is much too drastic, that it is not at all correct, and that it will stop all enterprise.  Perhaps some Forestry Bill is necessary, but I do not think that this Bill will meet the position at all.  If the Bill made it compulsory on people to give notice when they were going to cut down trees, and if the Minister made a condition upon the permit to be given that they were to replant a certain number to replace those cut down, there might be some reason in it, but it seems very unreasonable that men who have been paying rates and income tax on land, and their fathers and perhaps their grandfathers before them, should now be told by the Government that they cannot cut down their trees&mdash;should be told: &ldquo;We are usurping this power, and consequently we will not allow you to cut them.&rdquo;  Of course it has been said that a good deal depends on how the Bill will be enforced, and, according to the Minister, there will be no trouble about it.  He says that all you have to do is to make application to the Department, and that the Department will probably say: &ldquo;Yes, it will be all right.&rdquo;  But we would like to <Col N="874" /> have some more definite information about this.  We want to know how we are going to be treated in case the Department says &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and if there is to be any appeal against the Department's decision.  I think that there should be an appeal to the Circuit Judge in a case like that, or to some other responsible person, and that it should not be left altogether to officials of the Department.  I think the burning clause opens a very wide and perhaps a dangerous question, because in the case referred to by the last speaker the serious fire that took place in his district was probably not caused by the owner of the place, but was caused by some passing person, who may have done it maliciously or by throwing down a match after lighting a cigarette or a pipe.  If the Bill passes with this clause it will leave the owner liable.</P>

      <P>It opens a big question. There is no danger that the owner of a big place like that would burn it, even for the destruction of the ferns, at this time of the year.  Anybody who owns a place like that would be quite well aware of the damage that would be done if a fire was lit there.  I think we are going the wrong way to have our woods protected.  If the industry was encouraged, and if the people were allowed a free hand, I do not think there would be any necessity for these powers.  The Minister dealt with contracts that have already been made. He is evidently doubtful as to what steps can be taken with regard to them.  I do not know what steps he intends to take, but I think something very definite should be done.  Other wise it will lead to a considerable amount of trouble, because any man who has got a contract and who has cut part of the timber will have to decide whether he has to cut half of it or a quarter.  It will mean big discussions, and probably trouble and law.  Notwithstanding what has been said, the timber trade is in a depressed condition.  I know from experience that timber is not worth more than 25 per cent, of what it was worth four or five years ago.  That is soft wood, and as regards hard wood, such as beech, <Col N="875" /> it is practically unsaleable at present. Men who deal in timber tell me that they can buy enormous beech trees for about 5/- a ton.  I do not think that at that price there will be any encouragement for people to grow timber, and certainly it would not be in the interests of anyone to sell it, except where the trees were doing harm to grazing, as they do.  I think Section 4 is much too drastic, and therefore I will oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether between this and the Committee Stage he will carefully consider Deputy Redmond's suggestion of inserting in Section 4 a provision permitting the cutting of timber for fuel. The difficulty I see is this: in common with a great many landowners, I am accustomed to making use of my own timber for fuel.  The Minister may say that there would be no difficulty about giving a licence, but I observe that Section 5 says: &ldquo;The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, grant any person a licence in the prescribed form to cut down or uproot any tree specified in such licence.&rdquo;  Does the Minister seriously suggest that it would be worth his while to send an inspector specially to my remote domicile in order to mark down half-a-dozen trees that I may propose to cut for fuel purposes? It appears to me to be utterly impracticable.  While it is necessary that the Department should have general power of control, the form in which it appears in the Bill is really quite hopelessly impracticable.  One does not want to be driven to the evasion suggested by a former speaker of having to cut down trees by night.  I suggest to the Minister that between this and the Committee Stage he ought to consider seriously whether a simpler form of dealing with the matter could not be found.</P>

      <P>There is general agreement that the introduction of this Bill is necessary.  There is no doubt that if anything in the nature of an extensive, not to mention a national, scheme of afforestation is to be carried out, it must be carried out by the <Col N="876" /> State.  The class of people who in the past were responsible for planting and maintaining forests is rapidly disappearing, and the denudation of timber took place largely simultaneously with the expansion or completion of land purchase.  The two main reasons why afforestation cannot be carried out by the individual are that at the present prices of practically all classes of timber the schemes would be unremunerative, and that even if they promised to be remunerative, the long period which planters have to wait for the financial returns makes it impossible for the small holder, in fact any farmer, to embark on a scheme of afforestation.  It is also pretty evident that under the afforestation laws as they stood it was impossible for the Department to extend their afforestation activities, for the reason that they were obliged to acquire the land which they wanted by voluntary means.  It, therefore, sometimes happened that in places where there were suitable tracts of land&mdash;mountain land, perhaps &mdash;available for afforestation, the Department could acquire certain portions, but could not acquire the whole of the land owing, perhaps, to peculiarities of certain holders, who could not be satisfied as to price, with the result that large areas which could be planted if the Department had compulsory powers were and are still lying derelict so far as afforestation is concerned. This Bill will give the Department power to acquire this land by compulsion, and when that power has been acquired the way will be clear for a general expansion of the afforestation policy of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this Bill, although the general principle may be approved, there are certain sections, a great many of which have been commented upon, which will require careful examination in Committee.  In Section 4 we have the old hardy annual which has been discussed under several Land Acts&mdash;the question of the prohibition of the felling of trees.  I approach that section with a great amount of diffidence, because I have heard it argued so frequently that I have come to recognise the extreme difficulty of drafting a section or devising <Col N="877" /> a formula which will make it possible for the Department to control the felling of trees in certain circumstances and, at the same time, give the necessary freedom which is required by the ordinary farmer in order to carry out his usual farming avocations without unnecessary interference by a Government Department.  It seems to me, however, that the devising of a formula is not beyond the bounds of possibility.  Deputy Law suggested the inclusion in Section 4 (1) (f) of timber to be used for fuel purposes, and I think the Minister should accept that suggestion. But even that suggestion would not fully cover the situation in regard to the ordinary farmer.  The real difficulty is that apparently the Minister visualises a situation in which certain legal enactments will be passed, certain powers will be taken, which can be enforced or not just as the Department sees fit, and that in actual practice the farmers will continue to do as they have been doing in the past, that is, cutting an occasional tree when necessary for fuel or for the requirements of their farm.  Personally, I think that principle of law is bad.  If we enact a law we ought to be prepared to put it into force.  It is an unsound principle to have a law on the Statute Book and that a farmer who cuts down one tree will be consciously violating that law.  In addition to that, I am sure it is well known to the Minister that the kind of afforestation which is wanted is not of the nature that exists at present on farms, if we can call it afforestation.  It is a well-known fact that hedge timber and isolated trees scattered through lands are in many cases injurious and that no good purpose is served by keeping them.  Land may even be improved by cutting them down.  As the law stands, and will continue to stand after this Bill is passed, the individual farmer will have to obtain a licence before he can cut down one tree, unless that tree is used for a certain purpose on the farm.  I am sure it is not outside the bounds of possibility to devise an amendment or formula which will get over this, and if that can be done it ought to be done. It is a blot on all the Land Acts and on the present Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> The only other section which I would like to call special attention to is Section 6, which deals with the burning of shrubs.  With many other Deputies, I am not fully convinced that the section is practicable in its present form.  The placing of responsibility in the proper quarters will, in my opinion, be very difficult, but not impossible.  Further than that, it seems to me to throw all the responsibility on the person who burns the shrubs, and no responsibility on the owner of the afforested portion of land.  Possibly some responsibility ought to be thrown on the owner of the land, because it is well known that in certain mountainous districts the setting fire to scrub growth, heather, etc., is essential to the proper retention of that land in the kind of condition necessary in order that grazing may be available.</P>
    <P>Whereas it is right and correct that responsibility should be thrown upon the people who set fire to the land in their own interest it is also, in my opinion, perhaps advisable that some stipulation should be placed in the Bill throwing a certain responsibility on the owner of the afforested portion of the land to protect his land.  I think the whole responsibility should not be thrown upon the owner of the scrub land adjoining the portion of the afforested land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore made some comments with regard to the extraordinary power given by this Bill to the Department of Lands and Agriculture.  This is a type of legislation very common nowadays&mdash;legislation by regulation. But it seems to me that in dealing with a matter of this kind no other form of legislation is possible.  You cannot make provision for every contingency which may arise from time to time. There is no possibility that we can pass Acts that will make provision for every contingency arising out of a complex situation which may change from year to year.  And you must give certain powers to the Departments, and although we give these powers we have the right to come to the Dáil and to restrict and stop those powers at any time we think fit.  Deputy Moore also referred to a matter which, I think, was mentioned before.  He suggested the advisability of putting restrictions <Col N="879" /> upon the export of timber.  I find it difficult to follow the intention of the suggested restriction of that kind.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that one of the main reasons why afforestation is not taken up at the present time, or even thought of, as an economic and financial enterprise is that the return from timber is so low that in no conceivable circumstances at the present price could a man think that the planting of an area of land would be remunerative to him or his children. After all, internal prices are and must be regulated to a very large extent by the external price, and undoubtedly the internal prices are governed in regard to timber as in regard to every other exported article by the external prices, the price of the exportable surplus. But the actual effect of restrictions on the export of timber would be to give a monopoly to the saw-mill owners and the industrialists who deal with the timber on an industrial basis, and to give them a right to fix their own prices.  By doing that we give a monopoly to a class generally acknowledged to be paying unremunerative prices to the producers at the present time.  It seems to me if a stipulation of that kind were introduced into this Bill, or into any Act dealing with the export of timber that the effect would be not to encourage afforestation but to restrict it.</P>

      <P>I was very interested in Deputy Gorey's definition of scrub. It reminded me of the answer given by the committee man who was telling his neighbour some of the improvements which were going to be made in the local graveyard.  He said they were going to remove the big timber round there.  And the other said: &ldquo;What are you going to do then?&rdquo; And he answered that they were going to put scrub in.  Looking over this Bill, I think it is a Bill that is all for prevention and negation.  It is not as acceptable as if it made provisions for the more productive end.  While some measure of protection of the forests may be necessary, that is protection of immature timber, the Bill as presented to us seems to be very incomplete. Deputy Heffernan mentioned, as we <Col N="880" /> well know, that tillage land is far better without lone trees.  Any of us who has tried tillage in the neighbourhood of ash trees knows what happens. There should be in the Bill some provision where a person having these trees should not have to go the rounds of getting permission and of having an inspector sent down to cut down such lone trees which are only doing damage and only useful for firewood.  Another thing I want information about is with regard to timber on fee simple land.  I know the case of business men who purchased land at a good price.  There was timber on the land and that timber was an asset, because they looked upon it as very useful in connection with the factory which they worked for the making of boxes for their products. That timber has not been removed as yet.  Would the provisions in this Bill prevent them getting what they have regarded as an asset on the land in return for their money?</P>
      <P>There may be a great many reasons why people should cut timber.  A person may have to sell timber at a low price to get the necessaries of life.  I think it is a sad reflection on the timber of our country that so very little of it is of use for building purposes.  I have in my short life engaged in building operations and I found very little of the native timber useful or suitable for that purpose.  If the Minister had brought in this Bill along with another Bill making provisions for the planting of trees I think this House might have met it in a more gentle spirit and in a spirit of welcome.  If provision for planting large areas were made along with this prevention, and also if there was encouragement given to the smaller farmers to plant the corners on their holdings, even if only half an acre in extent, I think it would appear to this House more acceptable than the Bill as it stands now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Moore when he says that a good deal of power is vested in the Minister. None of us has any reason to believe the present Minister for Agriculture, being a practical man, would prevent great things being done.  But when you look into the Bill you find that in thirteen sections the Minister is mentioned <Col N="881" /> no less than nine times.  I think a law or a measure should stand on its own feet and not on the opinion of an individual, no matter how good that individual may be.  I admit there is necessity for this prevention of the cutting down of timber that is not matured, but the provision extends too far.  I ask the Minister to allow time between now and the Committee Stage in order that amendments might be framed which might make the Bill more acceptable to Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTReynolds" hpid="Mr. REYNOLDS Mr. REYNOLDS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. REYNOLDS</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill to this extent, that it will be the means of promoting the growing of timber in the country a little better than it is going on at present.  Many Deputies have stated that timber here is of very little value.  I can state from experience that home-grown timber in this country costs to-day almost as much as foreign timber.  For instance, if in my neighbourhood you go to the wood and buy a tree, bring it to the saw-mill and there get it cut up as you require, it costs you, by the time you have it ready for use, almost as much as the foreign timber costs you on rail at the local station.  I think if this Bill promotes the growing of timber that many people will welcome it.  In years to come, the timber grown will be of great benefit to the country.  I just wish to refer to Section 4, which prohibits people who own timber from cutting it without a licence.  I think that such a provision in the Bill is a poor recompense for the industry of farmers and others who preserved their timber up to this time.  There was a period not so many years ago when the owners of this timber could have got a good price for it.  I think that the method adopted here is hardly a right way of dealing with this.  I think that the people who own the timber should get a certain amount of consideration, or that they should be compensated for it before anyone would be allowed to take it over and say: &ldquo;This belongs to me.&rdquo;  In my opinion, that is not a fair way of dealing with the matter.  I hope that before the Committee Stage is reached the Minister will consider that and make such provision that the farmers will be compensated for the timber <Col N="882" /> they have saved up to the present should it be taken from them.</P>

      <P>With regard to Section 4, I desire to support what the last Deputy has stated.  I think that section ought to be abolished.  The idea that a farmer should have to look for a permit every time he wants to cut a tree seems to me to be ridiculous.  Goodness knows we have to look for permits enough without having to seek one every time we want to cut down a tree. I think what is sought under that section is very well provided for under Section 5, where it is provided that a licence granted may, if the Minister so thinks fit, contain a condition that the licensee shall within a specified time after cutting down or uprooting a tree under the licence plant one or more trees of a specified kind on the holding on which such tree was cut down.  I think myself that the general run of farmers at the present day are planting more trees than they are cutting. I think if there was a proviso put in that, in the case of a farmer cutting a tree, he would plant one in its stead it would be meeting the situation fairly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wolfe sought to draw a distinction between purchased land, land on which annuities are being paid, and land held in fee simple&mdash;demesne or landlords' land.  He said that those holding land in fee simple had a better sense of what was right than those paying land annuities&mdash;a sort of superiority complex.  I know that in my district when the landlords were leaving the land they did not leave as much as a bush to be cut.</P>

I think myself that Section 4 should be deleted from the Bill.  I am glad to see a Bill of this kind brought in, because I would like to see plenty of timber in the country. At the same time, I think Section 4 is an outrage.  It is not right that a farmer should have to apply to the Department for a permit before he can cut down a tree on his land.  I think the Bill could do very well without that provision.</P>

      <P>I desire to draw the attention of the Minister to Section 7. In that section there is no provision for the protection of farmers' crops outside woods.  During the past five weeks my attention has been called on several occasions to the damage done to farmers' crops by rabbits, pheasants and other birds which had come out of the woods adjoining the farmers' lands.  I hope that the Minister will be able to find some means of amending this section on the Committee Stage so as to prevent damage of that kind.</P>

      <P>Nearly everybody agrees that there should be some restrictions placed on the wholesale cutting down of woods; even Deputy Cole, who was more free trade in the matter than probably any Deputy who spoke.  How to carry that general agreement out is the difficulty. The proposal in Section 4 is that no tree, with some exceptions, shall be cut down without a licence from the Department. I admitted that was drastic, but I stated the intention was mainly to protect the wholesale cutting down of woods.  A number of Deputies object to that but what do they want me to insert in its stead?  I considered the matter from every angle, and I fail to see how I can take any powers under this Bill which will enable the Department of Agriculture to prevent the wholesale felling of woods without replanting by anything short of this. If Deputies think that it can be done, then let them put in amendments; but I ask them to remember that they have <Col N="884" /> all agreed that there must be some restrictions.</P>
      <P>There was just one possible alternative suggested.  That was that there should be no power to prevent the cutting of trees, but that the Ministry should have power to compel the person who cuts a tree to replant.  I think if you compel everybody who cuts a tree to replant, that is a much more drastic provision than the one in the Bill.  Moreover, it seems to me to be a little wasteful, because, as it was pointed out by many Deputies, the planting of trees is quite a simple operation, but it does not carry the problem very much further.  Anybody can dig a hole, get a tree, and put it down and cover in the earth, but then the job only begins.  It is the protection of the plantation while the trees are growing that is the real problem. If ten trees are planted in a careless fashion like that, perhaps only two will survive.</P>
      <P>If I were to accept what many Deputies have stated and insert a provision about replanting as a substitute for the powers I have asked, namely, to prohibit the cutting down of trees except under licence, then you would be doing something much more drastic than what is proposed in the Bill.  In addition, you would be doing something which would be extremely wasteful, as well as extremely difficult to administer.  You could administer it in odd cases, but if you had to administer such a provision in a wholesale way, and if you made an order that every wood and every plantation, no matter what its size, should be replanted, look at the number of inspectors you would have to employ, unless you wanted to turn the thing into an absolute dead letter.  There is a dilemma here. Every Deputy here says that he is in favour of restricting the wholesale felling of woods and of trees, of shelter belts and ornamental beds, and of plantations big and small, but everybody, not perhaps everybody, is against this particular provision.</P>

It would be extremely drastic if it was considered that in the case of every plantation or wood where matured timber is cut down, no matter where and in what circumstances, the owner would have to replant.  That would make it impossible in many cases to cut down, and in some cases it would be undesirable.  In any event, even as the provision stands, if it were applied everywhere and in all circumstances it would be very drastic.</P>

I contemplate that that would be exercised in this way: There is an application to cut down a plantation, and there is a lot to be said on both sides of the question, so that it is very doubtful as to whether or not you should allow such a plantation to be cut down.  It may be very valuable from an ornamental point of view.  It may be very valuable as an asset, and for some reason of that sort the Department are doubtful as to whether they should allow the plantation to be cut.  In that sort of case you would resolve the doubt and say &ldquo;Very well, cut away, but replant.&rdquo;  I do not anticipate that section will be used except in cases of that sort, and in the minority of cases.</P>

Is it suggested there should be no authority in the country to stop that?</P>

      <P>Of course, it is possible, and it is a matter for consideration whether this might not be narrowed somewhat.  A farmer may cut <Col N="887" /> down any tree he wants for the use of his holding, such as for fuel, except it is ornamental timber or a sheltered belt.  If it is that, he must get a licence. It might be possible to insert some words which would make it clear that a farmer could cut trees scattered here and there through his holding if they were not of much value, such as ash, for his own purpose without having to apply for a licence.  What I want to prevent is that a farmer or any person occupying land should wantonly cut shelter belts or ornamental timber.  I can see no other way of doing it than that suggested in Section 4.  If it is made wider there would be loopholes, and there would be questions as to whether it was valuable timber, a shelter belt, and does it come within the category of a wood or plantation? Is it merely a half-a-dozen or a dozen trees which are of little value?  How do you define a plantation?  Is it twenty trees with a fence about them, and if the fence falls what about it then?

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my view.  As to the three points put up by Deputy Ryan, who is to judge whether the trees are ornamental or not?  There is also the point of cutting the timber for fuel.  The question he asked on Section 5 was a Second Reading question. Sub-section (3) of Section 5 states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A licence granted under this <Col N="888" /> section shall operate to relieve in respect of every tree mentioned therein the licensee and any person authorised by him from any prohibition against cutting down or uprooting contained in this Act but shall not operate to give any other relief or to confer any further or other authority in respect of any such tree.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is inserted for the purpose of ensuring that the State has no liability in the matter.  For instance, a person who did not own a tree might apply for a licence to cut it.  It is not a question for us to decide who owns the tree. We give a licence to cut the tree and it is a matter afterwards between the person who owns the tree and the holder of the licence to deal with that case.  I think I have also dealt with the point about replanting.  The intention was to exercise that power very carefully, and not as a general rule. My idea was to exercise that power when there was some doubt as to whether a licence should be granted for cutting trees.  In such cases you might resolve the doubt by saying, &ldquo;Very well, it is a doubtful case, it is a case in which, for one reason or another, a licence should not be granted to cut down the wood; but if you agree to replant we will make no further difficulty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That I think is a reasonable enough power to take.  I agree that as the Bill is drafted the Department might say that in every case and make things impossible, but I can see no other way except leaving it to the discretion of the Department.  You cannot deal with special cases.  If you want to make it more specific you will find that the very case with which you want to deal will be left outside the Bill.  It is extraordinary when you pass legislation how often you fail to cover cases for which you intended to provide.  Deputy Haslett made a point which surprised me.  He also said that there would be a greater welcome to the Bill if we coupled it with powers to plant very much larger areas and gave help to individuals and local authorities to develop their planting programmes.  In other words, the point was made that we have not taken powers in this Bill <Col N="889" /> to plant more land.  That I take it is what he meant, or that we should increase our assistance to private individuals and local authorities for the purpose of planting.  That point was also made by Deputy Maguire on the opposite benches.  Is there, however, any point in again taking powers which we have already got?  If the Minister for Finance put up a sum of £1,000,000 per annum for buying land and if the Dáil passes the estimate we have all the powers we want under this Bill and previous legislation.  What more powers do you want?  If the Minister for Finance put up £1,000,000 to be advanced to individuals and county councils and if the taxpayer and the Dáil agree to find the money we have all the powers we want.  They are all there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HASLETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you have that power but I understand that you do not deal with anything under 300 acres.  My suggestion was in regard to schemes for smaller plantings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not, in practice, take less than 300 acres, but we could do so.  That is an economic question. We could take an acre here, there, and elsewhere if we wanted to, and we do not require legislation for that.  I am only professing to deal here with points that are not covered by legislation.  It is a question whether it is good business from the point of view of the taxpayer to go into smaller areas and what you would pay for them.  I was also asked to link up the question of afforestation with that of saw-mills.  That was done by Deputy Moore, but, as Deputy Goulding rightly said, they are two different questions.  The insertion of a provision as suggested in the circular is, as Deputy Goulding said, a question of trade, and an entirely different question from that of afforestation.  Remember Deputy Moore's position.  He is in a different position from Deputy Cole.  He agrees that there should be restrictions on the felling of timber and the cutting of woods, but he objects to the way we do it, and makes no suggestion as to how it should be done.  He objects to giving discretion to any Department.  He says that this is the lazy way.  I do not know what is the <Col N="890" /> lively way.  He goes on to say that the provision suggested in the statement of the Native Timber Merchants' Federation should be inserted, dealing with the prohibition of native timber in an unmanufactured state except in the case of pit wood.  He seems to suggest that if a provision were inserted prohibiting the export of unsawn timber it would have a wonderful effect on forestry.  I am talking from the point of view of the development of woodland and forestry.</P>
      <P>If you prohibit the export of unsawn timber it will be sawn and exported and just as much timber will be cut.  This provision would really be no good to the timber merchants.  The sting is in the tail.  There are two more provisions to be inserted to meet their case.  One of them is that properly established and registered saw-millers and timber merchants should be free to purchase their supplies of standing timber wherever and whenever they please in the Twenty Six Counties.  I do not know what they mean by that except that the position of saw millers in Ireland in that regard should be stabilised and that no one else should cut timber, that they should cut it, saw it, export it, and that they should be perfectly free to buy timber without let or hindrance anywhere.  That might be a sound case to put up on any Bill but a Forestry Bill.  This is purely a commercial question.  I have no objection to anyone putting forward that provision provided it is not done under cover of doing a good turn for planting. As I say, if you prevent the export of unsawn timber it will be sawn and exported.  You stabilise a number of timber merchants.  That means something like a monopoly and you then tell them to go ahead, buy their timber, cut it, saw it, and export it.  There is much to be said for that, especially from the point of view of the saw-millers, but do not let anyone pretend that that is going to benefit the development of forestry.</P>

      <P>May I say that I do not see how, as a result of this Bill, unemployment could take place, provided the Department are reasonable in giving licences to cut timber that should be cut.  Deputies cannot have it both ways.  They cannot say, on the one hand, that the country is denuded of timber and that trees should not be cut down in a wholesale way and then, on the other hand, blame the Department or any other authority which may be set up for using their discretion in a reasonable way to prevent this wholesale felling.  They cannot try to have it both ways.  By saying to me: &ldquo;Well, what about the unemployment?&rdquo; I could no more discuss unemployment which might be caused on such a Bill than I could discuss any other reaction such as, for instance, the indirect effect which this Bill might have on the climate of the country.  I do not see how this can cause unemployment. It is not proposed drastically to restrict the felling of timber fit for felling, and the cutting and sawing of such timber.  It is only proposed to interfere with the odd case where timber is being cut wantonly and where everyone would agree that it is wrong to cut it.  That is the idea, but the Bill may not carry it out.  I cannot understand the attitude of any Deputy who takes up the position of saying that there should be restrictions and then, when you put on restrictions, asking about the unemployment it will cause. That is a different question.  The question whether timber should be exported, sawn or unsawn, is not a forestry but a commercial question. Whatever decision you come to it will have an implication which should be examined from a purely commercial point of view, but not on a Bill like this.  These were the general points raised.  There were a number of other points which, as the Ceann Comhairle pointed out, were Committee points, which can be dealt with in Committee, and which I do not intend at this stage to go into.  It was suggested that ample time should be given between Second Reading and the Committee Stage to enable Deputies to consider the Bill.  I would suggest that the Committee <Col N="892" /> Stage be fixed for Wednesday, 9th May.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he has considered, or will consider, the case which Deputy Moore made here when Resolution No. 4 was before the Dáil in Committee, in connection with the operation of the Imperial Preference duty.  Deputies will recollect that Deputy Moore pointed out that as a result of the new tax the duty payable upon a chassis imported direct from France, with the intention of having a body built here, would be higher than the duty on the same chassis if the body were built in England.  I would like to point out that the operation of this new tax is likely to have in another direction a bad effect upon the coach-building trade in this country.  Leaving the Imperial Preference out of the reckoning, we find that, assuming the cost of a chassis was £600, and the cost of a body, whether built in England or Ireland, was £150, when the importer brought in a completed car before the new duty went on, he paid in duty £50 out of the total outlay of £800.  That is, he found he would save one-sixteenth of the purchase price if he had the body built in the Free State.  Now, if he imports a completed car he pays £250 in duty, and if he imports the chassis only, he pays £200 in duty. Again, he saves £50 by having the body built here, but this time the total outlay is £1,000.  Thus he finds that now he saves only one-twentieth of the total price of the car, and consequently the inducement which he has to import a chassis and have the body built here, is lessened to that extent.  I do not think it was intended by the Minister in imposing the tax that it should operate as a reduction of the preference <Col N="912" /> given to the coach-building trade in the country.  If it is merely the intention to use it for the purpose of getting revenue, I think some provision should be inserted to ensure that even the preference that has already been given should be continued.  I would like if the Minister would tell us if the Government has taken into consideration the question of the abolition of the McKenna duties on cars, and if not, what particular advantage does the Free State get by retaining this preferential rate of duty, in view of the fact that practically two-thirds or more of the cars we buy come under the Imperial Preference rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the first point the matter is under consideration, that is the effect of Imperial Preference and the adding of a British-made body to, say, a French chassis. We are going into that with the Department of Industry and Commerce and I think we will be able to see that the position is kept right.  The Department of Industry and Commerce has certain powers as regards the amount of British labour there must be in any article to entitle it to Imperial Preference.  I think we will be able to fix that matter up, but I shall be able to speak more definitely on what we propose to do when the Committee Stage of the Bill comes along.  With reference to the second point, we propose to put in an amendment on the Committee Stage of the Bill providing that where a chassis alone is imported without a body attached, we will give three months' credit for duty, whereas if the chassis is imported with the body attached, the duty will have to be paid on entry.  We think that perhaps will meet the position of the coach-builders and make it at least as desirable for people to have an Irish body as before from every point of view.  We do that, because if we did not give credit the position would be that the man importing an entire vehicle could have the use of it immediately on paying the duty, whereas if he imported a chassis some time would be lost before an Irish body could be fitted and before he could have full use of the vehicle.  With reference to the question of Imperial <Col N="913" /> Preference that is a matter I think that is a fairly big consideration.  This is the only duty of any consequence in regard to which Imperial Preference operates, and one of the reasons why we retain it is that we have the Ford factory in Cork, which sends parts into Great Britain, where they are charged duty at the Imperial Preference rate. I do not say that it would necessarily follow that the British would refuse to give us that preference if we refused them, but possibly it might prejudice the situation for that factory.</P>
      <P>If we were to decide to do away with Imperial Preference in this matter it would be a fairly serious step in view of the position of Ford's in Cork, and the need they have, if they are to carry on at all, to send their parts into England at the Imperial Preference rates. I do not want to discuss that matter very fully unless Deputies at a later stage were anxious to have it discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if between this stage and the date on which the Bill will go before the House he would consider meeting the representatives of the Irish Glass Bottle Makers?  The reason I ask that is because I feel the Ministry are not <Col N="914" /> taking an attitude in this matter that is in strict accordance with the facts. For example, the Minister himself, when this matter was being discussed at a different stage, made a statement which indicated that he was viewing the matter of the remission of this duty on the manufacture of bottles in this country as a question of machinery against an antiquated method of manufacture.  Naturally, any person who takes a progressive view of things does not like to feel that he is siding with antiquated methods against new inventions.  If the issue here were one of machinery against the older and less efficient method, there would be no question whatever as to what side an ordinary individual would take.  But it is not so.  As has been indicated, the bottles which will be imported free of tax, the bottles which are not being manufactured or will not be manufactured now by the Irish Glass Bottle Company, are mainly manufactured in England and Scotland by the very same methods by which they would be manufactured here.  That is by hand or by hand-fed machines.  I am confirmed in my impression that the Ministry are not correctly informed in this matter both by the fact that the receivers who are in charge of the factory and the manager of the factory with whom they have no doubt consulted, have no practical experience of the making of bottles by hand or by hand-fed machines.  Deputy Beckett, who spoke on this matter on the last day, and who was himself at one time engaged in the glass bottle-making business, made a statement that showed he also was misinformed. I would like to make a statement with regard to what he said for the purpose of putting him right.  He said that: &ldquo;Deputy Lemass proceeded to discuss the question of unemployment amongst the bottle-makers, which every Deputy deplores, but in his discussion he wandered into fields of employment in which the bottle-makers in either the Irish Glass Bottle Company or the Ringsend Bottle Company never worked.  He started off by mentioning ink bottles.&rdquo;  Then he added, further: &ldquo;There have been no crib bottles made in Ringsend for the last fifteen years,&rdquo;<Col N="915" /> and in connection with those bottles he said, &ldquo;nor are they ever likely to be made.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since last Friday I got into touch with the representatives of the bottle workers for the purpose of finding out whether Deputy Beckett was correct in the statement he made that there had never been any crib bottles made in Ringsend for the last 15 years, or whether my statement was correct.  As a proof that Deputy Beckett's statement is not correct, I would like to point out that the receivers of the company, early in this year, stated that they were prepared to extend the manufacture of crib bottles here only that they were unable to secure competent workmen, skilled in the manufacture of crib bottles.  That statement was communicated by an official of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Glass Bottle Makers' Protection Society, and they prepared a list of their members who were skilled in the manufacture of crib bottles and transmitted the list to that official.  But so far nothing has been heard of it, and these men have not been employed.  I feel perhaps that Deputy Beckett may have been confused by the particular term I used.  In their trade &ldquo;bottle maker&rdquo; and &ldquo;crib worker&rdquo; are two distinct classes, and when he says that the bottle makers in the Ringsend works have never been employed at this particular type of work, he would be, perhaps, correct in saying so under ordinary conditions. The bottle makers were not employed at that work.  The crib makers were.  I used the term &ldquo;bottle makers&rdquo; to indicate the men who made bottles.  Apart from that, the men employed in the Ringsend works at crib work were bottle makers and members of the Bottle Makers' Union.  They were skilled bottle makers, who happened to be skilled crib workers as well.  Deputy Beckett also said, in connection with the three skilled workers who were brought over from Scotland to train the local workers here in operating the Foster machines, the hand-fed machine, that they made large quantities of bottles on that machine.  He added: &ldquo;Might I ask Deputy Lemass, if he has any further interest in the matter, what <Col N="916" /> became of these bottles that these men were paid wages for making?  I think he will find, if he makes as careful an investigation as I did, that not one of the bottles they made was ever sold or was saleable.&rdquo;  I was interested in the matter, and since Friday last I did make inquiries, and I was supplied with the name of the firm in Dublin that bought these bottles, and the only complaint they made about them was that when they wished to repeat their order they were unable to do so.</P>
    <P>The letter I read was a declaration made by the three Scottish experts that they were prevented by the manager of the works from carrying out the work for which they were brought over here, that is to train the local workers in the utilisation of this machine.  They made that statement in the most definite manner, and Deputy Beckett referred to it as being somewhat fishy or doubtful, and he deplored the fact that it was referred to in this House at a time when the subject of it was to be discussed between the receivers of these two companies and the men involved, including the three Scotchmen.  That meeting took place on Saturday, and it may be of interest to Deputy Beckett and other Deputies to know that the local Bottle Workers' Protection Society were put to the expense, in order to insure that they would be able to prove the facts alleged, of bringing these three Scotch experts from Scotland and paying their expenses and paying them for their loss of time while here.  They had to take the local workers also involved in the incident and pay them for the loss of time.  The whole lot of them came to meet the receivers on Friday last.  The meeting began at 12 o'clock, and the first thing one of the receivers (the Chairman) intimated to them was that the meeting would end at 1 o'clock.  In fact it did end at a quarter past 1.  At the meeting the manager of the works made a statement concerning the incident, and the men concerned were all there; and every one of them adhered to his original statement, and said it was their opinion that the manager of the works was not interested in the operation of the machine, and was not anxious that the machine should be successful.  The meeting ended at a quarter past 1, and they gave the men <Col N="917" /> no adequate opportunity of expressing their views of what the attitude of the manager had been.  In view of these facts and the other definite statements which have been made concerning the manufacture of glass bottles here in this country by the unemployed workers, I think that there should be some investigation of the matter before this Resolution is embodied in the Bill. Remember this Irish Glass Bottle Company is operating on a State guarantee. The State is financially involved in its success, and we believe that so far as it is manufacturing bottles by machinery, bottles of which very large quantities are required, there is no reason why it should not be a success.  But for some reason the receivers and managers of the company appear to be definitely prejudiced against the manufacture of bottles which they say cannot be economically manufactured on the machine and which can be manufactured by hand.  So the workers involved maintain, I believe.  A circular has been sent to all Deputies in this matter in which these men state that they were prepared either to lease or to buy the Ringsend factory for the purpose of manufacturing bottles by hand and putting in hand-fed machines. The Ringsend factory was purchased by the Irish Glass Bottle Company some some time ago for £5,000.</P>

      <P>Let us say £12,000. I will take it the Minister is right and that the workers are wrong.  Let us say that the factory was purchased by the company for £12,000.  It was equipped with a considerable amount of plant, including a motor car which, I think, was in fairly new condition and which was purchased some time ago for £1,000.  The company offered to lease the factory to the workers for an annual rental of £1,000, and subsequently they offered to sell it for £12,500.  It would have taken another <Col N="918" /> £10,000 or £12,000 to put into the factory the barest minimum of equipment to enable it to start working.  The company may have been quite within their rights in demanding that sum for the factory.  Any Deputy who may have had an opportunity of seeing the factory will agree with me that it is a heap of ruins, and some day, perhaps, the Inspector of Buildings on behalf of the Dublin Corporation will order it to be taken down.  At present it is in a dilapidated condition and, stripped of its equipment, as it is to a large extent, it is certainly not worth £12,000.</P>
      <P>Presuming it is, we all want to see the manufacture of bottles proceeded with in this country, and before we take action in regard to the removal of a tariff we should be satisfied that the manufacture of these bottles can be proceeded with economically.  The workers say it can.  Several people who have studied the matter are convinced that it can.  The Irish Glass Bottle Company do not appear to be convinced that it can, but, merely to ensure the success of their own business, they are anxious to preserve their monopoly.  Whether they should retain that monopoly and whether the State should assist them in retaining it is another matter.  The matter we must consider as representatives of the people is whether or not we should take the action which this Resolution proposes that we should take.  I do not want to press it any further than this, that the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, or some representative of the Government, should meet the representatives of the workers to discuss the matter in all its details before the Finance Act is introduced.</P>

      <P>In regard to this particular question of the Ringsend Works, and apart altogether from the dispute between Deputy Lemass and Deputy Beckett, about which I know nothing, I want to say that there have been negotiations going on for quite a long time as between the particular bottle workers who are concerned in this memorandum which was circulated to Deputies and the receivers of the factory at Ringsend.  I do not know <Col N="919" /> any body of men who have been more sympathetically treated by the receivers than that particular section of workers. Meeting after meeting has been held, letter after letter written to them explaining the position, and intermediaries in the form of officials of my own Department have gone from time to time and have held meetings, sometimes of the bottle workers alone, and at other times of the bottle workers and the receivers, in order to try to bring both parties to an agreement, in order to find out if there is any possibility of certain lines of bottles being manufactured in this country by hand, and if there is any possibility of the workers' guarantees being tested that they can get sufficient capital to start the particular premises which they hope to lease from the glass bottle people and proceed to manufacture a certain line of bottles on their own.  An enumeration of all the letters written, and the records that I have here with regard to meetings held from time to time, will prove my contention that no body of people has been so sympathetically treated by the receivers than those particular bottle workers.</P>

      <P>The bottle workers certainly were emphatic that they received sympathetic treatment from the Department of Industry and Commerce. I would not agree with you about the receivers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine my remarks to the treatment they received from the receivers, leaving my own officials out for the moment.  At meetings which they had with the receivers, and at meetings held under the chairmanship of officials of my own Department, and of which I have records and their accounts, I repeat that I do not know of any body of workers more sympathetically received or whose claims were examined in such detail and with such sympathy as those people. And they have been brought a long way.  I remember when I received at least one of the two men who have signed this document and two others. I received those three persons at one time, and they were introduced to me by Mr., then Deputy, Johnson.  At that <Col N="920" /> time the contention of these people was that it was the introduction of machinery into the bottle business that had ruined bottle-making all over the world.  That was three years ago, and that was their attitude&mdash;that it was the introduction of machienry that had ruined bottle-making in all countries in the world.  They claimed that wherever the machine was installed there was a failure, and I think they committed themselves to that in writing.  Now they have been brought along by process of reasoning and getting certain arguments and figures put before them until they have, within the last year, abandoned that contention.  They have been going on the basis that there are certain types of bottles which can be more economically manufactured by hand and by the hand-fed machine than by the complete machine process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing resolves itself into this: the glass bottle factory is subsidised by the Government to a very big extent. They are working on a Government guarantee and they are operating under a tariff.  They have every advantage, and we put it to them that, having every advantage, it was their duty to see that every class of worker who could be employed would be given the fullest opportunity of getting employment, and I believe they have tried to meet us fairly, recognising the consideration that they have got in very many ways from the Government. But it came to this in the end, that the bottle people themselves did not believe that economically, even as a side-line to the bigger business, they could run the manufacture, even by the semi-automatic process of the hand-fed machine, of certain types of bottles. They were being importuned from all sides, being the only factory here, that they should manufacture every type of bottle.  If I were asked, merely from the point of view of saving State money, would I say that the tariff be continued as it is at present or with the modification proposed in the Financial Resolution now under discussion, I would have no hesitation in saying on which side I would come down.  Undoubtedly it embarrasses the factory to be asked to produce certain bottles, because they believe they have responsibility <Col N="921" /> in the country to produce all types called for, and there are certain side-lines which, even when they load the charges on these against overhead charges on the other types of manufacture which are economical and profitable, they cannot manufacture economically. They were therefore prepared to abandon them.  They have asked to be relieved of the necessity of manufacturing certain types, and from the point of view of its reaction on the factory and, consequently, the security of the State's money, I would have no hesitation in asking, even in pleading vehemently, for this modification of the tariff.  There was, then, the other side of the question.  The bottle workers said: &ldquo;Very well, test us; let us get facilities and we will guarantee to make, and to make to the needs of the public in Ireland.&rdquo;  Certain negotiations were started, and they complain in this memorandum that they were asked for an exorbitant rent. They say that the factory was purchased for £5,000.  It was not.  That particular end of it was purchased for £12,000&mdash;£5,000 cash and shares to the extent of £7,000 more.  But what stands against that particular factory is a sum of £12,000, not £5,000 at all; £5,000 was only the cash end, but there were other accommodations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There was a factory at a particular time.  It had certain things.  There was a factory in a particular state.  I know nothing about this motor truck that is talked about; I do not remember it occurring in the statement of assets that came when the guarantee was under discussion. I have not got the guarantee papers here; it may have been there. But after that factory was purchased £5,000 cash was paid, and liabilities to the extent of £7,000, and some hundreds of pounds by shares as a liability also existed.  The people themselves put an additional sum of about £10,000 into it.  They put £13,000 extra into it in the provision of new plant and machinery.  And in the place that is now described as &ldquo;derelict&rdquo; there <Col N="922" /> was in the books of the company value to the extent of £26,000.  Negotiations were entered into with the men.  They said distinctly: &ldquo;We do not want these machines in this place.  We are not going to operate these machines; we are going to operate by the hand process or the semi-automatic process.  Take your old machines away.  There is your air compressor; we do not want that.&rdquo; This is all subject to correction.  I am stating the case as it was put to me. There were certain negotiations and it came to this, that the receivers were asked to remove from the premises certain property.  They did so, and they left the place in what they thought was a suitable condition for the men to operate the hand process.  They had to look at what was left and say: &ldquo;How does this stand in our books?  Where are our commitments to the shareholders and to the Government we have incurred liabilities with?&rdquo; and they make a strict calculation as to the rent they ought to charge.  I believe that if they had come to myself or to the Minister for Finance and asked leave to rent it at the amount that was put up, we would have looked at it in this way: if it amounted to a weakening of the assets of the firm we would have come along to the workers and asked for a new guarantee, and we might have shifted some of the burden of the old guarantee to the workers if they had put up a good proposition.  But, certainly, as a transaction between the factory and the bottle-workers we could not allow that place to be leased at less than the £1,000 that it was decided to ask for it.  I do not know that possibly £10,000 might not be taken if what was supposed to be put up was a proposition for a sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard a sum of £12,500 mentioned. I think that eventually came to £10,000, but I am not disputing it. But remember, receivers are receivers; they have their liabilities to certain people.  They had to look at the whole transaction, viewing this from their own position as receivers on behalf of certain people; and we were at their back, ready to pounce on them if they carried out what we thought was a bad bit of business.  There was State money there; there were certain assets <Col N="923" /> on which money was put up, and we had to see, if that was put forward as a business proposition and likely to be accepted, that assent would be required from some Department of the Government, whether my own or that of the Minister for Finance, I cannot say, but that of the Minister for Finance in the end, probably through my Department.  But any offers that were made broke down in the end.  I cannot convict the receivers of any harsh dealing with the men in so far as the transactions necessary either to the renting or the selling of the concern was concerned, and when people are speaking of that they should remember that the people in question are only receivers, and they have very definite responsibilities before the Dáil in regard to certain moneys that were lent.  I am prepared to meet this particular body of workers in the interval between the passage of this Resolution to-night and the bringing forward of the Bill, even although I say that this file is simply a mass of records of previous meetings at which I had tried to explain the position, tried to point out to them that where a factory having a profitable line of business was unable to operate the smaller line economically, they are not likely to operate the smaller line and make a business success of it when the other line has failed.</P>
    <P>If my Department, being in some supervisory capacity over the factory, were asked: &ldquo;What do you think is the best thing to render more secure the Government money in that factory?&rdquo; I would say unhesitatingly: &ldquo;Modify the bottle tax as proposed in this resolution,&rdquo; because it must be viewed entirely from the business end. There is the other element.  The tariff has been there for two years; it has been well-known that the bottle factory has been anxious to get rid of the unremunerative end&mdash;of the smaller type of bottle.  The workers have tried to get people to give them the capital to buy the concern, and working capital. They say that they have been unable to get a certain amount.  But it has been rather widely advertised from various sources that this end of <Col N="924" /> the business was open to anybody who liked to come in, that there was a tariff there to protect that, and nobody has come in, although the tariff has been in operation for two years.  We have in fact a two years' test of this end of the tariff, under which we cannot get any work done.  I would be prepared to receive the workers again to find out if they had got any new proposition. But if they are going to put to me all the things in the Memorandum that have already been put up, I do not think such a meeting would serve any useful purpose except to get these people to realise that we are sympathetically disposed towards them, but that we will not go to the point of doing an unbusinesslike thing, of making that factory a burden with a particular line that is unbusinesslike and uneconomic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact I want to stress is that these bottles from which it is proposed to remove the tax&mdash;that is, I take it, every bottle not manufactured by the Irish Glass Bottle Company&mdash;were made for many years in this country economically by the same process by which they are still made throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers who made them are still here and are available.  They have been unemployed for a long time, living in the hope that they could induce the only firm still in the business&mdash;the Irish Glass Bottle Company&mdash;to undertake the manufacture of these bottles by hand or by hand-fed machines.  Now, the removal of this tariff will practically remove their last hope of getting employment in this country.  No doubt a lot of what the Minister has said is true.  It sounds convincing, but I think the possibility of any factory, and the construction, as they suggest, of an eight-hole furnace that will give work to about 48 men in the manufacture of bottles specified in that particular memorandum might be considered, and if necessary the facilities which were given to the Irish Glass Bottle Company could also, to a lesser extent, be given to these workers.  It is that matter I now wish to discuss.  I believe if this tariff goes off there will be no necessity for ever putting it on again.  The skilled workers here will drift to other <Col N="925" /> trades or will emigrate.  The possibility of these bottles ever being manufactured here will be removed, and it is for that reason that I would like to see every possible effort made to ensure the manufacture of bottles by these men in this country before finally deciding to remove the tariff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go every step of the way with Deputy Lemass. We put on this tariff; we thought it was going to be successful with regard to bottle-making.  It is with a considerable amount of reluctance that we ask the Dáil to let us retrace our steps, even on portion of the tariff.  Experience has taught us a certain amount with regard to it.  If there is any prospect of the extra bottles being made it would be quite easy to keep the tariff on.  As a matter of fact, if the tariff is kept on, and if the glass bottle factory is not to be asked to turn from lines it considers profitable to this unprofitable line, there will be a certain amount of right in keeping it on, and we would be prepared to do it if we could be shown that there is any likelihood of this type of bottle being manufactured here immediately or in a year or so.  There has been no case shown. I would be glad to meet the workers with Deputy Lemass if he believes that there is any possibility of a case being made that certain people will get employment, that certain people will manufacture in a way that the bottles can be sold commercially.  I will meet them between this and the bringing in of the Bill.  The Deputy asked me a specific question about the types of bottles that were made here at one time. I do not think very much argument can be drawn from that.  The conditions have changed.</P>

      <P>This is a proposal to remit a certain entertainments tax.  The entertainments tax as far as I understand it, was a war measure, introduced in 1915.  The war, I believe, is over for the past ten years, <Col N="927" /> and therefore the conditions which prompted the introduction of the tax have long since disappeared.  In the neighbouring country, Great Britain, this tax was abolished some years ago in respect of the lower prices, but instead of finding relief from this tax in this country extra taxes have been imposed in the shape of duties on imported films and for the maintenance of a film censorship.  In consideration of this tax and the people it affects it is just as well that we should ask why it is singled out for consideration.</P>

      <P>There are a lot of foreign firms doing business here, and, from the point of view of income tax and ease in assessing income tax, it is desirable that they should register as separate companies here, as we do not want to encourage the doing of business through individuals, whose affairs are much more difficult, and they have not the same obligation in regard to accounting.  It is felt that we should not do anything to discourage the actual companies, the foreign firms, who are obliged to comply with certain requirements which make it comparatively easy to collect the tax.  That, however, is not the real point.  What we are getting at in this Resolution is really the company which has a large number of Irish shareholders, which owns substantial property here, and on which, under present circumstances, you cannot get death duties.  We are actually aiming at going beyond that. The whole question of foreign companies is under consideration, and we do propose to take certain steps that will get us the equivalent of death duties in all cases.  But that is a bigger and more intricate problem, and for the present we are only dealing with that class of company which has a substantial number of Irish shareholders, and substantial property here, and on which at present, owing to the operations of the existing scheme of double taxation relief, we do not get any taxation at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that other foreign companies which may not have any Irish shareholders do constitute a problem.  Let me suppose for a moment that we have a firm making woollens here on a very large scale that is owned by a dozen people living in England&mdash;that they own the shares.  In the course of a generation the whole of these dozen people will die, and that entire property will pass to their successors.  We would get no death duties on that.  Although the property will be nominally situated in England, because the company is registered there, and the shares held there, the actual physical property that would pass would be situated here, and <Col N="931" /> we should get death duties.  We are considering a scheme which will enable us to get death duties in such a case.</P>
    <P>But the case of these companies is not at all so glaring or at present so important or urgent as the one which we are proposing to deal with in this particular way.  That is, when a company has property situated here, has large numbers of shareholders here, but is actually registered in England, and is an English company, in that case we, in many instances, fail to get death duties at all.  Take the firm of Guinness, for instance.  If a person in Dublin who had a large holding in Guinness's, and practically no other estate, died, we will get absolutely no death duty whatever.  Suppose he had some estate situated here, we would get a small fraction of the death duties, but it might be very little, because the additional estate might not raise the rate on the whole very much above the rate it would be charged on the Guinness's part of it, if that were taken separately. The result is that the British tax leviable on the Guinness's portion would be only a small amount less than the whole tax, and we, under the existing system of double taxation relief, which works fairly enough in general, would have to repay the amount to the British Government that the executors of that person had to pay, and we would get practically no tax.</P>
    <P>We simply set out in this Resolution to deal with the one problem and the more glaring problem.  Probably in another year further proposals on the whole matter of getting the equivalent of death duties in regard to foreign companies will be dealt with, but we do not at present want to do more than compel those companies which can establish Colonial Registers to establish them, and let us get the death duties that will come to us if they set them up.  Take the case of Guinness's again as an example.  If they had a Colonial Register here, and the person whom I cited, who had a large holding and was domiciled here, died, and his shares were on the Saorstát Register, they would be deemed to be property situated here, no British death duties would be charged on them and we <Col N="932" /> would get the entire amount.  We are only out in the present resolution to compel companies, which have Saorstát shareholders and are carrying on business here, to establish a register here that will give us the death duties in respect of the holdings of these Saorstát shareholders.  We are not out to deal with what is a bigger problem and, in some ways, a more difficult problem, but one which is under investigation. If the companies set up a Register and if all these people were outside the country, we would gain nothing.  The Register would be a register but there would be no entries, and there would be no point in regard to that.  We are not proposing to tackle in this the whole question of foreign companies, although that is under consideration.  We are dealing only with one aspect of it.  There may be certain difficulties in establishing a Register if there were no names, and we do not want to put difficulty in the way of a company at present until we have considered the matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I would like to say one thing.  As far as income-tax is concerned the thing operates both ways, as the Deputy will understand.  For instance, take the Great Northern Railway Company, which might earn all its profit in Northern Ireland.  I am not saying that is so, but we would get all the income-tax, so that as far as income-tax is concerned we have the advantages in regard to wealthy individuals under the present arrangement, which cancel out the disadvantages of the income-tax side.  But so far as estate duties go, we recognise it is a very urgent matter, <Col N="933" /> to which we are giving careful consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to deal with that whole thing, and there is a definite question there.  The real question is, all along the line, simply the estate duty, because the present system of double-tax relief is really advantageous to us. We get more income-tax under the present system for relief of double income-tax than we did under the old system prior to the agreement of 1926, whereby we would have got half the income-tax and the British the other half from those companies subject to double-tax, when each country would have given relief as to half.  The present arrangement, so far as income-tax is concerned, is advantageous to this country, so you may leave it out of account so far as revenue is concerned. The real position is, we do not get death duties when the actual property in these concerns passes from one individual to another at death.  That is a problem we want to deal with as a whole.  We do not want to put impositions on these companies in any sort of haphazard way.  We are examining methods of dealing with the whole estates duties problem; but here is one simple aspect where you put no particular burden on the company at all.  We would simply secure for the Saorstát Exchequer death duties that ought to be coming to it and that are at present going into the British Exchequer.  We are imposing no burden at all upon any company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. TUBRIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>At the adjournment last night I referred very briefly to the educational recommendations made in the White Paper.  I do not know whether the Minister for Education was in the House or not.  I shall refer again very briefly to them.  One was that the Irish colleges should be confined to the Gaeltacht, for the reason that they will benefit the teachers that go there, and for that reason.  I think, will benefit the Gaeltacht.  I also referred to school meals and the necessity for applying them before the Compulsory Act is enforced; to the <Col N="935" /> Training College in Galway, and to the advisability of having an Irish library in each National School, and to the objectionable proposal made by the Minister for Finance that the poor pupils in the Preparatory Schools should be clothed.  I think it would finish the Preparatory Schools if there is any trace of pauperism or charity about them.  It will be better to give scholarships, even if they were only for £10.  The Minister for Agriculture, in dealing with this question, admitted that most of the recommendations were merely palliatives, and that it was merely palliative treatment.  I also intend to refer to the palliatives mentioned by the Minister for Agriculture. The first is the Housing Grants which are not availed of in the Gaeltacht for the reason that the schemes are not suitable.  There should be a reversion to the housing schemes in force under the Congested Districts Board by which grants were made for roofs and additions to ordinary houses.  In the island of Bofin, which is in the Gaeltacht, the roofs that were put on by the Congested Districts Board have now gone rotten, and these people cannot avail of the housing grants at present, and I think there should be a reversion to the old system of giving grants for roofs, and for the purpose of making additions.  The Claddagh is the only portion of Galway that I would call Gaillimh.  A scheme should be started for re-building in the Gaeltacht, and I think this should apply to the Claddagh in Galway City.  The urban council or some other body there are getting a grant, and I hear that this body has shown itself to be an anti-Irish body, and is going to use that grant, not in the Gaeltacht, but to beautify other portions of the city for the benefit of the tourist.  I presume they will leave the Claddagh as it was, to be visited and seen by the tourists as a sort of native kraal.  Ministers come down as well as tourists, and look at the Claddagh from a char-a-banc point of view&mdash;a very old traditional place, and that sort of thing, where the traditions of the Gael have remained.  But it is a most insanitary spot, and the one place in Galway where buildings should be down.  One <Col N="936" /> of the things mentioned was a central depot that should be set up as soon as possible.  I attributed the failure of the lace schools at Galway to want of a central depot.  The manageresses at places like Carraroe, Rossmuck, Tirconaill and Kerry, find it difficult to travel to get sales for stuff, and at the same time to run small establishments.</P>
      <P>I think that when a central depôt is started in Dublin with a manager to look after supplies and sales that these lace and knitting schools will become a paying proposition.  There is another point and it is with regard to reafforestation. The Minister for Agriculture tries to have it both ways.  He is reported to have said that reafforestation is no good in the Gaeltacht because the land is not suitable, but when he brings in his Forestry Bill he says that he wants land of very little agricultural value for it.  The land in the Gaeltacht is suitable for reafforestation and for nothing else.  Estates owned by Mr. Benidge.  Screen; Mr. Bruce Ismay, and one by Ranji, as well as lands in various other places in the West are well planted.  Therefore, I do not see why a scheme of afforestation could not be started in Connemara.  It is really the only thing feasible in these places.  Carrigeen and kelp are not dealt with very much in this White Paper.  Some years ago I got into touch with some firms in New York.  The highest price we got for carrigeen was £75 a ton.  All it brings in the Gaeltacht is a shilling a stone.  It has to undergo certain processes before you get such a big price as £75 a ton. Thirty pounds or forty pounds a ton is about the usual price.  I think some steps should be taken by the Government to see that these processes are carried out.  Steps should also be taken to see if it would be possible to set up a kelp factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing said about a mineralogical survey.  We know that there is limestone in the Gaeltacht.  We know that there are lead quarries, marble, granite and limestone quarries in Connemara.  We are not induced to believe from this Report that anything is going to be done in the direction of developing these quarries.  One thing that is mentioned in connection with <Col N="937" /> migration in this Report is the peat-cutting industry.  There is a very extensive area of turf in South Connemara, but it is impossible to get at it except by boat.  The piers along the south coast have fallen down.  I asked the Minister for Fisheries some time ago if he would consider the advisability of rebuilding some of these piers, especially the one at Knock.  If that pier were rebuilt 50 boatmen would get employment, while hundreds of people would be employed in the turf cutting.  These of course are what the Minister for Agriculture would call palliatives for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The two most important items in the Gaeltacht Report are shelved completely in the White Paper.  One is migration, and the second fisheries. There was a debate here some time ago on the motion to amalgamate the Land Commission with the Department of Fisheries and on putting the Gaeltacht in charge of the Department of Fisheries. I objected to that at the time. I was told by the Minister for Local Government that I was merely putting a red herring on the trail, and that I was not giving any reasons why the Department of Fisheries should not be put in charge of the Gaeltacht.  We all know that the Department of Fisheries is the most inefficient Department in this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. TUBRIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraphs 64, 65, 66 and 67 in the White Paper refer to the Department of Fisheries and the development of the fishing industry. Three of these paragraphs were referred back for the report of the Technical Commission.  From what I saw in the report of the Technical Commission it appears to me that those who produced it were not aware of the conditions in the Gaeltacht.  Paragraph 67, which in my opinion was the important one and which dealt with the giving of boats to the fishermen, was completely shelved.  I object to the <Col N="938" /> Department of Fisheries being put in charge of the Gaeltacht, not alone for their inefficiency, but because I do not think it is possible for them to co-ordinate all the services and work out the recommendations made in the Report of the Commission.  Leaving that out for the moment, I wish to refer to the question of the fisheries.  It is not so much what the Department of Fisheries did not do as what they actually did that I have to complain of.  Quite recently there was a fishing fleet with quite a number of people fishing from Quilty up to Roundstone and along the Western coast to Mayo and Galway. There was one boat in Quilty, in West Clare, and a boat fishing in Arran. The fishing in these places is now practically dead.  Some time ago the boats that these fishermen had were taken up by the Department of Fisheries. The boats were brought into Galway and into Donegal and other places and left there to rot.  One place in Donegal to which they were brought is known locally as the &ldquo;graveyard.&rdquo;  In Galway they took up the boats from the fishermen.  No matter what the fishermen did with the boats it would have paid the Department much better to have left the boats with them.  They are now selling the boats.  &ldquo;The Zulu&rdquo; was sold for 14/-, the &ldquo;St. Keelan&rdquo; for 10/-, the &ldquo;Mary Joseph&rdquo; for 15/-, and the &ldquo;Shamrock&rdquo; for £13 10s.

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but surely the matters that he is now referring to could be raised more appropriately on the Estimate for the Department of Fisheries.

      <NameTxt>Dr. TUBRIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just mentioning a few little things to prove that this Department is not in any way an ideal one.  There is a marine store in Galway owned by one of the Departments of the Government, and in order to keep on to the stuff which they refused to give out to the fishermen they put creosote on the nets and materials they had in the marine store, and the result is that they are rotting, and the stuff they sent to Donegal had to be returned because it was rotten.  There is a boat called the Helga.  Yesterday we were told about fishing in Iceland.  If a boat is found entering the three mile limit with the gears not stored under the deck, a fine of £500 is imposed, with confiscation of the gear, and the skipper is held until the fine is paid. On leaving the bay if the gear is not stored before leaving the three mile limit, a fine of £700 is imposed, and the skipper is held until the fine is paid, <Col N="940" /> and the gear is confiscated.  We have a boat in Galway but there is no gun on it or wireless.  It never goes out at night.  As a matter of fact it has no searchlight, and it is known amongst the foreign trawlers as &ldquo;The Pouka.&rdquo; These trawlers have a system by which they wireless, and they can easily judge when &ldquo;The Pouka&rdquo; is coming along shore with the result that the boat is useless. It cost £9,500 last year, and the suggestion was seriously made to me by some fishermen in Arran that if it would be possible to get the crew of &ldquo;The Pouka&rdquo; to leave the boat and stay in the Railway Hotel, Galway, that they could take the boat and deal with the poaching trawlers.</P>

      <P>Previously when we were discussing this subject I was told that we had nothing constructive to put up.  Some time ago I did suggest that something should be done for the fisheries.  I did not leave the matter with the word &ldquo;something.&rdquo;  I put concrete proposals before the House. Nothing has been done, and I do not think anything will be done.  There is a man in Galway who owns a boat, and he would go out to fish if there were a bounty given.  There is no maji-fishing now in Galway or the West.  It would be very easy to induce fishermen to take part in maji-fishing in June. However, I do not think the Fisheries Department is a suitable body to deal with that.  The one industry in the Gaeltacht is the one thing that has been shelved.  The other is the migration question.  I for one found myself in thorough agreement with the Minister for Agriculture when he said, &ldquo;You must have migration.&rdquo;  There are over 80,000 Irish-speaking people in the Gaeltacht in Galway.  We cannot leave them there if we are to look at this as a national problem.  If we are to keep the language alive and to spread it throughout the country, these people must be migrated, and to undo the work of Cromwell you must have a movement from the West to the East. What are we offered?  A few jobs in the Civic Guards, a few positions as teachers, and things like that, and possibly <Col N="941" /> a residential school for the training of nursery maids.  The Minister agrees that migration is necessary to solve this problem.  He does not say that would solve it.  When I come to deal with migration, I find that in the old days five or six reasons were given as to why migration should not take place.</P>
      <P>The first reason is rather old, and they are forgetting to use it&mdash;that is, that the people were so fond of the rocks and the bogs that they would not leave Connemara or Tirconaill or the South, except for America.  Even if they were willing to go we find there is no land for them; that would be the second reason.  The third reason is that even if there was land and they would go, they would not be able to work the land.  The Minister for Agriculture made the point at a meeting in Galway that the people in the Gaeltacht were not accustomed to work the land, leaving out of consideration that these people do all the spring work and most of the autumn work when they migrate as labourers.  The most insidious attack against migration was made by the Minister for Finance when he said that if the people migrated they would have to get police protection. That is a dangerous thing to suggest. I never heard of people in the Gaeltacht looking for police protection.  I think that was a peculiar thing for the Minister for Finance to say.  It was a sort of incitement to people in other places to stand up against this migration. The fifth reason was that it was too costly, and the Minister for Finance gave us a sixth reason when he said that they would lose their Irish.  They lose their Irish in Boston and Chicago. That sort of excuse does not appeal to me or to anybody in the Gaeltacht.  It is a pity the Minister for Fisheries is not here, because the reason he gives is that Irish should spread from Dublin instead of from the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of migration, which is dealt with in paragraph 61 of the Report, and is the most important recommendation, is completely shelved in the White Paper.  You will never have an Irish-speaking Ireland unless you migrate some of those 80,000 who live in the Irish-speaking portion of Galway to spread the language.  You <Col N="942" /> might spread them along the Shannon, or it might be an ideal thing to start a colony outside Dublin.  Instead of this the alternative we are given is the scheme I referred to here before&mdash;the migration of what they call the Cluas Valley.</P>

      <P>Nobody knows what they are doing in the Cluas Valley.  It is a sort of secret way up in the mountains. It is a swamp led to by one road. It reminds me of Ali Baba and the Forty Robbers, and the pass-word is&mdash; mind you, this is a national question, and all parties should take part in the regeneration of the Gaeltacht&mdash;&ldquo;Cumann na nGaedheal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has been there, but I have not.  One of the reasons given by the Minister against migration to other parts of Ireland is that it would be too costly and that it would cost £700 in each case.  What will it cost in the case of each migrant in Cluas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. TUBRIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>What return will there be?  When you spend £700 and give them 25 acres nobody will go there. Experts tell me that it would cost £72 to produce an acre of potatoes, and you could only get £15 for the produce.  The Minister may dispute that, as he probably knows more about agriculture than I do.  At present the land there is only worth a few pence an acre, as it is unfit for anything except afforestation and turf.  It cannot be worked.  There are people working in the Cluas Valley and nobody knows what they are doing.  I wanted to get information from one prominent member of the Government Party as to what they were going to do in regard to that, and he answered: &ldquo;Do you think the Government are mad?&rdquo; That is the impression all around South Connemara about Cluas Valley.  Maam Valley is good for sheep, but the people who made money on sheep had plenty of mountain land.  I believe that ordinary people would starve there.  Some might go to Maam, but no one would go to Cluas.  If you want to look at the problem from an <Col N="943" /> economic point of view, and if you want to do something for the Irish language, you can carry out the recommendations in Paragraph 61, but leave out Paragraph 54.

      <P>Would you deal with the point that, for the purpose of migrating these tenants to other parts, you must decide that no one in the country must have more than a £50 valuation holding, and that any land over and above that must be taken for migrants?  What is your attitude on that?  A lot of local congests will have to forego their claims to land.</P>

      <P>We must ask the Minister to leave enough people there to carry on the traditions of the Gael. There are afforestation, the fisheries, granite, marble, kelp and other industries you can develop, and you will have plenty of room for the remainder of the people to migrate.  The plan of migrating them to the mountains is not going to turn out a success and it will simply be a waste of public money. There is very little land to be divided in the Gaeltacht.  There is Ardagh Farm and an odd bit of island here and there.  If the question is to be looked at from the national point of view, if we are to have the ideals of having this country Irish-speaking, and if we are to do something for the unfortunate <Col N="944" /> people who have to live in the Gaeltacht, make up your minds that money will be required to be spent.  Having done so consider the advisability of having a commission or some body that would co-ordinate all the various services, but do not hand over money and authority to a Ministry or Department that will eventually make a bigger mess of the problem than it has already done.</P>

      <P>Yesterday evening the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, speaking to this motion, made a characteristically caustic and witty remark that we have the habit of talking in this House about the Gaeltacht as if none of us ever lived there or saw the place, as if it were inhabited by a set of peculiar people, by a different race from ours.  I must say that the Minister for Finance, speaking earlier in the debate, rather gave colour to that remark. If I remember aright he said that he would hardly think it worth while to devote much attention to the Gaeltacht if it were not the sanctuary of the language and a repository of the Gaelic tradition.  Like Deputy Bryan Cooper I am one of those who got as far as the fifth book of O'Growney on two occasions, but I am unfortunately ignorant of the Irish language in any real sense.  If you say to me: &ldquo;John is going to the fair,&rdquo; I will repeat: &ldquo;Mary is going to the well.&rdquo; Unless you keep to the book I am afraid I would be unable to continue the conversation. I would not have intervened in this debate unless I had the qualifications of being a member for a Gaeltacht county, and that at one time I was a member of the Congested Districts Board.  Moreover, I have lived nearly all my life among the people of the Gaeltacht, and I do not speak of them as a foreign race or a strange or peculiar people.  I speak of them, not as one might speak of the ancient Irish elk, for instance, but as kindly neighbours whom I know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal in the resolution proposed by Deputy Fahy with which I can agree.  That resolution invites us to say that the Government proposals contained in the White Paper will not save the Gaeltacht, that the Government should produce a definite scheme, <Col N="945" /> and devote a specific sum of money to the problem.  So far as the first part of that resolution is concerned, I think it very much depends on the meaning you attach to the phrase, &ldquo;Save the Gaeltacht.&rdquo; I do not believe it is possible for anybody, either on the Government or Opposition Benches, to produce a complete solution, as the problem is far too tangled and difficult, but, so far as mere wording is concerned, I do not see that there is anything to which one could object in the general statement. Neither the Government's proposals nor any proposals, in my judgment, can completely solve that difficult problem which the economic condition of the Gaeltacht presents.  From the other part of the resolution, in so far as it suggests that the Government has not put forward a definite scheme, I would dissent.</P>
    <P>The third portion suggests that a specific sum should be available, and that we ought to know how it should be spent.  That is an old idea of my own, which I have expressed on several occasions.  I have said that I do not believe that there is any direct solution of the problem.  I am afraid that I am a little bit of a sceptic so far as the common views about migration and emigration are concerned.  I confess frankly that I do not believe in the possibility of a large scheme of migration, and I do not very much believe in the possibility of largely stemming the tide of emigration for two perfectly simple reasons.  In the first case, because the people will not go, and in the second case, because the people will go.  I do not believe, in spite of what Deputy Tubridy has said, that those who have practical experience of the Gaeltacht, have found, or will find, that any very large proportion of the people in the Gaeltacht are willing to leave the Gaeltacht for any place except America.  That is a queer psychological fact which I believe to be true of the Gaeltacht.  To America, on the other hand, they will go.  It is not by any means, as is sometimes suggested, merely a question of unemployment. Only within the last week or two I had this matter very forcibly brought before my mind by hearing that a young boy who is assured of <Col N="946" /> continuous employment, and who was living with his family, is emigrating. He has an elder brother who is running a successful motoring business. Yet nothing could stop him from going to America.  The lure of that country outweighed every other consideration. By all means, let us make the Gaeltacht a more attractive place for young and old to live in, but I think we are only deluding ourselves if we suppose that anything we can do is going, permanently and finally to stop emigration.</P>
    <P>I say that I do not believe in heroic remedies for the Gaeltacht.  What moral do I draw from that?  By no means a conclusion of despair, but rather one of hope.  I believe that when you approach the problem of the Gaeltacht, you must not despise the day of small things.  I think that there is a certain danger in the line taken by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture yesterday.  I agree with nine-tenths of his speech.  I agreed, as I always do, with the general tenor of his speech, but there were parts of it in which he was a little inclined to minimise what could be done by particular agencies.  He was a little inclined to think that because you could not solve the entire problem in any one way, it could not be solved at all because, as he said, fisheries by themselves would only provide for a very small number of people in the Gaeltacht, and that because industries in themselves could only touch the fringe of the problem, you could not solve it. I thought that there was a certain danger in that line of argument, that other people might conclude that these things were not worth attention.  I do not believe that to be true at all.  In the first place, I believe that, whatever dispute there may be as to the number of people you can bring out of the Gaeltacht from their present congested holdings, and the number of people whose farms you can enlarge in the Gaeltacht, you must always have a sufficiently large number of people in the poorest parts of the Gaeltacht, to make it necessary to bring every possible agency to bear if you intend to improve their condition.  By doing <Col N="947" /> that, I believe you can enormously improve it.</P>
    <P>My colleague from Tirconaill, Deputy Carney, who never addresses the House without giving it amusement and instruction, defended the people of the Gaeltacht in general, and of Tirconaill in particular, against the charge, which I hope nobody really had made, of being thriftless and lazy.  I do not believe anybody who is conversant with the conditions of life in the Gaeltacht could believe either of those things.  I do not think that people who are either thriftless or lazy could possibly live on the land there, and the fact that they have managed to live there is plenary proof that they are neither thriftless nor lazy. I can speak for one portion of Donegal, Glen Colmcille, which, with Gortahork, is one of the most purely Irish-speaking districts in the country.  I do not always agree with statistics about the percentage of Irish speakers, but I think there is no question that the people there are purely Irish speakers. I know of no district in which you will find, taking the size of the farms, such good farming and such a smiling landscape as in that area.  They have combinations of industry there.  Their little farms are no better, perhaps worse, than many others of a similar kind in other districts which do not present the same happy appearance.  To what, then, do I attribute the fact of their well-being?  Partly to their admirable character, but also in part to the fact that they have kept alive in that district a home industry, namely, homespuns. It may mean very little money. The women, up to some time ago, could sell their webs in London.  I am sorry to say that the business has become somewhat disorganised.  The women have to go to other parts of the country, carrying webs on their backs, and selling at prices far below what they got some years ago.  I hope, as a result of the activities of the Minister for Fisheries in that particular area, that we shall see that industry re-organised, but even as it is the amount of money brought into that district by industry has a very considerable effect.  One of the matters I want to impress upon the Government is that they should not, <Col N="948" /> because one of those things will not save the Gaeltacht, neglect any one of them. They should not despise any agency which will help.  It is quite true that the fisheries on our coasts, compared with the fisheries in other countries, are very small beer.</P>
    <P>It is not very many years ago when a fish buyer told me that he had paid at one little pier in Donegal, and by no means one of the most important, in one season £20,000 for herrings.  You may say that £20,000 is not an enormous sum in the national economy, but when you remember that the total valuation of the whole union, the lands and houses of the whole union in which that little pier is situated, is exactly £21,000, and when you find that in one little pier that £20,000 worth of fish has passed from the fishermen into the hands of one fish buyer in one season, then you begin to ask may there not be something in the development of that industry as a contribution to this problem; is it not well worth considering? On the other three points I shall not enlarge.  That matter has been raised by the Minister for Agriculture, the improvement of stock, to which he has nobly contributed; the improvement of land by afforestation, the planting of shelter belts, drainage and reclamation, in regard to which I was very glad to hear the Minister for Finance promise the aid of that money which he has under his control and which is needed on a considerable scale if that work is to be undertaken successfully.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the last word I have to say.  As the Minister has said, the kernel undoubtedly of the motion is that the Government should set aside a specific sum for the development of the Gaeltacht.  The Minister for Finance has said that he considered that matter sympathetically.  I know that he has considered it sympathetically, and it is quite obvious that the Minister for Finance, whatever one's quarrel with him from time to time may be, has his heart in the Gaeltacht, and is perfectly sincere when he says that the development and the preservation of the Gaeltacht is his chief political object.  I accept that statement. All I ask the Government is this, to tell us a little more as to their policy.  We accept generally their <Col N="949" /> scheme, but I would like to know a little more of the details and exactly the machinery by which they propose to carry out their schemes for the Gaeltacht.  I accept their conclusion that there is to be nothing in the nature of the old Congested Districts Board. I accept their conclusion that the matter is to be best discharged by the Ministry of Fisheries.  I accept reluctantly the decision of the Minister for Finance against the provision of any specific sum for some of the work. I accept that.  But that being so I ask the Government to give us more details than we have had yet, because this matter has been under consideration now for a year.  As far as I am concerned I am still somewhat vague as to what is the actual machinery by which the Government proposes to carry on there.  I still do not know in relation to finance whether the sums at the disposal of the Ministry of Fisheries and the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture are to be increased for the purpose of giving the Gaeltacht services that are not given elsewhere.  I do not know what the conditions are.  The Minister for Finance might say exactly what the scale is to be, and whether it is to be a separate department.  Again, I do not know whether the Ministry is to be free to spend that money for the purposes of the Gaeltacht without Treasury control, somewhat in the same manner as the old Congested Districts Board.  I make these observations in no spirit of hostility to the Minister and certainly in no spirit of hostility towards the Gaeltacht.  There has been no spirit of hostility towards the Gaeltacht from any side of the House.  I do make these observations in asking that before this debate concludes we may have some more definite and detailed statement of the manner in which the Government's proposals relating to the Gaeltacht are to be carried out.</P>

      <P>As one of the signatories to the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission, I do not care to let this debate pass without endeavouring to put briefly, and, I am sure the Dáil will be glad to hear, very briefly, what my conception is of the action of the Government towards the <Col N="950" /> recommendations that were put before them.  The Minister for Agriculture is invariably very clear when he adumbrates policy.  He told us last night the economic policy in the Gaeltacht&mdash; the Government's economic policy in the Gaeltacht.  It practically amounts to eternal agriculture.  A précis of his policy might be put something like this: better agricultural produce, increased agricultural produce and delayed industrial activity.  That is the policy that the Minister for Agriculture evidently intends to follow.  That is the policy he proposes and intends to carry out in the Gaeltacht, and it is just as well perhaps that we should see what was the effect of that consistent agricultural policy carried out in the Gaeltacht before the Ministry of Agriculture took over control of that particular department.  It is just as well that we should see during his control and previous to his control what has been effected by that policy.  I should like to be fair to the Minister, and if I am misunderstanding him or misquoting him I would be glad to be corrected. He said last night, in reply to Deputy Fahy: &ldquo;There was a suggestion that industries should be started in his neighbourhood; that was an entirely different matter.  It was an attempt to deal with it as a commercial proposition. He did agree that it was an attempt that would possibly succeed, but if they did all these things, how much better off would a man be in ten years?&rdquo; Later on he asked, &ldquo;What were the traditional industries of the Gaeltacht which Deputy Fahy said they must get back to?  Was it not a fact that those industries were sheep, pigs and cattle?  These were the industries that the people there understood, and of which they were capable of making some sort of success.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Evidently this is the idea that nothing should be introduced into the Gaeltacht except agriculture.  That we should consistently and strenuously pursue that policy.  And we find in looking at the various statistics that are available the effect of this consistent concentration on this agricultural policy during the regime of the Congested Districts Board.  We find that for some thirteen years there has been a certain amount of money spent, and <Col N="951" /> spent only on that particular phase of the Gaeltacht problem.  We find that in 1909 there was spent £65,000; in 1910, £65,000; in 1913, £132,000 odd; in 1919, £147,000; in 1920, £197,000, and in 1921, £236,000.  These are the sums that have been expended by the different governments on this concentrated agricultural policy.  What has happened during that period?  What has happened to the population of the Gaeltacht while that concentrated agricultural policy was in progress, and nothing else done of an industrial kind to try and relieve the position in the Gaeltacht, nothing done to endeavour to secure occupation for the natural increase in population, nothing except the immigrant ship, nothing except emigration to America?</P>
    <P>We find that in the largest area in the Gaeltacht in Ireland (Donegal), in the period during which we have had this manifestation of agricultural policy in the Gaeltacht that the population has been going down.  We find that in 1901 the population of the County Donegal was 173,722; in 1925, we find that population had dwindled to 145,296, or a decrease in the population of 28,426.  That has happened practically for the same years in which we find this amount of money being extended in concentrated agricultural activities in the Gaeltacht as represented in one section by Tirconaill.</P>
    <P>In the County Kerry, another large Gaeltacht, we had in 1901 155,859 people; in 1925, 131,284, a decrease of 24,575.  I am sure the Minister will be interested to know what happened in Galway.  He told us about shifting people from Lettermullen to the Maam Valley.  Deputy Tubridy told us about some other valley that I do not now recollect.</P>

Lest there should be any misunderstanding that I do not consider Clare a Gaeltacht&mdash;I do&mdash;I will tell you what happened there.  In 1901 there were 89,204 people; in 1911 there were <Col N="952" /> 81,785, and in 1925 there were 71,330, a decrease of 10,455 between 1901 and 1925&mdash;a very eloquent commentary on the value of the agricultural policy that has been pursued by the C.D. Board, which the Minister for Lands and Agriculture evidently intends to continue according to his statement last night. He told us that this thing has been going on, that the recommendations were being carried out.  He told us there were pedigree Galloways in Connemara, but he did not tell us that the result of his policy was also to put genuine Gaels in Boston and New York. He told us there were pedigree pigs in Connemara, but he did not tell us that the flower of the Gaeltacht were fleeing because of the policy which he adumbrates, and which he intends to continue after failure has been exemplified by those who preceded him.  He told us we were far removed from the centre of power; he told us we were far removed from what would make industries effective, such as the coal of England.  I wonder did the Minister remember that the tax-payer is paying five millions odd for the Shannon scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is always in order.  Well, passing from the economic policy, or the want of an economic policy, an attempt has been made by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture to tell us that we are not to indulge in any form of industrial activity&mdash;that we are to do nothing beyond agriculture and that there is nothing to be got but the emigrant ship for the sons and daughters of those in the Gaeltacht.  Coming to the administration side, which was what I mainly had in mind when I got up, I find the intentions of the Government, according to statements made here on the Front Benches with reference to a measure that passed through the Dáil a little while ago, and especially according to the White Paper are:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...the Government have decided to entrust the administration of State schemes in the Congested Districts, which correspond generally with the necessitous portions of the Gaeltacht, to one Parliamentary head, to whose care will be allotted <Col N="954" /> the relevant aspects of the various State improvement schemes which have a special importance for these areas, viz.: Land settlement and migration, drainage, fisheries, rural industries, etc., and whose duty it will be, furthermore, to keep in constant touch with all Departments of State to ensure that the requirements of these districts will be specially provided for in the designing and carrying out of other schemes applicable to the State as a whole.</P>
    <P>I find at the tail-end of the statement of Government policy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Land Commission has been transferred to the Minister for Fisheries, who will act as the coordinating authority for Gaeltacht services in the future.  The Minister will make the necessary arrangements to keep in close touch with those other aspects of Governmental activity....</P>
    <P>That means that the Minister for Fisheries is to see that all the recommendations in this White Paper, as far as one can gather, are to be carried out by the Minister for Fisheries.  He is to see that we are to have Irish-speaking Civic Guards in the Gaeltacht. He is to see that Irish-speaking post office officials are to be appointed in the Gaeltacht, and he is to see that pension officers who are capable of interrogating old age pensioners are appointed in the Gaeltacht.  He is also to see that the many and various services in which the Government indulges in every part of the country are carried on by people with a sufficient knowledge of the language to carry them on through the medium of Irish.  I wonder will it happen, and does the Government itself really think that it is going to happen?  Does it really suggest that the Minister for Fisheries, overburdened as he is with the many activities of this Department at present, with the varied and many activities in which it indulges, is going to have time to look after the Post Office, the Civic Guards, the schools, the Excise, Old Age Pensions Section, the offices of the Local Government, etc.? Is it suggested that this Department is going to see that all of these people are to be Irish speakers, and that they are <Col N="955" /> going to carry out even the poor recommendations of the Government themselves?</P>

      <P>This is not the Gaeltacht, unfortunately.  It is the Galltacht. I would like to point out that it is a physical impossibility for that Department to put it into effect.  I will just give a few instances of my experience as a member of the Gaeltacht Commission. I remember dropping into a wayside Civic Guard station.  There were two of us.  There was an old lady scrubbing the hall, and as she was rather in my way I said, &ldquo;Bail a Dhia ort,&rdquo;&ldquo;Cad atá tú ag déanamh annso?&rdquo; or something like that.  Oh, said she, &ldquo;Beannacht leat.&rdquo; I am not quite sure yet whether it was a polite invitation to me to get out, whether she was handing me my hat and coat, or whether she was actually speaking the couple of words of Irish she knew.  And this was in the Gaeltacht.  I went inside and I said a few words of Irish to a constable.  He looked me up and down.  He did not know Irish.  I am not saying this now as a joke against the Civic Guard. There are Irish speakers in the Civic Guard and I do not intend to make any point against them, but I am endeavouring to point out what will happen if there is not more close contact with whoever is put in charge of this mission to the Gaeltacht, because it is a mission. The constable looked at me in surprise.  I asked him something else in Irish and he said to me, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; He emphasised &ldquo;want.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I want an Irish-speaking Civic Guard.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;You had better go in to the sergeant.&rdquo; I went in to the sergeant, and he was discoursing a beefsteak inside.  I spoke to him in Irish. He said, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No, I did not want poteen.  But this was in the Gaeltacht. I said, &ldquo;If I continued speaking Irish to you, what would you do?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I would eject you from the room.&rdquo; That is the position in the Gaeltacht. If a man had a grievance, if he were <Col N="956" /> assaulted, and if he made a request for protection in Irish to the Civic Guards, he would be put out of the room.  That is not a fabrication.  It is an incident that actually happened.</P>
      <P>I put it to those of the Ministry who are anxious to see that Irish should be put in its proper place in this State&mdash; and there are some in the Ministry who I believe are anxious that Irish should get a proper show in the administration of this State&mdash;will the Minister for Fisheries be able to see that things like that do not happen?  Will the Minister be able to see that an English-speaking pensions officer does not visit Tirconaill? An old lady in one of the districts we visited told us that an officer cross-questioned her about her Irish, about her age and about her position, in English, and that, although she could catch a word here and there, she was not able to follow him.  Will the Minister be able to tell us that these things will not occur?  It is ridiculous, it is absurd, it is toying with the problem. The suggestion that we put forward, that a special Department be set up, with a watching brief, so to speak, to see that all these Departments carried out the recommendations of the Government, carried out our recommendations, is the one way in which the Government can concentrate upon the Gaeltacht, and in seeing that the Departments of State, instead of becoming denationalising centres in the Gaeltacht, will become nationalising centres.  The Government do not seem anxious to do that.  They seem anxious to continue their economic policy, the slipshod policy that at present exists. If they do they may succeed in driving thousands more from the Gaeltacht. Thousands are leaving at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other day a train was one-and-a-half hours late at Ennis, because of the stops it had to make to pick up boys and girls who were leaving the country between the place where it started in Galway and Ennis.  Is the policy that is driving these people away to be continued or are the Government going to force people into the Gaeltacht who are Irish-speaking, and to see that the public administration is carried on in the spirit and the language of the people in the Gaeltacht?  The policy of the <Col N="957" /> Government is absurd.  It is not an attempt to solve the problem, and the Government know that there is no sincerity behind it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. KILROY Mr. KILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion in the name of Deputy Fahy. It is about my eight attempt to get a hearing, and so many have spoken on the question that I feel that it would be very hard to make one's self interesting at this stage.  Anyhow, there are a few things that I would like to make some remarks about. I understand that the Gaeltacht Commission which was set up over three years ago to inquire into the condition of affairs in the West of Ireland and the other Gaelic-speaking districts was established specially to look after the wants of the people in those districts and to try and stem emigration, from which the nation has been suffering for such a long period. Also to encourage and foster the native language as much as possible and to try and restore it to its former position in the nation.  I feel that the worst possible set-back that the Gaelic language could receive or did receive in our time it received yesterday in this House. The Minister for Finance made what I would call a very plausible speech in connection with the Gaeltacht motion which is before the House, but, unfortunately, on the same day, he had to vote on an issue which meant the filling of a position in this House which we hold should be filled by a Gaelic speaker.  He had a choice, if he wished to take it, but he did not do so.  He did not take the steps necessary to secure that we could have a Gaelic speaker in the Chair as Leas-Cheann Comhairle. That, I hold, is a terrible precedent to have set in this country&mdash;the twenty-six counties.  I think I might add Ireland. I think it is the most serious set-back that the Language movement has got in our time, or that it is likely to get.  I do not see what heavier stroke it could get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, I understand from the public Press, the Minister for Defence in the United States was inclined to boast that he had secured concessions for Irish emigrants, that he had secured the means by which the quota would be raised, so as to favour emigration from Ireland.  That <Col N="958" /> under the conditions that were existing might be all right, but I would very much rather that he would pay attention to the establishment of ways and means of securing that those people would be kept at home.</P>
    <P>We, of the Fianna Fáil Party, hold that the present Ministry have had a good many years to experiment in that direction, and that it is time that they should either have found means towards that end or clear out.  We hold that they have not found the means.  Three of the Ministers have spoken and none of them has given us any indication that they have anything at the back of their minds that will deliver us from the trouble from which we are suffering.  The President, according to the public Press, suggested that those emigrants were wealthy enough to take a trip or tour to the United States to see their friends.  That kind of thing, of course, is all very well for himself and his Party, but the Gaeltacht, that has suffered for years, is still suffering, and I am afraid it will continue to suffer unless the advice of the Fianna Fáil Party is taken.  It is all very well for the opposite party to have advertisements of that kind, but the nation suffers in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister for Agriculture stood up here and, after giving what I considered some very sensible advice on industries, he uttered a sentence which I think was not creditable to him, and I will give some of the reasons why I think it was not creditable.  He said he never listened to so many heresies in such a short time.  I would ask him is it heresy to take a man from a 210 acre farm in Kerry and give him in Kildare 247 acres of the best land and in addition give him 310 acres of a grazing farm? That would be 550 acres altogether.  I think there is some room there for criticising the heresies that he applied to us.  Also I would like to know is this a heresy, or what does it mean? It was admitted yesterday, in answer to a question put by Deputy Boland, that the Ministry had charge of a farm for which they paid a man for the past three or four years £400 a year and gave him back the farm every year for <Col N="959" /> £100.  There we hold is a waste of £300 yearly on one farm of land.  What kind of heresy is that?  I do not think it is a sensible business anyway.  There is an old saying about pulling a man's leg. A good deal has been said here about the Maam Valley; a good deal more could be said.  I would say that the man who would walk across some of the land in the Maam Valley and pull his legs after him would be very fortunate.  In parts of the Maam Valley, if he traversed it, he would be very fortunate if he did not pull the mountain down on him.  In some places the valley is only a mile wide and, on each side, there are mountains 2,000 feet high.  Parts of it are nothing but hills with swamps in the middle.  Thousands of acres of the land are valued at less than 4d. an acre.  I forget at what price the best of it is valued, but it is only a few shillings anyway, and this is one of the big schemes we have heard a lot about.  I heard one Deputy boasting the other day that the Government was doing a lot and instanced the Maam Valley.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all that has been said for the last couple of days about unemployment and industries, perhaps a little more could be said.  Down in the West we have places like Achill, where there are about 6,000 inhabitants, and about 2,000 of them are migratory labourers.  We have not had any expenditure of money there, either from the recent free grant or any other grant.  We had it mentioned here yesterday that about £20,000 was expended in the Dublin district. The Dublin district largely manufactures the goods that we buy from them in the West.  We provide them with employment, but we do not get a third of what the city of Dublin gets in the way of grants.  Besides, the so-called dole is administered up here, but we know very little about it in the Western districts, and especially in the Gaeltacht.  I know that there are a lot of people who do not agree with paying people for being idle.  There are a lot of industries that could be carried on, and carried on profitably, and if the money that is spent on these doles were added to other moneys much useful work could be found.  It <Col N="960" /> would be a more sensible way of relieving unemployment and of assisting the Gaeltacht and keeping the people at home, instead of their being forced to migrate to England or to go to America.  It is all very well to talk about the dole being a necessary asset, but I may say that there are a lot of valuable works that could be opened up, both here and in the West, if money were spent in giving employment instead of being paid to able-bodied men for being idle, because that is really what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>I would also say that a mineral survey should be made at least throughout the Gaeltacht.  I know that there are a lot of mineral deposits along the Western coast that could easily be worked.  For instance, there is a slate quarry at Killery Bay, close to one of the best harbours in the West, which could be very profitably worked in connection with the present housing problem.  It would not be a foolish thing, I hold, to develop such a quarry.  I understand that that vein of slate runs from Killery Harbour through Aughagower to Westport, and its development would be useful and necessary for the nation.</P>
    <P>I think it is in directions of that kind that we have to look for development. That they eventually would be of profit to the nation is beyond all doubt.  Down in Achill there are copper-mines and other mines.  The copper mines had been worked previously. They are on the seashore, and, I believe, could be profitably worked again for the reason that there will be no transport difficulties.  So far as afforestation is concerned, we have in Mayo about 30 square miles of mountain land which, I hold, could be very easily secured by the Government.</P>
    <P>Remember this land is 30 miles square, which runs into hundreds of thousands of acres.  A similar area practically is available in Galway, and up to the present nothing whatever has been done for the development of afforestation in Mayo, and very little has been done in Galway, if anything at all.  I trust when the Minister is looking into the matter of afforestation development in the future, he will not neglect those districts which afford such room for work in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> So far as fisheries are concerned, a good deal has been said, and I believe a good deal more could be said upon that matter.  In the first place, if we are to have any aspiration for the development of fisheries, boat building, which is a very important industry, should be encouraged.  After all, if we want fish it is our business to develop that industry, and there is room for the development of it.  The proof of that is that we are importing £292,000 worth of fish annually.  It ought to afford great encouragement to the development of this industry that we have such a market as that.  We find in the present undeveloped market we have an outlet for about £300,000 on fish.  I hold there is nothing very discouraging in that, and it should be gone on with at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>The markets are undeveloped and, of course, it is a very difficult thing to develop markets if you cannot secure supplies.  Until we have developed our fish markets, we cannot hope to secure contracts from the various large institutions throughout the country that would be the key to the situation.  You cannot hope to secure contracts from these institutions without insuring that you have the best possible sources of supply, and in my opinion that means that in tackling this fishery problem you must secure that you have deep-sea fishing to begin with.  Then, when the in-shore fishing cannot be carried on in rough weather, this fishing could be almost constantly carried on, thereby securing a more regular supply of fish, or at least, as constant as that carried out by the foreigners who send in their fish and capture our markets.</P>
    <P>I notice by the Estimates that there is provided this year £3,000 less than was provided for the development of the fishing industry of last year.  The sum provided has been falling for some years past.  It is lower this year than it has been for the past five or six years, anyway.  That is not very encouraging.  For the years 1925-26 and 1926-27 the two years for which the figures of expenditure are available. I find that there is an average of £26,500 unexpended by the Ministry of Fisheries.  We had to complain quite <Col N="962" /> recently that the supply of money for this Department was meagre.</P>

      <P>The resolution does not express dissastisfaction with what the Government has done. I shall translate it into English for the benefit of Deputies in order to call attention to what we are discussing. The resolution says that the statement of Government policy embodied in the White Paper will not save the Gaeltacht, and it invites the Government to prepare a definite scheme embodying practical recommendations and to allocate a specified sum of money for putting into operation without further delay such recommendations.  In other words, it puts up this question of a specified sum of money and how it should be spent.  I have listened to Deputy Kilroy with what I consider to be great patience.  What he is doing now is going into the Estimate for the Department of Fisheries, which will arise later on, and which is not relevant to this motion.  The motion does not raise the question of the neglect by the Government of the Gaeltacht.</P>

What I want to know now is, are we going to arrive at some accommodation with reference to this?  We have given five and a quarter hours yesterday to it, and an hour and a quarter today. At least two Ministers wish to address the Dáil on the subject before it finishes.  The Bill which we postponed until this motion would be considered is due for consideration early next week.  I am prepared to give one hour and a half to it to-morrow, but it must be finished to-morrow, as I can give no more time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, A Chinn Comhairle, I desire to raise a question as to a circular letter which has been sent to the farmers of the district known as the County Louth Black Scab Scheduled Area.  The effect of that circular is that the removal of mangolds, turnips, and cabbage is prevented from within the scheduled area. I do not propose, at this stage, to go into the whole question of black scab in that area.  It is sufficient to say that it has existed in the districts known as Carlingford and Greenore since the year 1917.  The Order has extended to the whole district, which comprises 20,000 acres, on which were supported, in the year 1922, 3,000 families.  My sole purpose in bringing this matter before the House is to have a statement from the Minister for Lands and Agriculture as to his reasons for issuing this circular. I quite appreciate the steps that have been taken in the past by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture in order to <Col N="966" /> prevent this terrible disease from spreading throughout the Free State. Nobody quarrels with that&mdash;not even the people affected in this particular area.  But, somehow or other, they are under the impression that the circular which has been sent out lately will press unduly upon them, inasmuch as it will prevent them from removing mangolds, turnips, or cabbages from within that area.  I do not desire to trespass upon the time of the House unduly, but I await the statement of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, as it is anxiously awaited by the people of the district concerned.  I hope it will be possible&mdash;perhaps after consultation with the Minister&mdash;to arrive at some agreement whereby this circular will be withdrawn, while at the same time safeguarding the interests, not alone of the farmers of that district, but also of the entire farming community of the Free State, which is really the backbone of the State so far as industry is concerned. I am quite prepared to leave it to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture to state the reasons which prompted his Department to send out this circular.  There is only one sentence I wish to refer to, and that is the statement that &ldquo;the alarming spread of black scab disease elsewhere in recent years points to the conclusion that every practical measure should be adopted to prevent its spreading in the Irish Free State.&rdquo; I have underlined the word &ldquo;elsewhere,&rdquo; for the simple reason that, as far as I know, no fresh outbreaks of black scab have been discovered outside the scheduled area.  I want to know what the Minister means by &ldquo;elsewhere.&rdquo; Is he referring to other districts in the Free State, or is he referring to the spread of the disease in England, where it is pretty general?  Because of the spread of the disease there, the farmers in the Cooley area have been able to export their potatoes to England during the past ten or eleven years.  That was because black scab prevailed generally throughout England.  I should like the Minister to deal specially with the meaning of the word &ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo; and to explain what is really intended by the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody will quarrel with the Minister for Lands and Agriculture <Col N="967" /> for taking what steps may be necessary to prevent the spread of black scab.  The one big, staple product of these people is potatoes.  I am sure I would be correct in saying that that crop represents at least 75 per cent. of their income.  They are very gravely dissatisfied&mdash;whether rightly so or not I do not know&mdash;with the actions of the Department of Agriculture and the methods adopted by it in dealing with black scab.  Since the prohibition on the export of potatoes from the scheduled area to other parts of Ireland, free from black scab, which I think was imposed in 1907, up to the other day, potatoes, turnips and other vegetables were allowed to be exported. The people who are growing the potatoes, with many of whom I have spoken, are not clear whether or not the Department think that the disease is spread or carried in the potato itself or in the clay that clings to it when taken from the ground.  They reason this way: If the disease is carried in the potato, the Department have insisted that nothing but immune varieties should be set in the scheduled area for the past twenty years or so. The Department's Inspectors go around and if they see a potato growing which is of a non-immune variety, they immediately issue an order to the grower to have that non-immune potato plucked up at once.  That would occur in all cases.  Only potatoes which will not contract the disease have been allowed to grow in this district for many years. At the same time, other agricultural produce was allowed to be exported, so that people thought that the disease was carried in the potato only.  When they thought that it was carried in the potato only and not in cabbage or in the clay that clings to the potato, they pressed for a sale, in a safe way, to public institutions.  They pressed for permits to sell potatoes to workhouses, hospitals, the Army and institutions of that kind.  They pressed for an alternative market to England, to be provided in this way, for potatoes which are not subject to the disease.  In one or two years it happened that potatoes were 4/- and 5/- per cwt. in Dundalk, while the people of Cooley could only get 1/- per cwt. for their products. <Col N="968" /> They thought they should have been allowed permits to sell their potatoes to public institutions.  I think it would be better to regularise the export of potatoes, so that the people should have an alternative market to the British market and be able to dispose of their potatoes in a safe way.  No matter what police measures the Minister may take, there is no doubt that potatoes are leaving Cooley.  There is more danger in this surreptitious method of exporting potatoes to the general farming community than there would be if potatoes of the type that would not get the disease were exported under licence to public institutions.  I should like the Minister, if not now at some other time, to give fully the reasons for the methods the Department of Agriculture have taken for the last number of years &mdash;since the ban has been put on&mdash;in dealing with the black scab disease.</P>

      <P>Under this Order, which was issued in 1928, the same procedure is adopted in regard to mangolds, turnips and cabbage as had been adopted in previous Orders in regard to potatoes.  Black scab has been in existence for a long time in this area.  I think there is only one other area in the Free State where you have the same state of affairs.  In that respect we are in a very much more fortunate position than any other country. We are in a very much more fortunate position than Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  In Great Britain, as Deputy Coburn has pointed out, black scab is fairly general.  In Northern Ireland the position in regard to black scab is very much worse than it is in the Saorstát.  That, of course, is due to the fact that potatoes were grown more intensively in Northern Ireland than they were here.  But, whatever the reason, our position is very much more satisfactory here.  This is a highly contagious disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Aiken's question, it is established beyond doubt that the disease can be carried not only by potatoes, which are susceptible, but also by the soil attaching to immune potatoes or to mangolds or turnips or cabbage&mdash;provided the disease is in the soil.  They have, for many years, <Col N="969" /> grown none but immune varieties in the Cooley district, but comparatively recently it was verified that black scab still remained in the soil.  I was put a question by Deputy Aiken some time ago as to when the last case of black scab was discovered in Cooley.  I forget the answer I gave.  The Deputy may remember it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said &ldquo;last year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The disease was then actually discovered in potatoes, notwithstanding the fact that the potatoes grown there were of immune varieties. It is almost impossible to get a variety which is absolutely pure, which will not occasionally develop some sort of throw-back, the technical term for which is &ldquo;sport.&rdquo; That is a throw-back which has not the qualities of the product as it exists at the present moment. That is common to all varieties.  Mangolds and turnips throw back as well&mdash; turnips especially.  They all throw back some sort of &ldquo;sport&rdquo; or &ldquo;cross,&rdquo; which loses the particular characteristics of the normal plant at the moment. In a case like this, the immune varieties occasionally throw out a cross potato, which is susceptible.  You have occasionally examples of such potatoes even amongst immune varieties.  Last year, &ldquo;sports&rdquo; were discovered which were found to be affected with black scab. There is no doubt that black scab is in the soil still and will affect potatoes.  I am quite satisfied as to that.  Some of the farmers up there may doubt the statement I am going to make, but I think there is no doubt about it&mdash;that the soil will carry the contagion and will affect susceptible varieties in other districts if they are brought in contact with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the problem in connection with the Cooley area, which is easily the best potato-growing district in Ireland.  The facts are there.  It is not such a hardship as it looks on the face of it to prohibit the export of potatoes from Cooley district to districts in the rest of the Saorstát. Their main trade is and will remain with England, because they grow a sort of potato which is not valued very much in this country but for which <Col N="970" /> there is a very big market in England. If they were exporting their potatoes freely to Dundalk, the prices would be very different in Dundalk, and would compare closely with the prices they get in England.  I have no doubt that would be so.  If there was a free market from Cooley to Dundalk, I doubt if the price would be as good as it is in England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. COBURN Mr. COBURN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are farmers in a very small way in Cooley who would be delighted to bring their potatoes to Dundalk market.  At the present time they have to amass them and bring them in bulk to Bush Station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt of that, but any advantages that would accrue from bringing them to Dundalk would not be widespread.  Their main export trade is to England.  They do essentially an export trade, and when we confine the export trade to England or to places outside the Free State, there is undoubtedly hardship, but it is not nearly as great as might otherwise accrue.  It would be quite out of the question to allow potatoes to be removed out of the Cooley district to the rest of the Saorstát, and it would be a wanton act.  The Saorstát is practically free from black scab.  With the exception, I think, of Donegal and this area, it is free of black scab, which is quite the worst disease that could affect potatoes.  The potato crop is a very important crop in this country.  It would be a wanton act to allow the potatoes to be removed from this area in view of the fact that, though the potatoes may be immune, the sports of the potatoes would carry the disease and the soil would carry it.  To do that would be asking for the same situation that exists in Northern Ireland and in England at present.  It would be particularly bad, and particularly careless to allow that because for the last three or four years the potato trade of this country has been developing very quickly.  In that connection, I might say that people who talk a lot about wheat and other crops do not seem to give the same attention to the potato crop.  For some reason, into which I do not propose to enter, potatoes have been grown in this country <Col N="971" /> for a long time, and they seem to have been very successful.  They seem to suit the soil and climate of the country. There has been a big development in the export trade of potatoes&mdash; not so much of ware potatoes as of seed potatoes&mdash;to England in recent years, and we are reaching a point where the potatoes of the Saorstát are getting quite a reputation for seed.  The export heretofore was almost entirely from Northern Ireland, but we are reaching a stage now in our export trade when it would be absolutely wanton to allow potatoes out of this district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but when I introduced this question I did not want to discuss the question of the export of potatoes; what I wanted to discuss was the movement of mangolds, turnips and cabbage out of the area.  I should like the Minister, too, to explain the meaning he attaches to the word &ldquo;elsewhere,&rdquo; when used in connection with &ldquo;the alarming spread of black scab disease.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to the question of mangolds, turnips and cabbage. We considered the position.  The disease can be carried in the soil.  If we had been quite logical, we would have made an Order in the beginning prohibiting the export of mangolds, turnips and cabbage, as well as potatoes. The Order would not have meant much extra hardship because potatoes are the main export.  People rarely sell mangolds, turnips and cabbage.  On the other hand, there is a small market for mangolds in Dundalk.  People buy mangolds there, but it is a comparatively small market in comparison with the export of potatoes.  These vegetables have too much water to make it feasible to take transport costs out of the total price.  They are mainly used by the farmers.  I know there are cases in which they are sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning, if we had been quite logical we would have made an Order in connection with mangolds, turnips and cabbage, as well as potatoes, but at that time it was not established definitely, I think, that the clay-attaching <Col N="972" /> to the roots of a tuber of that sort would carry the disease.  That is established now, and when that was taken in conjunction with the fact that, for the last two years especially, the export trade of potatoes had developed considerably, we came to the conclusion that the time had come definitely when we should eliminate this rather considerable risk by preventing the removal of mangolds, turnips and cabbage out of the area.  The amount of mangolds, turnips and cabbage removed for sale as a cash crop is extremely small.  We think that at a time when we are trying to develop a very much bigger area for potato-growing, the export trade having developed largely because of our immunity from black scab, we would be neglecting an obvious precaution if we did not bring in that Order at this stage.  As regards &ldquo;elsewhere,&rdquo; that does not mean Saorstát Eireann.  We have succeeded pretty well in controlling the disease in Saorstát Eireann.  It is confined to Cooley and Donegal, and even there to a few areas.  It is in order that we should confine it to them that we brought in this Order.  If we let mangolds and turnips, with soil attaching to them which might carry the infection, be removed, we would be asking for trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. COBURN Mr. COBURN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been removable for eleven years and there has been no specific case of black scab.  My argument is that the removal of mangolds, turnips and cabbage has been going on since 1917 and that the Minister is unable to give any instance of black scab having occured as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point against me, but, on the other hand, it is proved absolutely that soil attaching to these vegetables can carry the disease.  I admit it is not likely that soil would get in contact with other soils, but you can bring a pitcher too often to the water.  It is probably because other countries neglected to take this type of precaution in time that the disease spread so rapidly in them.  There are other reasons, of course.  It was a much easier job for us, because we have not such a big area of potatoes, but the fact that other countries neglected to <Col N="973" /> take these precautions in time was one of the factors which brought about the spread of the disease elsewhere.  We allow sugar beet out of this area, but if we do, we make a special arrangement with the Carlow factory.  The sugar beet from this area goes to one place and to one place only.  The establishment is a very big one, they have a big staff and efficient arrangements. We make a special arrangement with the Carlow factory to deal in a special way with the soil attaching to beet from Cooley and Dundalk areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should want specific notice of that question, because if it is done officially, special arrangements are made.  Deputy Aiken asked why we should not allow the potatoes to be sold to public institutions.  I do not think that would satisfy anybody.  The amount of potatoes that institutions would be likely to consume would be <Col N="974" /> very small.  A fair number of institutions grow their own potatoes. Compared with the danger involved, that would not be worth doing.  It would not affect the position of the people concerned.  It is reasonable enough to allow sugar beet to be sent to one factory, but it would be hardly worth while to allow a very small proportion of your total output of potatoes to go to ten or fifteen institutions, controlled by ten or fifteen different interests.  It would be ten or fifteen times as hard to supervise the disposal of the potatoes in these institutions as to control the output of sugar beet sent to the Carlow factory.  It would be of very little advantage either.  While I admit that the Cooley people are suffering a distinct hardship because their land is so suitable to the crop, I do not see any way out of it.</P>
