      <P>&ldquo;That the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts, dated 29th February, 1928, which has been printed and circulated, be now considered.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In presenting this Report to the House for its consideration, I take the liberty of pointing out that the work which had to be carried out for the year under review had to be carried out by three separate committees, appointed in the first case by the Fourth Dáil, in the second place by the Fifth Dáil, and also by the Sixth Dáil.  Many members of the Committee who will be held responsible for the Report now presented were not members of either of the committees appointed by the Fourth or the Fifth Dáil.  I was not a member of the Committee set up by the Fourth Dáil, but I was a member of the Committee appointed by the Fifth Dáil, but was not constantly in attendance at the meetings.  Eventually <Col N="2073" /> I found myself in the peculiar position of being Chairman of the Committee which had to take responsibility for drawing up the Report now before the House.  I want to take advantage of this opportunity of saying on behalf of the Public Accounts Committee, and if I might say also on behalf of the House, that we deeply appreciate the conscientious and painstaking manner in which the Comptroller and Auditor-General and his staff performed the duties which fell to them in connection with this important aspect of Governmental work.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General is, of course, an officer of this House, appointed by the House for the purpose of seeing that its intentions when voting money are faithfully carried out in the spending of that money.  If I may do so at this stage, I want to emphasise the fact that the work of the Public Accounts Committee should be looked upon as a work of a purely non-party character.  It would be a very serious matter in the opinion of some of the Committee, and I hope in this matter members of the House will agree, if the Report or recommendations of the Committee were to be looked upon and dealt with from the party point of view.  The Committee consists of members of all parties, but so far as my experience goes, the work done by members of all parties on the Committee was performed in a manner which had no relationship whatever to the views of the parties, if they had any views on the particular matters that came before the Committee from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Committee conducts its business in the presence of the accounting officers of the Departments concerned, representatives of the Department of Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The Committee can, any time it thinks fit, examine official files so as to clucidate any particular matter that it may not be clear upon. The procedure is defined so as to safeguard the taxpayer from official error in the spending of public funds, and to ensure faithful financial administration. I want to emphasise the fact also to members of the House who may be new to the work of the Public Accounts Committee that it is not the Ministers <Col N="2074" /> who are called before the Committee to answer for any matters that the Comptroller and Auditor-General may deem fit to report upon.  It is the accounting officers of the Departments concerned. Cases have arisen, and perhaps will arise again, where Ministerial policy may cut across the Departmental decisions, and where such matters are reported to the Committee by the Comptroller and Auditor-General the Committee in due course reports to the House, and the Minister or Ministers responsible will have to answer to this House.  Any departure from the directions and intentions of those voting the money in this House means a query from the Comptroller and Auditor-General, an examination by the Public Accounts Committee, a report in turn to this House, and disallowance or a supplementary application to the Dáil, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The system of public accountancy or the work and procedure of the Public Accounts Committee has been in existence in Great Britain for a period of, I think, 60 years.  We had in this country to erect under very difficult circumstances a Governmental machine. It is only natural to expect that in the earliest stages of the work of a new Government, set up in such peculiar circumstances, that matters would crop up that would not arise under normal conditions.  Speaking from a slight examination of the work of the Public Accounts Committee in Great Britain. and of the matters which have come before that Committee.  I can truthfully and honestly state that the work performed by the people who are responsible for administration in this country is now as good as if not better than the work performed in Great Britain under the same circumstances.  There is nothing of an unusual nature in the Report which I now present to the House which would make one feel that there is any reason for apprehension. Many matters appear in the Report of the Public Accounts Committee in Great Britain which do not now arise in this country, and I say that we can boast of a Governmental machine as good as if not better than that which exists in Great Britain, where you have an old-established Government, and where <Col N="2075" /> the machinery, the working and the procedure of the Public Accounts Committee have been in existence for a period of over sixty years.</P>
    <P>I have to take the responsibility of presenting the Report to the House under a certain disadvantage.  I take it that in the usual way the Report of the Public Accounts Committee would not be considered unless and until the Committee had received from the Minister for Finance minutes with regard to the different matters raised in the Report.  The Report was signed on the 29th February, 1928, and in the usual way found its way to the Department of Finance.  But as far as I am aware, we have no report or no minute of any kind to give us any indication whatever as to the views of the Minister for Finance on any important matter raised in the Report.  I take it that matters which will be referred to by Deputies will be replied to by the Minister to-day.  At this stage I intend to refer only to two or three matters raised in the Report.  I feel, and I am sure that the members of the Committee also feel, that any discussion and criticism that may arise from the presentation of this Report should, at any rate in the earlier stages of this debate, be left as far as possible to Deputies who are not and have not been members of the Committee.  If any Deputy refers to a matter which calls for explanation the members of the Committee, and I myself if necessary, will take responsibility for answering them for anything in the Report that may not appear clear.</P>
    <P>I want to refer, in the first place, to paragraph 17 of the Report.  I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is not now in the House.  Of course we have already been informed that he is Chairman of the Economy Committee, and I would like to direct his attention to the matter raised in that paragraph so that he might, in consultation with his colleagues on the Economy Committee, see what could be done&mdash;and we believe that something could be done in this case&mdash;to bring about savings in expenses under this head.  Ministers, and the Government as a whole, are of <Col N="2076" /> course responsible for the administration of Acts, such as the Old Age Pensions Act, and they are very careful not to give away a shilling in the case of an old age pension where a shilling can be saved, under the very strict regulations governing the administration of the Act.  Here is a case where we believe&mdash;and in this we are supported by the accounting officer responsible&mdash;that considerable savings could be effected, and I merely direct the attention of the Chairman of the Economy Committee to this particular paragraph so that he may go into it with a view to bringing about savings.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 26 a very important point is raised, a point where the Department of Posts and Telegraphs joins issue with the Minister for Finance on the question of discipline within the service.  Those of us who were present in the House a couple of weeks ago, and who listened to the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will remember that he made a boast, probably to a certain extent correct, about the discipline of the Department for which he was responsible.  Now here is a case where his own Department on a question of discipline is joining issue with the Minister for Finance, who is nominally if not actually the head of the Civil Service.  I will read the Report as far as I may have to refer to it:</P>
    <P>Sums amounting to £69 10s. 4d. were charged to this account under the sub-head for losses.  To this the Department of Finance refused sanction. The losses occurred through defalcations on the part of the officers in charge of two branch offices, and it transpired that the supervision on the part of the Department was defective.  As a result of an application for authority to write off this amount, the Department of Finance requested that prosecutions be undertaken in both cases.  The Solicitor to the Post Office gave it as his opinion that there was sufficient evidence to sustain prosecutions.</P>
    <P>This is not the important point:</P>
    <P>The Department for Posts and <Col N="2077" /> Telegraphs, nevertheless, refused to proceed on the grounds that it was not in the public interest, and also that the decision as to whether prosecutions should be instituted in this type of case was one for them and not for the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Now that raises a very serious issue, and I hope that the Deputies of this House will support the members of the Public Accounts Committee in insisting that on matters of this kind the view point of the Department of Finance must be carried out and adhered to, if there is to be discipline in the Civil Service.  I would like to hear from the Minister, when he is replying, what he has to say in regard to that particular aspect of the report.</P>
    <P>Now I come to paragraph 31 in connection with Trade Loan Guarantees. The Deputies will recognise that a special provision of this Act was that no guarantee was to be given if any part of the proceeds was to be used as working capital.  In one case which has already come under the notice of the House in the discussions which took place here last year, and where the Loan was guaranteed, it was found that the State security must stand as a second mortgage in order to allow a first mortgage on the assets for cash advanced by the bank as working capital.  I believe it is generally admitted, I am not sure if the Minister is now prepared to admit it, that that certainly was not in accordance with the intentions of the Act. The Act of the 17th July, 1926, made no amendment such as was suggested in the interim report of the Public Accounts Committee dated 15th June, 1926.  In another case it was brought to the notice of the Public Accounts Committee that the State security has been reduced by about £20,000 since the loan was guaranteed by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  This makes me feel that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, in commenting on these cases, is entitled to deal with them as matters of account and not as matters of law.  The Dáil, in granting money for any purpose, looks to the Comptroller and Auditor-General to see that its intention in granting the money is carried out.  When a liability on the <Col N="2078" /> Exchequer is created, the Comptroller and Auditor-General is bound to bring any matter to the notice of the Dáil, any matter which he thinks should be brought forward.  In my opinion the Act should be amended so as to remove all doubt regarding the conditions under which a loan may be guaranteed.  The Minister, in speaking on his own Vote the other day, gave the House to understand that in amending the Act, as he anticipated that amendments would be necessary, he would be guided in bringing forward such amendments as a result of the discussion that would take place in the House on this Report.</P>
    <P>I want to come to another, the last matter in connection with this Report. It is the matter dealt with in paragraph 42 under the head of Army Pensions. I want to say here and now that the question raised by the Committee under this paragraph has nothing whatever to do with the desirability of granting pensions to able-bodied men.  This House has, by the Military Service Pensions Act, made provision for granting pensions to individuals who can prove active service in pre-Truce days, and who could also prove that they had subsequent service in the National Army.  The Act which made it possible to pay pensions to such individuals made it also possible to set up what is called a Board of Assessors.  And that Board under the Act was charged with the responsibility of going into all applications and making recommendations as to whether certificates could be issued which would enable individual applicants to obtain whatever pensions they were entitled to under the terms of the Act.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General, as far as I am aware, is entitled in all cases where moneys are advanced under any Act passed by this House to have access to every document which would enable him to satisfy himself on behalf of this House that the moneys payable under certain sections of the Act would be properly chargeable to the Vote and within the meaning of the Act which gives authority for the granting of pensions or other payments.  A definite conflict arose subsequent to the establishment of the Board of Assessors in connection with the administration of this particular <Col N="2079" /> Act.  If I am wrong, I would like the Minister to point out to me where I am wrong.  I hold that the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General were not in any way limited under the terms of any section of this Act.  If they were, and if there was any such intention in the minds of those who were responsible for presenting the Bill to the House at the time, these things should have been mentioned at the time.  When the moneys came to be voted for the Estimates in the ordinary way, the Minister, when subsequently moving for several Votes since the first Vote was presented to the House, did not inform the House that the moneys payable to the persons who were considered as entitled to pensions should be subjected to a limited examination. It was only when the Auditor-General came to review the payments made in a certain year that the Board of Assessors declined to give him the papers which he thought he was entitled to under the terms of his appointment under the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act.  The point I want to make is this, and I do not want to stress it too much&mdash;that the refusal to give to the Comptroller and Auditor-General the papers to which he thinks he is entitled, and to which I think he is entitled under the terms of the Act as it stands, is, I understand, a ministerial decision.  Evidence was given before the Public Accounts Committee which makes that quite clear to any person who has read the minutes of evidence.  Mr. Brennan, who was then the accounting officer for the Department of Finance, gave evidence before the Committee on the 13th January, 1927.  In paragraph 2216 of the printed evidence I find:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Chairman:&mdash;In the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, I find provision is made in respect to the payment of pensions to a variety of classes, including civil servants. Dublin Metropolitan Police, Criminal Investigation Department, Army pensions, resigned and dismissed R.I.C., teachers and others.  I find that in the Superannuation and Pensions Act.  Section 9, it is provided that the decision of the <Col N="2080" /> Minister for Finance on any question which may arise as to the application of any section of this Act to any person or as to the amount of any allowance or gratuity under this Act or as to the reckoning of any service for such allowance or gratuity shall be final.  I find this Act is to be cited together with the previous Superannuation Acts from 1834 to 1923.  I desire to ask you as to the practice of the Minister for Finance in respect to the audit of pensions awards whether it is usual to submit any documents that may be called for by the Comptroller and Auditor-General which he may require in the course of his audit?</P>
    <P>The reply was:</P>
    <P>That is the practice in all these cases&mdash;that any paper relevant to the award of pensions is sent to the Comptroller and Auditor-General on his request.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I said it was the evidence given before the Committee on the 13th January, 1927.  In the next question, the Chairman asked:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Would you base that practice merely upon good will or would you consider it within your rights&mdash; would you consider it the right of the Department of Finance&mdash;to refuse access to the documents that the Comptroller and Auditor-General asks in respect to a pension of which the Minister for Finance was the final decider?</P>
      <P>The reply was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general in view of the essential character of the work of the Comptroller and Auditor-General involving audit and criticism of accounts and in view of the more particular provisions in relation to the conduct of audit which are set out in the Exchequer and Audit Act, it has always been assumed that papers relevant to financial transactions an <Col N="2081" /> to accounts are proper to be called for by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and that they ought to be furnished to him.  The refusal of the paper to the Comptroller and Auditor-General would be a very exceptional matter, and in general it could only be defended where it is clearly a matter pertaining to an account, upon some grounds of public policy rendering it undesirable that the papers should be disclosed.  In any such case, the Minister who takes the responsibility of refusing the paper naturally also takes upon himself the responsibility of justifying to the Dáil and to this Committee that such action was proper in the particular case.</P>
    <P>This is a Ministerial decision&mdash;the refusal to produce the documents considered necessary.  I assume that it is now the responsibility of the Minister to justify to the House the action of the Ministry in declining to submit these papers for the examination of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The question which the House should concern itself with in this matter is, was it the intention of the members of the House who took responsibility for the passing of this Act to limit the powers and the rights of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in making his examination into the payments that are being made under this Act?  Was it the intention of the members of the House who voted moneys at different periods when Votes were presented here that the same limited examination should be carried out?  If that was not the intention, if it was not the intention of the Minister, and if there is nothing in the Act to prevent the Comptroller and Auditor-General from getting the papers, then a case must be made to the House here and now on behalf of the Ministry which refused to give the Comptroller and Auditor-General the rights which we all believe he is entitled to.</P>
    <P>On the question of the work performed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in matters of this kind I have been informed, as a member and as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, that pensions were granted under the Superannuation and Pensions <Col N="2082" /> Act of 1923 by the Departmental officials responsible for considering applications, and when some of these cases were submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General he found the pensions in some twenty odd cases were not properly payable within the meaning of this Act.  I notice that the Minister dissents, but that information has been given to me, and, if it is correct, it only goes to show how necessary it is for the Comptroller and Auditor-General, acting on behalf of the House, to make a careful investigation into every case in which a pension has been granted.  I am informed also that in order to get the maximum pension under the Military Service Pensions Act it is necessary to produce proof before the Board of Assessors that you had active service in 1916.  I am reliably informed that one individual now in receipt of the maximum pension of £350 a year had not active service in 1916.  That man, in my opinion and if I am correctly informed, could not be given the maximum pension under the Act.  If my statement is correct, if there is any ground for that statement and if the papers were brought in the ordinary way and submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, that would be the time when the Comptroller and Auditor-General would be able to exercise his powers and prevent such a person getting a pension if he thought he was not entitled to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be well to have it from Deputy Davin whether he is making this statement purely from his own knowledge or whether evidence on the subject came before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not think that any such evidence came before the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that it is not supported by any statement in the evidence, and could not be, simply because of the position that has arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is Deputy Davin's own personal knowledge, and not his knowledge as the Chairman of the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  I quoted the case and I refer to the matter now <Col N="2083" /> in order to show how necessary it is that papers should be submitted to the C. and A.-G.  We had one case, as Deputy Cooper knows&mdash;and this is supported by evidence&mdash;where an individual was dismissed in disgrace from the National Army and immediately courtmartialled.  He wos found guilty of certain shortages.  A year after his dismissal the individual in this case came along and made application for a pension.  The Board of Assessors granted the pension with or without the knowledge that the individual had been dismissed in disgrace.  I hold that if all the facts in connection with that case were submitted to the C. and A.-G. the individual concerned would not be in receipt of a pension.  I refer to these matters to show how necessary it is that the officer of this House, who has been appointed with very definite responsibility, and who has been given very definite powers, should have access to every document that is available, so as to satisfy himself on any matter concerning the spending of the taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>The discussion in connection with this matter has no relation whatsoever to the desirability of granting pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act, and I hope the discussion, in so far as it may take place on this matter, will be confined to the issues raised in the report of a Committee of Public Accounts.  I hope the members of the House will give expression to their opinion as to whether they think that the C. and A.-G. is right in demanding access to these documents, and whether there is any justification for the action of the Ministry in refusing him access to the documents to which he thinks he is entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to one other matter, and that is in regard to the work of this particular Committee.  In the discussion on the Vote connected with the Department of the Ministry for Industry and Commerce on the 17th May, the Minister expressed himself very clearly.  I am sorry to see that he did it in such a way.  He remarked on the red-tape regulations and methods adopted, in his opinion, by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Committee <Col N="2084" /> of Public Accounts, as far as my experience of the work of that Committee has gone, merely sets itself out to consider matters which have been brought under its notice in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The Committee of Public Accounts has, of course, the right, if it so desires, to go into other matters that they would be entitled to go into under their terms of reference.  The Committee, as far as I know, have quite sufficient work to do to deal with the matters that are brought under their notice by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in his report, and during my membership of the Committee they have not gone outside that particular phase of the work which they were appointed to do. Deputy Briscoe and the Minister for Industry and Commerce appear to be a little at variance in regard to the matter.  The Minister is reported as having said in the House on the 17th May, 1928:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for the red tape in Government Departments?  This Dáil.  This Dáil insists upon a certain responsibility being put on certain people in such a way that there is this red tape.  We can get rid of the red tape if the Dáil says in any legislation it passes, &ldquo;Very well, you can have a free hand.&rdquo;  However, it happens that Deputies who complain of red tape in this House go into the Public Accounts Committee and show they are intent on tying up every Government Department in coils of red tape.</P>
    <P>The red tape merely consists of this, as far as I know: This House votes so many millions per year of the taxpayers' money.  We have to be satisfied that we can justify our action to the taxpayers who sent us here to share the responsibility for the good government of the country.  After that money is voted we have to leave it to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who is appointed by the Dáil, to see that the intentions of the Deputies who voted the money are faithfully and conscientiously carried out.  In order to have that work carried out in a proper and efficient manner the Public Accounts Committee has been appointed. It would be impossible for the House <Col N="2085" /> as a whole to take up the consideration of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Can anyone picture Deputies sitting here for months at a time, having before them the Accounting Officer of every Department responsible for Government administration, and examining him at length with regard to this, that, and the other matters raised in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General?  It could not be done.  In order to avoid that a committee of twelve Deputies, representative of all Parties, sit and bring before them from time to time, as and when necessary, the Accounting Officers of the various Departments, and question them upon any matter raised in the report.  If that is the red tape which the Minister for Industry and Commerce apparently dislikes, it is for the House to say what other machinery can be adopted which will do the work in future better than it has been done by the Public Accounts Committee in the past.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say at this stage in regard to the presentation of the Report, other than that I do not feel called upon to refer to any other matter at the moment.  Personally I should prefer that criticism of the Report would be taken up by Deputies who are not and have not been members of the Committee.  I would emphasise again the necessity for looking at this Report and the work of the Committee from a purely non-Party standpoint.  That cannot be emphasised too often or too much, and I hope Deputies, regardless of Party, will appreciate the necessity for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fourth Report of the Public Accounts Committee. The third Report was never considered by the Dáil.  Therefore, one is in some difficulty because there appears to be a certain conflict between the decisions of the third Committee and the decisions of the fourth Committee. We are entitled to examine this Report, in connection with the evidence given before the Committee and also, I think, in relation to previous reports.  There is one very important item in this Report&mdash;the last item&mdash;as to which no evidence was given before the fourth Committee.  In fact, the Committee passed judgment <Col N="2086" /> on the matter without hearing any evidence whatsoever &mdash; they passed judgment on the evidence as appearing in the printed volume of the third Report.</P>
      <P>Deputies who have read through this Report and compared it with the other reports will agree, I think, that the Report as a whole is very satisfactory, and that there has been a very steady improvement every year in the condition of the public accounts.  The further away we get from the period of the Civil War the more accurate becomes the accounting in the various Departments.  From that point of view the Report is very satisfactory.  But there is another aspect of this document which is not so satisfactory, and I fear that the Report is likely to cause uneasiness on other grounds than on the grounds of the condition of the public accounts.  This Report shows, in my opinion, an accentuation of certain defects and of an unsatisfactory spirit which started in the previous Public Accounts Committee.  I think there is cause to be gravely concerned as to the general lines on which the activities of the Committee are developing.  The Committee is not a statutory body; as far as I know it has no official legal existence.  It is not mentioned in the Constitution or in any Act, as far as I know.  It is established under Standing Order 109:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be appointed, at the beginning of each financial year, a Select Committee, to be designated &lsquo;The Committee of Public Accounts&rsquo; to examine and report to the Dáil upon the accounts showing the appropriation of the sums granted by the Dáil to meet the public expenditure, and to suggest alterations and improvements in the form of the Estimates submitted to the Dáil.  The Committee shall consist of twelve Deputies, none of whom shall be a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary, and four of whom shall constitute a quorum.  The Committee shall be otherwise constituted according to the provisions of Standing Orders Nos. 65 and 68, and so as to be impartially representative of the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only official statement as <Col N="2087" /> to the exact functions of the Committee as far as the Dáil is concerned.  The Committee are not a court of law, and yet I regret to say the Committee have discussed the decision of a court of law. They have discussed whether that decision is wise or not, and whether evidence was before the court or not. That is, in my opinion, a dangerous tendency which should not be encouraged in the Committee.</P>

      <P>It is the previous Committee, not the last, and it appears on page 26 of the third Report.  A matter was raised by the Comptroller and Auditor-General dealing with a question of compensation in which the court granted a decree for over £13,000. The Committee discussed whether that was right or not.  What use the Committee had in discussing the matter I do not know.  I do not think it is a matter which was within their powers. In any case, there has been, in my opinion, a tendency towards undue interference by the Committee in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rights and duties of the Committee have never been clearly defined, and certainly they have never been defined in detail.  As the Chairman has pointed out, the Committee has had to make its own law and develop its own method of procedure.  It has been doing so for the last four years.  I have noticed that there has been a tendency in the Committee to accept whatever the Finance Department and the Exchequer and Audit Department state has been the practice in England and to follow that.  The Committee is intimately connected with the work of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  As the Chairman has pointed out, the Comptroller and Auditor-General is appointed by this House.  We have no right, and certainly I have no desire, to criticise any action of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  We can, however, consider the report and proceedings of the Committee without in any way giving offence to or infringing the rights of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. We can discuss the interpretation which the Committee have <Col N="2088" /> given to the rights and privileges of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the functions of his Department. In the last paragraph of this Report which we are considering, there is a statement which would imply that the previous Committee had attempted or, at any rate, that their Report appeared to limit the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  In this paragraph, which has reference to military service pensions, the Committee state&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On further consideration, however, this Committee is of opinion that it is undesirable to deal with a charge which recurs annually in a manner which appears to limit the powers conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who is required by the terms of the statutes defining the duties and powers of his office (the Exchequer and Audit Act, 1866, and the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act, 1923) to examine on behalf of the Dáil every appropriation account (other than those in which a specific indication to the contrary appears on the face of the estimate).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact that is slightly inaccurate, because it is not so much the Act of 1866 as the Act of 1921 which is involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exchequer and Audit Department Act.  It is a most important matter, and if the Dáil will permit me I will examine briefly what are the statutory powers conferred upon the Comptroller and Auditor-General. First of all we have our own Act of 1923, which says in Section 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  It shall be the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to control all disbursements and to audit all accounts and moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas at such times and in such manner as shall from time to time be prescribed by law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I know, we have not passed any law on this matter and we are carrying on the traditions of the <Col N="2089" /> British Government.  Sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless and until it shall be otherwise provided by the Oireachtas the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall have and exercise all such powers and perform all such duties as are prescribed by this Act or are conferred or imposed on him by any Act of Parliament of the late United Kingdom having the force of law in Saorstát Eireann and adapted to the circumstances of Saorstát Eireann by or under the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, and particularly by the Exchequer and Audit Department Act, 1886 and 1921.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is roughly the amount of rights and functions which we have conferred upon the Comptroller and Auditor-General as far as this Dáil has legislated. The Exchequer and Audit Department Act of 1921 virtually supersedes the provisions of the original Act of 1866 with one important exception, and the functions are very clearly laid down in this in the first Section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every Appropriation Account shall be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor-General on behalf of the House of Commons, and in the examination of such accounts the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall satisfy himself that the money expended has been applied to the purpose or purposes for which the grants made by Parliament were intended to provide, and that the expenditure conforms with the authority which governs it.</P>
    <P>(2) The Comptroller and Auditor-General, after satisfying himself that the vouchers have been examined and certified as correct by the Accounting Department, may, in his discretion and having regard to the character of the Departmental examination, in any particular case admit the sums so certified without further evidence of payment in support of the charges to which they relate.</P>
    <P>Provided that if the Treasury desires the vouchers or any of them to be examined in greater detail the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall take action accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is extending to the whole service what was formerly the privilege of the <Col N="2090" /> Army and Navy.  It is giving a discretion to the Comptroller and Auditor-General not to carry out an exhaustive audit, but to take a test audit or to accept the audit of the Department concerned. But the vital article concerning us here is in the Exchequer and Audit Department Act, 1866, and that is Section 28, as slightly amended by this Act.  I am reading it as amended and not in its original form.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In order that such examination may as far as possible proceed <i>pari passu</i> with the transactions of the several accountancy Departments the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall have free access, at all convenient times, to the books and accounts and other documents relating to the accounts of such Departments, and may require the several Departments concerned to furnish him, from time to time, or at regular periods, with accounts of the transactions of such Departments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that is a summary of the statutory authority of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and the question arises: Who is to interpret these laws conferring these functions upon him? How are they to be interpreted and by what body?  Is the Comptroller and Auditor-General alone entitled to interpret them?  That is a problem the solution of which I do not know.  In England, as I understand, these laws are being interpreted by a long process of evolution going from precedent to precedent and involving tradition and customs of the Treasury. the Audit Department and the Public Accounts Committee.  What I am not clear about is this: By the Adaptation of Enactments Act we took over this legislation dealing with the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Did we also take over these laws as interpreted by the traditions of the British Treasury and the Public Accounts Committee in England?  Are we bound by the precedents of the Public Accounts Committee in England?  While that doctrine has never been stated at the Public Accounts Committee here.  I must say that from the very beginning the Committee has acted as if that were the case.</P>
    <P>Another doctrine which is accepted <Col N="2091" /> as <i>ex cathedra</i> and absolutely unquestioned by the Public Accounts Committee is that the power of the Department of Finance over all other Departments is unlimited.  The first item to the First Schedule of the Ministers and Secretaries Act states that the business and functions formerly administered and discharged by the British Treasury in Ireland shall be assigned to the Department of Finance.  Who is to interpret that particular item?  What exactly were the business and the functions of the British Treasury in Ireland?  I strongly suspect that literally the business and the functions of the British Treasury in Ireland were not nearly so extensive as the Treasury functions exercised by the Department of Finance at the present time.</P>
    <P>The question as to what the functions of the Treasury are the Committee of Public Accounts leaves to be decided entirely by the Treasury itself. In the course of the last few years I dared to suggest to the House that perhaps the Department of Finance, in certain matters, wielded a tyrannical power, that it exercised legislative, executive and judicial authority&mdash;made its own laws, enforced its own laws and interpreted its own laws.  I dared make that suggestion occasionally in the House, not that I expected, in any way, to mitigate the occasional tyrannical exercise of that power, but in order to show that there was at least one &ldquo;Skibbereen Eagle&rdquo; with its eye on the Czar.  The Committee of Public Accounts has meekly submitted to everything which the Finance Department suggested.  It is in constant conspiracy with representatives of Finance against the other departments of State.  I have noticed a tendency in the Committee to regard its functions not so much as a tribunal to keep the balance between Finance and the other Departments, but as a public prosecutor or devil's advocate with the dice loaded against all the Departments except the Finance Department. I have noticed that some members of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House, and also in the Committee of Public Accounts, fondly imagine that <Col N="2092" /> when they are persecuting some particular official, or demanding some impossible economy, the administration trembles to its foundations.  These poor, innocent people are entirely mistaken. There is more joy in the Department of Finance at one Fianna Fáil Deputy advocating some impossible reduction than at 99 just Deputies advocating an absolutely essential expenditure of money.  That is what they have not yet realised.</P>
    <P>The Committee has accepted the doctrine that the authority of the Department of Finance is absolute.  The Committee itself is not responsible for the fact that the Minister for Finance is an infinitely more important and more influential person than the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England. The success of Treasury control in England is largely due to the fact that the head of the Treasury is, <i>ipso facto,</i> the Prime Minister.  The First Lord of the Treasury becomes, <i>ipso facto,</i> Prime Minister.  In this country, the Minister for Finance combines the functions of Chancellor of the Exchequer and watchdog of the Treasury.  I am fortified in my opinion on this matter by the fact that, in the first year, the President himself held the office of Minister for Finance.  There is no country in the world, so far as I know, where the Treasury control of other Departments is so great as in this country.  There is no country in the world where the Departments, and the Ministers responsible for those Departments, are so bound up by regulations and so controlled by Parliament and where they have so little freedom of action.  The tendency of the Committee of Public Accounts has been to enter into a joint partnership with the Department of Finance for the purpose of interfering in all Departments. That is the impression I got&mdash;that the tendency was to reduce this State, in the end, to a modified bureaucracy. The traditions of the Treasury have been accepted as gospel.  The Committee have not accepted the traditions of the other great Departments of State in England.  That is only one of the weaknesses of the present position. In England, simultaneous with the growth of the traditions and rights of <Col N="2093" /> the Treasury, there grew up the customs and practices of the other great Departments&mdash;the War Office, the Home Office, the Foreign Office, and so on.  These traditions have protected those Departments from the encroachments of the Treasury.  In Ireland, that is not the case.  It is the Treasury alone that decides.  The other Departments, apparently, have no rights; they have only duties.  The Committee of Public Accounts has supported that situation and, in its Reports, it has been virtually, from the very beginning, the loud-speaker of the Treasury.  I myself do not believe that the regulations of the British Treasury, whether written or unwritten, were ever designed for or suited to the position created by an Irish Revolution or an Irish Civil War.  The pathetic obedience of the Committee to those regulations often results in rather comic situations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>A question was raised as to whether or not the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General were limited.  An attempt has been made to limit them.  That question is dealt with in the report.  I think it is the principal question dealt with in the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde began by quoting paragraph 42 of the report, which we are now considering. That paragraph states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;On further consideration, however, this Committee is of opinion that it is undesirable to deal with a charge which recurs annually in a manner which appears to limit the powers conferred on the Comptroller <Col N="2094" /> and Auditor-General, who is required by the terms of the statutes defining the duties and powers of his office ... to examine on behalf of the Dáil every Appropriation Account, other than those in which a specific indication to the contrary appears on the face of the Estimate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That paragraph does seem to raise the question of the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, generally, and his powers in this particular instance. In other parts of the report, the Department of Finance is mentioned, and the Committee states its view in regard to relations between the Department of Finance and other departments where that question arose. That would seem to bring what Deputy Esmonde is saying about the Department of Finance into order.  I was carefully listening to the Deputy to ensure that he would not lead us into a discussion on the general functions of the Department of Finance.  The relations of the Committee of Public Accounts to the Department of Finance in respect of the work the Committee has to do is relevant, but I will hear the Chairman of the Committee at any moment on that question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point I would like to get explained.  It appears that the particular section of the Report to which Deputy Esmonde is referring was inserted as an amendment to the Draft Report of the Chairman, on the motion of Deputy Cooper.  It was agreed to without a division by the Committee of which Deputy Esmonde was a member and at a meeting at which he was present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned&mdash;and I am very grateful&mdash; with explaining Deputy Esmonde or any other Deputy to the House.  I am certainly concerned with seeing that Deputy Esmonde is in order.  The terms of the Report bring the matters <Col N="2095" /> that Deputy Esmonde is discussing into order, but it would not be in order to discuss generally the functions of the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it is in order to deal with the private happenings at the Committee.  As Deputy Lemass has raised the question, perhaps I am entitled to explain the situation. I am criticising the Public Accounts Committee not because it has done wrong&mdash;in fact I think it has done admirable work&mdash;but I am trying to point out a few defects in the system.  I am the only member of this House who has assisted in the drawing up of these Reports, and I am trying to give my experience on the Committee during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the particular point with reference to military service pensions, I will deal with that later.  I accepted Deputy Cooper's amendment merely because I was aware that the Committee was opposed to my views.  I agreed with the amendment because had I not agreed with it the report would have been worse than it is, as the Committee would have passed the original proposal of the chairman.  I was dealing with the intensely pathetic adherence of the Committee to the traditions of the British Treasury and the Treasury regulations.  That, as I have said, brings the Committee into ridiculous situations.  For instance, there is a matter which I have raised in discussions at the Public Accounts Committee, and that is the continued increase of Appropriations-in-Aid.  The Accounting Officer of the Department of Finance at the very beginning of the work of the Committee four years ago stated he was strongly of opinion that this practice of Appropriations-in-Aid was a violation of Article 61 of the Constitution.  This extraordinary practice of Appropriations-in-Aid exists only in England, and is one the value of which I never understood. When I suggested to the Committee that it might urge on the Department of Finance the desirability of uniformity in public accounts the Committee enthusiastically rejected the suggestion because of its intense affection for old British traditions, and stated that it had the greatest regard for <Col N="2096" /> Appropriations-in-Aid and wished to retain them.</P>
    <P>Another case arose in the course of the discussion of this Report.  The British Treasury have certain regulations dealing with travelling expenses. As an interesting survival of the British regime there are special travelling expenses for Great Britain, and special travelling expenses for Ireland, and then travelling expenses for abroad.  In a small item which arose in the accounts mention was made of an officer travelling to London.  I suggested to the Committee to substitute for London the word &ldquo;abroad&rdquo; in order to show there is some difference between this country and London, but members of the Fianna Fáil Party on the Committee unanimously and enthusiastically proclaimed that in their opinion London was not &ldquo;abroad&rdquo; and insisted on regarding themselves as at home in London.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Esmonde would state why in the opinion of some members of the Committee of Public Accounts it was considered in this particular instance London could not be classed as abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to indicate to Deputy Esmonde that he was perfectly correct in saying at the beginning that the Comptroller and Auditor-General could not be criticised, but the Committee of Public Accounts could.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General has made a report arising out of purely financial considerations. The Committee considers that report in the same way and reports to the Dáil.  It is advisable that the House should consider the report of the Committee in the same manner. The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts said so, and the Deputy did not disagree, although I do not know whether he agrees or disagrees&mdash;that the Committee had discussed these matters in a financial and not a political sense.  I think it would be advisable if the Deputy said what the Committee thought without particularising the Party to which members of the Committee belong.  Otherwise we will have a discussion on the very basis which, in the view of the <Col N="2097" /> Chairman of the Committee, and it is my own very strong view, is not a proper basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I know in my criticism of the Committee, and the tendency of the Committee, I am not expressing the opinions, possibly, of the majority of the members of this House.  I am attempting to express what will be the opinions of the majority, or the unanimous opinions of the members of this House in four or five years time, when the present process of unnecessary interference has advanced to such a state that the Committee and the House will be obliged to make an ignominious retreat if the elementary efficiency of public departments is to be preserved.  I have the utmost respect and admiration for the great work done on the Committee of Public Accounts by Deputy Johnson, who certainly succeeded in stabilising the procedure of the Committee in a very difficult time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only knowledge we had in the matter was that of British procedure, and we had to adopt that, at any rate for the time being.  The work Deputy Johnson did in that respect is of great importance and will be remembered in the history of the foundation of the State.  There is another picture, which the Minister for Industry and Commerce hinted at, of Deputy Johnson sitting on the Committee of Public Accounts year after year like a vast spider weaving a web of red tape which stretches to all the nooks and crannies of the Government offices.  Since Deputy Johnson ceased to be a member of the Committee other spiders equally industrious have come to the fore&mdash; Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Good, Deputy Cooper, and to some extent the Chairman. If the good work of spinning this great web of red tape continues at the present rate, in a few years time when the great day comes and some other party gets control of Government Buildings <Col N="2098" /> they will find they are bound hand and foot, incapable of thought or action, and in fact they will be reduced to the position of a cabinet of corpses in the vaults of St. Michan's Church.  They may say it is only for the present Government the red tape is intended, but I think when the time comes they will be caught in their own trap.  As far as paragraph 42 is concerned, as the Chairman pointed out, this question should not be discussed in a party manner.  I absolutely agree with that, but I would like to point out that this question, I am sorry to say, has been made one of party politics.  It certainly was a question at issue in the last two elections, and the incidentals of it are used to fill up the vacant spaces in certain newspapers.  It has been made to a certain extent a question of party politics, and that makes it difficult to discuss it very strictly leaving out all questions of party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, my feelings as to the matter are expressed clearly in the Report of the Public Accounts <Col N="2100" /> Committee&mdash;in Section 18, subsection (3).  That is the amendment I proposed to the draft Report of the Chairman.  I think I am entitled to read out the reasons which led the Committee to sanction the action of the Department of Defence.  The reasons were these:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  That, by reason of its nature, the information contained in the documents in question was of a character that rendered it undesirable in the public interest that it should be made available, either now or for many years to come, to any person whatsoever.  The matters which the Board investigated were of a type bearing a strong analogy to those ordinarily the subject of secret service, the Vote for which is specifically exempt from audit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General;</P>
      <P>2.  That stringent assurances that their statements and evidence would be regarded as confidential were given by the Board to applicants and witnesses in order to enable the Board to secure the evidence necessary to arrive at its reports;</P>
      <P>3.  That, from the nature of the investigation which the Board of Assessors was called upon to make, difficult questions of fact would have arisen in the interpretation of pre-Truce military service; that only a Board of very specially qualified persons could ascertain these facts; and that accordingly its findings on such facts should not be open to review by any other authority.  The Committee is further aware that the Minister for Defence had been advised by the Attorney-General that he had not legal power to demand from the Board the production of the required documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a fair account of the reasons which led the Public Accounts Committee to approve of the action of the Department of Defence.  It is quite obvious that the Committee of Public Accounts has no power whatever to limit the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  There is no authority of any kind to do such a thing.  The words of the Report are <Col N="2101" /> somewhat vague in that respect.  It states:&mdash;&ldquo;It is a matter which appears to limit the powers.&rdquo;  It does not say definitely an attempt is made to limit the powers, or that the powers have been limited, but &ldquo;it appears to limit the powers.&rdquo;  I do not believe that any of the statutory powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General are limited or attempted to be limited by the Report of the Public Accounts Committee. I do not believe that any limit has been put to the powers conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor-General by the custom and practice of the British Treasury and the working of the Acts in Great Britain.  If it is found that an attempt was made to limit the statutory powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, then steps will have to be taken to deal with the matter.  If, on the other hand, it only limits the customary powers granted to the Auditor-General in Great Britain.  I do not see where the actual necessity for action arises.  I am quite satisfied that the action of the Committee in approving of the action of the Department of Defence is in strict accord even with the traditions of the British Treasury and the British Committee of Public Accounts.  A very clear precedent appears in the Report of the Public Accounts Committee of 1875, and, strangely, it deals with this country.  It is a Report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General on accounts dealing with the Commissioners of Church Temporalities in Ireland. Under the Irish Church Act, Commissioners have been appointed with judicial or quasi-judicial powers.  A question arose as to whether their findings were to be investigated by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The Report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been distinctly admitted, on the part of the Commissioners, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has the fullest right to require vouchers of payments to be produced to him.  The terms of a Minute dated 6th January, 1874, adverse to this right, have been qualified and explained in evidence and by a subsequent Minute.  Nor is it disputed that it would be his duty to point out a departure from the express provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2102" />&ldquo;It has been not less distinctly admitted that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has no right to call in question the finality of a decision or Order of the Commissioners deliberately made in their character of judges of law and fact under the Irish Church Act.  He disclaims ever having disputed such finality, and adds that he never differed from the Commissioners upon a point of law without diffidence, recognising that the functions of his Department are primarily financial.  Again, the Comptroller and Auditor-General cannot claim that the Commissioners should furnish him with the reason of, or justify their judicial decisions to him; any information or explanation they may have, or may hereafter afford him, of the grounds of any such decision is a voluntary act on their part.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The opinion of the law officers of the State in this country is that the Board of Assessors is a quasi-judicial body.  I think in that capacity their rights are very similar to those of the Commissioners appointed under the Irish Church Act. There is certainly one thing which the Dáil will have to decide sooner or later. When there is a conflict of opinion between the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the law advisers of the Government as to the interpretation of an Act of this Oireachtas, what authority is able to decide?  That is the problem.  I do not know.  Certainly it is one which will have to be either explained to the House or legislated for in the House.  Such conflicts have arisen in the course of examination of public accounts.  At present there seems to be no machinery for co-ordinating the interpretation of an Act between these two authorities.  That, I think, is a matter which the Dáil will have to consider, possibly in the near future.  In conclusion, I only wish to state it is quite obvious that Treasury control is absolutely essential for the proper conduct of the Departments of State. Although I have criticised the methods of the Treasury, I fully realise that Treasury control is absolutely essential. Also I realise that Parliamentary control over expenditure is absolutely <Col N="2103" /> essential.  The rights of the House ought to be maintained.  But there is a very great difference between control and dictation.  There is a great difference between control and unnecessary interference.  There is a just medium in these matters, and as yet, I will admit, I am of opinion that the balance has not yet been reached.  I think the present tendency which is visible in the public accounts, if continued, will result in a considerable weakening of the efficiency of the Departments of State.</P>

      <P>It is rather difficult for a Deputy who has not the constitutional experience of Deputy Esmonde to quite grasp his purpose when he complains about the Committee of Public Accounts tying up the Departments of the Government in reams of red tape.  It seems to me, as one who has not been a member of that Committee, that it is its function to draw the attention of the Dáil to any irregularity on the part of the Government or any Government Department in administering the funds which this Dáil voted.  The Report that is now under consideration contains many references to acts of irregularity on the part of different Government Departments. If the Committee of this House which considered them is of opinion that the continuance of these irregularities is not in the public interest, then it is surely up to this Dáil to restrict the Departments concerned from repeating the offence, whether <Col N="2104" /> they restrict them by tying them hand and foot with red tape or by any other method that Deputy Esmonde can suggest.  Certainly when we read in this Report, as has been pointed out by Deputy Davin, that in the Post Office Department, for example, officials who were responsible for the loss of a sum of £64 were not proceeded against in the law courts, despite the advice of the Ministry of Finance that they should be proceeded against, because some high official of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs decided that it was not in the public interest to disclose the facts concerned in it, I think it is the duty of the Deputies here to ensure that such a thing will not occur again, and if any public official of this State is responsible for the mis-appropriation of public funds that he will be made amenable in a court of law. Certainly the statement of Deputy Davin that the number of irregularities which took place in the past in the administration of public funds is being reduced, is a statement with which no one can disagree.  It, however, throws into greater relief the particular matters which the Committee thought fit to refer to in the Report now published. We have to bear in mind, of course, that the matters referred to all occurred at a time when the relationship between the Government and this Dáil was on a different basis from what it now is.  In the years 1925 and 1926, to which these accounts refer, the Government's position in this House was much securer than it is now, and they permitted the security of their position to influence their judgment when they thought they could do public good in an irregular manner. The case referred to, the case of the Queenstown Port and Docks Company, in which money that was voted for the relief of unemployment was given in the form of a subsidy to a private company, is a case in point.  No doubt, the manner in which the money was expended did help to relieve unemployment, but the Dáil should have been expressly informed that it was the intention of the Government to use the money advanced in that particular manner.  The case mentioned in connection with the Department of <Col N="2105" /> Fisheries is very similar.  I have no doubt whatever if the Minister for Fisheries, when he wanted this £104 which he borrowed from a private individual, had come to the Dáil and asked the Dáil to vote that amount to keep the knitting industry in Donegal in existence the Dáil would not have any hesitation in giving the money. The Minister for Fisheries, apparently, was anxious to avoid bringing the matter up in the Dáil, and he borrowed the sum required from a private individual, until the Estimate came up in the ordinary way in the next year, and it was possible to secure the repayment of the sum.  The same criticism applies to some extent to the references on the Vote for clothing for the Army Reserve.  In this case, the amount required was secured from the Dáil some twelve months before it was needed, and the Committee point out that the intention was obviously to ensure that the reduction would appear in the Estimates for the following year. Deputies in opposition who have not got the information which Ministers have concerning the business of the Government, but who are, no doubt, just as anxious as the Ministers to base their policies and arguments upon accurate information, cannot possibly do so if incorrect Estimates and incorrect statements are made to them concerning the amounts required by public departments each year, and the amount expended by each Department each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is juggling with figures in this manner it will be impossible for private Deputies to know exactly what is the position of the State or any particular Department of the State.  The two matters that are, of course, of greatest importance mentioned in the report deal with Army Pensions and the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  In the case of the refusal to submit to the Comptroller and Auditor-General the data on which these pensions were awarded, we think the House is entitled to have full explanations as to the reason which caused the Government to arrive at that decision.  There can be no doubt whatever, that on general principles it is undesirable that large sums of public money should be voted to private individuals on grounds that <Col N="2106" /> no one except the Government is aware of.  No doubt the Minister for Defence, if he deals with this matter, will make a statement similar to that which he made when the Supplementary Estimate for the Army Pensions was introduced early this year.  The Minister then informed us of something that I, at any rate, had no knowledge of before, that it was estimated that the total number of Army pensions would be 3,050.  He said that he had discharged his duty to the Dáil and to the country when, at the request of a Deputy on these benches, he published a list of these pensioners and the amount awarded to each of them.  He said:</P>
    <P>In response to questions from various Deputies, I had a list issued of all pensioners, giving the amounts of their pensions and the counties in which they reside... If anyone comes along and proves that a man received a pension on false pretences, there is, of course, a perfectly simple legal method of dealing with him.</P>
    <P>The Minister was walking very near the border line of truth in that statement. The list published, in so far as it conveyed information to anyone as to who was or was not in receipt of pensions, was practically valueless.  There may be strong arguments against publishing the actual data on which a pension was awarded, in so far as it relates to service given by each individual, but I cannot see what argument can be used to withhold publication of the period of service given by each individual, the unit in which he served, and his address.  If one gets a long list containing 3,050 names it is impossible, if there are a half-dozen John Murphys, all coming from the city of Dublin, to know which John Murphy each name refers to.  It was really an attempt to confuse things by withholding information when that list was published.  It was not intended to enlighten Deputies, but to confuse them as to the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Fitzgerald) Desmond FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of personal explanation I am not quite sure, but I think I explained at the time that continual questioning as to lists was putting <Col N="2107" /> an undue burden on the Department, and would require a great deal of work at a time when the Department was particularly busy.  I think any Deputy who takes the trouble to consider the amount of time and labour required in preparing all the data published for no specific purpose&mdash;no reason was given for publication&mdash;will see that there was no desire to conceal things, but there was a desire to save unnecessary expenditure of public money and a great deal of public time in preparing lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that the list was published in the form in which it was published in order to save public money.  Deputies on this side of the House are just as anxious to save public money as the Minister, but it is because we believe that money is being spent in a manner in which we think that it should not be expended that we want that information.  I have no doubt that if we had the information we asked for we would be able to produce cases, amongst the people who are in receipt of pensions, of false pretences and be able to take, as the Minister assured us we could take, a perfectly simple legal method of dealing with them.  I think the amount of public money that would be saved by this publication would be far greater than the Minister thinks would be saved by withholding the information. No doubt the officials of his Department took a long time to prepare the list that was published.  They went, I think, to great pains to publish the list in a form that would convey information to no one.  Surely if there is ordinary efficiency in the office of the Minister for Defence, the list of persons in receipt of pensions are tabulated under the heading of the counties they come from, or in alphabetical or some such order.  The list that was supplied did not give the names of the pensioners in alphabetical order.  It did not give them in the order of counties; it did not give them in the order of rank, or the amount of pensions they were receiving. I suggest that the Minister deliberately instructed his officials to take the complete list of pensioners, box them up and publish the list in a <Col N="2108" /> form that would give most trouble to anyone who was trying to analyse it. If the time and trouble taken in preparing the list in that form was expended in giving the full information asked for, there would have been no extra expenditure, this House would be in a much better position in relation to this matter, and would know exactly who was getting&mdash;pensions, and for what.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to say definitely why he will not state in the case of each pensioner the unit he served in: I want him to state why he will not state in the case of each pensioner the period of service for which he was awarded a pension; I want him to state why he will not give in the case of each pensioner sufficient information as to the address that would enable anyone to identify him.  That has nothing to do with the statements furnished by the claimants when they went before the Board of Assessors.  No doubt a number of pensioners may have made statements before the Board of Assessors that it would not be advisable to publish. The information I am asking for is the period for which the pensioner served, the rank, and the address.  It cannot be against the public interest to publish that.  The Minister seems to think that it is scurrilous on the part of Deputies on this side of the House to ask for information.  At least, judging by the remarks he made on the Supplementary Estimate, he seemed to think that by asking for that information we were insinuating that there must be some reason for withholding the information, and that Deputies at this side were guilty of some form of scurrility.</P>

      <P>Might I remind the Deputy that we are not now discussing the information withheld from this House, but information withheld from the Comptroller and Auditor-General with regard to certain pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Comptroller and Auditor-General states that he was supplied with a list of pensions, the amounts awarded in each case, and that the Government Department concerned refused to give any additional information. <Col N="2109" /> It is for this House to say to the Government that they demand that the additional information be given, additional information which, by no stretch of the imagination, can it be argued is against the public interest to give.</P>
      <P>The attitude of this party towards the whole question of military service pensions is well known, and I am not going to deal with it here.  These pensions are being given by an Act passed by this House, and in view of the fact that a large section of the people is opposed to giving them at all, we think that the Government in its own interests should be very slow to do anything in connection with them that might appear to be sharp practice.  That is what they are doing; they are withholding information that there can be no justification for withholding, and whatever information they do give they give in a manner that makes it practically valueless.  I hope that the Minister will state the reasons why that information is being withheld, and if it is the intention to continue to withhold from the House, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor-General the information which they want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter which was referred to at length in the Report is the matter of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act. In connection with that, Deputy Davin stated that it was not in accord with the intentions of the Act that the State security should only be a second charge upon the assets.  He also stated that the Act should be amended so as to remove all doubts as to the conditions under which a loan could be guaranteed. The burden of his remarks in connection with the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act is, I think, contained in these two sentences.  I cannot agree that he is correct in the first one.  There does not appear to be in the Act any limitations upon the power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give a guarantee &ldquo;in such manner and form and under such terms and conditions as he shall think proper, subject to the limitations hereinafter imposed and subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  I do suggest, however, that when the Minister is introducing the Bill to extend this Act, which he has stated will be introduced <Col N="2110" /> next month, when the present Act expires, he should consider the advisability of ensuring some form of direct sanction from this House in the case of any loans guaranteed upon insufficient assets.</P>
    <P>I think a very strong case might be made out in favour of granting State loans in cases where there would be no assets at all, where, in fact, the only asset that could be placed against a loan would be the honesty of the proprietor of the firm concerned and the prospects of the firm.  But in such cases there should be some check upon the decisions arrived at by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, not merely in the interests of the Dáil as a whole, but also in the interests of the Minister himself.  If there are cases, as there appear to be, in which loans were guaranteed secured upon assets that did not or would not, if realised, repay the entire amount of the loan, or if there are cases where a prior charge upon the assets was in front of the State charge, then it would be desirable that the sanction of the House, or of a committee of the House, should be obtained beforehand.</P>
    <P>I also think that Deputy Davin's suggestion that the Act should be amended so as to remove all doubts as to the conditions under which a loan could be guaranteed is a wise one.  I understand that the Minister claims that his action in connection with the three firms that came within its terms by process of reconstruction was perfectly legal, and that he has legal opinion to that effect.  The Committee of Public Accounts apparently has a different opinion, and it would be in the public interest that any doubts in the matter should be removed.  As the amending Bill will be introduced in the course of a month or so, the occasion should be availed of to define the term &ldquo;capital expenditure&rdquo; in such a manner as to cover the action that the Minister has already taken, and to permit him without any doubt as to his legality, to take similar action in the future.</P>
    <P>I think that that is all I have to say in connection with this Report, but I do hope that we will have full statements from the Minister for Defence, <Col N="2111" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister for Finance concerning the different matters that are raised here, because I think it is undesirable that important issues like those raised in this Report should be treated in the flippant manner in which Deputy Esmonde has thought fit to treat them.  They are matters that do concern the welfare of the public and the authority of the Dáil over all matters concerning public finance, and definite statements in the Report of the Committee should be treated in a definite manner by Ministers, and their attitude in relation to them clearly and definitely defined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>This Report can be looked at from many points of view. Deputy Lemass apparently looks upon it as a hat-peg, upon which he can hang speeches which may be and certainly are made on the Estimates, and which can be made on the Bill which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is to introduce.  But Deputy Esmonde is more serious; Deputy Esmonde looks upon this Report as a thorn in the flesh, a dangerous symptom.  I hope that Deputy Esmonde feels better, now that he has delivered himself.  Evidently for four years, during three of which I have been a colleague of his on the Committee of Public Accounts, he has been nourishing his sorrow in secret, and it has grown, grown, grown. I hope now, in the terms of the psycho-analysts, that he has liberated his complex and that he feels happy. Of course I knew that Deputy Esmonde was not satisfied with all that we did. He moved occasional amendments to the Report.  An historical one was about London, when he wanted to substitute &ldquo;abroad&rdquo; for &ldquo;London.&rdquo;  I was enthusiastically in favour of &ldquo;London&rdquo; for the simple reason that I believe in giving the Dáil the most detailed information possible whenever I can do so without using too many words, and I do think that members of the Dáil and members of the Committee who have not had a university education are aware that London is not in the Saorstát.  I would have gone further if necessary and would have referred to Oxford; I would have preferred <Col N="2112" /> Oxford as against London, because Oxford is not in the Saorstát either.  I think the real reason for Deputy Esmonde's feelings is one of disappointment.  Deputy Esmonde spoke of the Committee of Public Accounts as a tribunal&mdash;that it should be a tribunal to settle contentions between the Department of Finance and the other Government Departments.  I sympathise with Deputy Esmonde's disappointment. He thought that the Committee would be nothing but a prize fight, but instead of that he found that it was more like a mother's meeting. The position of a man who thinks he is going to referee at a prize fight and then finds himself thrown into the middle of a very harmonious discussion, with very little contention at all, is a position of acute disappointment. But the function of the Committee is not to act as a tribunal to settle disputes between the Department of Finance and other Departments; its function is to see that money voted by this Dáil is expended for the purpose for which it was voted.  In doing so it has to realise that to some extent the Department of Finance is a permanent body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee changes its composition from year to year, and it changes as the result of elections; the Department of Finance will go on; it will have an assured practice and a definite mode of dealing with questions.  There will be contention in the Committee between the Comptroller and Auditor-General and Government departments, including the Department of Finance, and we have always found&mdash;I speak with three years' experience&mdash;that there are two view-points.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General says: &ldquo;In my opinion this is illegal,&rdquo; and the Department concerned immediately comes up and says: &ldquo;The Attorney-General says it is legal.&rdquo; Then Deputy Esmonde asks in a very pertinent sentence: &ldquo;Who is to decide?&rdquo; I can tell him at once that neither the Committee nor the Dáil can decide.  Our function is not to interpret the law, but to make it.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General cannot give a final decision; the Attorney-General cannot give a final decision.  Obviously the only body who can possibly give a final decision, <Col N="2113" /> if the issue is sufficiently serious to make a decision absolutely essential, is the courts.  The only body that has the function of interpreting the law is the courts, and if the matter is of sufficient importance it must be taken to the courts.  Certainly neither the Committee nor the Dáil are in a position to decide between these two contentions. Deputy Esmonde made the statement that the Committee challenged decisions of the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>That they discussed them, and that was misleading.  I asked Deputy Esmonde for an instance and he gave me one.  You would infer from that that the Committee had said something about decisions of the courts in their Report.  That is the inference. There is not a word in the Report. I spent some time hunting in the Report for the reference.  What happened was this.  It was a case of property losses compensation.  We did not discuss the decision of the courts, but what we did discuss was whether the Department concerned in defending the claim had brought the case properly before the courts and had the necessary knowledge that it had brought the case properly before the courts.  There was some doubt about it.  Question No. 251, put by the Chairman, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It is a case, I think, where the Comptroller and Auditor-General should refer again to the files to satisfy himself that the State Department did exercise due care in obtaining knowledge and in the presentation of the case to the court.</P>
      <P>I do not think we exceeded our duties in that respect at all, and the State Department concerned was that very Department of Finance which Deputy Esmonde says we are too subservient to.</P>
      <P>The functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General were discussed at length by Deputy Esmonde.  It was remarkable that when he read the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act. 1923 that he did not read the whole of Section 7:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2114" /> (1) It shall be the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to control all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas at such times and in such manner as shall from time to time be prescribed by law.</P>
    <P>(2) It shall also be the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to report to Dáil Eireann on such matters and at such periods and times as shall from time to time be prescribed by law or required by resolution of Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>(3) Unless and until it shall be otherwise provided by the Oireachtas, the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall have and exercise all such powers and perform all such duties as are prescribed by this Act or are conferred or imposed on him by any Act of the Parliament of the late United Kingdom...</P>
    <P>This Act which is the latest Act and which is our own Act quite definitely prescribes that it is his duty to control all disbursements and audit all accounts.  I think that obviously when you say to a man it is your duty to do this, and say that without exception, you do confer on the Comptroller and Auditor-General the duty of examining every account.  It has been questioned whether it was wise and whether he acted wisely.  I think he acted fully within his powers in every case.</P>
    <P>There is one specific matter arising on the Report that I would like to refer to and that Deputy Davin did not refer to.  That is the matter of an honorarium paid to the Chairman of a Temporary Commission and paid without the knowledge of the Oireachtas.  I hope when the Minister for Finance replies he will assure us that that is a precedent he will not follow.  I do not dispute the fact that the gentleman who received the honorarium performed most valuable work and rendered very useful service and probably he was well deserving of it.  But a substantial payment of this character should not be made without the matter being brought to the notice of the Dáil, because it obviously opens the <Col N="2115" /> door to abuses.  Suppose, for instance, that the Minister for Finance says that Deputy Davin, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, is deserving of an honorarium.</P>

      <P>Probably it might be as well if the Deputy included Deputy Ryan's name in this with my name.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly include Deputy Ryan's name, but I do not know that it will make the parallel more convincing.  Let us suppose that subsequent to the receipt of the honorarium Deputy Davin went into the Government Lobby&mdash;I cannot conceive Deputy Ryan doing that&mdash;there would be a certain atmosphere of suspicion if it was found that a substantial sum of money had been paid to a Deputy and subsequently that Deputy happened to support the Government, even though he did it with the best motives in the world.  That is why I think it is undesirable to have large sums of money paid to individuals, even outside the Dáil, without it being clearly brought to the notice of the Dáil that the money was being voted and expended.</P>
      <P>As regards Army pensions, I concur with the report.  I take a rather different view to that taken by Deputy Davin.  Deputy Davin is of opinion that these papers should be made available. I personally think they could not be made available without grievous injury to individuals.  If they are made available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General he must be at liberty to publish some comment on them; otherwise there is no use in having them.  He must be at liberty to report on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These papers&mdash;I have not seen very many of them&mdash;are concerned not merely with the applicants, but with statements of individuals quoted by the applicants, and referees quoted by the applicants, to whom the Board of Assessors applied for information, and who gave that information under a pledge of secrecy.  They gave the information <Col N="2116" /> under a pledge that the evidence would not be published.  The Board may not have right or power to give that pledge, but at the same time it was given, and if those papers are now published it will make it much harder for a Government Department to obtain information in future, especially having given an undertaking that it would be secret and now being obliged to disregard that undertaking.  In future it could be said, &ldquo;I gave you evidence in confidence and it was published.&rdquo;  That is a very strong objection to the publication of these papers.  All this matter should have been foreseen when the Act was passed, and it should have been definitely stated in the Act that application forms and evidence shall not be submitted.  Of course, all the claims are properly vouched.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General knows who is getting the money.  The only thing is the original application is not available. nor is the evidence on which the pension was granted.  I think it should be regularised now either by resolution or by an amending Bill.  For that reason I concur with the Report.  The present arrangement is not one that you could continue.  It is extremely bad, and I think the Minister for Finance ought seriously to consider this matter.  We have heard a quotation from the Minister for Industry and Commerce about red tape.  Deputy Davin quoted the Minister.  I find the Minister on Thursday of last week said:</P>
    <P>If the Public Accounts Committee is to insist rigidly on certain things being observed, the more insistent they are on a rigid observance of rules the more red tape there is going to be, the more minuting there is going to be from one civil servant to another, and the more delay there is going to be.  The House has it in its own hands to relax all that and to institute another system.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will not relax all that and institute another system.  Red tape properly used is a very useful thing.  If you have matters to deal with and you have no red tape, and no method of segregating one type of document from another, there would be a much worse system in vogue.  I firmly believe that the machinery of the <Col N="2117" /> Public Accounts Committee and of the Comptroller and Auditor-General are valuable elements in the State.  It is not, perhaps, for a member of the Committee to boost up that Committee, but I hope this debate will not pass by without some reference being made to the Chairman of the Committee in former years, Mr. Johnson, who did a very great deal of work on that Committee, work along the right lines, in spite of what Deputy Esmonde has said.</P>
    <P>The Committee serves not only to ventilate things, but it has been a very powerful lever in the direction of economy.  If anybody reads the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of three or four years ago on the Army Estimates and compares it with the current report he will realise the improvement made.  The bulk of the credit is due to the Army Finance Office, no doubt, but I cannot help thinking that the Committee was a useful weapon for the Army Finance Office to have at their back.  They are in the position to say: &ldquo;I could not get that passed by the Committee of Public Accounts,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;The Comptroller and Auditor-General will not receive it.&rdquo;  That is to my mind a most valuable function in the State.  I believe it is being exercised cleanly and decently, and most certainly after three years' experience I must say the work has been carried out with an entire absence of Party spirit on the part of the Committee members.  There was one occasion when during the heat of an election the Chairman used certain remarks.  They were to be regretted, and they are only to be accounted for by the heat of an election. The work has been, on the whole, conducted free from any Party spirit, and that freedom, I am happy to say, continues to the present day.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin and, I think, Deputy Cooper suggested that I should give verbally the substance of the Minute that is normally prepared in the Department of Finance on the Report of the Public Accounts Committee. I am not in a position to do that.  This Report was signed at what was the busiest period of the year for me personally and for my Department. I have been unable to give any consideration to the Report up to the present, <Col N="2118" /> and I can only try to have the minutes supplied as early as possible, and if further discussion is necessary an opportunity can be given.  There are one or two questions to which Deputy Davin refers, and which I would like to deal with.  He referred to the question of certain officials who have been guilty of defalcations in the Post Office and who have not been prosecuted. The Executive Council agreed with me that no money lost through defalcation, through default, should be written off without a prosecution, but the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at that time was not a member of the Executive Council, and there was no means of getting him to accept the view of the Executive Council, and consequently we were only able to deal with the matter by disallowing it, or by refusing to write it off and having the matter dealt with and commented on by the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to paragraph 42, I do not know how many Deputies who have commented from time to time on the refusal to submit the papers of the Board of Assessors to the Comptroller and Auditor-General have read the Military Service Pensions Act of 1924, because it seems to me to be perfectly clear from that Act that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is not entitled to receive the papers.  The Act sets up such procedure in relation to these pensions, and it removes from the Minister discretion that either the Minister for Finance or the Minister of the particular Department concerned would normally have in regard to pensions. I will take up the time of the Dáil for a moment or two in reading some of the passages of the Act.  Section 2, sub-section (1) of the Act states, that persons to whom this Act applies may apply to the Minister and the Minister may grant to him a certificate of military service.  Sub-section (2) of Section 2 says: &ldquo;The Minister shall refer every such application for a certificate of military service to a Board of Assessors appointed under this Act to hear all such applications and shall, before granting any such certificate, take into consideration the report made by the Board of Assessors, and subject to the provisions of this Act shall grant or refuse a certificate of military service <Col N="2119" /> in accordance with such report.&rdquo; That is, in the normal case the Minister has no discretion whatever in regard, to the issuing of a certificate of military service.  The Minister is bound by the report of the Board of Assessors. He is not entitled to query their findings; he is not entitled to have the information or the evidence which that Board of Assessors had before them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say then what is the meaning of the words, &ldquo;shall grant or refuse a certificate of military service&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The words, &ldquo;shall grant or refuse a certificate of military service in accordance with the report&rdquo; are the words of the section.  If the report says that there has been military service the Minister must grant the certificate.  If the report says that there has not been military service he must refuse the certificate.  He has no discretion.  Section 3 of this Act says: &ldquo;A Board of Assessors... shall be constituted under this Act and shall consist of three members who shall be appointed by the Minister with the approval of the Executive Council, and one of whom shall be a person who at the date of his appointment is a Judge of the Supreme Court, High Court.  Circuit Court, or District Court of Saorstát Eireann, or is a practising barrister of not less than ten years' standing.&rdquo; That section indicates plainly that it was intended that the Board should have something of a judicial character, and in point of fact there was appointed as Chairman of that Board a District Justice who holds office from which he cannot, practically speaking, be dismissed, and who is not subject to the control of the Executive Council in any way.</P>

      <P>The Board has been dissolved.  The Deputy is speaking <Col N="2120" /> about another matter; he is talking about another Board which has to deal with wound pensions and other matters. It has nothing to do with military service pensions.  The Minister for Defence informs me now that it is not dissolved, but it is not operating. The staff has been dispensed with actually.  District Justice Beatty is Chairman.  The Deputy was referring to quite another matter.  Sub-section (2) of Section 3 says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Board ...shall examine every application for a certificate of military service referred to them by the Minister, and they shall for that purpose make all such inquiries, summon all such witnesses, and take all such evidence, whether on oath or otherwise, as may appear to them necessary and proper for the purpose of making reports to the Minister as to the military service of the applicant.&rdquo;  That section indicates that the proceedings would of necessity be something like the proceedings of a court.  It is perfectly evident to me that if we take all these sections together that there was no right whatever and no duty whatever on the Comptroller and Auditor-General to examine the evidence that was before this Board; and, furthermore, that the evidence was of such a character that the Comptroller and Auditor-General could not properly weigh or examine it.  I have no doubt that when the Act was passed, so far as this matter of military service was concerned, it was intended that the Board of Assessors' findings should be treated as the findings of a court.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General, when he is examining the expenditure of, say, the Department of Finance, in connection with payments made for, say, compensation, does not go behind the decrees of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the decrees may be right or that they may be wrong.  They may be in excess or they may be too low, but the Comptroller and Auditor-General is satisfied, when he has the decree of the court before him.  It was certainly the intention when this Act was passed that the investigations of the Comptroller and Auditor-General should begin at the point when the report of the Board of Assessors in regard <Col N="2121" /> to service of the applicant was made.  Deputy Davin said that a certain person had been dismissed in disgrace from the Army, and that he had been given a pension by the Board of Assessors, and that that fact illustrated the need for submitting the files of the Board of Assessors to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The making of that statement by Deputy Davin indicates to me that he has not taken the trouble to understand this matter at all.  Because the Board of Assessors do not award the pensions. The pensions are awarded by the Minister for Defence with the sanction of the Department of the Minister for Finance.  It is perfectly open to the Auditor-General to say that in spite of the certificate of military service being granted to this person, that he was not, because of his faults or misbehaviour, entitled to the pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in this particular case his own Department actually held up payment of the pension, but on account of pressure brought to bear upon the Department in the course of correspondence over a long period by the Department of Defence eventually gave way to the Department of Defence and paid the pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is absolutey irrelevant in all this.  That has nothing to do with this question of the award of a certificate of service.  The only thing in question in paragraph 42 is whether the Comptroller and Auditor-General is entitled and required to inquire whether the persons who got a certificate of service actually have given that service or not.  That has nothing whatever to do with the question of offences which might disqualify a person who had the service for a pension from getting that pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter. It has absolutely nothing to do with this.  It would have been more becoming on the part of the Chairman of the <Col N="2122" /> Public Accounts Committee&mdash;I am not complaining of his general tone in this &mdash;but it would have been better if he had left irrelevant matters like this out, because this is absolutely irrelevant. It has nothing whatever to do with the matter that is in this Report. It would have been better for him also to have left out the hearsay and tittle-tattle and matters that were not before the Committee, such as talk about a person who had not got Easter Week service and who had got a full pension, and about twenty pensions which had been disallowed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  It would be better when dealing with a matter of this sort to deal with it soberly and not try to apply lurid colours, as if we were dealing with it on an election platform. The reason for that&mdash;and I say this quite seriously&mdash;is, as Deputy Esmonde pointed out, that the Public Accounts Committee has really no statutory basis.  We have taken the thing over from the British Parliament, and therefore its effectiveness depends upon tradition and upon the attitude of the House.  If we get into the way of discussing the Report of the Committee in a party spirit, then we make it impossible for the Committee itself to carry on in a non-party spirit.  If once the Public Accounts Committee appears to act in a partisan manner, then you can only look for Ministers and others to try to fight with and counter its moves instead of accepting it, as we have accepted it, as an assistance to the Executive and to the Parliament in having the work of the State properly done. I regret that Deputy Davin should have really impaired what was a very fair statement by introducing irrelevancies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I was not saying anything of the sort, but I was saying the contrary.  I was saying that in making his statement Deputy Davin thought it proper to try to lay on the <Col N="2123" /> colours in a way which was unfortunate and which, if it were followed, would make it difficult for discussions of the Report to be conducted in a proper spirit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish.  We hold the view, as I said, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is neither entitled to have those papers nor required in the discharge of his duties to seek for them.  We hold, moreover, that there are compelling reasons, which have already been referred to by Deputy Cooper, why those papers should not be submitted to him, because there might be circumstances in which we might have thought the Comptroller and Auditor-General was not entitled to papers, but in which we would, nevertheless, give them to him. The general view is that everything he requires, without question and without attempting to limit what he will obtain, should be given to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reason why in this particular case a different view should be taken and that has been stated. Everybody knows the period to which these papers relate.  They know the many reasons why the matter should not be the subject of controversy. There were pledges given to applicants that there would be no disclosure and pledges given to witnesses.  There is just one side of the witnesses' case that I would like to refer to.  There were many witnesses who gave the most valuable and most conscientious evidence. There were many cases&mdash;I have this merely from statements of members of the Committee&mdash;in which men applied for pensions and pensions were refused to them on the evidence of neighbours, on the truthful and frank evidence of people who were working with them day by day.  Witnesses probably would have phrased their language differently if they had known or had any idea that there was any possibility that it might be canvassed and made public.  I need not go into it in detail, because Deputies appreciate <Col N="2124" /> the reasons.  Many applicants included matters in their applications and evidence which they need not have included, even for the purpose of supporting their applications.  There are many good reasons why, in the interest of public peace, for the prevention of ill-feeling, and, perhaps, of violence, there should not be disclosure of these documents for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>The matter was dealt with by one Public Accounts Committee which supported the action of the Executive in refusing to submit those papers.  The last Public Accounts Committee has asked that the matter be regularised. It seems to me that it is impossible to have this matter coming up as a point of controversy year after year.  It is a most unsatisfactory position to have the Comptroller and Auditor-General complaining every year that papers which, in his view, he is entitled to and bound to get and to examine, are withheld from him, and for the Government to come each year saying that in its view it is not bound to submit the papers to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and, furthermore, that in its view it ought not to submit the papers to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. We had legal advice as to the effects of the Act, but as that legal view is not accepted by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and is apparently not accepted by other people, it seems to me to be necessary for the Government to take such steps as would put the whole matter beyond all doubt, and we propose to do that probably by legislation immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is too deep a lawyer for me.  Now, with reference to Deputy Esmonde's remarks, I feel the work of the Public Accounts Committee has been most valuable work, and I think the present state of administrative efficiency could not possibly have been reached without the <Col N="2125" /> work of the Public Accounts Committee, and that the service which the Department of Finance is able to render would be very ineffective if there were not a Court of Appeal which exists in the Public Accounts Committee.  On the other hand, I am inclined to think that the Public Accounts Committee here has tended towards increasing the rigidity of the system which we took over from Great Britain.  I am not sure that it is desirable that there should be greater rigidity here than in Great Britain.  Experience will show us, and, of course, if we have been making matters too rigid it will be possible &mdash;the Public Accounts Committee is not bound by its own precedents&mdash;for the Public Accounts Committee this year or next year to reconsider matters. Possibly it was the fact that at the moment that the Public Accounts Committee began to function there was a rather unsatisfactory position arising out of the civil war and the start of government here that caused the Committee to be stricter than, as far as I can ascertain, the Public Accounts Committee in Great Britain is.  What is called red tape is, I believe, inevitable in Government administration.  In accountancy, in Government departments, there must be greater strictness and more careful checking than is normal in business concerns.  The directors of a business are regarded as practically dealing with their own money, and they can have decisions taken, and expenditure incurred with an informality that, I think, is impossible for Government departments dealing with public money.</P>
      <P>Our system of accounting and reporting to the Dáil by means of the Public Accounts Committee also increases the care that must be taken.  The accounting officer who is responsible for the expenditure of huge sums of money is very liable to have himself condemned and surcharged 6/8, and held up to odium in the newspapers as a result of the investigations of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee.  The managing director of a big business outside is not in any danger, if it happens that 6/8 has gone wrong, of seeing himself figuring in a headline in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2126" /> On the other hand, I see no way out of the strict accountancy and of the procedure that we have adopted.  If we loosen that in any way I believe great evils would speedily creep in.  I have heard it suggested, from time to time, that in certain Departments there need not be such careful checking and counter-checking of accounts and claims as is the present practice.  People have told me of cases where it cost £100 to trace a difference of three half pence in accounts.  That may have happened, but if we were to allow the accounting officer any margin which might be set against small losses I am afraid great evils might grow up, although from the point of view of economy I have once or twice had discussions in regard to the possibility of spending less time on minute and detailed checking and counter-checking of accounts, and of having less of the business of applying for sanction, and justifying expenditure in advance, to the Department of Finance, as is the practice at the present time.  I have always, as a result of such discussion, been driven back to the conclusion that this financial system which we have taken over from Great Britain, built up there as a result of long experience, and which gives them a very sound and efficient administration, is one that we cannot with advantage substantially alter or modify.</P>
    <P>It might be that in certain details we could do away with a degree of red tape, but if Deputies themselves think of the losses of money that undoubtedly did occur in connection with Army administration in 1922 and 1923, when there was no red tape, they will, I think, be driven to the conclusion that whatever is the objection to red tape it is a thing we must bear the expense of, and the inconvenience of, to avoid greater evils and greater losses than are now incurred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question.  It seems to me that there is a great deal in what he says with regard to the attitude of the Public Accounts Committee.  He stated in his Budget speech, as well as on this occasion, that he does not quite know where he stands with regard to the system taken over from the British Government.  I suggest to him that a <Col N="2127" /> great deal of the difficulty which has arisen, in connection with the Public Accounts Committee, is due to the fact that the accounts are not presented in as simple a way as the Public Accounts Committee would wish and, certainly not in quite as simple a way as the man in the street could easily follow. That might be done without any great revision of the system of accountancy if the sub-heads, particularly with regard to salaries and allowances, could be set out in a more distinct manner so that the different branches of the service in the different Departments, as, for instance, the Army, could be distinguished from one another, and so that on an easy survey of the face of the Estimates you could find the total cost on every head of expenditure. There is also the question of superannuation. Superannuation allowances could be shown on each Vote.  Superannuation at present is bulked together. An official goes out on pension and the Superannuation Vote is made responsible.  That creates a vacancy and the Public Accounts Committee are more or less led to believe that there is a saving effected on that account. The word &ldquo;saving&rdquo; occurs in a great many cases throughout the Appropriation Accounts which the Committee examine, but that saving does not really represent a saving as compared with the expenditure for the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It simply means in regard to that particular Vote that a less amount was spent than was estimated for, so that if you could have a good estimation, and if the Departments spent the amounts estimated, no more and no less, there would be little work for the Committee of Public Accounts to do.  I suggest steps should be taken to make the matter simpler.  For example, when the Minister for Finance was speaking on the Budget he read a list of Exchequer assets, and on that occasion he said he could not say that drainage was represented by an Exchequer asset, but that certain payments on the Vote for the Land Commission would be represented by an Exchequer asset.  He also said that telephone capital would result in an asset for the Exchequer.  Another difficulty the Committee had is that <Col N="2128" /> they had not a definite statement with regard to the stores or assets the State holds, and which are really State property, and are represented by State advances.  I submit the Minister should give us some assurance on the question of looking into Government accountancy as to making it simpler, particularly in matters like National Health Insurance, which are nearly impossible to follow by anybody except a trained financial expert.  That also would simplify the work of the Committee. and questions would not be coming up in the sharp way they do in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of this debate Deputy Davin tried to emphasise in the opening and concluding portions of his speech that, as far as the members of the Committee of Public Accounts were concerned, the public accounts as they came before them were considered absolutely on a non-party basis.  We were only concerned with the accounts as bookkeeping transactions. When Deputy Davin sat down I was very sorry that Deputy Esmonde got up and proceeded to show that the accounts were considered by the Committee as a party matter.  Subsequently I was pleased when Deputy Cooper got up and to a certain extent nullified what Deputy Esmonde had said.  I do not wish to touch on any matters referred to by Deputy Esmonde, and I only wish to state that the House can realise now how sorry some members of the Public Accounts Committee will be that Deputy Esmonde is no longer amongst them.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Esmonde wishes to make out now in his references to the Fianna Fáil Party he was one Party and the rest of the Committee the other Party I accept that. As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, who worked fairly hard on that Committee, I may be expecting too much when I expect that on the submission of the Report of the Committee to this House we would get a more detailed statement bearing on <Col N="2129" /> the Report, particularly from the Minister for Finance.  I expected that the Minister for Finance would have gone through, even hurriedly, this Report, which was drawn up after great care and consideration, and that he would refer paragraph by paragraph to matters which called for some direct explanation or answer.  We find ourselves, therefore, faced with a situation where, as Deputy Cooper pointed out, we cannot decide, and where legislation would have to be introduced to do away with matters that are bound to occur year after year and give rise to the same discussions as the result of dissatisfaction with particular items. Paragraph 11 of the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts points out that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was observed that two officers of the Land Registry who had been promoted in 1918 under the Lord Chancellor's Order of November, 1918, and had retired under Article 10 of the Treaty, were awarded compensation allowances on their pensionable service as civil servants, with the usual additional years and a special addition of one month for each year of actual service.  This award was made on the recommendation of the Civil Service Committee, and the evidence of the accounting officer was that the Minister simply carried out the recommendations of the advisory body.  It came to light, however, that in another case which arose subsequently, also of an officer holding under the same order, the finding of the Civil Service Committee was not on the basis adopted in the two cases under observation.  The Committee would, before coming to any decision, like to be informed if the particulars placed before the advisory body disclosed the similarity of all three cases.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Possibly the Minister might deem this paragraph as one to which an answer should be given.</P>

      <P>That is quite satisfactory so far as I am concerned.  With regard to the Trade Loans guarantees, there is a difference of opinion not only among the members of the Committee of Public Accounts but those who are not members.  We got general agreement for the purpose of this Report from the Committee.  I may say that I, for one, am at complete variance with the outlook of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this matter.  When the State guarantees a loan which it did not advance in the first instance.  I consider that a contingent liability, and it is a liability which the State may be called upon to pay at any time, or a portion of it. Therefore, the State should see that that liability should be kept at all times before the Departments concerned, particularly in connection with any changes that affect the assets upon which the State has a lien as a result of its guarantee.  It would appear from the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that that is not his view, because in one particular case to which reference is made the loan was guaranteed, and in exchange for the guarantee given by the State the State became in a sense the mortgagees of certain assets.  Rightly or wrongly, I am not disputing the point that when the necessity arose something had to be done, but on the loan being granted and subsequent to the formalities being gone through whereby the State had a lien on certain assets, the company in question again found itself in need of financial assistance. I am not quarrelling with help- <Col N="2131" /> ing the company to carry on, but the method adopted to enable it to do so. The State in this case receded from its position on the lien.  It had to weaken its position with regard to the lien to enable that concern to borrow fresh money from outside sources, and to enable it to give as a security the property or asset on which the State released its hold.</P>
      <P>If the Minister thought it necessary &mdash;I am not saying it is wrong to help these people&mdash;to get further money, and if we had to take a lien on an asset in exchange for a guarantee which we extended, and if we found afterwards that we were faced with the position. that the concern assisted had to get further money to carry on, it would be far better to bring the matter before the Dáil and get an increased loan if necessary, and to hold our lien on the asset as before.  If this particular arrangement were allowed to go on it would be quite possible, where the State had a lien on assets and where there was a recurrence of such cases, that subsequently the State would find itself without any lien on any property which it originally held, and find itself called upon to pay the guarantee in full, without any hope of recovering the money from the lien on the assets which it held.  The underlying principle of these loans, which I can understand and with which I am quite in sympathy, is the promotion of industries to give employment.</P>

      <P>I am not splitting hairs on the matter as to whether it is new employment or continuous employment. I am not finding fault with that at the moment.  The Minister is in a position, according to his interpretation of the Act, once a loan is given under certain circumstances, with the advice of an advisory board, to accept what they put forward and to permit a firm to raise fresh capital by releasing to them, to enable them to raise this fresh capital, the assets on which he holds a lien in exchange for the guarantee <Col N="2132" /> given.  There is certainly room for amending the Act to make it possible for either the Minister's interpretations in regard to granting of loans under the Act to come definitely within the ambit of the Act or to say they do not come within the ambit.  I do not propose to say anything at the moment with regard to the action taken by the Minister in allowing concerns to be reconstructed for the purpose of coming within the Act.  What I do say is, that while there is a difference of opinion as to whether the Act should be amended to make that particular class of advance or guarantee for a loan available, it should be definitely stated that that is not the intention of the Act.</P>
      <P>The matter of Paragraph 42 was discussed in detail.  The Minister for Finance, in referring to this matter, quoted the Act, and suggested that some of those who agreed to the report, or those who had discussed this matter before, had not read the Act.  I might say that I read the Act backwards and forwards to try to get an explanation of the attitudes and actions of the Ministry.</P>

      <P>The Minister pointed out in his argument here that the Board of Assessors set up to recommend whether pensions should be granted were a judicial, or, at least, a semi-judicial body. and that as such their findings could not be questioned. We quite agree with that.  In the case of courts their findings cannot be questioned.  Even where the findings may be wrong or too severe we have got to act according to their findings. The Minister is aware, however, that the findings of no court are kept secret from the public.  The judgment of the court is written and considered and that is put before us.  The judge, in giving his judgment, always gives his reasons for that judgment, and you <Col N="2133" /> have everything put before you.  Therefore, that is not an argument that we can take into consideration, that because they are a judicial or a semi-judicial body we should not ask how they arrived at their findings, but that we should accept their verdict.  The point is that it is fairly well admitted now that, although the Act is described as a Military Service Pensions Act, and although to the uninitiated it would appear that those who benefit under the Act are citizens of the State who had service in the I.R.A. in pre-Truce times and subsequent service in the National Army, to enable them to qualify for that pension, it is now clearly and definitely stated, as far as I could make out from the Minister's statement, that not all such persons who benefit under the Act need have had actual military service in pre-Truce days.  I would be glad if the Minister would explain the matter before I go further.  I understood the Minister to say that there was a certain number of people, benefiting by this Act, who performed certain actions which if would not be in the interest or peace of the country to make public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

      <P>What I am getting at, if I understood the Minister correctly, is that that does not necessarily mean that an individual should have been out in 1916, should have served in the I.R.A. in pre-Truce days and subsequently in the National Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary that he should have been out in 1916, but it is necessary that he should have served in the I.R.A. prior to the Truce. That is one of the essential conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that any member of the I.R.A. in pre-Truce days, who served as a volunteer, as he was at that time, and who is entitled to a pension, will object very much to having his identity made absolutely known, if his services are questioned. If the Act means that a person is entitled to a pension on the grounds that he was a member of the I.R.A. in pre-Truce days and subsequently a <Col N="2134" /> member of the Army, where does the argument of the Minister come in, that the making known of a man's identity, his unit, the rank he held and his present address, is going to create disturbance and to bring about violence? There are many members of this House who were members of the I.R.A. and it is quite certain no one is going to do them violence because they were members of the I.R.A.  If the Minister said that there were other reasons, and that there are men benefiting under the Act who were not actually recognised as members of a unit who had service which could be classed as good as that of an active member, there would be an argument for that, and we should probably meet that argument.  I am not satisfied, and I do not believe any members of the House can be satisfied, that when it is stated the only people who benefit under the Act are those who had I.R.A. service in pre-Truce days and National Army service subsequently, there is any reason why there should be secrecy about the identity of these men, the period of their service, details of the units to which they belonged, and the areas to which they belonged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister further compared the attitude of the Report to that of a previous Public Accounts Committee in this regard, and suggested that we had reversed a decision.  When this matter came before the Committee originally 6,000 was involved, and it was thought, as far as I could gather from conversation with members who were on the Committee, that it only concerned a certain small number of people and would not involve an annual expenditure of very much money.  The explanation then given was that it concerned men who had taken part in certain activities, some of which happened in the Six Counties, who were living there still and in whose interests, necessarily, it was not right to make it known that they were getting these particular pensions or for what particular service.  That was the attitude adopted and the explanation given, and was the sense of the understanding of the persons who framed the report, as far as I can find out.  But the present situation is that we are confronted with <Col N="2135" /> an annual expenditure of, roughly, £145,000.</P>
    <P>When the Act was being introduced, very little was said for or against it. One significant thing was said.  I think it was in answer to an interjection of Deputy Good.  He asked how much the Act was going to cost each year, and was told that it would run to about £100.000.  Now we are faced with an annual expenditure of £145.000, and we are not allowed to know who the beneficiaries are under it.  We are not allowed to satisfy our own suspicions, if you like.  Although the Act is in force, we are not allowed to satisfy our suspicions, if we have suspicions.  As a matter of fact, I have a list in my pocket of six names of beneficiaries under the Act who, it is claimed, could not in all righteousness&mdash;if the interpretation of the Act is as I have stated. and as I understood from the Minister &mdash;have benefited under it.  The names have been given me in good faith, and have been accepted by me in good faith, but on investigation it might be found that my informant is wrong, and that these people are entitled to pensions. There is an element of doubt and an element of suspicion, and I say, without hesitation or reserve, that I am not satisfied.  I will never be satisfied as long as the Act is administered as it is that there is no possibility&mdash;I will not say for any fraud or anything wrong&mdash; of error.  There is the possibility of error.  If the Comptroller and Auditor-General has to audit the accounts and vouch for the expenditure in accordance with the Act.  I contend that if he is not allowed to get particulars that he requires in this instance, the next time the Minister for Defence comes to the House and asks it to vote money to pay these pensions, he should ask it under a separate Vote; he should submit to the House that it is subject to a restricted audit; that it is none of our business who the beneficiaries are, what they are, or what they are getting the money for.  That is the plain way of putting it.  The Minister for Finance was quite frank, at least in the end of his speech. We are criticised for having adopted a certain attitude, a certain view-point in the matter, yet he admits that he proposes to bring in legislation to regularise <Col N="2136" /> this procedure.  Therefore the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor-General were correct in holding this matter up, because if they were wrong, why now propose to bring in legislation?  In a sense we are criticised for referring to this matter, and the Comptroller and Auditor-General is criticised and told that he is wrong, but nevertheless the Minister said that he hoped in perhaps a short time to bring in legislation to regularise this particular matter.  That satisfies me, and I hope it satisfies members of the Committee by whom this report was worked out.  It justifies the report that was framed regarding this item.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to hear if the Minister for Industry and Commerce intends to give some enlightenment as to his outlook or his interpretation of the Trade Loans Act so as to enable the Committee to have some knowledge as to that phase of the situation when it crops up again, if it should crop up in the case of the next Committee of Public Accounts.  We may then be faced with a repetition of work which we handled in a previous Committee.  If we are not going to get any definite indication from the Minister or Ministers concerned, we will be in the same position, and have to bring in the same wording and criticism of the Estimate.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce proposes to give any enlightenment on that.  There is no indication from him.  I would like to say that this Report, as presented, is a Report from members of the Dáil who sat together, judging only as far as they could&mdash;without any party feeling whatever&mdash;the accounts submitted, and the different disputes between departments and the view-point brought forward by the Comptroller, and Auditor-General when interpreting expenditure as compared with the Vote.  When Deputy Esmonde suggests that we sat there as guardians on behalf of the Department of Finance, and that whatever they suggested we religiously enforced, I would like to say that that is not the case.  We did not hold a brief for any department.  I am particularly cautious about directions from the Department of Finance.  When Deputy <Col N="2137" /> Esmonde suggests that we were there as guardians on behalf of the Department of Finance, just to carry out its instructions, I think he is quite wrong. I would like to emphasise that the attitude of all members was to judge the facts that came before them from the book-keeping point of view. owing no allegiance to any department of State. owing no allegiance to any individual, and showing no preference to any individual because of like or dislike.  I believe it will be borne out by every member, that we presented the Report as it is, and that we hoped the Minister would reply to the matters referred to in it.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  Deputy Briscoe thought fit to refer here on one occasion to evidence given by the Controller of the Stationery Office and brought it into a discussion with regard to tariffs.  He brought it in in this connection, that if the Executive Council had a particular policy which he could approve of that policy ought to be reflected clearly in all the Departments, and he went on to state: &ldquo;Yet we find a civil servant who is a member of the Tariff Commission having to admit that only one per cent. of the paper bought by the Stationery Office for Government Departments was produced in the Free State.&rdquo;  He was challenged on that point, and there was a certain discussion.  I am not referring to the fact that that statement was made out of this document before it came before us; but in fact the statement that only one per cent. of the paper was produced in the Saorstát <Col N="2138" /> was wrong.  The statement was entirely without foundation, and the Deputy cannot get it in the evidence given by the Controller of the Stationery Office. Even if the statement was right it was wrongly brought into the Tariff Commission debate.  That statement revealed that the Deputy sat on the Committee of Public Accounts for the purpose of collecting ammunition in order to use it against Government policy.</P>

I do not intend to ask for any mercy or to plead for any protection that the House could give in that regard.  While I withdrew unreservedly from the position, I have nothing to say about it, and the Minister is entitled to lash as hard as he can on account of my breach of privilege. With regard to the Minister's statement that what I said was quite wrong, perhaps the Minister will tell us to what degree I was wrong when I stated that only one per cent. of the paper bought by the Stationery Office was bought in the Saorstát.</P>

I am not asking for latitude.  The statement was made in a particular context, and it was apologised for.  But I say that the statement, apart altogether from the fact that it is a breach of confidence, was made in a context which shows that the Deputy sat on the Public Accounts Committee for the purpose of examining officials of the State in order to get information that he could use in debates on policy; that this statement was so used, and that he showed that clearly by the context in which he introduced it, while in addition the statement was entirely wrong.  The Deputy asks me to state how far it was wrong. Apparently, he agrees that one per cent. was wrong.  The Deputy asked a question and got a statement, and he asks what should have been the correct statement.</P>

      <P>I am not going to say anything about it.  The Deputy made a mistake and he had time to correct himself.  He asked a question which revealed that he was very far away from truth or accuracy in the matter.  The matter has lain there since; we did not get any statement from the Deputy.  Apart from the correctness of the statement, the statement was introduced in a context which showed the Deputy's attitude towards the Public Accounts Committee and which, to my mind&mdash;if it was only that instance&mdash;showed that <Col N="2140" /> Deputy Briscoe was not a proper person to serve on the Committee.  With regard to the Trade Loans Act, Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Lemass asked what my attitude is.  I explained my attitude on this before.  It has become one of the hardy annuals in the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Report and in the Public Accounts Committee Report. I was held up before by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who expressed his doubts that loans given under much the same conditions as the loan that was criticised in the Report of the last Committee that we have were within the law.  I expressed myself afterwards as satisfied that it was within the law, and it was said that I expressed myself as disregarding the opinion expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. I made no comment on that except that I was going to disregard it.  The Committee of Public Accounts issued an Interim Report in which they adverted to two other matters, one of which was that they were of opinion that the matter contained in, I think, Section I of the Act had been rather widely interpreted by me in connection with certain guarantees.  I stated that I again considered I was within the terms of the Act, had acted properly, and was carrying out the intentions of the House, but that if any Deputy thought that an amendment to the Act was required, either to preclude me from acting in that way again, or to enable me to act again, under a more regularised procedure, then it was for the people who thought that way to bring forward an amendment.  I was satisfied that the Act gave me the powers that I wanted, that I had interpreted it properly, and I was going to continue to use the powers in that way if no amendment were carried. They also expressed themselves with regard to the third point quoted in this year's Report: &ldquo;The Committee considers that the creation of a liability in front of a State guarantee is not desirable and should not be repeated.&rdquo; With regard to that, speaking in June, 1926, I said: &ldquo;But unless there be an amendment brought in of a certain type and inserted in the Bill I would like to give notice that I do not consider myself bound merely by this recommendation <Col N="2141" /> of the Public Accounts Committee in the carrying out of the Act next year.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The history of what followed is essential to the understanding of this.  The Second Reading of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Amendment Bill was passed without a Division after I had made statements of that sort.  When we came to the Money Resolution before the Committee Stage, Deputy Johnson set down an amendment which he said&mdash;and it was agreed by the Chair&mdash;had to be taken in conjunction with three other amendments which he had set down to the Bill itself. After a long discussion, in which I again made my position clear, the amendment was negatived, no Division being called.  There was a vocal vote, but there was no Division.  The amendment consequently fell, and amendments to the Bill afterwards fell; no other amendments were moved, and on the Report Stage no amendments were moved; the Bill passed as it stood, after I had given that indication to the House, members of the Committee having previously reported that in their opinion the interpretation of the Act was wrong.  When I gave the interpretation that I considered was right, and when I said that I proposed to act in the same way unless the House took the opinion of the Public Accounts Committee and introduced amendments the House gave me the Bill as it was before, and I proceeded to act on the same lines.  If no amendment to the Bill be carried when it comes before the House again, I propose to continue to act along the same lines.  The Committee have registered their opinion that that was not right.</P>

      <P>I am referring to that and to other matters.  Everything <Col N="2142" /> that was reported on by the Public Accounts Committee was again brought before the Public Accounts Committee in this year.  They expressed their opinion in a particular way; they reported their opinion to this House as to how the Act was carried out.  I say that if the Act is given to me, when it comes up for amendment, in the form in which I introduced it, I will continue to interpret it as before. It will be for Deputies who are on the Public Accounts Committee to justify the opinion that they have set their hands to in this Report by moving amendments to change it.  I hold that I am acting quite legally, and I am fortified by legal opinion in saying that. I am fortified by the opinion of the Advisory Committee with regard to the business side of all that I have done, and I do not intend to change it.  That is the situation with regard to the Trade Loans Act.</P>

      <P>No, amendments can be discussed.  In 1926 I said that if amendments were brought in they would be left to an open vote.  On the amendment moved by Deputy Johnson to the Money Resolution, I think it was stated that it would be left to an open vote.  A division was not challenged; apparently the House was satisfied.  I do think that the Committee, in reporting on this matter, might have taken into consideration what had happened when these criticisms were previously made.  I said that they were their criticisms; that I did not admit that they were proper criticisms, and that my conduct had been beyond criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave an explanation of what happened, and I said if the House approved of the Public Accounts Committee in opposition to me, let any Deputy move amendments and we will have them discussed on their merits.  The only amendment that came up was one moved by Deputy Johnson.  The Bill came to me in the ordinary course, and having given that definite notice to the House that I would continue, I said I did not consider myself bound merely by this recommendation of the Public Accounts <Col N="2143" /> Committee not to carry on as I had been doing.</P>

      <P>There are three or four items that the Minister is taking in conjunction with each other.  I do not think the Minister sees my point. I am referring particularly to the case where the Minister released assets or a lien on assets for the purpose of enabling the concern to get fresh money from an outside source, giving as security the lien which the Minister previously held through his Department.</P>

      <P>The Edenderry case was talked of.  It was spoken of here quite publicly.  There were three points taken out for criticism.  One was a question of the creation of a liability in front of the State guarantee. The second was the use of the money with regard to the reconstitution of a company by allowing certain things to happen, and there was a third point. I said I did not consider myself bound by what the Public Accounts Committee said or what the Comptroller and Auditor-General said.  That will all fall again for discussion on the Second Reading of the Bill that I propose to introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe has said that if this process goes on the State might find in the end that all the assets would have disappeared.  That, of course, is a very amusing gloss on what exactly was brought before the Public Accounts Committee.  Listening to Deputy Briscoe, one was inclined to think that <Col N="2144" /> that must create the impression in the minds of people that, there is a process very frequently going on and that there is a very big number of cases coming before the Public Accounts Committee in which they have to pass judgment, and in which you get the assets of a concern, to which a guarantee has been given, wasting away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">

      <P>In other words we are told that if that is going to go on, if the Department of Finance and my Department are going to be foolish enough to allow that sort of thing to go on, they will find the money wasting away.  I stated in the Alesbury's case that I regarded what was done as an exceptional thing, but I was not going to preclude myself from dealing in the same way with another, exceptional case if that came up.  There is another application now pending which depends on the same thing, and if that be refused by reason of the particular report of the Public Accounts Committee, I am not going to be subject to criticism hereafter if complaints come forward in regard to certain things which depend on the industry whose fate is in the balance, an industry which would be destroyed if the report of the Public Accounts Committee were going to be acted upon rigidly.</P>

      <P>I did not mention that at all.  I mentioned another firm. <Col N="2145" /> I said that another application is pending, and the fate of the firm making that application is in the balance.  The firm will definitely be destroyed if this report was rigidly to be adhered to.  The Act is before the people, and the people can understand the Act in the meantime before it is brought up again.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has to consult the Advisory Committee on certain things.  If, after consultation, he is satisfied, not himself and the Auditor-General and the Minister for Finance and the Committee of Public Accounts, but he&mdash;if he is satisfied, he can grant certain loans subject to certain other conditions which the Minister for Finance may impose upon him.  If he has not that right, and if it is that there is something wrong, then it will be open to amend the Act. But I pray Deputies not to amend it on the lines suggested by Deputy Lemass, namely, that we are going to bring exceptional cases here before the Dáil, or before a Committee of the Dáil, and have these exceptional cases discussed. If that is to happen you might as well scrap this Trade Loans Act.</P>

      <P>I stated here already in the debate on this matter in 1926 that there are two aims&mdash;the loosening of money for certain purposes and the preservation of the public purse against abuse.  I have given a certain interpretation to Section 1.  You can decide whether that is a good interpretation or not. There is then the legal side of it.  I believe I am justified legally.  And I am not going to accept the Comptroller and Auditor-General's view against the legal advice I have got.  Do not let us have any talk about bringing these doubtful and dubious cases before a Committee of the House.  You are not going to get any business done in that way.  No firm struggling along is going to risk having its whole arrangements brought into discussion and criticised here.  There is a question of the amendment of the Act with regard to working capital.  It is for Deputies to bring forward amendments I am not proposing to bring forward amendments myself.  I believe the Act works <Col N="2146" /> properly, and it would be hard to administer it if money for working capital is not going to be allowed.</P>

      <P>The criticism of the Report of the Public Accounts Committee is a criticism in reality as far as it has gone of the recommendations of the Committee on the point raised by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and to that extent the criticism to which we have just listened now is a criticism of the Comptroller and Auditor-General himself.</P>

      <P>On the one point raised in paragraph 42 I deliberately refrained from expressing my own opinion or the opinion of the Committee as to whether or not it was desirable to disclose certain information given in evidence in support of certain applicants for military service pensions.  I agree with Deputy Cooper that it would be very undesirable indeed in the interests of applicants in from 20 to 30 cases to make public the information which these individuals gave in support of their applications for pensions.  The whole point at issue in the matter raised by the Committee is whether the moneys voted by this House for the payment of pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act should be treated in reality as a Secret Service Vote.  I am satisfied so far as the Minister for Finance has gone with his statement, which means that there is doubt and reason and justification for the doubt raised in the Report of the Public Accounts Committee. And to that extent he intends and promises to introduce amending legislation to remove that doubt.  On that and other points raised in the discussion I am satisfied to leave the matter where it is now, realising that all the points raised in the Public Accounts Committee's Report must be dealt with in due time by the Department of Finance, for the Department must make a minute which will come before the Public Accounts Committee <Col N="2147" /> in due course and on that minute we will have another opportunity of dealing with these matters on the merits of the minutes sent to the Committee by the Minister.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Byrne v. The Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Company, Ltd., the Circuit Court decided yesterday that the Local Authorities (Mutual Assurance) Act, 1926, does not apply to the defendant company, and as a result of the decision that Act must now be regarded as useless for the purpose for which it was framed.  The defendant company was formed by local authorities and complied with all the provisions of the Act except the provision that the insurance must be carried out by the company on a mutual basis.  It has been decided in this case that a company, where the risks insured against are covered by re-insurance, and not by the mutual liability of its members, does not within the meaning of the Act &ldquo;mutually&rdquo; insure its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being so, the Act was drafted under an insurance plan and does not <Col N="2148" /> achieve the objects of the Oirachtas in passing it.  Re-insurance is, of course, essential to the financial soundness of an undertaking of this kind proposed, and in the early stages must be the principal security against risks.</P>
    <P>The Government have therefore decided to introduce legislation immediately to cure the defects in the Act and enable it to fulfil its purpose, so that a company of this kind formed by local authorities may carry on operations for their sole benefit in the manner intended when the Act was passed.  It is intended that the Bill to be introduced will also include provisions validating the operations of the Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Company, Ltd., from the date of its registration to the passing of the new Bill, and safeguarding local authorities, who have dealt with the company under a bona fide misapprehension of the legal position, from loss arising from these operations.</P>
