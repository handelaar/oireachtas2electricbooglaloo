      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state why poor rate due on the Coastguard Stations at Dunmore East, Ballymacaw, and Tramore, County Waterford, has not been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, perhaps, first explain that it is incorrect to speak of poor rate as being &ldquo;due&rdquo; in respect of property in State occupation. Under the Valuation Acts all property occupied for the Public Service is exempt from rating provided that, where an annual rent is derived by the lessor from the occupation by the State of any property, one-half of such annual rent is included in the Valuation Lists and rates are payable thereon by the lessor.  The Government makes an ex-gratia contribution in lieu of rates which is based on the principle that as a matter of equity property occupied for State purposes should pay its share of local rates.  This contribution is equivalent to the amount by which the rates, which would be payable on all Government property situated in any rating area, if such property were in the occupation of private persons, exceed the rates paid on the half-annual rents; so that if, in any rating area, there should not be any such excess, no contribution in lieu of rates is payable. <Col N="1325" /> This was the case in Waterford County in 1927-28.  The rates which would have been payable had the property in the occupation of the State in County Waterford been occupied by private persons were, in fact, less than the total rates assessable on immediate lessors in respect of half the annual rent derived from Government property in the county; so that the principle that property occupied for State purposes should pay its share of local rates was fulfilled without any need for a contribution in lieu of rates from the State.</P>
      <P>In regard to the particular stations mentioned by the Deputy, (1) that at Dunmore East was destroyed some years ago and no rates are payable in respect of destroyed premises, (2) the Station at Ballymacaw is not in Government occupation and the valuation of the buildings which comprise the Station is included in the ordinary way in the List of Rateable Hereditaments, (3) the greater part of the building at Tramore is now occupied as a Civic Guard Station and, as such, the valuation attributable there to appears in the schedules of property in State occupation; the remainder of the building is let to tenants and rated in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the rate collector has had to pay a sum of £70 in respect of these buildings?  From whom is he to recover it?  He has applied to the Board of Works on several occasions and has got no satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question for the Department of Local Government. At any rate, the answer shows that full rates have been paid to the county on all rateable property in Government occupation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN (for Mr. F.H. Crowley)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he has seen a resolution passed at the Teachers' Congress in Dublin a few weeks ago, requesting the Department of Education to withdraw the regulation made in August last, on the ground that it would have a detrimental <Col N="1326" /> effect on primary education, as it would debar from entrance to the Training Colleges the vast majority of the clever children of the poorer classes; whether, as this is practically the only chance the monitresses, ex-monitresses, and pupil teachers under the old scheme will have of entering a Training College, he will consider the advisability of postponing, for this year at least, the regulation made in August last, and of reverting to the rule in force for many years, that candidates must be called to training on the principle of merit, and merit alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor O'Sullivan) John Marcus O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a copy of the resolution alluded to.  I do not admit the contention contained in it. There was no new regulation issued by me in August.  The regulation to which the Deputy refers is that contained in the regulations relating to the appointment of pupil-teachers issued in May, 1926.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to alter the regulations now in force with regard to entrance to training colleges.  I do not admit that the interests of the clever children of the poorer classes are detrimentally affected under the Preparatory Colleges and New Pupil-Teacher scheme: at least equal provision is made for all clever children of whatever class. The principle of merit and of merit alone applies to the admission of all students to training, whether called on the result of the Leaving Certificate examination of the secondary system on the prescribed course or on the result of the Easter Scholarship examination.</P>
      <P>It will be open to the candidates referred to in the question, if unsuccessful this year, to compete again for admission to training at the Easter Scholarship examination.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he can state (i) how many candidates competed at the Easter Scholarship Examination of 1928 for entrance to Women's Training Colleges in September, 1928; and (ii) how many of these candidates were (a) monitresses or ex-monitresses; (b) pupil teachers appointed under the old scheme for intermediate students; (c) pupil teachers <Col N="1327" /> appointed under new scheme for intermediate students; (d) junior assistant mistresses employed in National Schools; (e) ordinary pupils of National Schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to (i) is 617; and to (ii) is&mdash;(a) 140; (b) 60; (c) None as such; (d) 33; (e) 384 candidates, not coming under categories (a), (b), (c) or (d), competed; of these 373 were pupils of National Schools, preparatory departments, Secondary Schools, or other educational institutions.  It is not possible to ascertain accurately, from the information at my disposal, the number who actually were ordinary pupils of National Schools but the approximate number was 150.</P>
      <P>I may add that of the 140 monitresses or ex-monitresses referred to in answer to (ii) (a) above, 103 are ex-monitresses who had already competed in former years and did not succeed in obtaining places under the regulations then in force; and that, of the 60 pupil teachers (old scheme) 54 were ex-pupil teachers who had already competed and did not succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN (for Mr. F. Crowley)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that the latest code of regulations issued by the Commissioners of National Education&mdash;which issue is still in force&mdash;contains a rule (No. 168) making it compulsory on the heads of Training Colleges to call candidates in order of merit; and whether this rule, which has been strictly adhered to up to the present, and which has given complete satisfaction, is now to be superseded by a new regulation as outlined by him in reply to a question put in 1927 on this subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The rule to which the Deputy refers applied to the Marlborough Street Training College, which is no longer in existence.</P>
      <P>Rule 165, with note in the existing code which relates to the admission of students, in order of merit, to training colleges applies to candidates who compete at the Easter Scholarship Examination, and it is not intended to supersede it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> The preparatory colleges and the pupil-teacherships under the new system must be considered as preliminary training, and the entrance to these is by order of merit.</P>
    <P>I cannot admit that the older system of recruiting for the training colleges was satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The facts, I find, are that this case was not reported until 22nd February, and that when Mr. Murphy's premises were visited on the following day, there were only 13 swine on the premises, of which nine were already dead.  The Laboratory examination of the organs showed that the cause of death was swine fever, and the outbreak thus confirmed was dealt with as expeditiously as possible, having regard to the exceptionally heavy demands on the Department's Inspectorate owing to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease which occurred in Wexford about the same time.  On 2nd March, when a Departmental Inspector visited the premises again, he found only one pig alive.  This pig was slaughtered, and the statutory proportion of its value paid to Mr. Murphy by way of compensation, together with the sum agreed on for cleansing and disinfecting his premises.  There was some delay in sending disinfectants to complete the process of disinfection, but it is not the practice to permit re-stocking immediately after disinfection.  Permission to re-stock was issued on 22nd instant. The Department have no power to pay compensation in respect of swine that die.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The outbreak was reported on the 22nd.  A veterinary surgeon in the County Wexford was instructed by the Department to go to the premises on the 23rd.  He could be regarded for all practical purposes as the Department's veterinary surgeon; he was instructed by the Department. We had no veterinary surgeon to spare as foot and mouth disease had broken out.  The Deputy can take it that he was acting for the Deparment. It was confirmed on the 26th.  When the veterinary surgeon from the Department visited the premises there was only one pig alive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was confirmed by <i>post mortem</i> here in Dublin at the laboratory on the 26th February. With the greatest possible expedition that confirmation would get to Wexford on the 27th or 28th.  In fact, the confirmation did not reach Wexford until the 2nd.  The veterinary surgeon was not sent down until the 2nd.  That was due to the extraordinary circumstances of the time; to the fact that there was an acute outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Wexford and, in addition, a very acute outbreak of swine fever in County Dublin.  There was no unreasonable delay in the circumstances. There was no doubt that the farmer himself was very much to blame.  He admitted to the veterinary surgeon at the time that the pigs were suffering from something very like swine fever, yet he did not report it until nine were dead and four on the point of death.  There is no power in law to pay once the pigs have died.</P>

The cleansing of the stream referred to was not included in the specification of repairs required to protect works on the Studdert estate, but owing to representations made by a Mr. Richard Woulfe, of Dromlough, Lisselton, who is a tenant purchaser on the Ormathwaite estate, and whose lands are affected by the upper portion of the stream in question, the Land <Col N="1334" /> Commission have had an investigation made by an inspector, whose report they are at present considering with a view to ascertaining what steps, if any, they can take in the matter.</P>

      <P>A holding in the townland of Cregane, comprising 130a. 3r. 15p., was vested on 27th March, 1913, in Jeremiah Quaid as tenant-purchaser under the Irish Land Act, 1903, subject to a Land Purchase Annuity of £92 2s. 2d.  The purchaser died on the 27th December, 1914, and letters of administration of his personal estate were granted to his widow, Margaret Quaid, who afterwards married Richard O'Gorman.  The instalments of the land purchase annuity fell into arrear, and the Land Commission were obliged to take proceedings for their recovery, with the result that the holding was put up by the Land Commission on the 6th instant for sale by public auction for the recovery of three years' land purchase annuity and expenses, total £283 7s. 3d.  The only bidder at the auction was the said Richard O'Gorman; he signed the conditions of sale and paid the sum of <Col N="1336" /> £88 15s. as deposit on the purchase money.  The Land Commissioners refused to confirm the sale to the husband of the defaulting annuity payer and returned the deposit to the auctioneer with instructions to return it to O'Gorman with any fees he might have paid.  It would appear that a dispute exists between the children of the late owner and their step-father, the prospective purchaser O'Gorman, and legal proceedings may arise in consequence thereof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we proceed with public business to-day, I would like to draw your attention to a motion which is down on the Order Paper for Thursday next in the name of the President.  I would like to make a submission with regard to that particular motion.  It is that the motion and the manner in which it is framed are out of order, and I think it ought not to be accepted for discussion.  It raises a very serious issue.  It assumes that this House will take a certain course regarding a certain proposal which is now before us.  Making that assumption, I think it casts a reflection upon this House in so far as it implies, at any rate, on the part of the President, a belief that all the procedure for making laws in this House is a mere matter of form, and that the Standing Orders, of which I think there are almost twenty which govern the progress of Bills through various stages in this House, are of no importance whatsoever&mdash;that they partake more or less of the nature of Article 47 of the Constitution, that simply they have been devised to fool the public into the belief that the Dáil has any control whatsoever over the making of laws.  I submit that a motion like that ought not to be anticipating in its terms the decision of the Dáil in regard to any particular piece of legislation. As I said, that motion makes light of the Dáil.  It casts a reflection upon this House.  In fact, it states that this House is not the real governing authority in this country; that matters of very great importance to the people are already pre-decided before they come to this House, that they are prejudged before they come to this House, and that consequently the only thing that remains for any legislative proposal to go through when it comes to <Col N="1338" /> this House is to go through a series of stages as a matter of routine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>The President's motion says here &ldquo;which has this day been passed by the Dáil...&rdquo; Now, that notice was written five days before the Dáil could have passed the Bill.  I submit it is an attempt to get over the Standing Orders, which says that four days' notice shall be given for the motion. They assume something which was, on the face of it, untrue at the moment that this notice was written.  There is nothing in the motion itself to conclude that the date is Thursday, 28th June.  That is the date for which this motion was given in.  The motion that has been put in must be read as at the time it was put in, and it sets out that &ldquo;the Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill, 1928, which has this day been passed by Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  That notice was written at least five days before it was possible for the Bill to have been <Col N="1339" /> passed, even assuming, as this motion does assume it, that the Bill will be passed that day, and that the President will be enabled to get the closure from the Chair in order to put the Bill through within that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>The assumption is in this way&mdash;the assumption is there by anticipation in this way, that the Bill &ldquo;has this day been passed by Dáil Eireann,&rdquo; and it is perfectly obvious that the Bill has not this day been passed by Dáil Eireann.  That notice was put in five days before the Bill could have been passed by Dáil Eireann.  I suggest that it is simply a method of trying to get over the Standing Orders of this House which, in the interests of the liberty of its members, decides that four days' clear notice must be given before the motion can be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

      <P>It says at the date on which the motion has been handed in that this Bill has &ldquo;this day been passed by Dáil Eireann,&rdquo; that is, five days before the Bill can be passed by Dáil Eireann, and I submit that to the knowledge both of the putter in of the motion and of the person who received it, and everybody else in this House the statement is untrue; the statement is an untrue anticipation of the fact for the purpose of getting over the specific Standing Orders by which it is necessary that before a matter of this kind can be discussed on a motion in this House four clear days' notice must be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The notice on the Order Paper is a notice of motion.  That is to say, the motion cannot be moved before next Thursday and if, on next Thursday, the Constitution <Col N="1340" /> (Amendment No. 10) Bill, 1928, has not then been passed by Dáil Eireann, the motion will not be moved.  There is no doubt about that.  The motion is not being moved to-day, could not be moved to-day, and it cannot be moved on Thursday if the statement in the motion, that the Bill has been that day passed by Dáil Eireann, is not then true.  The point is whether this notice of motion should be allowed to appear before the Bill to which it refers has passed through all its Stages.  The notice of motion appears to be properly on the Order Paper.  It cannot be moved until the Bill to which it refers has passed through all its Stages. When the Bill has passed through all its Stages the motion will, of course, be in order.  It is, in fact, common practice to put down a notice of motion which anticipates a particular decision of the House.  On the Order Paper at the present time there are two notices of motion.  One is in the name of Deputy Thrift and it was put down before an amendment of Deputy Thrift's to a particular motion had been debated and decided upon.  The other is in the name of Deputy Tomás O Conaill and it is as follows: &ldquo;That a Select Committee consisting of eleven Deputies to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, be appointed to consider and report upon the working of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926: that the Committee have power to send for persons, papers and records.&rdquo;  That is a notice of motion contingent, presumably, upon the House adopting an amendment by Deputy O'Connell to the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Bill, 1928.  It is properly on the Order Paper.  It could, of course, be moved quite independently of the fate of that particular amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, the notice of motion in the name of the President is in order as a notice of motion.  If the Deputy has a point of order to raise about that motion when it comes up for decision, that point of order can then be received and decided upon.  That the notice of motion should appear now on the Order Paper is quite proper and quite ordinary. The contrary proposition would appear to be that the Bill must pass through its Stages and then a notice would be given in respect of a motion <Col N="1341" /> such as this which would be considered four days later.  The procedure that has been adopted seems to be quite in order and has, in fact, precedents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the proper procedure in a case like this would be that the motion could not be introduced until after the House has made its decision upon this Bill?  Then the Chair could exercise its power under the Standing Orders by suspending the Standing Order relating to the four days' notice.  That would be the way in which the difficulty should be overcome properly, if there is any regard to be had for the procedure and the dignity of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any infringement of the dignity of the House in having the notice of motion placed upon the Order Paper to-day.  That motion will be moved in the ordinary way in the event of the House making its decision upon the Bill.  It is exactly the kind of motion in connection with which the Chair would be loth, indeed, to exercise discretion in taking it without the notice that is prescribed by the Standing Orders.  I am not at all adopting Deputy MacEntee's view that the motion is one which could be accepted by the Chair without notice, or even with one day's notice.  It is much better that there should be the prescribed four days' notice.  The Bill may not have passed the Fifth Stage on Thursday.  If so, this motion cannot then be taken.</P>

      <P>I mentioned on Friday last about sitting on Wednesday morning and Thursday morning, and on Tuesday, and I stated that there would be an adjournment for lunch on the Wednesday and Thursday for an hour, or for longer than an hour if there was a request for that.  I do not mind ninety minutes, if it is not more than ninety minutes; but that was the understanding on Friday.  I think I announced last week that it was our intention to adjourn in about a fortnight, that we hoped to introduce a motion for a Vote on Account which would leave over until the autumn discussion of the Estimates which had not been considered, allowing something like forty hours for discussion, and I understood that there was general acceptance of that.</P>

      <P>Speaking on behalf of Deputies who come from the country&mdash; and I think I can speak for all Parties in this&mdash;if we hold sittings on Tuesday and not on Friday, it still means four days for country Deputies.  If we have to sit here until 10.30 on Thursday night, it will mean that another day is broken for country Deputies, that they cannot go home until Friday, and it is just as convenient for them to sit here until 2 o'clock on Friday, as it is to go away on Friday morning.

I shall not get home one bit earlier.  I shall have to keep the holiday of obligation here, as Deputy Gorey will, but the fact remains that we will be telling the people of Ireland that in this Catholic country we do respect a holiday of obligation, and that we will do so in spite of the &ldquo;ssh, ssh, sshes&rdquo; from those Benches opposite.</P>

      <P>We are discussing the question as to whether the Dáil should meet on Wednesday and Thursday of this week at 10.30, not the question as to whether we are to sit on Catholic holidays.  On that particular question agreement was reached that we would not meet on next Friday, Friday being a Catholic holiday of obligation, but with the view of leaving the whole question as to whether the House should, in practice, sit on Catholic holidays open for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to report to the House on.  If we do not sit on Friday the question need not arise before Friday, but it will arise later.  The decision with regard to Friday is merely with regard to this particular instance, and it does not govern the position generally. What we are discussing now is whether the Dáil should meet at 10.30 on Wednesday and Thursday, and we are deciding that only.</P>

It is too much to ask the Deputies to sit the twelve hours on end and to prepare in a proper manner for discussions in the Dáil.  We are not coming here simply to discuss some work that has been prepared for us and to give a decision on it; we have to make up the work each day before we come to the Dáil, but sitting for twelve hours on end gives Deputies no opportunity to make up that work.

Apart from any agreement that may be arrived at, I propose to suspend the sittings to-morrow between a quarter to two o'clock and two o'clock for at least one hour, or any longer period over that that may be agreed upon.

The principal argument is this: that there are questions which had <Col N="1353" /> best be decided by being separated from other questions and put as distinct issues.  It is easy to imagine, at a General Election, a party being elected to which the people would be prepared to give authority on broad general terms, but there were certain particular points of their policy to which the people as a whole objected, or that there were certain questions in which the people were interested and on which it was likely that party would not take action.  As far as we are concerned, we believe there is one particular question&mdash;this is an example &mdash;in which the people would be very glad to have an opportunity of declaring their will when separated from other issues.  I indicated that by saying that the people wished to change Article 17 of the Constitution.  A petition brought here to this House, signed by over 96,000 persons, indicates the widespread interest that there is in that particular matter.  If the Initiative is deleted from this particular Article of the Constitution, it is only the preliminary to deleting it elsewhere, as we can see from the whole Bill.  On that account, we intend to oppose the section, because we believe that the Initiative ought to be preserved for these reasons.  It has worked satisfactorily in other places and is, I submit, a particularly satisfactory way of dealing with a situation such as in our circumstances we are likely to have to deal with.  The events during the last four or five years were such that we believe the people have been confused.  My point of view is that they have been deliberately confused as regards certain issues, and we want to give them the opportunity of separating these issues and have them brought up for separate decision by the people.</P>

      <P>The real purpose of this is to regularise and to implement the democratic rights of the people.  I could quite understand a case being made in respect of certain alterations in the Constitution by giving a larger number of electors such a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number that is down in the Constitution would represent approximately three per cent. of the electorate. <Col N="1354" /> Now the position would be that three per cent. could put into motion something which 60 or 70 per cent. of the electorate do not want, and impose considerable expenditure on the general community.  As regards the particular question mentioned by the Deputy, three per cent. of the electorate could seek to make a majority of the representatives of the people carry out the policy of a minority.  That is not democratic, and I do not stand for it.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the President what is the basis of his thought at all?  Is it not clear that before anything can be passed there must be a majority of the people in favour of it?  If we talk about majority rule at all, where are you going to get it more clearly expressed than when a single definite question is put to the people, and they are asked to decide upon it.  Talking about the majority party having to carry out the will of the people, I understood they were supposed to be the Ministers of the people, that their object was to carry out the policy that the people agreed upon and not to impose some policy of their own on the people.  The whole question of the Initiative is clearly to indicate that the people want a certain thing to be done.  If the Executive do not want to do that, then the remedy is to get some people who will do it. As far as we are concerned, we believe that when there is a clear question settled by the people, by the majority vote of the people, that it is the duty of the Ministry to implement that and carry it out as their policy.</P>

      <P>Section 1 is in the Bill merely because of section 3, and I think that it is on section 3 the provisions of Article 48 can be discussed.  The whole machinery of the Constitution provides the matter can be discussed on Section 3 rather than on <Col N="1355" /> Section 1.  I would be much more satisfied to allow section 3 to be discussed widely than to allow the whole matter to be discussed on Section 1, on which the matters in Article 14 do not really arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 14 when passed will read:&mdash;&ldquo;All citizens of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) without distinction of sex, who have reached the age of twenty-one years and who comply with the provisions of the prevailing electoral laws, shall have the right to vote for members of Dáil Eireann and to take part in the Referendum&mdash;&rdquo; and then the words &ldquo;and Initiative&rdquo; are omitted, and it follows on: &ldquo;All citizens of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) without distinction of sex, who have reached the age of thirty years and who comply with the provisions of the prevailing electoral laws, shall have the right to vote for members of Seanad Eireann.&rdquo; That, of course, is amended by another Act, so I need not refer to that.  There will not be much left of Article 14 by the time the amendments are passed. It is in respect of this Article it is sought to deprive citizens directly of their rights to the power of the Initiative, for Article 48 rather puts into force what Article 14 lays down. Article 14 gives the right to all citizens of the Free State to take part in the Initiative.  Of course, the Initiative is an experiment in a sense.  The argument that the Initiative has succeeded or not succeeded, or that some particular measure has not existed before, is a relevant argument, but it should not carry much weight with a country trying to break new ground in democratic methods.  Even if the Initiative has failed in other countries, or had not been properly tried, that is no reason why it should not be tried here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once it is put into the Constitution there is every reason to give it a fair trial and experimenting properly with it before it is turned down.  The whole attitude of the Government in this matter is one very definitely distrustful of the people, and is a gradual departure from relying on the people for any liberal institutions.  The people are quite as intelligent as those who are at <Col N="1356" /> the head of the Government, and in the end representative government may be found very imperfect indeed.  There is a good deal of fiction talked about representative government, a good deal of what might be called myths gathering round the sacred institutions of representative government.  It may be found in the long run that a more sensible, but in some ways perhaps less picturesque, way of dealing with certain matters of local government may be found in direct government and not in representative government&mdash;I mean a meeting of the people or a direct judgment by the people, and not a judgment merely by representatives of the people. There is no reason why people should not be educated up to such a standard that they would be able to think in masses as well as to think as individuals.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why on large issues they should not have the power of Initiative.  People cannot develop their strength unless they try and practise. No matter what people are put to they must develop the strength to do it. They must be educated to do a thing. When they are given the right to do something and they try to do it they will get to know how to do it.  If that right is taken away on the grounds they are unable to do it, that is stultifying oneself entirely.  Once the Initiative is there the people should be given the opportunity of trying it.  When we had supplied the opportunity by the petition the reasonable thing was to see whether it was going to work properly or not.  The argument that there is apathy in the country, or that the institutions of freedom have not been exercised, or that the people should lose their institutions simply because of the amount of apathy, would also apply to the present Government which depends on a minority of 61 representatives out of a House of 153, but the Government is not going to go out of existence simply because it happens to be in a minority.  Similarly, if the Initiative was supported only by a minority that is no reason why it should not be recognised. The people as a whole should have the right to exercise their powers, and if they do not that is their business and it is no reason why their rights should be taken from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that the way I looked on it was that the possible deletion of Article 47 was a short-cut to dealing with the part intended for the Seanad.  After all, the only reason that it should come into this set of Bills is that it should define the relation of the Seanad.  The object of the amendment is to delete from Article 47 the portion relating to the Seanad. To delete the other portion would be to strike, first of all, at the powers of the minority here, which were definitely guaranteed by the Constitution, which was taken by the Executive to the country and lauded from one end of the Twenty-six Counties to the other.  To take away these rights of the minority without reference to the people is wrong and is also something which, I think, members of this House ought to <Col N="1359" /> oppose as taking away their powers. Therefore, there are three things referred to here, namely, the powers of the Seanad, certain powers of the Dáil, and certain powers of the people.  If this Bill is to go with the other Bills, it is not unfair to presume that it is going with them because it refers to certain powers.  I submit that the amendment should be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that that is an argument on the merits which the Chair cannot meet or deal with in any way.  I have given the matter consideration.  The Title and the contents of the Bill are very clear. The Bill is to delete Articles 47 and 48. The line of argument which the Deputy has been using would be open to him in opposing the section and endeavouring to retain Article 47, which could then be amended, but the Bill is not one to amend that Article.  The principle of the Bill which was dealt with on Second Reading is that Article 47 be deleted. That leaves a possibility of deleting the operative section, but I do not think that the operative section is open to amendment of this kind.  Indeed, I am not clear that it is open to an amendment of any kind.</P>

      <P>Yes.  If the amendment were relevant to the contents of the Bill it could be inserted and a consequential amendment made to the Title, but the amendments on the Order Paper appear to be contrary to the principle of the Bill, which is to delete Articles 47 and 48.  Apart from the Title, I am going on what the Bill contains rather than on the Title.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>That is on the assumption that this Bill has a scope independent of the other Bills, that it is not one of the series at all; that, over and above anything which it may do as one of the series, it has wider powers.  If that is your interpretation of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not called on to interpret the Bill as one of a series but as a Bill which was given Second Reading.  What the <Col N="1360" /> House has given Second Reading to is a Bill for the deletion of Articles 47 and 48, and all that appears to be open now is opposition to the section rather than an attempt to retain Article 47 partially.  I am not called on to decide the other question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we are in order in opposing the section. Article 47, as I indicated, might be included in a series of Bills of this kind, and the deletion of it might have been put down in a Bill simply because it had reference to certain powers of which it was proposed to deprive the Seanad.  The Article itself gives power, first of all, to two-fifths of the members of Dáil Eireann to demand in writing the suspension for ninety days of any Bill passed by a majority.  It gives power also to the majority of members of the Seanad to do the same thing. The result of these powers, particularly those of the Dáil, if exercised, would be to send any Bill which passed both Houses to the people for final decision. That power of final decision gave the people the power of veto, which is a very important one.  In other Constitutions the power of veto over acts of the Legislature is given sometimes to the Chief Executive&mdash;a partial or suspensory veto, and in some cases there is power of complete veto. To give such power to anybody but the people is unreasonable.  The people ought to have that power and be in a position to say that a certain measure, which it is proposed by a majority to pass, shall not be passed.</P>
      <P>It is only fair and reasonable that, if they are the fount of all authority, they should be able to exercise that authority in some really effective way. There is no way so effective as the way of the Referendum.  I know, of course, it might be abused, but the fact that a thing which is useful and right may be abused is no reason why it should be completely blotted out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it is only reasonable if the people are the fount of all authority on all questions that they should ultimately decide all questions, questions as to the laws that ought to govern them, and particularly questions about the Constitution, which was to be the fundamental law governing all the other laws.  I think I indicated also that as far as I was concerned I did not think that power ought to lie anywhere except with the representatives of the people&mdash;the power of sending back laws.  I think there ought to be a fair proportion of the elected representatives required in order to compel a Bill to be submitted to the people, and the number asked here is two-fifths.  It seems to me to be a very fair number.  It means, for instance, that in this House it would be necessary to have 61 or 62 signatures&mdash;62 would probably be held to be the number&mdash;before a Bill could be referred to the people.  That would mean that there would be substantial opposition to the measure from the representatives of the people, and those who would demand that it should be sent back to the people would be taking a certain responsibility upon themselves.  If it <Col N="1362" /> were a frivolous demand, they would be running a certain risk when they came before the people later for reelection. The people would say, &ldquo;Very well, you abused the power which you had on a certain occasion; you caused money unnecessarily to be spent.&rdquo;  I think that would be a sufficient safeguard for the people, and would ensure that this power of the Referendum would not be abused.</P>
      <P>A good deal was said about it when the Constitution was going through. One section, for instance, said that it was likely to be a clog upon legislation, that it was going to be used in a reactionary sense.  Well, if we are going to admit the principle that the people are to be the ultimate masters, I hold for one that we must be prepared to take it when it is a clog as well as in the other direction when it is an incentive to action.  We must look at our own circumstances.  After all we are not sitting down and theoretically examining these questions.  We must regard our own conditions; our people are conservative and the barriers there as to progress are many.  The clogs on their action generally are very great.  One should not be in a hurry, I will admit, to give any further powers in that direction, but again I say that if we are going to accept the principle that the people are ultimately to be masters, to decide all questions affecting the general interest, we cannot get over the fact that they should be permitted directly to decide upon questions whenever they are considered sufficiently important to be referred to them by such a large minority as two-fifths of the total number of members here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I objected to the Seanad and that was why the amendment was put down.  I object to giving that power to the Seanad, particularly the Seanad that you are going to have.  It is a Seanad not directly elected by the people. There are objections to having a Seanad directly elected by the people.  We have mentioned these in another connection. Seeing that the Seanad that is going to be the Seanad here are divorced largely from the people, we think it is improper that they should be in a position to hold up legislation by referring it unnecessarily back.  That does not, we think, <Col N="1363" /> apply to the case where we have 62 members out of 150, or two-fifths.  When you have such a proportion opposed to a measure, and when they are prepared to take the responsibility of referring, that power should not be denied them. We are opposed, therefore, to the deletion of Article 47 on that account &mdash;that it takes away from the representatives of the people, the members of this House, the right which they understood they had and which the people understood they had.  Finally it is taking away from the people the opportunity of finally deciding.  There is a further safeguard beside the safeguard of having to get as many as 62 members to make the demand; there is the safeguard that that is only sufficient to suspend the Bill for 90 days.  After that, within the 90 days, a petition must be signed by not less than one-twentieth of the voters on the Register. That is a safeguard against arbitrary action on the part of the representatives. Not merely must there be 62 representatives, but they must be able to get, within 90 days, something like 90,000 signatures.  When you can get 90,000 signatures within 90 days against any particular measure, there must be a good deal of public interest in it and of opposition to the particular Bill.</P>
    <P>As to the Referendum, as was stated in one of the papers this morning, there would have been conscription in Australia had the people not possessed the power of the Referendum.  I believe there will be many occasions here on which the people will regret that this power of the Referendum has not been retained for them, should it be taken away now.  These are, in the present connection, the considerations which have decided us to vote against the deletion of this Article 47.  We believe that it is not playing straight with the people to take away this Article without giving them an opportunity of expressing their will upon it, in view of the fact that at several elections the democratic nature of this Constitution was held up as a reason why it should be supported and why the Executive that was in favour of this Constitution should be returned.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would not be out of place to refer to the final sentence in this <Col N="1364" /> Article which says:&mdash;&ldquo;This provision shall not apply to Money Bills&rdquo;&mdash; there is good reason for that, of course &mdash;&ldquo;or to such Bills as shall be declared by both Houses to be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety.&rdquo;  I am quite sure that anybody taking that Article and voting for that sentence in it did not think that it would ever be used to call upon the House to declare what was an obvious falsehood&mdash;to declare that in connection with the present measures there is any urgency, in the sense that there would be in the case of a Money Bill, or that there was involved a necessity for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety.  We got notice of a certain motion which is going to be moved under this Article, and when we see the use that it is proposed to make of that Article, one only wonders why anybody bothers about the Constitution at all.  We held certain views about this Constitution generally before we came here.  Since we have come here we have not seen very much which would cause us to alter our views.  We have believed all the time that it would be used in a partisan fashion; that one section would use it to prevent the Irish nation from marching ahead, and that whenever they wished to abuse or ignore it they could do so.  Our opposition to the deleting of this particular Article is because of the principle contained in it, but as far as I am concerned for one, the moment this set of Bills has gone through, if they do go through, whatever little regard I had for it up to the present will have vanished.  I for one will believe, if we are going to be reasonable at all, that everyone will regard themselves here as being in an assembly for which there is no fundamental law.  I am very glad to accept that position any day, but the Executive are not honestly declaring that to be the position.  They want to maintain and to carry on the camouflage that there is a Constitution&mdash;that they will use it to interfere with their political opponents, use it simply for that purpose.  But from the point of view of getting respect for it as fundamental law, that respect must have vanished from the mind of anybody who saw what happened here on Article <Col N="1365" /> 48, what is happening now in connection with this particular Article, and particularly what is going to happen in connection with the application of the last sentence in that Article.  For my part, I am quite glad&mdash;very happy about it.  I hope everybody in the House will realise that the position we are arriving at is one in which this House and its will to do anything is to be sovereign; that we have definitely arrived at a position in which we will say that there is no fundamental law whatever; that this House is sovereign from day to day; that what it does to-day it can change to-morrow without any restrictions whatever, except the momentary restrictions which may be law; in other words, we are getting rapidly to the stage in which there is no fundamental law.  If that be the purpose of the Executive and their action at present, I for one will welcome it.  The only thing is that I would like to have it clearly declared, and not simply a pretence being carried on that we have a Constitution to which we must give a certain amount of obedience and respect.</P>

      <P>During the debate on the Second Reading of this Bill most of the discussion centred round Article 48, which provides for the Initiative.  That was the impression one got from listening to the debate. Little was said, especially from the Government Benches, with regard to Article 47, which is the subject of this particular section.  To my mind, no good or sufficient reason, in fact no reason, was put forward from the Government Benches that I remember to justify the deletion of this Article 47 from the Constitution.  Whatever semblance of argument there might be for the deletion of the Initiative, in my opinion, there was none for this one, and there is none for this one.  This Article provides a check on legislation introduced into the House by an unscrupulous Executive and forced through the House by a small majority. That was the object of the Article&mdash;to give the right of check to a minority, and, as Deputy de Valera said, it is only in the case of a substantial minority that that right is given.  Two-fifths of the Dáil are empowered under <Col N="1366" /> this Article to hold up legislation for 90 days during which it is possible, on the application of a certain proportion of the voters, to have the matter subjected to a Referendum&mdash;in other words, to have the question submitted directly to the people and to let the people decide.  As I said, that was put in definitely as a check on legislation that would interfere with or infringe the rights of the minorities.  With its disappearance there will be no check. An Executive elected, let us assume, and returned to power on whatever specious pleas, such as are put forward at a general election, will have complete power to do almost whatever it likes for the period of five years.  There will be no check upon them.  This Executive that we have here are removing the last check which is in the Constitution upon such power.  They tell us they have authority for that. Where is the authority from the people?  We have it from the President that this was put before the people at the last election.  What proportion of the President's manifesto, issued on the 25th August, did that particular question occupy?  I have not the manifesto before me.  I wonder could the President tell us whether it is mentioned in that manifesto that he proposed to take away this power from the people which was given them by Article 47?  I do not believe it is in his manifesto at all.  He comes here now and tells us that he has authority from the people to remove this Article and that he is acting in the name of the people.  If he is genuinely acting in the name of the people, he should not be afraid to submit this question to the people.  That he is afraid to submit this question to the people and that he is not sure what their decision would be, he has already given evidence of in the motion that appears on the Paper this morning.  The question of expense is mentioned.  It was mentioned that a small proportion of the people could set certain machinery in motion.  Why should not a small proportion have the right to set the machinery in motion if they wish to do so?  If it is thought that a proportion of one-twentieth is too small and not a sufficient number, they can increase it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President has no evidence whatever <Col N="1367" /> to justify his contention that this will be used for vexatious purposes or to clog legislation.  After all, a substantial number of Deputies&mdash;two-fifths&mdash;will not, purely for the sake of clogging legislation or hindering legislation, submit a question of this kind to the people time after time.  They know it would destroy their political future if they adopted measures of that kind, and it is only when they believe that the question was a substantial one, on which the people as a whole felt very strongly, that they would take the risk of submitting a question of this kind to the people and getting their decision upon it.  If the majority of the people decide that the question is one that ought not to be adopted, what right has the Executive here, who speak in the name of the people, to put it into force?</P>

      <P>The majority of the people who voted are the people that put the Executive into power.  If you insist upon the point in one case you must insist upon it in the other, and also insist that before any Executive can claim to have power in this House a majority of the voters on the register must have voted for them.  Is the President prepared to take that view?  He knows if he took that view he would not be in power to-day.  If the principle is good in one case it is equally good in another case.  If it is necessary that the majority of the people on the register must vote in the case of the Referendum to decide the question, then it should be equally necessary or proper that a party that claims to have power should get a majority of the voters on the register and not a majority of the votes cast in the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Article was put in by the Provisional Parliament which framed this Constitution to show that the people had power and always would hold that power.  The President talks a lot about democracy here.  The tendency of a democratic people always is to resist the power of the Executive.  It may <Col N="1368" /> not be necessary for us to say anything about this particular Executive to realise that an unscrupulous Executive is a possibility and, therefore, it was the object of the framers of this Constitution, and the people who passed this Constitution, to take measures to protect the people against that possibility or contingency, and now, just because there is an obedient majority in this House prepared to follow this Executive into the Division Lobby on a matter of this kind without question, it is proposed to take away this check from the people, and it is proposed to adopt methods that are not worthy of any Executive in order to carry out the object of preventing the people having a right to say whether or not that should be done.  I think that every right-minded person is in duty bound to protest in the strongest possible way against the action of the Government in this whole matter.</P>

      <P>This Article has been in the Constitution since December, 1922, and only on one occasion during those years did two-fifths of the members of the Dáil sign a requisition to hold up any measure&mdash;once in six years.  If one were to pay attention to what Deputy O'Connell said, one would think that this was a sort of right that was exercised freely during that time, and that the Government was now seeking to take away this power of which there had been full enjoyment during that period of time.  The only enjoyment of that power in that whole period was one petition presented to the President of the Executive Council which was not followed by a petition, having the names of only five per cent. of the electors on the register to protest against that Act being passed into law.</P>

Deputies on the benches opposite and on the Labour benches have excellent experience of that matter.  They have been trying to get power for five years.

      <P>The whole fact of the matter is this: the Executive get authority in this country, or in any <Col N="1370" /> other country with proportional representation, and they must have support from other parties.  When Deputies speak about unscrupulous tactics on the part of an Executive in those circumstances they know very well that they are exaggerating, that it is pure exaggeration. They will know, if they look at the history of this country for the last four or five years, that in connection with ordinary Parliamentary work numbers of vacancies occur in constituencies and this question and other questions are raised there.</P>

      <P>And the work of the Executive, the general tenor of legislation passed there, is canvassed at the elections in those constituencies and at general elections and before general elections take place.  I submit that it is the height of nonsense, simply nonsense, to be talking about those things and talking about the taking away of the rights of democracy.  We must secure the rights of democracy, and we must see that the will of the majority of the people is going to carry. It does not happen that on every single issue that is presented to Parliament it is possible to get a decision in connection with that from the people.  But there ought to be finality, and finality can only come through the ordinary methods of Parliamentary representation and decisions in the Parliament. I would like to know if it is within the experience of Deputies who have made an examination of the Constitutions of other countries whether such a thing as this is included in the Constitutions of other countries, whether it would not make for instability rather than stability, and whether it would not make for less respect for the institution of Parliament and less confidence in Parliament if this were the practice and the usage in the ordinary way?</P>

      <P>There is probably no Deputy in this House who is so capable of advancing fair argument in support of a rotten cause as the President.  In the discussion on the first section of this Bill he described it as a Bill to regularise and implement the democratic sections of the Constitution.  We have heard him make audacious statements before, but that statement, I think, was quite enough to take one's breath away.  A Bill to regularise and implement the democratic sections of the Constitution!  Does the President contend that Articles 47 and 48 are not democratic sections?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not?  Then the discussion on these Bills that we have been proceeding with was at cross purposes.  That discussion was at cross purposes all the time.  What is <Col N="1372" /> democracy?  Is it undemocratic to provide that the people may, by a majority vote, sanction or withhold their sanction from an Act of this House?  Is it undemocratic to provide that the people may, by majority vote, initiate and pass legislation with or without the consent of the majority of this House? Is it undemocratic to have a majority vote of the people prevailing in any issue?  If that is undemocratic, then what is democratic?  If these are not the democratic sections of the Constitution, I would like the President to refer us to them.  Is Article 17 a democratic section?  Is that the section which it is hoped to regularise and implement as a result of the passing of this Bill?  If that is not a democratic section of the Constitution, what is?</P>
      <P>I have recently studied this Constitution very carefully.  In the course of the debate on the Second Reading of one of these Bills I went, one by one, through the sections of the Constitution which I considered undemocratic, but Article 47 and Article 48 were not in the lot.  I did not consider them undemocratic. The President, I think, can fairly be said to be a prohibitionist in the matter of democratic rights.  He will regularise and implement the democratic sections of the Constitution by putting them into cold storage, where they cannot be touched.  But does he not think that when he has carried his constitutional amendments and has prohibited democratic rights in the Free State, that a situation might arise here very similar to the situation that arose in America after the prohibition on liquor was established&mdash;that as people in America went looking for liquor surreptitiously, other people might go looking for liberty and freedom surreptitiously? When all these democratic rights have been implemented and legalised out of existence, and when the only things left will be the sections which bear the hall mark &ldquo;made in England,&rdquo; is the situation which will then exist in this State likely to be preferable to that which now exists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Constitution, as I have already stated, was always rotten in the major part of it, but there were a few clean spots in it, a few spots which do recognise the fact that the Irish people have <Col N="1373" /> some rights in this country.  Even these spots the President is proposing to rub out, and then there will be nothing left except sections which provide that the Irish people must subordinate themselves to an external authority under certain circumstances.  That is all that will be left, and that will be the fundamental law of this State and we will be glad.  We will be glad because there will be less hypocrisy about it.  The President has excused himself about this Article on the grounds of ignorance&mdash; that it was on the grounds of ignorance these sections were introduced into the Constitution in 1922, when the Constitution was being enacted, and when he was a much more innocent and less experienced man than he is now.</P>

He said that in ordinary normal circumstances this Article would not have been in the Constitution. I hope I am correct in quoting his words.  What were the abnormal circumstances, apart from the President's ignorance, which resulted in putting this Article in the Constitution? What circumstances existed in 1922 that do not now exist and which forced upon the Executive of that day the necessity to put Articles of this kind in the Constitution?</P>

      <P>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle has scruples about going back to 1921, but there was no time in the history of this country when the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party did not express themselves ready to accept the will of the people at all times and the people as the final arbiters.  The will of the people was to be supreme, and the democratic sections of the Constitution were to be accepted.</P>

      <P>If any member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party is prepared to accept the will of the people on this issue, I trust that next Thursday, when the motion of the President on the matter of urgency concerning this Article is brought in, that such Deputy will vote against the motion, which says that &ldquo;the passing of this Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety.&rdquo; The abolition of this Article may be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health and safety of Cumann na nGaedheal, but I do not think it has anything to do with the nation.  We should remember that the Irish people have not got a very long experience of self-government, and their views concerning self-government are likely to be considerably influenced by the votes of those here.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the possibility of an unscrupulous Executive coming into office, but the people are wondering if there is any possibility of a scrupulous Executive ever coming into office.  They have had no experience of one, and they are beginning to think that an honest Government is an unrealisable ideal, when they see those whom they elected to implement this Treaty and to preserve this Constitution against the attacks of Deputies on this side of the House, coming before the House with ten Bills in order to abolish every section in the Constitution which has any meaning, because the remaining sections in the Constitution about His Britannic Majesty and the rest of it are largely meaningless, except in so far as a certain amount of force can be advanced to make them operative. The President, of course, has tried apparently to search the Constitutions of the world to see if he could find therein any justification for the abolition of this Article.  Did such an Article exist in the Constitution of any other country in the world?  I remember the time when the President as a member of the Sinn Féin Party was <Col N="1377" /> very glad when the news came here that as a result of the Referendum in Australia, invoked by Archbishop Mannix, the proposal to conscript the people there to fight England's war in Europe was defeated.</P>

      <P>In any case, there was proposed an enactment there that was directly contrary to the will of the people, and that enactment was defeated, and it was defeated by reason of the fact that an Article providing for the Referendum under certain circumstances did exist.  Let us have straight talking in connection with this. If it is proposed to strip the people of their democratic rights, let us say so. If it is proposed to hold up this Constitution to ridicule, let us say so and we will be with you. If it is proposed to scrap this Constitution let us say so and we will be with you, but let us not take the democratic sections out of this Constitution with the cry of the will of the people on our lips.  That is merely hypocrisy.  It is merely an attempt to deceive the people.  The assumption that because you have done it once you can do it twice is wrong.  You deceived the people when you put in these sections. Do you think you can also deceive the people when you take them out?  The people of this country have been easily deceived in the past.  They have shown themselves to be what is commonly called &ldquo;green,&rdquo; particularly when arguments are advanced in support of certain Articles, arguments similar to those advanced by the President here this evening.  But they cannot be that soft that they are supposed to be taken in with sheer nonsense like that.  It was President Lincoln who said something about deceiving all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time.  He knew what he was talking about.  President Cosgrave and his henchmen will, undoubtedly, succeed in deceiving some of the people all the time, but is he absolutely certain <Col N="1378" /> that he will succeed in deceiving all the people all the time?</P>

      <P>I am sorry to hear the President express such a lack of confidence in his own ability.  He has been trying very hard.  He has done his best.  He sees failure; he knows that he cannot carry that out, and that sooner or later he will be found out.  That is something pleasant to look forward to. But as regards the Deputies who sit behind him do they think that in cooperation with him they will be able to carry out this bluff?  I regret to remark that there are only one-tenth of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party here in this Chamber, only one-tenth of these men who were such vehement defenders of this Constitution some few months ago.  One would have thought that these men would have had the decency to come to its funeral.  They will not even come to listen to the arguments for maintaining the Constitution.  They prefer to sit out in the Lobby waiting for the Division bell to ring in order to come in and vote it away.  I hope that if we cannot succeed in teaching what the Minister for Agriculture calls &ldquo;the proper canons of political honesty&rdquo; to Deputies in this House that some knowledge of what is going on here will filter through to the people.  I hope so.  I am not very hopeful that it will. Remember, there is between this House and the people a very definite barrier, constituted by the daily Press.  But it is just possible that some idea of what is happening, some hint of the truth, will get to the people, and if it does, do you think that the will of the people will be that the democratic rights which were given to them by this Constitution should be taken away from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do you think that the people are so willing to believe in the inspired wisdom of Cumann na nGaedheal that they will surrender any and every check which they possess upon the actions of Cumann na nGaedheal?  Let this Article go.  It has got to go.  A majority of this House has decided.  It is well, from my point of view, that any Article of this Constitution which could, in any conceivable circumstances, <Col N="1379" /> be referred to as a justification for retaining it should be wiped out.  The Government intends to have nothing in this Constitution but the naked truth, the naked truth that this is a subordinate State and that the ultimate authority in this State is not the people or the representatives of the people.  When nothing else remains in this Constitution, I can assure you that the Fianna Fáil Party will be very glad to spend a few pounds in printing and circulating it so that the people will get a fair idea as to what the fundamental law is.  At present we would hesitate to do so because of these Articles which were inserted in the abnormal circumstances of 1922.  These Articles were written by people who were determined that the pill would be well coated with sugar.  They were written by people who knew their job, just as, now that the success of their task has been amply proved and that the people have, by repeated elections, shown their gullibility by re-electing the present Executive, the necessity for keeping the sugar has disappeared, and all these Articles are in consequence being deleted.  Very well.  If, however, there are in this House any Deputies who are really honest and who stated that they were prepared to support this Constitution, if there are any Deputies who meant what they said when they went to the people and asked to be elected in preference to members of the Fianna Fáil Party because they were constitutional, I hope that they will indicate their honesty, when the Division bell rings, by their votes on this section.</P>

      <P>Deputies on the other side talk about democratic Articles of the Constitution and about the elimination of these Articles.  To my mind&mdash;and I know that Deputy Lemass will smile when I say this&mdash;it is in the interests of democracy to do away with the Referendum and the Initiative in the Constitution, because when we talked about the will of the people and government by the people when the British were here we talked about self-government. But what Deputies opposite fail to realise is that the fundamental need <Col N="1380" /> is government.  The mere fact that people have to live in society means that they must be ordered and regulated, and therefore there is a need for laws.  That is a fundamental ethical principle in what you might call the ethics of the citizen.  If you say to all the people: &ldquo;You are the people who are to decide how this country is to be managed,&rdquo; the ordinary experience of humanity is that if you leave it to the people it becomes anarchy, because there are mutually contradicting and mutually warring sections and interests in the people.  Therefore the people select a much smaller body from themselves to govern the country, to organise and to maintain law, and to institute order in the relations of the people.  The outstanding way in which that is done here is by a general election.</P>

On the other hand, the people who are in opposition are in a position&mdash;I am not blaming them for it&mdash;of presenting to the people for the purpose of misleading them things which are mutually contradictory. Does any Deputy suggest that if you put to the people by Referendum, &ldquo;That taxation be abolished,&rdquo; they would not be in favour of it?  I have no doubt that on that point Fianna Fáil could get a great majority.  On the other hand, if the Labour Party put forward for a Referendum, &ldquo;That old age pensions be given to everyone over thirty and that they be £1,000 a <Col N="1381" /> year,&rdquo; we would all vote for it.  But the two things are mutually contradictory. We have heard of adult suffrage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have here adult suffrage.  Why is it adult?  Because the democratic act of making a government is an adult act and requires thought; it requires a certain weighing of pros and cons.  When we have a general programme put before the people, the people have to swallow a certain amount that they do not like in order to get a certain amount that they do.  Necessarily.  Nobody likes paying taxes; even the members of the Government Party are not at all anxious to pay taxes, but it simply has to be done.  The Referendum is a means of deluding the people.  On the one hand, you have here the Government responsible.  What we do we have to stand over.  We are accused of having done certain things in the past, and rightly accused, if you like.  We stand over what we have done, but if this Dáil was so arranged that we might have a sort of back chat across it, when certain things we take responsibility for are mentioned, we could refer to <Col N="1382" /> certain things done, I believe, on the responsibility of the people in opposition, but for which they have never been put in a position of having to stand over.  I suggest that a general election is an adult act by adults.  A democratic system of government requires something from the democracy. It requires that they should weigh what they consider is most important in their own interests, or in the nation's interests, and that they should say: &ldquo;In order to have this, which we consider a pre-eminently good thing, we must swallow this which we consider not at all a good thing, but which we think is worth while accepting in order to have the greater good.&rdquo;  If you segregate each particular item and put it to the people, how are you going to have any coherent form of government?  Is there going to be democracy?  There is not. There is actually going to be a form practically of minority government, because although you may have a majority&mdash;different people making a majority in each case for each individual item&mdash;when you get the whole policy, the whole system of government, the whole method of regulating the lives of the people and of conserving and adding to the production of the country, would there be any majority in the people who would stand for all that is there?  There would not. You take a general programme and you put it before the people.  If you are elected as a government you fulfil that programme as far as you can, and you have to stand up before the people and answer for not having fulfilled what you have not done.  This other system is a system that is naturally popular with people whose whole programme is an attempt to delude the people, and I will give one definite instance of how this thing can be used.  Deputies on the other side have been around the country. First of all they called upon the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This other matter, which it is admitted now has been a failure in practically every country where it has been instituted, is an attempt to, as I might say, spoon-feed the people, and in spoon-feeding them incidentally to drug them.  Democracy, I understand, is putting responsibility upon the people.  The Referendum, as it would work out, would be taking responsibility from the people. Everybody could vote for the thing they liked on any Referendum that is put before them, and a man could get up afterwards and say: &ldquo;Oh, yes, I voted for the abolition of taxation, but I had no idea that that would mean the abolition of old age pensions as well.&rdquo;  Or a man could get up and say: &ldquo;Oh, yes, I voted that all the people who fought on any side should get pensions, but at the same time I had no idea that that was going to add to taxation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No.  We are not trying to prevent them.  I am not a member of the Fianna Fáil Party at all.  The Deputy seems to be making a mistake.  But on every act we have got to be judged, and I suggest that no Government can be judged by a system of governing by Referendum, which is really cousin-german to anarchy, because you cannot have a comprehensive, coherent Government where one body of people may make a majority on one point, and another body of people may make a majority <Col N="1386" /> on another point.  Under the system of general election the majority of the people if they like can vote for Fianna Fáil with all their promises and find out their mistake afterwards, or on the other hand if they like they can vote for the Government they have, with a restricted programme and restricted promises, because we have had the misfortune, if you like, to have been governing here for some time, and know that we cannot promise beyond our powers of fulfilment. That is, to my mind, a perfectly legitimate and easily worked form of democratic Government.  I admit that it requires a certain amount of thought on the part of adult voters. Under the Referendum system you could have, not in this country, but in other countries where women are in a majority, the women voting in a majority in favour of conscription for the men.</P>

      <P>You must let me assert that there are means of preventing that.  On the one hand the people elect a Government.  Certain restrictions must be put on that Government. But you can put such restrictions on that Government as would prevent it functioning at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There comes the <i>modus vivendi;</i> you put on so many restrictions that you make government impossible.  Then you come back to the position so loved by some people, the position of anarchy.  People have to put certain confidence in a Government when they elect it, and you have to rely on the fact that if the Government is governing in direct violation to the wishes of the people, that Government cannot prevail for long. You must trust them.  If on the contrary you say once a Government is elected.  &ldquo;We never knew what villainy it might do.&rdquo;  It is quite a legitimate thing to say.  But you have to bring a certain amount of commonsense to bear on it; you have to trust that the people in voting will have some regard for <Col N="1388" /> ordinary honesty, ordinary patriotism in candidates.  You may make a mistake, I quite agree.  But are you going to prevent a coherent Government for all time in this country because once in 300 years you may have a Government remaining in power a month or a year after it has forfeited the people's confidence? I suggest it is a matter of commonsense.  Does any one say that a system whereby the people have two coherent policies that mutually contradict and have to decide one way or the other between them is not democratic? Why?  Because it requires a certain amount of thinking on the part of the people.  When you have a system where each individual thing is voted on individually by the people does that make for government by the majority? Necessarily it does not.  You have a whole programme of the work of government of the country, and you have a majority for each individual point, but for the whole coherent system of government you may not have one person in favour of it in the whole country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>You could have as many majorities as you had individual points to submit to the people, but you would not necessarily have a majority for a whole coherent system of government.  Out of three people, A, B, and C, the position might be this, that A might vote for one thing and B and C for another, and if you were to add D, E, and so on, you might have an unlimited number of permutations. All that I am protesting against is the suggestion that doing away, if you like, with these ultra modern fancy things, which may look splendid enough on paper, is undemocratic, because to anyone who takes the trouble to look into them it will be seen that they are splendid machines for misleading the people and for making the whole machinery of government impossible in this country.  They would leave the position such that it would be impossible to carry on government.  From my point of view at least, the one thing that is pre-eminently necessary in this or any other country is government.  It <Col N="1389" /> may not necessarily be perfect government. Necessarily above all things, what a government is required for is to maintain law and order and to regulate the mutual relations between the people of a country.  That you must have. Under a system of government of the people declaring their will by Referendum on each individual point you may make that essential moral good impossible in this country.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite talk about democracy. I am talking about democratic government.  You can have a democracy which amounts to anarchy, and that is a thing that I have no use for.  Under the form of democracy, as understood by the Deputies opposite, each person might be having his own will in the most perfect fashion imaginable, but it would not be government and, therefore. would be bad.  Democracy, if it means anarchy, would be bad.  I think that the government that we are proposing here is a democratic government. The system that Deputies opposite are associating the word democracy with is not necessarily going to give you a democratic form of government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>From the position that I have occupied I have necessarily been forced to give a certain amount of thought as to what government means, and as to the ethical effects of what government is, and as to how government can be achieved, especially in a country where we had short experience of government. I have given more thought to it than I did six years ago.  I am satisfied above all things that an alien government is better than no government. A bad government is better than no government.  I suggest that any form of democracy that is imposed or is accepted in any country is imposed as a test.  And the test is: Does it unfailingly provide that there shall be a government to order the affairs of that country?  If it meets that test then it is bound to stand for a time.  If it does not it stands condemned on the face of it.  I suggest if Deputies opposite would consider the system of the Referendum they would be satisfied, after very little thought, that that system does not necessarily make for government.  They will be satisfied, I think, that it is pre-eminently a machine that could be used for the negation and for the destruction of government and as such has tremendous potentialities for bad in it. Deputies have pointed out that an absolutely irresponsible government might carry on for a long time after it had ceased to serve any useful purpose, and to prevent the possibility which, if you like, might happen once in 100 years, you are perpetuating a system the whole effect of which and almost necessarily the effect of which is a negation of government.  A negation of government is anarchy which, I admit, might be desired by a number of people in this country, because they have no experience of it possibly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is one definite ethical thing, and that is government.  I know no better way of securing that than by the ordinary system of general election. The system of the Referendum I regard as something which is definitely harmful and interferes with that system which provides for democracy. <Col N="1391" /> It puts upon democracy the necessity for thinking and it permits a coherent policy of government being carried out by the men elected by the people to do that.  The Referendum is aimed against that.  It aims at very great perfection, but in actual fact it falls into an abyss of imperfections.  I maintain, with all honesty, having given the matter possibly more thought than Deputies opposite, that the system of the Referendum has nothing essentially democratic in it.  It looks simple, of course, and would be splendid for a good many people.  The most perfect form of government would be that every man should come into the Dáil and air his own views.  That would be splendid democracy, but it would not be government.  There are many things that, superficially, look splendid and perfectly simple, but when you come to examine them closely they are not nearly so splendid or simple as they look.  The Referendum looks a splendidly democratic thing, but there is nothing necessarily democratic in it. Where it has been worked it has not necessarily led to the will of the majority prevailing as regards the government of a country.  The will of the majority may prevail on one point, but the will of the majority does not necessarily prevail as regards the whole government of the country.  That the will of the majority should prevail as to the whole system and programme of government and as to the working of government in its generalities is more important than the triumphant victory of the will of a majority of the people on any one given point.  When Deputies suggest that the taking away of the Referendum is undemocratic, they are suggesting what is the contrary to the truth.  I quite believe it is possible to have a better and a more democratic form of government than the existing Parliaments.  It is quite possible that there is a better way of forming a government and of running a country than by an ordinary general election, and of the majority so elected forming a government.  There may be better ways, but if there are, let us hope we will some time here adopt them.  I do not agree that the Referendum or the Initiative is the better way.  On the <Col N="1392" /> contrary, there are much worse ways. They stand condemned because they do not make for government at all.  They make for anarchy.  The Deputies opposite may want that.  I am not sure that they do not want it.  If they do they might as well get up and say that they want it, and not say that their hearts are burning and that tears are welling in their eyes at the mention of the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; and the will of the people.</P>

      <P>The last general election cost a lot of money.  If I had all the money that was spent on that general election, and if I wanted to use it in the most effective possible manner in order to win a general election for this side as against that side, I would ask permission to bring the Minister whom we have just heard and precisely the speech he has made on to a platform for exhibition before everybody in Ireland who was capable of thinking.  &ldquo;Allow me to assert,&rdquo; he says.  That is his argument, that is his answer&mdash;the <i>modus vivendi</i> is when you have piled so many restrictions on something that you cannot act.  That is the man who wants the country to think and to abolish Article 48 in order to teach the people to think.  He tells us that government by all the people is anarchy, but that government by the select people whom he thinks think is not anarchy.  That is what he wants. He was going to give you a coherent programme.  You heard it.  You know now what a coherent programme is. You know what sounds sound like when coming right out of a vacuum. Certainly no House, no debating society, let alone any legislative assembly, could with any respect for its reputation let loose to the world to be seen by the world as an exhibition of its capacity the incapacity of the incoherent programme to which we have just listened.  Imagine a responsible Minister who tells you that the majority of these people are capable of voting for old age pensions at 30, with £1,000 a year each.  That is a coherent programme.  That is part of the talk you get from somebody who wants to educate the people into thinking.  If the people thought and saw, something would very rapidly disappear, for <Col N="1393" /> nothing more completely descriptive of the word &ldquo;dud&rdquo; than the speech which has come from the Minister for Defence has certainly never been delivered in a third-rate debating society held in a lunatic asylum.  This is adult.&rdquo;&ldquo;It requires adult thought.&rdquo; What adult thought means I do not pretend to know.  I have seen children who thought a great deal more clearly, certainly more coherently, and who were infinitely more capable of expressing themselves than some adults who lecture this country on the necessity of being taught to think&mdash;by duds.</P>

    <P>We had a cousin-german.  What the cousin-german had to do with it I do not know, except that we are railroading through this House a Bill which will enable the cousin-german to administer officially.  What the connection is between the cousin-german and the subject before this House I do not know.  I am going through the Deputy's speech&mdash;I beg your pardon, I beg the House's pardon, I beg the pardon of the people of Ireland by having to call him Minister.  It requires apparently, according to him, more thought to buy a pig in a poke than to buy it by looking at it.  And really thoughtful people, people educated in the standards of intelligence and coherent thinking, with <i>modus vivendi</i> and a cousin-german educated in that style in which it is thought sensible for them to buy a pig in a poke.  Before these brilliant people decided to find out what fools they were when they put in things for the purpose of fooling the people under this brilliant Constitution, as it then existed, you did elect under proportional representation certain people to govern the country through this sovereign assembly of a sovereign State for five years, and you gave these people continuous control, negative and positive, over everything they did.  If they passed bad laws, you left in possession of the people the powers to prevent them from putting those bad laws into operation.  If they did not pass good laws it would be another of their follies and stupidity and inexperience which were represented by 1922, and in the ignorance and incapacity of the Irish people to govern themselves, you gave them power if <Col N="1394" /> these people were sent back here who did not pass good laws to compel them to do so.  Now, after four or five years of intensive thought and experience, so acute and broad that it possibly could not be found on any other benches but his own, and probably never outside a head as large as his own, he has discovered that is not good enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Withdrawn immediately. The next thing the Minister said was that he had to go to the perfect democracy.  He had to stand up before the country in four years' time.  Why? What is to make him?  What is the necessity?  Precisely the same machinery can be used to say that it will be fourteen years or forty years. <Col N="1395" /> There is no necessity whatever.  &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he says.  &ldquo;Allow me to assert.&rdquo;  Certainly that is all we get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole argument is assertion and assertion again, and, if you do not accept the assertion, well then you have the Division Lobby and the Closure and that settles it. That is a democratic argument. I have been looking for a definition of democracy which would fit into the coherent programme and the cousin-german.  Someone once said that the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;&mdash;and the learning, experience, and erudition of the Front Bench will check me if I am wrong&mdash;was derived from the Hindu-neolithic root &ldquo;demos&rdquo; and the Arabic word &ldquo;krazi&rdquo;&mdash;the most crazy system of government that ever was inflicted upon a race.  That definition fits in perfectly with the description of democracy as given by its inspired exponents, who have discovered after six years that they were infinitely too democratic six years ago because, they assert, it is more democratic that a House should be elected which for five years could do what it liked, good or evil, which during those five years could gerrymander the constituencies, which during those five years could abolish proportional representation, which during those five years could refuse to go back to the people until it liked, which during those five years could manipulate taxation any way it liked for the benefit of a class, and which during those five years could take all authority out of the hands of the people, even when they go to them, and make a farce of going to them by building up over the head and top of the nominal democracy an assembly which remained an outside authority and which does not care two pence halfpenny what the people require, and which under the Constitution is not required to care what the people want. That is democracy.  Buy a pig in a poke.  Send your members here.  Have no control over them.  Let them do what they like.  Of course, you have to think a lot, you have to be highly educated in a particular form of thinking, you have to use a thinker to the <i>n</i>th power, before you could possibly evolve a system of government, at any rate before you could evolve an appreciation of <Col N="1396" /> a system of government which would enable you to say that in buying a pig in a poke and electing a House over which you have no control is more democratic and gives you more control, gives the people more control, than you have within the narrow bounds and limitations of this sovereign people and this sovereign assembly: than you now have when the people have continuous control, positive and negative, over every act of the Executive and over every act of a majority in the Dáil which is not an absolutely overwhelming majority.</P>
    <P>The President&mdash;some more of the coherence&mdash;spoke of an unscrupulous Executive.  He does not like that Executive. What is he saying now in abolishing Article 47?  He thinks that we are up against the risk and danger of an unscrupulous majority of these people.  Remember, nothing else can do any harm.  First, you have to have a very considerable proportion of elected representatives here who are in favour of consulting the electors upon this point.  Secondly, you have to have a very definite number of the electorate who will go to the trouble and individual expense in order to express the desire that the wish of a large number in the Dáil shall be implemented by the people being consulted.  Then you have to go to the people, and unless you are up against an unscrupulous majority, or unless this country has reached the stage of mental degradation which is represented by it being true that the majority knowing the facts would vote for old age pensions of £1,000 at the age of thirty, no harm could be done. Yet it is necessary immediately for the public safety because we are getting rid of that clause also to get rid of this thing.  Deputy Connolly thought it was necessary for the public peace, health and safety that we should abolish this. This man will not even concede vaccination to the public health, but will tear out of the Treaty and Constitution this democratic provision without any hesitation, without any waiting, without asking the people whether they want it taken out or not, under the pretence and farce that it is immediately necessary for the public health and safety of this country.</P>

      <P>The President looks forward to the time when we, or somebody, shall have failed to deceive the people, and when that time comes he suggests that a general election will put it right.  It will not have to put it right, because we will have locked the door in advance, we will have locked the door after the horse has been stolen.  What the House wants to realise is that this Referendum is the only effective protection in the Constitution against the utterly illiberal use of a majority.  Once that goes, anything is possible, and in a House which has in its recollection the Public Safety Act, which has in its recollection a general election run as the last general election was run, it is nonsense to ask that House, and through it to ask the people not to envisage the fact that utter illiberality, utter criminal folly, may not have its seat in the Executive Council itself.  The only protection is the Referendum.  Remember, it is only a majority of three that is behind the whole of this.  People on both sides to-day are down at the county council elections, but the clear majority on this issue is there.  A change over of three men and this Government, these changes of the Constitution and this impertinence to the electorate will disappear. The members of Trinity College, the members of the National University&mdash;highly democratic institutions &mdash;three members of the Farmers' Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not suppose that there are any of them here, but three <Col N="1398" /> would change it over.  That is what you are resting on.  That is your whole majority. That is your whole sanction. That is the whole machinery which enables you to pass these Bills, and say that they are urgently necessary for the public peace and public health of this country.  Yet you throw ridicule on the idea that democratic veto or veto of an adult electorate might not be thoughtful enough, even if it was a majority, to enable the people to correct a fundamental wrong which will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will, when this is passed, be handed over to the Executive, if they dare to use it, absolute power.  Nothing can hold them.  It is under that power they are putting over this Dáil a Seanad which can hold up for twenty months anything done by the Dáil.  It is under that authority they are making George, King of England, capable of being a member of the Executive Council of this House, and it is under that power, when the restraint of the Referendum is taken from them, they can do any other Party thing, do any other sectional thing, do any other anti-national thing, do any other &ldquo;coherent&rdquo; thing, coherent with their policy of anti-nationality, coherent with their policy of sectionalism.  There is no limit.  &ldquo;Allow me to assert,&rdquo; says the apostle of thinking among the common people.  There is no protection when it is gone.  All you have got to do is to find out whether you have got your men in the House or not.  Three men more and you can do what you like.  I do not know whether you can succeed in keeping silent the Minister, who had no more sense than to make the perfectly silly speech which he did make, but within these limitations all power which is in the control of the people to-day disappears from them when Article 47 disappears from the Constitution.  That might be all right if you did believe that on the front bench, animating that majority of three, there were those inspired supermen, there were men with a full sense of responsibility and a full knowledge of what was required in the Government of Ireland and that outlook upon her future such as they ought to have, but have they?  Would you trust them? Would you yourselves individually, in relation to the affairs of your private life, employ them?  Which of them&mdash;<Col N="1399" /> these people who, when the Referendum is gone, will have the complete power to decide on the future of this House, on the fundamental law of this country&mdash; would you employ in your private business? To which one of them would you pay a salary for commercial purposes?

Of course, there is this difficulty in dealing with these points, that they have been dealt with a hundred times over, time and time again.  Speaking personally, I hate repetition.  It overwhelms me.  I hear the same stale arguments repeated day after day, week after week, year after year.  It has only just one reaction on me.  It has a certain amount of disgust and a certain amount of appreciation.  I appreciate the mentality of people who can get up and repeat the same thing, the same stale, silly arguments, knowing that most of them, because I give them credit for some intelligence, are entirely unsound and entirely false. <Col N="1401" /> Yet they can get up day after day, week after week, year after year, and repeat these arguments with a certain amount of freshness which I envy, and generally repeat them as if they believed them.  What is all the pother about?  Articles 47 and 48 are to be taken away, and the entire power of the people is to be removed with that removal.  That is the whole contention. Do people seriously call that a contribution to this debate?  There is a good lot to be said for the Referendum.

I do not regard the issue as of any importance, but I do realise that a case could be made for the Referendum as a democratic expedient, and that a case could be made for the Initiative as a democratic expedient, but there has been no attempt on the Benches opposite amongst the people who profess really to believe in the Referendum, really to understand it, really to appreciate its special uses, to make the special case that could be made for it.  You are too lazy.  Deputies will not settle down to the hard work of making up any case. Instead, they simply indulge in generalities&mdash;there must be some intelligence left, even in Deputy Flinn&mdash; which they must know are entirely foreign to the point.  Look at this! &ldquo;All power leaves the people when Article 47 is taken away.&rdquo;  That is the Deputy's statement.  I chanced to come into the House and listened to it&mdash;I could be better engaged elsewhere.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the courage to admit it; at least be logical in your policies.  There is a lot to be said for a dictatorship.  You attempted one, but you failed.  It is a position you could defend; it is at least a manly position. This attempt to bring off a dictatorship, this attempt to interfere with the will of the people, followed by an attempt to prove that you are the only champions of the will of the people in the country, is positively nauseating, is not believed by anybody, and does not carry any conviction with me.  The will of the people has been well expressed in the last six or seven years under great difficulties.  We established a state of affairs under which the will of the people must prevail in this country.  We gave them five or six chances to say what their will was.  It is not an answer for any Deputy to say: <Col N="1405" />&ldquo;You have a small majority.&rdquo;  Such a majority as we have is the sovereign will of the people for practical purposes, and there is no alternative to that state of affairs but anarchy&mdash;none. I am not going, as one citizen, to accept a dictatorship from the Deputies opposite or from a minority in the country. There is going to be only one dictatorship in this country, and that is the dictatorship of the majority&mdash;do not misunderstand me when I use the word &ldquo;dictatorship&rdquo;; do not play on the word; it has been used&mdash;and that dictatorship of the majority must prevail, and there must be no question as to whether the majority is made up of people who have a national outlook or who have not, or who have this, that, or the other.  There is only one doctrine that must apply to those people, and that is that they be Irish people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I did.  If they are bad, then it is the Irish people who are bad.  If they are virtuous, then it is the Irish people who are virtuous, and if they have vice, then it is the Irish people who have vice.  It is not for us to criticise them.  Moreover, we should not be told that there are merely different parties in this House.  They have not all been on the same ballot elected here as Deputies, but there are fundamentals upon which different parties agree and there are fundamentals upon which different parties disagree. But when any issue is put up here the majority, no matter where it comes from, must be the sovereign majority of the country.  It does not lie in the mouth of any man on the opposite benches, no matter what traditions he has or pretends to have, to criticise one single man who walks into one single lobby to vote.  All this nonsense, all this criticism on those lines has gone on for three or four years. No wonder we do not understand and are incapable of appreciating the meaning of the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; or the idea behind free constitutions.  Deputy Flinn made what he thought was quite a good recovery in attempting to put a more specific point.  He could have put a more exaggerated case.  He could have said, &ldquo;Assume you have a majority <Col N="1406" /> at the present moment you could decide to go back to the Union.&rdquo; Could you do that?  The Party majority that put that issue merely before the country and got a majority for it would be entitled to do so just as they might be entitled to join France or any other country, but it is not a sound point.  First of all, if you put such a proposal forward you would not get a majority for it.  Never in any circumstances.</P>
      <P>We all know that the Party machine is necessary.  You cannot carry on day after day the humdrum, monotonous work of politics without a Party machine.  The Party opposite is the best regimented Party in the whole House.  I shall pay it that compliment, but when it comes to a fundamental issue you must have sufficient respect for members to feel that each man will think for himself; that each man will ask himself what is his duty to his country and to his constituents, and will act on that, and if he does not we should really ask England to take us over.  But this is not a fundamental issue, as every Deputy knows.  What is the origin of this.  I feel very strongly tempted to deal with Deputy Flinn when he talks nonsense about Ministers opposite and said &ldquo;You would not employ them at £2 a week.&rdquo; That is merely an expression that I myself would use about Deputies on his side of the House.  I will not go into it now, except to say that we did quite a lot in the last five or six years, and even before the last five or six years, when there was very little sign of Deputy Flinn.  I listened to Deputy Flinn when he talked about the Minister for Defence.  There was very little sign of Deputy Flinn then.</P>

I look across at the benches opposite. There are people who pride themselves on their ancestry and their long tradition of national service.  They listen to Deputy Flinn talking about the Minister for Defence, and not a word of protest. They all know as well as I know that the Minister for Defence did good work in this country long before some of the Deputies on the opposite benches were active, when the times were more dangerous, and when it took a man of some courage and character to do it. Times are quiet now; we made them quiet.  Every one who wants a stage can come out and say what he likes.

You could say that is a perfectly reasonable contention for a member of one political Party to put forward; there is no more in it.  But supposing you do get a majority, I am absolutely satisfied.  You are then the majority party.  It means that you are then the masters of this country.  You will find nobody on your flank.  I will be a good looker-on, and I will be anxious to see whether all this talk about the great programmes&mdash;I do not want to mention them specifically&mdash;means anything.  I will be anxious to know whether, in regard to these great political and economic programmes, you will be able to carry them out; whether you really mean what you say and whether you will have the guts to carry them out.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture, who has just sat down, apparently did not advert to his continued absence from the House last week when the Second Stage of this Bill was being discussed.  He began his speech by saying that no argument had been advanced in justification of Article 47 and that the case for the Referendum had not been argued upon its merits.  I do not want to recapitulate all the arguments that were used by the Deputies on these Benches on that matter, but certainly we did show that Articles 47 and 48 had a very special place and a very special value in this Constitution.  The Minister asked in what other country had the people so much power as here.  Apparently he wants to make the case that because we have universal suffrage in this country exercised by citizens who attain their majority, that the people here have a special and unique power.  This is not the only country where such conditions prevail.  Great Britain, America and Germany have similar conditions and, so far as the fact that every man and woman in the Free State is entitled to vote is concerned, it does not at all justify the statement which the Minister made, that in no country in Europe had the people so much power as in the Saorstát.  What other justification has he for the statement?  So far as the Constitution is concerned, at the present moment the people have certain rights and liberties which are enjoyed by other <Col N="1411" /> States; but the people in this country have no more rights and no more liberties than are enjoyed, if you like, in the most democratic States in Europe or America.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked what was the justification for the Referendum.  The justification for the Referendum is this &mdash;the old principle that for every power and every authority for which you cannot provide a superior, you must at least provide an equal; that is, if you want to preserve the fundamental liberties of the citizens.  It is a fact admitted by those who are competent to analyse and judge upon these matters that representative government throughout the world has very largely broken down, in so far as, at the present moment, the principle that there was safety only in the division of political authority or power among several components of the State, has now practically broken down everywhere.  The power that the head of the State had has disappeared in so far as England is concerned and, I admit, in so far as the Free State is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do admit it, if every Article in this Constitution is honoured and given effect to; but if you are going to emasculate the Constitution as written, then it is a different matter.  We do not know what hidden power may be controlling the Executive Council.  We know very well it is not the Dáil that controls the Executive Council; we know it is not the Cumann na nGaedheal Party that controls the Executive Council. We have had several instances in the past few weeks showing that the policy pursued by the Executive Council is dictated, not in this House, but by some power outside this House, by some power that is not afraid to voice the policy which it desires the Executive Council to follow.  What we want to assure ourselves is, that upon great vital issues affecting the rights of the people and the liberties of the State, a substantial minority, a minority sufficiently large to prevent an abuse of the power already existing in the Constitution will be able to refer such matters to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> I do not wish to enter into a sidetrack and to show why if, in fact, the people have power under this Constitution, the trappings, the fictions and the symbols of monarchical institutions, as the late Vice-President and Minister for Justice described them, should disappear from this Constitution as being dishonourable symbols and trappings which we, representatives of free men, should not wear.  I will get back to the question of the Referendum.  I was saying, I think, that representative government has largely broken down, because, in fact, political power at the present moment, practically in every country in the world, is concentrated in the hands of the political Executive. The theory at one time was that the Executive was responsible to the Houses of Parliament, to the legislative assemblies which elected the Executive. But in point of fact the Executive Council controls those Houses now and we have seen measures&mdash;and those Bills which we are discussing at the present moment are examples of such measures &mdash;discussed not in this House, but discussed at a meeting of a little committee, the reports of whose proceedings have not been published.  We have seen Bills introduced here by the President and the only argument he advanced in support of them was that these Bills were giving effect to the findings of a Joint Committee consisting of six Deputies from the Dáil and six members from the Seanad who met in Committee, discussed in Committee in private certain Constitutional changes.</P>
    <P>That was an example, one example of the position of affairs to which representative government has been reduced. It is not the worst example. We know very well that the Executive does meet in secret and discusses certain matters in secret, advised, not by Deputies in this House, but by interests outside this House, and it then comes before the Dáil, puts before it a legislative policy, and demands that the Dáil should pass that programme under the penalty that, if they refuse to pass it in the form in which it is presented, the discussion is to be closured, that the health of Deputies is to be broken down in order that these Bills should secure free passage.  That is what has <Col N="1413" /> happened.  Up to the introduction of this Bill for the repeal of Article 47 the minority in this House who do represent a section of this nation&mdash;the minority on these Benches represent what will one day be the dominating factor in the councils of this nation&mdash; had some redress.  They could take the matter out of the hands of a tyrannical Executive, and it could be referred to a court of the people.  That was a great safeguard which minorities had, and it does not matter what political complexion the minority may have, that was a great safeguard which minorities have under this Constitution.  I think, speaking on the Second Reading, I said that I was perfectly certain that those who were interested in the drafting of this Constitution, particularly the two men who made themselves the principal sponsors to the Irish people for it, welcomed these Articles, and saw the advantages that would be derived from them and the safeguards they would afford to the people.  Deputy Flinn asked the Minister what the position would be as soon as these Articles disappeared. The Executive Council are proposing to repeal Article 47 of the Constitution.  It has been stressed time and again in this House that Article 17 has a special significance in the Constitution. Article 47 has an equal significance in the Constitution.  I believe it was thought one of the Articles which would remain in that Constitution for all time.  If you refer to Article 50 you will see that Article 50, which is the Article which gives power to amend and change this Constitution, has one sentence which is very significant.  It says: &ldquo;Any such amendment may be made within the said period of eight years by way of ordinary legislation and as such shall be subject to the provisions of Article 47 hereof.&rdquo;  That was to show that any Constitutional amendment under Article 50 should be referred to the people by a Referendum in order that it might have the people's express sanction.</P>
    <P>Does the President of the Executive Council propose to honour that Article of the Constitution?  The President has given notice of motion, and that notice of motion is to declare that the <Col N="1414" /> Bill to delete Article 47 is a Bill declared by both Houses to be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety.  And the grounds upon which the President asked the people to renew their confidence in him in 1927&mdash;he may have changed his tune in September, 1927&mdash; at any rate, the ground was this: he asked them to return him to power in order that he might maintain in its entirety this democratic Constitution. I remember when certain by-elections were being fought in the Irish Free State, when we on these benches founded the Fianna Fáil organisation and launched an attack upon the Oath, that the President came out with a statement that this was the most democratic Constitution in the world, and that in order to safeguard the people from the abuse of power on the part of the Executive, there were Articles 47 and 48 in the Constitution.  He referred in glowing terms to the Referendum and to the Initiative.  When we see the President now come into this House and asking the House now to delete these Articles from the Constitution, it reminds me of a few lines I once heard and which I remember:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You are old, Father William,&rdquo; the young man said,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And your hair has become very white,</P>
    <P>And yet you incessantly stand on your head,</P>
    <P>Do you think at your age it is right?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In my youth,&rdquo; Father William replied to the son,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I feared it might injure the brain.</P>
    <P>But now that I am perfectly sure I have none,</P>
    <P>Why, I do it again and again.&rdquo;</P>

As I said, the President, when I contrast his speeches in 1926 and 1927 with his attitude in the Dáil now reminds me of Father William in the poem and the whole Executive Council reminds me of the same thing.  There are some men who will go down in history, I suppose, as the fathers of the Constitution.  The President, I may remark, will never claim that title.  He reminds me rather of the step-father, or, if you like, the person who has taken Britannia for his paramour and is now engaged in strangling his luckless offspring.  This Constitution is the result of a bargain between Ireland and England.  When the Irish people tried to make use of this to advance the traditional cause of Irish liberty the President proceeds to delete from it every single Article which gives the people control over the Executive Council and that would make that Executive Council carry out the people's will.  It was urged&mdash;it was argued by Deputy Thrift that certain legislation, particularly legislation to delete Article 17 from the Constitution could not be considered in this House, because it would be ultra vires.</P>

      <P>To get back: I was talking about the importance of Article 47.  We have seen that the legislature has no control over the Executive.  The Executive becomes a mere party machine which can, and does, introduce and pass legislation which it is afraid to justify and which it cannot justify by argument.  I was going on to point cut that Article 47 had been deliberately <Col N="1416" /> introduced into the Constitution in order to provide that safeguard.  At the present moment, under Article 47, a substantial minority in this House, whose ordinary fundamental rights are infringed and violated by legislation passed in this House, can appeal to the people, and, as I think I said before, the sense and the feeling for justice and equity in the mass of the people is so great that they would prevent a flagrant injustice being done to any minority inside this State.  But if you remove this Article 47 what safeguard or what control have you over the Executive? The Executive, backed up by the majority which deletes this Article, can introduce, after it has been deleted, a Bill to prolong the life of this Dáil.  I do not think that there is any power in the Constitution which would prevent them from doing that.  I ask the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of any power which would prevent an Executive, backed up by a majority of seven in this House, from introducing such a Bill and carrying that Bill through this Dáil by exactly the self-same methods as they have used to carry these Constitutional amendments to-day?</P>

      <P>Well, I have a certain opinion of the Executive Council. I have seen their methods in this House, and certainly I do not regard it beyond the range of probability that if they thought it was necessary, in order to carry out their policy of Anglicising this country, if they thought it was necessary, in order to secure them in office and in power, they would introduce a Bill to extend the life of this Dáil.  Remember, they have done it once already; they introduced a Bill to extend its life from four years to six years, an extension of 50 per cent.  What is there to prevent them from introducing a further Bill?</P>

      <P>If the Executive Council thought that the sectional interests of its party would be served by extending the life of the Dáil for any term of years, even ten years, I believe that they would do it.  I am fully convinced, having witnessed their proceedings in this House, having seen the Minister for Finance hand in a motion to curtail discussion upon this most important Bill in Committee to four hours, having seen the President, by the abuse of his majority, compel <Col N="1418" /> the House to sit through a night discussing important Constitutional amendments, I believe that the Executive Council would be capable of doing anything in order to secure and to serve the ends of their party.  I am sure that under such an Executive Council there is not a single right of the citizens, whether it be of liberty, or honour, or of property, which is secure.  And the one safeguard that there was for such right, the one safeguard which prevented abuse by the Executive Council of its powers, was Article 47 and Article 48 of the Constitution. If these Articles are removed what redress has any minority in this House?  The law will afford them no protection.  The Executive Council, which sets such a bad example in other matters, has set an equally bad example in this.  It has created the worst of precedents.  The law will afford nobody in this country any protection, because the law is not permanent; the law only stands so long as it is not in conflict with the wishes and desires of the majority party in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen them introducing laws which have been retrospective in effect &mdash;the Public Safety Act and numerous Treason Acts, every one of them with that defect and all in that respect fundamentally bad.  What is there now left in this country which will prevent that Executive Council from introducing laws, making them retrospective and depriving certain citizens, otherwise of good fame, good standing and good reputation, of their liberty, simply because they happen to thwart or in some way to oppose the policy of the Executive Council?  The judiciary affords the citizens no protection either.  The judiciary is appointed by the Executive Council and can be removed by a vote of this House, and the majority in this House is controlled by the Executive Council.  The Minister stated that there was only one dictatorship that he was prepared to recognise, the dictatorship of the majority will of this people.  Very well.  We wish to appeal to the majority will of this people in reference to this Bill.  We wish to put this to the people and to ask the people to decide it.  Will the Minister for Agriculture accept the verdict of the people on that <Col N="1419" /> specific issue?  It can be set before them, not entangled or confused by any secondary issues.  There is no question now about the Oath; there is no question now about the Treaty; it is a question of an Article in the Constitution which secures certain rights to the people.  The Minister for Agriculture&mdash; if he will listen to me for a moment&mdash; stated that the only dictatorship which he was prepared to recognise was the majority will of the Irish people.  I ask him if he will submit that Article to the Irish people by Referendum, not as dictators, but as judges, and if he will accept the decision of the majority, or is he afraid of the decision?  Why has there been such haste to pass all this legislation through the House?  The single question of the Oath in the Constitution cannot be referred to the people.  Why is it that the single question of Article 47 in the Constitution, which gives to the people the right to exercise a veto. and which is, remember, the only veto which can be effectively exercised in regard to legislation passed in this House, is not referred to the people?  There is no other effective check.  If a check is going to be effective it must be capable of being exercised within a period of time which will prevent the ill effects of the legislation that is going through from being exercised. The veto, in order to be effective, must therefore be applied as speedily as possible if the law which is found to be unjust, or which is found to be <i>ultra vires</i>, if you like, is not to operate.</P>
    <P>There is no effective veto in the Constitution, except the power of veto in Article 47, and there is no other power, no other authority, which can rightfully exercise such a veto.  I am sure that there is no Party in this House at this stage that would permit, say, the Governor-General to exercise a veto. And yet there must be some arbiter who can say, before a law is given effect to, that the people as a whole will have an opportunity&mdash;if the disadvantages, defects or evils of that law are so manifest as to make it judicious &mdash;to see that the people as a whole should get an opportunity of exercising such a veto.  There is no other authority in this House that can give the <Col N="1420" /> people that power except Article 47. Most other States have sought it in vain&mdash;now that the powers and functions generally delegated to the heads of Government have, so to speak, atrophied.  We have it in Article 47. It has been said that it was never exercised up to this.  I think that is a sound indication and a very strong argument that this power will not be abused.</P>
    <P>A proposal to submit to a Referendum was once formulated.  It was not proceeded with, because people thought that the Referendum was an instrument that should only be invoked as a last resort.  Because people have not invoked it during the six years the Constitution has been in force, because people have not invoked that Article of the Constitution unnecessarily, that is, I think, a very strong argument why it should be allowed to remain in.  At any rate, the powers given a minority in this House, the powers, if you like, even given to the Seanad, have not been abused, and therefore it cannot be said in justification for the Bill now before us that these powers have got to be removed because they have been abused.  I think that was the main strain of the arguments advanced by the Minister for Defence.  The Minister for Defence&mdash;and this is the extraordinary thing about him&mdash;seemed to me to be incapable of understanding Article 47 of the Constitution or, at any rate, failed to understand it.  He talked about referring a single question to the people, as to whether taxation should be abolished or not.  Article 47 of the Constitution does not propose anything of that sort.  Article 47 reads: &ldquo;Any Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses may be referred to the people by Referendum.&rdquo;  Any Bill, not any single proposition that taxation should be abolished, not any single proposition that a man should have two wives, but any Bill which has been introduced into this House, which has gone through all stages, being subjected, with the kind permission of the Executive Council and the Minister for Finance, to discussion and criticism in this House, should then in its final and complete form, be referred to the people as a whole for their final decision. I think that is what we are contending <Col N="1421" /> for in regard to the Referendum, not a Referendum to refer an individual proposition which, when worked out in detail, might result very differently from the ordinary interpretation or the ordinary opinion which people at first glance might form upon it, but to submit legislation which has been thrashed out in this House in its final form to the people as the final arbiters and judges.  That is the purpose of the Referendum in this Constitution, and I think it will be conceded that it is a very good provision; that it does give to the people, at any rate, control over the Executive.  It prevents the abuse of Executive authority and gives to the minority the only safeguard and protection they have under the Constitution, and because it does accept to the fullest the principle which the Minister for Finance has so often give lip service to in this House and in the country, the majority will of the Irish people upon any domestic question, we are asking you to retain it in the Constitution and asking the House not to pass this section of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, apart from this, which is incidental to the moment, that where you have proportional representation, where you have groups coming back, each with a certain set of mandates, if it is necessary to amalgamate, or for certain groups to come into coalition to carry on Government, which I admit is so, then a Referendum is absolutely essential, because you must have machinery to test whether the people as a whole approve or, at least, do not violently disapprove of measures carried through by that coalition.  I think the President argued that where you have proportional representation a Referendum is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think he reverses the real truth, that where you have proportional representation, if you are not to carry on government by minority rule pure and simple, you must have the machinery  <Col N="1423" /> of the Referendum there at least for the purpose of two-fifths of the House, which represents a substantial body of opinion behind it.  You should then have the machinery for finding out whether their objection is a popular objection or not.  I think that is reasonable and logical, and that it is approximately scientific.  In contrast to that, you have the contention which is in its own way logical, that no matter how a minority is scrambled or wangled together it represents the sovereign people.  That is not a joke. That is a fact, and that is the fact as regards the present majority which is ruling in this country.  It is argued by the President that there would be a danger of a minority vote with the Referendum.  Suppose there was a minority vote with the Referendum. Suppose it was four-seventeenths and a minority to that extent.  The support which the Cumann na nGaedheal Party got at the last general election was 400,000 out of a total electorate of 1,700,000, so that any argument of that sort, if it holds good against the Referendum, holds equally good against the existence of the present Government. There is one remarkable anomaly in the present Bill.  In Article 14 there still remains established the principle of the Referendum, because it says that &ldquo;all citizens and so on&rdquo; shall have the right to vote for members of Dáil Eireann and take part in the Referendum and Initiative.  The words &ldquo;and Initiative&rdquo; have been deleted, but the word &ldquo;Referendum&rdquo; remains.  Later on in Section 4 of this Bill a portion of Article 50 is going to be deleted, but the words &ldquo;submitted to the Referendum&rdquo; will not be deleted.  They will be left, so that we are actually destroying the only possible form of machinery to implement the principles established in these two Articles.  We are destroying the only means of carrying out effectively the principle laid down in two other Articles of the Constitution. It is a common trick to say, &ldquo;Oh, yes; I am in favour of the principle in general,&rdquo; but the hypocrite, when it comes to its real application, takes good care that it is made impossible, and that is exemplified in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> The President referred to the one instance when Article 47 was put into force.  It was done at the instance of the Labour Party, together with the Fianna Fáil Party, but I think mainly by the Labour Party, in order to postpone the coming into force of an Act which imposed an affidavit or oath. The President argued that because that was not carried out in the full that it was a proof that this particular Article should be scrapped altogether. Obviously, it was not necessary at that time to carry that out to the full, and for this reason&mdash;that another petition had already been initiated which would have covered the whole ground.  If that particular petition had been carried out, it would not have been commonsense to carry out two petitions at the one time dealing with the one object.  The argument of the President was flippant and was really an insult to the intelligence of the House.  Any stick is good enough to beat the Fianna Fáil dog.  I have some notes here dealing with the speech of the Minister for Agriculture, but I am afraid, now that the Ceann Comhairle is back in the Chair, that I will have to confine myself to the section before us.</P>
    <P>The root of the matter is this. There are two sets of principles embodied in the Constitution, and two sets of people see that Constitution from two different angles.  There is one set of Articles which gives in this so-called Irish Constitution to British influence a very definite and established power and right.  There is a set of Articles dealing with that.  From one side of this House they are regarded as the root and vital part of the Constitution, and any attack upon them is described as wrecking the Constitution. On the other side of the House, and also on the Labour Benches, to some extent at least, there is a different view: that the root of the Constitution is in the Irish people, and that the Irish people ought to be the only people concerned in the Constitution, as occurs in any free country in the world, and that these are vital clauses.  I submit that amongst those clauses there is the principle of the Referendum, and that in the long run either one or the other set of principles will have to go, either the principles <Col N="1425" /> vesting power in the people and in the machinery of the State must go, or else the clauses dealing with the supremacy of England over Ireland must go.</P>

      <P>I desire to make a few remarks lest my silence might be taken as acquiescing in a statement which Deputy Little made at the opening of his speech.  I want to correct the statement he made.  He referred to the Government majority and to the number of its supporters in this House, He said that in order to get a majority the Government had entered into an arrangement with a member of the Farmers' Party.  I want to make the position clear in view of the fact that statements of the same kind may be made in the course of the debate by other Deputies on the benches opposite. The position is that the Government did not enter into any arrangement with a member of the Farmers' Party. Any arrangements that they entered into were with the Farmers' Party as a whole, and with the full consent and support of the Farmers' Party as a whole.</P>

      <P>The argument was put forward by Deputy Little and also by Deputy MacEntee against this Bill that the provisions for the Referendum and the Initiative in the Constitution would prevent a corrupt, unscrupulous or tyrannical Executive Council from doing certain things.  My opinion is that while constitutional checks will prevent hasty and ill-considered legislation, that legislation being passed in good faith by a particular House of the Parliament, I do not think that any checks can be devised which will frustrate the policy of an unscrupulous Executive, supported by an unscrupulous majority in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Tyrannical action would most likely be taken in the Executive sphere, and a certain course of action along executive lines would enable any checks that might be devised to be overcome or evaded.  I may be permitted to repeat what I said on a previous stage of the Bill, that ultimately there can be no protection for a minority except a sense of fair play on <Col N="1426" /> the part of the majority.  If there is a Parliamentary majority supporting the Executive in power, and if the Executive determines on a particular course of action, if that majority supporting them is unscrupulous, then nothing can be devised that would prevent them carrying out that line of action.  No constitutional check can be devised which would prevent them from carrying out their policy.  Checks were provided, such as the Second Chamber and the delaying machinery designed to prevent legislation initiated in good faith, but which may be wrong or ill-considered or panicky legislation, from being passed.  If you had an unscrupulous majority in power the Referendum would be of no advantage.  Taking a Referendum as governed by the ordinary electoral legislation, that legislation could be altered and so changed by an unscrupulous majority in the House that the Referendum would be no test. I think it was Deputy MacEntee who said that a judiciary might be overawed or over-ruled by this unscrupulous Executive with a majority.  Then without altering the electoral legislation at all it would be easy for the Executive to make the Referendum no test.  Deputy MacEntee asked if we were taking away these particular Articles what was to prevent an unscrupulous Executive from passing legislation to prolong the life of the Dáil to ten or fifteen years. I believe, but Deputy MacEntee might not regard this as any safeguard, that if such legislation were to pass, the Governor-General would be entitled on his own initiative and without the advice of the Executive Council to issue a proclamation dissolving the Dáil, so that the people might be consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there were an Executive with a majority in the House that would be prepared to go the length of prolonging the life of the House indefinitely it would be easily possible to conduct elections on such a basis that it would be unnecessary to pass any legislation prolonging the life of the House.  I think there is no use in discussing these particular Articles along the lines that they provide a safeguard against an unscrupulous Executive backed up by an unscrupulous majority in the House. If Deputies would consider how elections <Col N="1427" /> might be conducted, and how as a matter of fact they are conducted in a great many countries that are supposed to have very democratic constitutions and very democratic electoral machinery, they would see that the safeguard lies really in public opinion and some sort of moral standard being held by any majority that may be in power.  We must look at these proposals not as safeguards against the tyrannical majority, but simply as ordinary legislative checks designed to prevent hasty or wrong-headed action. I believe they are not good.  I believe that they call on the people to do things the people should not be called on to do, and that the people would, in this country at any rate, show great reluctance to do it.  We know how difficult it is to get a reasonable turnout of voters even when an election to the Dáil takes place.  For the purpose of deciding the fate of a particular law it would certainly be a matter of the utmost difficulty to get any poll that would prevent a Referendum being an utter fiasco.  You would have a very small poll and with a great number of voters not having considered the merits of the proposal before them.</P>
    <P>Unless it was something of outstanding importance you could not get the ordinary people who are preoccupied with their own affairs, and who have very little opportunity of coming together and discussing these matters on their merits to turn out and vote on the day of the poll, although by providing transport it might be possible to get a certain number.  People regard the elections as a certain burden and a burden which they would not carry in such a way as to give a satisfactory result if called on too often. In any case much legislation of the utmost importance to the people is specifically excluded from the operations of the Referendum.  At present Money Bills are excluded, and it would be possible to get the vital parts of a great deal of new legislation through in a Money Bill, supplementing it by further legislation passed separately, and which perhaps would not be a Money Bill, but which could not be very well challenged, the main principle having been passed as a Money <Col N="1428" /> Bill, if it were found necessary, because there was a great resort to the Referendum to do such a thing.  We really come down in this to the question as to whether we think that representative government can work, and whether we think that representative government with a wide franchise and a fair arrangement of constituencies is a good thing or not.  Many of us agreed to provisions of this sort when we had given very little thought to the matter; when we had very little experience of carrying on government, or even of discussing matters with the people outside, because there was great interest in the country, great enthusiasm, during the Sinn Féin movement, and some of us perhaps were inclined to think that you could have that interest maintained in ordinary hum-drum legislation.</P>
    <P>I think it is evident to everybody that you cannot get a lively interest in ordinary legislation.  The reasonable, and the best, method is to have as democratic a system of election as you can have, and to allow the freely-elected representatives of the people to come together, to hear the arguments, and to decide on behalf of the people, and then to go back and meet whatever fate befalls them at the hands of their constituents, and either have a renewal of confidence or be replaced by other people who may undo what they have done.  No machinery can be invented that can prevent mistakes. You could not even prevent a reversal of policy, prevent a law from being pealed, if it were made necessary to have a majority vote of the people for it before it was enacted, because experience of the working of that Act might show that it was wrong and would have to be reversed.  If representatives of the people do wrong and their actions have to be reversed, that is no argument against depending on the judgment of the representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>I believe if people come together in good faith, freely chosen by the people, if they look at problems put up to them, if they hear the arguments of their colleagues and opponents and come to a decision on them, you will get generally a very much closer approximation to what the people want <Col N="1429" /> than you could get by having a Referendum on which very few people would vote, and of which a great majority of those who would vote would vote without having given any serious consideration to the question involved. I believe it is no respect to the people to try to make them do work which can only be done by special machinery and which cannot be done directly.  As I said before in repect of these Articles, long before there was any question of the members of Fianna Fáil coming into the Dáil, long before there was any question of presenting a petition under one of these Articles, members of the Executive Council met together to consider what changes ought to be made in the Constitution, and they reached the view that these Articles were unsuitable, unworkable, and, so far as an attempt might be made to operate them, they would tend rather to prevent what the majority wanted being done than to help to get it done.</P>

      <P>It will not take very long to say what I have to say on this subject.  First of all, however, I would like to say a word or two in connection with what the Minister for Agriculture said.  He made it very pointed that he was making a reference to me in a statement which he made.  He made an oblique sort of reference to the fact that I was in the British Army.  I wish to tell the Minister this&mdash;he is not here at present, but he will get it in the records; I do not like to make a song about it&mdash;I never have; but from 1916, when I went to the Volunteers with my own rifle, I stuck by them until 1921, when the Minister was conspicuous by his absence.  With regard to the matter under discussion, the country has it generally, so far as I have been able to hear, that any Article of the Constitution may be changed, including Article 47, by the Executive, if it is in the interests of the Irish people, and if it is not, and if, at the dictation of some outside power, there is some Article which may not be changed according to them, it will not be changed by the Executive Council. That is the opinion of the people, so far as I have been able to gather.  Article 47 gave the people a certain power to <Col N="1430" /> do something if they wanted to do it. Although they did not happen to be a majority in the country, at least it gave them a chance of having the matter referred to the will of the people.  We have heard a lot about the will of the people for the last five years, and it has been drummed into us incessantly that the will of the people must prevail.  Why, then, should the people not get an opportunity of deciding what they would or would not like?</P>

    <P>We have a lot of pleas put forward to the effect that this Referendum, this Initiative, might be used in futile efforts to do certain things, that it might be overworked in minor details.  To my mind, all that is camouflage, because the whole thing is done with the object of obscuring the main issue, that is, there is a fear that if Article 47 were allowed to remain, and if action could be taken under it, the people might give a certain verdict which was not in conformity with the wishes of the power behind the Executive Council.  When that might be so&mdash;I do not say that it would be so&mdash;the Executive Council found the best thing that they could do was to introduce certain Bills to amend the Constitution, particularly to wipe out Article 47, although in every election the Cumann na nGaedheal party have been engaged in they have always told the people that the Constitution could not be changed by one iota. Article 47 was, to a certain extent, a safeguard to the people.  It could be used to do certain things which the people might want to do.  It is not obvious that the people would, if, say, Article 17 were put to a Referendum, agree to its abolition, but even the fear of the will of the people was sufficient to cause the Executive Council to bring forward Bills, particularly this one, with the intention of abolishing Article 47 altogether.  The Constitution, as a whole, is supposed to have been built on a certain bedrock and foundation, and, so far as I can gather from those who have spoken on the benches opposite, that bedrock and foundation seem to have been the Schedule to the Treaty, but it is questionable whether the foundation on which this Constitution was built is still in existence, and, if it is not in existence in its entirety, then the <Col N="1431" /> Constitution might be standing on something that is particularly rotten.</P>
    <P>For instance&mdash;I will not go into this, because it would not be in order&mdash;two fundamental and vital articles of the Treaty were removed, and they applied particularly to us in the North.  These were Articles 5 and 12.  Therefore the foundations upon which the Constitution was built presumably have been undermined, and the Constitution, as it stands at present, cannot have been built on a foundation which was intended to last.</P>

      <P>This Article 47 is just as important an Article in the Constitution as any other.  For instance, Article 47 must be just as important as Article 17 or any other Article of the Constitution.  If Article 17 is so important that we are threatened with immediate and terrible war if it be abolished, then I hold that Article 47, which gives a certain amount of power to the Irish people, is just as important as Article 17, and if England would go to war with us over Article 17 I do not see why we should not be entitled to say that Article 47 is as important, and to do anything about it, even to go to war if necessary.  I do not see how the Executive Council can come along here with ten Bills inside ten minutes and change the Articles of the Constitution, while if we attempt to do anything inside Article 47 of the Constitution to amend another Article we are threatened with immediate and terrible war.</P>

      <P>After the flippant jocu-the vituperation of my fellow-county-cies of the Minister for Defence and the vituperation of my fellow-countryman, the Minister for Agriculture, it was pleasing to hear some arguments put up by the Minister for Finance. The majority of the speeches on the other side were characterised by the speakers having recourse to the old debating stratagem of raising arguments that were never made by their opponents and then overthrowing them.  The President said that this <Col N="1432" /> matter and others were before the people at several general elections and that the people had given their decision on them.  His words were: &ldquo;This question and others and the general tenor of legislation, that was put before them at the last election.&rdquo;  That is precisely the point.  Very little stress was made on this matter of abolishing Articles 47 and 48 at any meetings at which I was present, and I was present at many.  Other interests cut across it&mdash; farming interests, land annuities, housing, etc.  At elections you have many interests fighting their own side&mdash; agriculture, brewers or distillers, Labour putting their point of view before the people, and a matter like the abolition of Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution, if before the people at all, receives very little attention. The President spoke of a reference made by Deputy O'Connell and Deputy de Valera to a possibly unscrupulous Executive.  It is not beyond imagination that we might have such an Executive.</P>

      <P>He said that it was strange that the Executive should be unscrupulous and the minority ought not be unscrupulous.  He forgot the fact that if the alleged unscrupulous minority, 60 members of this House, insisted on getting a Referendum to the people, they are staking their political future on that, and if it happened on two or three occasions within the life of Parliament, there would be no political future for these sixty members, I am quite certain, so that there is a great difference between an unscrupulous Executive and a possibly unscrupulous minority.  On this point, one of the methods of getting people interested in legislation or in Parliament, or in the use of or in the working of Parliament would be the Referendum.  The President said that the people or the Committee that drafted the Constitution, and the Parliament which agreed to it, had no experience.  They have had no experience of this Article, and the exercise of it has been found wanting.  Deputy O'Connell said that on the only occasion on which there was some intention of making use of it, it was not pursued <Col N="1433" /> to having the actual Referendum, because it was appreciated that it is only in very important cases such steps should be taken.  That is an argument in favour of maintaining it.  The Minister for Defence spoke of putting individual pieces of legislation before the people, spoke of it as the usual means of government.  Nobody ever dreamt of making this the usual means of government.  It would be a very serious matter, I maintain, before sixty members of this House would be satisfied to put it before the people on Referendum, or to demand that it should be put before them, and if there were sixty members of this House so opposed to any legislation brought in here as to demand that it should be so put, I should say that there would be very good cause for it.  It would be done after giving the matter thorough consideration and having it very well weighed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Defence spoke of a modus vivendi, and he went into the realms of government and the functions of government, but this is a modus negandi so far as the Constitution is concerned.  He also referred to a general election and to a coherent general programme, and said that there would be two opposite programmes before the people at a general election besides programmes of a general character, but the programme might be an agreed one, I maintain.  The three parties were agreed upon the question of the spirit duties and as to legislation in that matter at the last election. Many points in both programmes could be agreed upon, and even are agreed upon.  But, at any rate, people have many things to consider, and they do not give full consideration to every particular point.  There is need for the people to think.  We are told that there is adult suffrage and that people think at the time of elections.  But it is the same adult suffrage that will be there for a Referendum, and they are more likely to think more clearly when there is only one point to be considered. There is opportunity for the majority party to put a matter fully before them, and they are more likely in the majority of cases to have the Press at their backs also.  They can get their <Col N="1434" /> case put thoroughly before the people. Of course, it was nonsense for the Minister for Defence to talk about a Referendum on the question of having taxation abolished and providing pensions at thirty.  These are matters which are quite irrelevant to the discussion. A Referendum under Article 47 gives also, he said, a means of deluding the people.</P>
    <P>There is no opportunity for deluding the people if both sides, those for and against, have the opportunity, in the Press and on the platform, of putting the case before them and explaining all the points and all the consequences.  I am quite sure that whatever Government would be there would not let the people be deceived as to the possible consequences of their action in such an event.  The Government have a sense of responsibility we are told&mdash;they have to stand over their acts.  But the people in exercising their rights under the Referendum have a responsibility also; they have to stand over their acts. It is they pay eventually and they are the masters.  Submitting each individual item of legislation to the people &mdash;no one has suggested any such thing. Even if the Referendum were never used&mdash;it might go for 20 years and be unused&mdash;it is a very good thing to have there as a check, a very excellent thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture says that it is a matter of no importance. If not, why this rush legislation?  Why come in in the middle of the Budget and the Estimates and everything else and pile all these Amendment Bills on top of us, particularly this one?  Why not leave it over for another 12 months, if it is a matter of no importance?  I think it is a matter of grave importance. It is showing a tendency which is very dangerous.  The Minister for Agriculture was asked: &ldquo;What is to prevent the Executive from abolishing proportional representation?  Instead of answering that question, he put up another argument, that nobody in this House would stand for&mdash;union again with England.  Nobody suggested that.  No answer has been forthcoming as to whether in the same manner proportional representation <Col N="1435" /> could not be abolished by a majority vote.  The President said&mdash;I think it was at the penultimate election&mdash;when there was talk of abolishing this oath of allegiance, that not one Article, not one line, not one syllable, not one comma of that Constitution would be changed.  I believe these were his exact words.  Now we are changing whole sections of it, the sections that I maintain are democratic.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture spoke also of the liberty that the people enjoy, as in other States.  The danger I see is that we are not a normal State.  We maintain that it is not a normal State.  This country is divided into two states and we have not full freedom in either section of it&mdash;more limited in one section than the other&mdash; and that it is towards preventing the people from achieving full freedom that methods might be used, as exemplified in this present instance.  That is one of the reasons we on these benches have for strongly opposing it. The Minister for Finance said that the tyrannical action of a majority could not be countered in this way by the Referendum.  I think the tyrannical action of a majority here in legislative matters would likely raise a revolt which would secure that two-fifths vote required to get a matter referred to the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we assume an unscrupulous Executive.  I say this honestly, the Executive is unscrupulous in trying to get this legislation through and in trying to abolish Articles 47 and 48; that is an example of unscrupulous action on the part of the Executive. What is to stop the same Executive from postponing elections for a few years on the same plea that such postponement is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace?  They could change any Article of the Constitution, except, of course, Article 17 that they do not want to change, on the same plea.  They are to be the judges.  It would be better to let the people judge in these particular cases.</P>
    <P>The people, we are told, should not be called upon too often.  We do not intend to call upon them too often.  It is a safeguard that would be very rarely used, <Col N="1436" /> and that might not be used more than once in a decade.  The small poll is another objection.  If a matter was important, and unless a Bill was important, it would not be put to the Referendum.  I think you could get public opinion excited over it.  You could get a much larger poll then at a General Election, on one definite point, and you would get a very definite decision upon it.  One example upon which a Referendum might be taken would be the question of prohibition.  Suppose that question arose here, and it is not outside the bounds of possibility that it should arise, it would be a good question upon which to go to the people, holding up legislation and letting the people judge. I am not a prohibitionist, and we on these benches are not prohibitionists, but it might arise in ten or twenty years' time that you might get a Dáil that would be of prohibitionist tendencies, perhaps bitten by the microbe from the United States, and the Referendum would be a very good means of deciding upon that question.  We got one valuable lesson from the Minister for Finance.  I think he made his case well, and we got the excellent lesson from him as to how it would be possible to break or evade the Constitution.  The members of the Executive, we are told, thought this Article was unsuitable and unworkable.  This Article did not get a fair trial, and I believe its abolition now is a danger to the country.  In that I might speak personally, because I was consulted by many who had grave doubts when we came in here.  I pointed out that some things might be done under the Constitution, and this was one.  That goes now.  Other Articles will go subsequently, and what answer will I give then, when these safeguards are gone but to say, thank God; they have no respect for the Constitution, and if we get the opportunity we will have as little.</P>

      <P>I submit to you that if it is understood that the Report Stage is one for which amendments can be put in, the Report Stage must come at an interval which will enable amendments to be put in in an orderly manner, unless the Standing Orders are suspended for the purpose, and I suggest that the Standing Orders did not contemplate anything of this kind, I mean that in allowing amendments to be put in on the Report Stage they contemplated that there would be a legal interval, and that it should not be a matter of concession by the Chair. For instance, undoubtedly the Chair would have discretion under the rule to accept or refuse.  But the putting down of amendments for the Report Stage must be a right, and therefore there must be a legal interval during which a Deputy can put in his amendments in a legal manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Order is quite clear.  Standing Order 90 says: &ldquo;When the Preamble (if any) and the Title of a Bill shall have been considered in Committee, the Bill shall be reported with or without amendment to the Dáil, and an order shall then be made for its consideration on Report.&rdquo;  For the making of that order no notice is required. But the Dáil is, of course, the master in the matter, and if an order is made for taking the Report Stage to-morrow it necessarily means that any amendments will have to be accepted by the Chair, if the Chair considers them in order, without the usual notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>But in exactly the same way if the House is master of itself, that may mean the majority of the House is master of itself.  We could be told to go straight on with the Report Stage now, without any possible means of preparing amendments.  I suggest that is an evasion of the rights of the House, of which the Chair ought to be the guardian.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I draw your <Col N="1446" /> attention to Standing Order 94, which says: &ldquo;Amendments may be moved on the Fourth Stage, but no amendments previously rejected in Committee of the whole Dáil shall be in order.&rdquo;  That says quite definitely that amendments may be moved on the Fourth Stage. Now, under the Standing Order dealing with amendments, Deputies putting in an amendment to any motion or any Bill are required to give two days' notice.  If they are required to give two clear days' notice they could not possibly do it if the Report Stage is to be taken to-morrow.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance on the Finance Bill for 1925 or 1926 gave notice, I think, to suspend the Standing Orders in order to enable the Report Stage to be taken on the same day as the Committee Stage had been taken, or on the next day.</P>

      <P>There is no notice now required for stages of Bills, and it is not a matter for the Chair to decide on what day the Dáil will order a Bill to be considered.  The Chair has no power to rule the motion out of order, even if it were proposed that the Report Stage be taken to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit that though there is no direct intimation in the Standing Orders in relation to the time on which a Report Stage would be taken, that the rule must be read in relation to the fact that there is a definite Standing Order which says that a certain legal limit of time shall elapse between the putting in of amendments and its orderly discussion.  It must be a matter of right for the members of this House to put forward their amendments, and not a matter of permission, and if it is the rule that a majority of this House can go on with the stages of a Bill, without leaving that interval which is legally necessary under the Standing Orders for the putting in of amendments, then the putting in of amendments ceases to be a matter of right and becomes a matter of permission. That is a very serious dereliction from the rights of the House.  I suggest that in the light of these rights you must rule&mdash;I should not use the word &ldquo;must&rdquo;&mdash;in the sense that it is essential, obviously, that the thing <Col N="1447" /> must be governed by a purely mandatory provision in the rules.  It is a very serious thing if we are to have discretion exercised outside the obvious meaning of the rules.  Those of us who desire rigorously to remain in order will read these Standing Orders with great care, and will attempt to understand them, and we will fashion our conduct and work according to them.  A man would know that this provision was on, and, knowing the circumstances of the case, he would know that it could be passed by a majority to-day.  But he would also know that he had a legal interval in which to put in amendments. What I am suggesting is that you, sir, cannot interpret one rule of the House in a manner which will take away the rights which are specifically accorded to the ordinary members of the House under any Standing Order.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Standing Orders were amended, and that the provision which existed in the old Standing Order requiring that notice should be given for stages of Bills was deliberately deleted?  Is it not a fact further that the right of proposing amendments for the Report Stage exists for the purpose of enabling consequential amendments to be inserted in case important amendments have been passed in the Committee Stage, or to enable amendments to be inserted dealing with some points that had only come to light during the course of discussion on the Committee Stage?  But is it not a fact that amendments normally should be proposed during the Committee Stage and passed, if they are to be passed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the points which have just been made by the Minister for Finance certain considerations have just come to light.  Deputy MacEntee attempted to call the attention of the Chair to a point of order just as you were about to put the question with regard to the title.  Notice would be required to examine that matter carefully.  We would require some time to have that matter set right. As Deputy Flinn has pointed out, it is not fair that a matter like this should be in the discretion of the Chair solely. <Col N="1448" /> It ought to be a matter of right, and I think it is according to Standing Order 94.  That Standing Order clearly implies that amendments may be moved, and in another Standing Order we have it that certain notice must be given of amendments.  It is clearly implied that proper time should elapse so that notice of amendments may be given in a proper way.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever as to the meaning of the Standing Order.  Apart from the history of the Standing Order, the Standing Order itself says that on the conclusion of the Committee Stage an order shall then be made fixing a day for the Report Stage.  That order may fix the Report Stage for to-morrow.  It is not for the Chair to decide upon the merits of a motion as to whether or not the House should fix the Report Stage for to-morrow.  Usually these orders are made by agreement.  In the event of agreement not being forthcoming in this case, I am prepared to put the Question so that the House may decide it, but there is certainly no power in the Chair to refuse to receive a motion that the Report Stage be taken to-morrow on the grounds that sufficient notice had not been given or that no notice has been given.  There is no doubt at all about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Standing Order 94 must be read in conjunction with Standing Order 90 for the fixing of the Fourth Stage of Bills without notice.  I am quite clear that once a Bill comes into the possession of the House, the House can fix the dates when its various stages are to be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>We say that this has to be considered in relation to the rights which are guaranteed by the Standing Orders to the ordinary members of the <Col N="1449" /> House, that is the right to provide amendments to a Bill.  If you rule that they have the power to go right on with the Bill now, it would be utterly unreasonable to expect us to prepare amendments now.  The Standing Order says that amendments may be moved. That means that they must be capable of being moved.  We cannot put them in except by permission and in this matter we have a right, but when a right falls into a permission it ceases to be a right.  That is logical.  You may have, say in Russia or some country like that, trial by jury by permission, but it is not a right.  There is no right in anything which somebody has the discretion to refuse if he likes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made that point of order before.  I have no doubt whatever with regard to my ruling.  What I am ruling is that an order may now be made for the consideration of the Report Stage of this Bill to-morrow. There can be no doubt at all about that.  The question is then a matter for the House, and not for the Chair, to decide.  Deputies are simply urging points of order which I am quite clear have no validity as points of order. The question whether or not the Bill ought to be considered to-morrow is one for the House and not for the Chair to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we are in order in asking you to quote the Standing Order which gives you the right to allow such a motion to be made.  We are contending that the Ceann Comhairle is bound by the Standing Orders as set out in this book.  Standing Order 94 states that amendments may be moved on the Fourth Stage, while, Standing Order 25 states: All motions, to be put on the Order Paper for any day, shall be in writing, signed by a Deputy, and shall reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the fourth preceding day.  Any amendments to such motions shall be in writing, signed by a Deputy, and shall reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the second preceding day.  Provided that by permission of the Ceann Comhairle, motions may be made on shorter notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> There is one Standing Order which makes it quite clear and says that amendments may be moved on the Fourth Stage of a Bill.  There is another Standing Order which says that amendments must be put in on the second preceding day.  Seeing that these two Standing Orders are there, I submit that before the Chair can accept a motion which runs counter to them that the Chair must quote some other Article in support of its decision. The Chair and the Minister must keep within the Standing Orders as set out here unless they move to suspend them altogether.  There is only one way in which you can get the Report Stage of this Bill considered to-morrow, and that is by moving the suspension of the Standing Orders altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the points made by Deputy Aiken, I submit that Standing Orders 94, 90 and 25 must be read and construed together. I do not see how one can escape that. Obviously the purpose of the Report Stage is to give Deputies adequate time and opportunity to consider a Bill which has just emerged from Committee. I do not think that those who drafted the Standing Orders ever contemplated that we should proceed to-morrow without notice from the Committee Stage to the Report Stage of this Bill.  At the present time it is too late to comply with the requirements of Standing Order 25, and I wish to enforce that point with reference to the Report Stage of this particular Bill. As Deputy Flinn has said, we have the right to submit amendments.  I presume that that right is intended to secure to us and to provide that we can give the notice required by Standing Order 25.  The two things must be taken together.  If we have the right to put in amendments, then we must also have the opportunity of complying with the requirements of Standing Order 25.  That, I think, is the important point that we cannot lose sight of.  If we have the right under Standing Order 94 to move amendments on the Report Stage, then we must have, in the exercise of that right, the opportunity of complying with Standing Order 25 with regard to the giving of adequate notice.</P>

Standing Order 25 provides &ldquo;that all motions, to be put on the Order Paper for any day, shall be in writing, signed by a Deputy, and shall reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the fourth preceding day,&rdquo; and that notwithstanding anything contained in Standing Order 90, that Standing Order 25 applies to all orders made for the stages of a Bill.

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend at this or at any other stage to give a ruling on anything more than on the point before me.  What I am asked to hold is that Standing Order 25 applies to the Orders made for the consideration of a Bill on various stages.  If I were so to rule, the result would be that when leave had been given to introduce a Bill notice would require to be given of a motion, which motion could not be considered until four or five days later, for the taking of the Second or any other Stage of a Bill.  That motion would become an order if it were passed.  The order would fix the Second Stage for, presumably a later period still.  It amounts to this, therefore, that between the First and Second Stages, and the Second and Third, and the Fourth and Fifth Stages, there would always be four days, and probably a longer period, for while there was merely a notice of motion the House would not know on what day the Second and other Stages of the Bill would be taken.  I am asked definitely to rule to that effect, and the effect of so ruling in this particular instance would mean that the Minister would have to give notice before 11 o'clock to-morrow to allow four days for the Report Stage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must not be more insolent than he can help.  Deputy Flinn makes a persistent effort to be insolent here to the Chair, and there must be some limit to that insolence of Deputy Flinn.  He has made points of order and repeated them to-night over and over again.  He must now listen to the decisions regarding the point on which I was asked to rule.  On the point that the Orders relating to the taking of the stages, that these must be subject to the provisions of Standing Order 25, there were Standing Orders made in 1923, which included a Standing Order having reference to the taking of the Fourth Stage of a Bill.  That Standing Order has since been amended.  The Standing Order was Order No. 86.  It read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When a Bill has been returned from a Special Committee, or from the Dáil sitting in Committee, notice shall be given of a motion to receive the Bill for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The present Standing Order 90 on the same matter reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When the preamble (if any) and the title of a Bill shall have been considered in Committee, the Bill shall be reported with or without amendment to the Dáil, and an order shall then be made for its consideration on report.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meaning of that Order so amended &mdash;and when it was being amended it was discussed on this basis&mdash;is that no notice was required for fixing Stages of the Bills.  I am unable to hold, therefore, that because of the provisions of Standing Order 94 that amendments may be moved on Report Stage, that the provisions of Standing Order 25 should apply to an Order fixing the date of the Report Stage.  I hold that under the provisions of that Standing Order clearly no notice is required.  It is a matter for the House to decide whether it will or will not take this Bill to-morrow, but manifestly, as I said in reply to an inquiry at the beginning, if the Report Stage is fixed for to-morrow, <Col N="1454" /> the Chair in such circumstances would normally have to waive the question of notice with regard to amendments. That appears to be a consequence.  The notice for the Fourth Stage to-morrow is in order, and I am now accepting that motion.  The motion is that the Fourth Stage be taken to-morrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>We intend opposing that for the reasons given already, that sufficient time has not been given to prepare amendments.  The ruling that has just been given would make it discretionary for the Chair to accept amendments without notice.  Members, I think, ought not to give up their right and have it replaced by a purely discretionary power in the Ceann Comhairle. It seems to me that when it was agreed that notice should not be given for the various Stages of Bills that dispensed with notice, inasmuch as it was known to everybody that these Bills were going through and that notice was not necessary.  I hold it should have shortened only from four days to two, in other words, that proper time should be given to enable amendments to be prepared and submitted.  My interpretation of the change in the Standing Order is that it cut down the time from four days to a minimum of two days as the time to give notice of amendment. There is no use in stressing the matter further, but I intend not to allow that right to be waived.</P>

      <P>I, too, protest against the proposal of the Government to take the Report Stage to-morrow. The President has given no reason for this unseemly haste.  He has not given any reasons why the Report Stage should be taken to-morrow. As has been stated, it would not be possible to have amendments ready to be moved.  I hold that the action of the President and of the Government in fixing the Report Stage in such circumstances is an invasion of the rights of other Parties in the House.  I do not think there is any justification for it.  I will object to the Report Stage being taken to-morrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing on the motion to take the Report Stage to-morrow. I do not hold that it is necessary there should be four days' notice of a particular motion in relation to the Fourth Stage of a Bill.  I submit that the Government in fixing a date for the Report Stage ought to bear in mind Standing Order 25.</P>
      <P>Though it may not be necessary for them to give four days' notice, they ought to remember that Deputies, in the exercise of their rights to propose amendments on Report Stage, ought at the same time be given an opportunity of fulfilling Standing Order 25.  As Deputy Flinn pointed out, when a right degenerates into a permission it speedily ceases to be a right.  That is very important, and I think we ought to take it into particular consideration. I suggested to you earlier this afternoon in connection with a certain matter, with the notice of motion in the name of the President in relation to the Constitution Amendment Bill No. 10, that that notice of motion need not appear on the Order Paper to-day, and that he could come to you and ask you in the House, in exercise of your rights under Standing Order 25, to dispense with that notice of motion.  You said that that was a matter on which you would not like to be asked to rule.  I submit that the same thing applies here.  There may be very important proposals coming from this side of the House, not in relation to this Bill only but possibly in relation to other Bills, proposals which may be very controversial, and I submit it would not be fair to come to the Chair and say that he should permit these proposals to be introduced here without notice of motion required by Standing Order 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you are unwilling in one case to be placed in that position you ought to be equally unwilling in all cases, and therefore the Government should not put you in the invidious position of having to grant that permission.  They ought to arrange their legislative timetable in such a way that Deputies will be able to exercise their rights under one Standing Order and, at the same time, comply fully with the conditions <Col N="1456" /> required by another Standing Order.  I put that to the President through you, that all this pother would be saved if he simply decided that instead of taking the Report Stage to-morrow he would take it on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week, the first day on which we meet.  That would give everybody an adequate opportunity of dealing with this Bill as it emerged from Committee.  It has not been amended in Committee, but it is the only one of the series of Bills to amend the Constitution upon which there has been any sort of discussion.  There has been an interchange of arguments in Committee, and in our opinion there are certain important ways in which the Bill should be amended.  We submit, in view of that fact, that the President ought not to proceed with his expressed intention of taking the Fourth Stage of the Bill to-morrow, and that he ought to fix a date which will enable Deputies to comply with Standing Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is one which, from all I heard during the discussion on Second Reading and in Committee, does not lend itself much to amendment, less perhaps than any other Bill.  A copious number of amendments were put down, and very favourable and ample opportunity for discussing them has been afforded, and Deputies have availed of it.  In the circumstances I do not see what use there would be in affording extra time.  In any case, it is a Bill which has not been amended up to this.  In the ordinary way if a case were likely to be presented for the reception and consideration of amendments to the Bill it would be one thing, but we are really exaggerating, and we know we are exaggerating, if we make statements that the time allotted or allowed would not permit us to hand in amendments.  If I permitted time from this to Doomsday, Deputies would not hand in amendments.</P>

      <P>I wish to place my views on this matter before the House.  We have definitely a Standing Order which says that amendments may be moved on the Fourth Stage.  The Standing Orders were drafted to protect the rights of minorities in this assembly.  The majority are pretty well able to look after themselves always, but the Standing Orders were drafted with a view to so arranging business that minorities and individual Deputies in the House could put their views before the House on any questions which arose.  There was discussion on only one clause of this particular Bill on the Committee Stage. The last four clauses of the Bill were put without discussion of any description. Standing Order 94 had some meaning and, surely to goodness, we are not here to act at complete variance with that Article without amending it? If two days' notice had to be given, so that amendments may be moved for the Report Stage, surely that period at least should be allowed or this Standing Order 94 ought to be amended, so that when Deputies come into this House they will know where they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the House not to agree that the Bill do now pass.  Some of us here were accused of being inconsistent in not supporting the Bill on the Fourth Stage as we had allowed the Second Reading to go through without voting against it.  Seeing the example that has been given to us here of consistency, I do not know that much could be expected of us after watching the actions of those opposite.  At any rate, in the case of the Forestry Bill we could say that we have a certain justification for saying that we had been consistent.  We supported the principle of the Bill on the Second Stage, and stated definitely that a Forestry Bill was necessary.  We said, however, that amendments would be introduced on the Third Stage dealing with certain matters, and on that account we voted for the Second Reading.  On the Third Stage we appealed to the Minister to adopt certain of these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big question on which we wanted the Bill amended was to stop the export  <Col N="1463" /> of unmanufactured timber.  That induced us to support the Second Reading in the hope that we could do something on these lines.  On the Third and Fourth Stages we pointed out the evils of having unmanufactured timber exported without any effort being made to stop such export.  I only want to explain now that we would have continued to support the Bill right through if that principle had been embodied in it&mdash;to try and control the export of unmanufactured timber and to get the timber manufactured before it leaves the country in order to give the employment that is badly needed.  It was pointed out here before that timber which, say, is being exported at from £1 to £2 per ton would, if manufactured here, be exported at from £8 to £10 per ton, and the difference would have given employment to those who are unemployed.  A few days ago I happened to meet a carpenter in Dublin whom I had met during one of my sojourns in prison.  He told me he was not working, and I said I was very much surprised to hear that, because I believed that all the carpenters in the city were working at building, etc.  He told me that at present of the 1,700 carpenters in Dublin 500 are idle.  It is rather a scandalous thing that we should be dealing with, the question of whether a farmer who tells the Civic Guards that he is going to cut down a tree for firewood should be allowed afterwards to turn it into a cattle post, while we have unmanufactured timber leaving the country and 500 carpenters idle in the City of Dublin, as well as others all over the country.  It is because that principle was not embodied in the Bill on the Third Stage that we mean to oppose it as far as we can, because we see no necessity for the Bill as it stands at present.  It is merely another instance of giving power and control into the hands of the Minister and the Executive which they have not got so far.  From our experience here, especially during the last three or four weeks, we believe that they have sufficient power as it is&mdash;in fact, too much. If they are going to have power over the Constitution and over more serious matters, perhaps more fundamental matters, there is no reason why they <Col N="1464" /> should come down and, I might say, demean themselves so far as to regulate how an ordinary farmer is going to use an ordinary bit of a tree.</P>

      <P>With most of what Deputy Dr. Ryan has said I am in agreement.  I would be glad to see the principle of which he speaks embodied in the Bill.  If it were possible to have an amendment to that effect I would have voted for it, but as that has been ruled out we must take it as it stands.  I am prepared to vote for its Fifth Stage.  Even though it does not contain this provision which Deputy Ryan speaks of, it does help, to some extent, to a greater or a lesser degree in having afforestation expedited, and so far as it does that I am prepared to support its passage.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Ryan in what he said with reference to the export of timber.  I happen to come from a part of the country where there was a considerable trade at one time done in wood-work.  At one time in a small town in the South of Ireland over one hundred men got steady employment manufacturing articles made from native timber.  That employment now to a great extent is gone to England. We can very ill afford to lose employment in that village.  I know that in other parts of the Free State employment of the same kind was also given.  Now, if the request to prohibit the export of timber in the rough has been acceded to, it is quite possible that this employment would again be given in the different districts, and although I realise the importance of saving the few remaining forests we have, I think we could accomplish that saving of the forests while at the same time retaining this work in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree thoroughly with the argument that where timber is cut new trees should be planted, and that every effort undoubtedly should be made, and that every Irishman interested in the welfare of his country should co-operate and give every assistance possible to the Forestry Department in preserving the few remaining forests we have.  At the same time there is the danger that we may have too much bureaucracy in the country.  At the present time farmers are hampered in various ways <Col N="1465" /> by the various Departments controlling their industry.  Now, unfortunately, we are to have another department interfering with them in perhaps petty ways.  Of course, I understand that if the matter is in the hands of sensible men it might be different.  If a Civic Guard sergeant, for instance, is a sensible man he will not adhere to the strict letter of the law.  Unfortunately all men are not so, and the danger is that considerable inconvenience and trouble will be caused to men who already have quite a lot to contend with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Deputies on the opposite benches confuse the real intentions of this Bill.  As I understand the Bill, it is a Bill for the promotion of forestry and the preservation of forests when established, and it is not a Bill to deal with the manufacture of timber after the trees have been felled.  It seems to me that Deputy Ryan and other Deputies interested in the turning of timber into manufactured articles must regard that question as a fiscal matter; it must be dealt with as fiscal matter.  As one who has taken an interest in questions concerned with the agricultural community, I welcome this Bill, and I feel that although it does impose certain rather severe restrictions upon those who are producing timber, particularly the farmer, though not the farmer only, the exigencies of the circumstances in the country with regard to afforestation make it necessary that that should be done.  I feel that, with the considerate administration which we can expect, the Bill will serve a very useful purpose indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the point raised by Deputy Ryan and other Deputies, it seems to me that if the Deputies on the opposite benches are as concerned as they constantly profess to be about the interest of the farmer, the interest primarily of the producer of timber, that the acceptance of the amendment they put forward restricting the export of Irish timber would not have the effect of stimulating the production of Irish timber, but would have the opposite effect.  That is because, naturally, the restrictions on the export would <Col N="1466" /> place restrictions on the market which is available for the absorption of the timber now produced in Ireland.  It would change an open market into a close market.  It is pointed out to us that if the unmanufactured timber is handled in a particular way that its value would go up from £1 or £2 a ton to £8 or £10, but we have no indication whatever that the producer of the timber would get the higher price. In fact, the indication is that because of the restrictions in the market and the elimination of the outside demand, the prices which the primary producer would get for his timber would be lower than at present. I think if the Deputies opposite really wish to stimulate the use of Irish timber for manufacturing purposes they should approach the question in a different way and from a fiscal point of view.</P>
    <P>Those who are interested in the manufacture of timber into the finished article in this country ought to appeal to and make a case to the Tariff Commission for restriction on the import of manufactured timber, and similarly for the articles manufactured from timbers and similar restrictions on the importation of sawn timber itself for the purpose of manufacture.  I do not say that I would give my personal approval to such a proposal.  I would be inclined to say that I would not.  But if the matter is to be approached from the point of view of stimulating the production of Irish wood and thereby giving employment, it should be approached altogether in a different way than from the point of view of an Afforestation Bill.  I think Deputies who gave their approval to the Afforestation Bill on the Second Reading, and who refuse their approval now because the Bill is not to be used for the purpose of imposing fiscal restrictions on the import of timber, are certainly not acting consistently, and they are not acting in the interests of the primary producer of timber in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. CARNEY Mr. CARNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CARNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that, as far as anything in the matter of the promotion of forestry is concerned, any knowledge the Minister for Lands and Agriculture may have had he must have left outside the Bill.  He has kept all things pertaining <Col N="1467" /> to timber in his head.  In every section practically of the Bill the word &ldquo;tree&rdquo; is used.  And one would think that when the word &ldquo;tree&rdquo; is used that it is some certain, small article, like a Christmas tree.  It would certainly not create the impression that the Bill was dealing with afforestation for the country at large.  We all know that there is a necessity for afforestation. No later than the European War we had the country practically denuded of all the decent timber in it.  They took away all the best of the hardwoods in the country, seven and eleven foot logs for railway sleepers, pit props and so on.  Hundreds of men were employed throughout the country, and there was no tree of any decent size at all that was not taken away, with the consequence that there was nothing left in the woods but timber that could not possibly be used in any decent manufacturing business at all, or timber that had not matured.</P>
      <P>Talking about a tree or trees in this connection is futile, because if this Bill were intended to help on afforestation, it should have been on a scale that would definitely establish the fact that we really mean to carry out a decent scheme of afforestation throughout Ireland. Talking about a tree is quite a simple thing in this House.  But if we are going to deal with hundreds and thousands and millions of trees in the future, it is absolutely futile to talk about a tree in this Bill and have sections providing that forms be filled up with regard to every tree that is necessary for the sawyer in the country.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly obvious to anybody who knows anything at all about timber that some of these sections in the Bill are absolutely ridiculous; because if this Bill were the means of bringing about a big scheme of afforestation, all the resources of this country, the Gárda Síochána, Inspectors of Agriculture, and so on, could not possibly deal with the different items which are laid down. It would be absolutely impossible.  It would be necessary to multiply the numbers of the Gárda Síochána by two or three, because it is laid down here that each tree to be cut must be inspected by a sergeant of the Gárda Síochána.</P>

The man who is going to cut one hundred trees or one thousand trees, or all the trees in a certain area, has to hand in one application for a felling notice.

Otherwise, he does not know whether that man has cut the particular tree or not. If the man makes a statement in the felling notice which is false, and if he cuts a tree which has not been specified in the felling notice, he is liable to a fine or imprisonment.  He must necessarily specify the tree or these particular sections should not be here.  If he makes a wrong statement he is liable to a fine not exceeding £25.  Now, how can we attempt to impose a penalty <Col N="1471" /> of £25 on a man for making a wrong declaration in a felling notice if there is to be no particular type, kind, or class of tree specified in a felling notice?  For example, let us take it that a tree requires a certain number of years to come to maturity.  If a man goes out and cuts a tree which has not come to maturity, I take it that would not be in accordance with the particular thing specified here?</P>

      <P>Who is going to tell whether the man is carrying out what he stated in his felling notice?  If he does not specify a tree in the felling notice, he can cut down any tree.  He can cut down a twenty years old tree which has not come to maturity, and he can cut down a tree which has not been specified at all.  Therefore the Act is inoperative.  If the Bill is not to be operative, if there are certain things laid down which a man cannot do, if, for example, it was laid down that a man could not cut a tree twenty years old unless the sergeant of the Civic Guard should come along and see that within twenty-one days that that particular tree is not cut down, this whole Bill might as well be torn up.  If the Bill contained anything which would make it an Afforestation Bill, certainly everyone of us would be in favour of it.  I think it was Deputy Heffernan who stated that we should look at this from a fiscal point of view, that we should look at it from any point of view other than the point of view of afforestation.  I am looking at this from a financial point of view.  I know what devastation there has been in regard to timber in this country, as I saw hundreds of thousands of tons of timber taken out of the country during the war, and I know that the timber should be replaced, but if it is to be replaced, it cannot possibly be done effectively under this Bill.  If it were to be done effectively there are measures which should be taken, and there are people in this House, even people that the Minister knows well, who could have told him a great deal more about timber than is contained in this Bill. There are clauses in this Bill which make it absolutely impossible to have <Col N="1473" /> the Bill put into operation.  For example, it will be impossible for a sergeant of the Civic Guards to prosecute a man when he goes along within twenty-one days to find out whether that man is acting in accordance with the law or not.</P>
      <P>There are Deputies here&mdash;I have been talking to some of them&mdash;who know something about timber, and they know what it means to go around a place where a man is cutting timber in the winter time.  They know what it is when a pair of horses have gone along with sliding chains, sliding logs out of a wood, and they know what it is to see the ground after these horses have passed over it fifteen or twenty times a day.  The Minister may know it, but certainly if he did he has not used his knowledge to any great extent in framing this Bill.  Those men who do know something about timber know that you would need three times the number of Civic Guards that there are to go through the woods and see that everything is carried out according to the law.  Who, for example, is going to tell, if not the sergeant of the Civic Guards, whether any man who fells timber is committing an offence or not? Who, for example, if not the sergeant of the Civic Guards, is going to tell whether a sawyer is committing an offence if he receives a tree into his mill?  If he receives a tree which is outlaw, we may say that he is committing an offence according to this Bill. I will put the Minister in the position of a sawyer who is getting a thousand tons of timber into his saw mill.  We will suppose that he is taking the timber from water or from land; it does not matter much.  He gets in the timber wet and muddy.  He may cut it immediately if he can get away with it, or he may let it lie for a while to season a bit.  Who is going to tell, if not the sergeant of the Civic Guards, whether each tree that he cuts is the tree specified, and the tree that should have been cut according to law?  I ask the Minister how is the sergeant of the Civic Guards to keep law and order and do all that he is supposed to do under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister should have done if he were going to carry out a scheme of afforestation was, if he had not land <Col N="1474" /> already, to take over land that could grow timber.  As I said before, it does not take such great land to grow timber. You can grow pine on practically any hillside in this country, and pine is very valuable timber.  What he should have done was to take these places over <i>en bloc</i> and plant them with the wood that would grow on them.  Then when he had a big district, say a thousand acres in one district, planted with timber, he should appoint a forest ranger, a man who is trained in forestry.  All that man would have to do would be to go along and glance at the timber, and he would know what he was talking about. He could say that all the timber that was cut was cut according to law.  The Minister did not do that.  He wants a two-pence-half-penny scheme of afforestation, and wants the country to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in trying to carry it out.  It is impossible. Take any of the clauses in the Bill, and it will be seen that it is absolutely impossible to get any group of men to put it into operation, without big expense with very little return, and say that it is going to help afforestation.  If the Minister were to introduce a genuine Bill, one that was going to help the country, certainly we would back it up for all it is worth, because that is what we want.  We want to see this question placed in the position that we would have, as we once had in the little town that I belong to, one hundred men employed making spools.  We want to see that position restored, but we do not want to see this two-pence-half-penny scheme of afforestation, with big expenditure, and the Civic Guards running here and there trying to find out whether things are legal or not.  If the Minister would only try to bring in some decent measure he would have our full and unstinted support, but, after reading this Bill, we could not possibly see our way to support it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan tried to answer the point made by Deputy Ryan regarding the export of raw timber.  I do not think Deputy Heffernan succeeded.  He spoke about a free market.  The objection we have to the continued export of raw timber is that the supplies for the saw mills in this country would be cut off.  If there <Col N="1475" /> is to be any cessation of felling at all, there is going to be a smaller supply, and naturally the inference is that the big interests across the Channel are going to crush out the Irish saw mills. I do not see why consideration was not given to that aspect of the question.  It is a very serious aspect, as I believe that most of the hard wood is, as Deputy Carney pointed out, used for making spools for the cotton trade.  That industry is practically gone now.  Spools will still be required, and saw millers <Col N="1476" /> say that the Irish hard wood is the best wood for that purpose.  Apart from keeping the saw mills going in Ireland, there would also be a chance of employment for wood turners, which is a very simple operation.  That would give much needed employment, and would put some of the cross-Channel people under a considerable handicap. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
