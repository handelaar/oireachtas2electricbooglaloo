      <P>The Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act, 1924, provides, inter alia, for the repayment of the Internal Loan floated under the authority of the First Dáil Eireann by public subscription during the years 1919-20.  The Indemnity Act, 1924, precluded the consideration by the Committee established under that Act of claims arising from sums paid or subscribed to any national or local levy, requisition or loan.  There is accordingly no provision under which claims such as those which the Deputy apparently has in mind could be met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">

      <P>The circular referred to provides for increases of the scale payable to certain classes of temporary employees to 27s.-1s.-31s. and 25s.-1s.-29s. per week, plus bonus. Customs watchers are at present entitled to the scale 28s.-1s.-33s. per week, plus bonus, and the question of the application of the terms of the circular to watchers does not, therefore, arise. The increased scale of 27s.-1s.-31s. applies to temporary messengers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN (for Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that ten men who have been continuously employed for three years as Customs watchers by the Revenue Commissioners have not been established, although they have passed a qualifying test for permanent appointment; whether it is contrary to the regulations governing such employment to retain unestablished men in continuous employment for more than twenty-one consecutive days; and whether he will take the necessary steps to have these men permanently appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The question refers presumably to certain extra men who have been employed continuously at the port of Dublin for some time past.  In only four cases have the men been in employment for three years, and it is not correct that they have passed a qualifying test for permanent employment.  Extra men are casual employees who perform duties analogous to those of watchers, a quasi-permanent class.  A limit of twenty-five days was prescribed as the normal period for the continuous employment of any man as an extra man, but the Revenue Commissioners have exercised their discretion in favour of these men by allowing them to be retained continuously in employment for a prolonged period.</P>

      <P>The conditions of employment of Customs watchers have been under consideration since the date of last year's debate on the Estimate for the Revenue Department.

      <P>The summer holidays in the bulk of the National Schools in Dublin are taken about the same time.

      <P>I am aware that there is some such inconvenience. In fact, the Deputy himself brought one case under my notice, but, unfortunately, I am not aware of the extent of that inconvenience.  It is really a question of degree, namely, whether more inconvenience would be caused by my sending a circular of this kind than is actually caused at present.  If the Deputy can give me any information as to the extent of the inconvenience, I should be quite happy to consider the question of communicating with the managers on the matter.  The Deputy will remember that it was really one case that he himself brought before me. That may be a typical case, but I would like to know how far it is typical.

Donovan, under Section 36 of the Land Act, 1923, and allotted them in the exercise of the discretion vested in them as follows: 78a. 2r. 20p. to Michael Donovan, who was evicted in 1886 from a holding on this estate, and who had no other lands: 38 acres to Daniel Hayes, the representative of a tenant evicted in 1886 from another portion of the estate; and 9a. 2r. 20p. as an enlargement to a holding of an adjoining tenant.  The applications for reinstatement of the six persons referred to in the question have been considered by the Commissioners.  Their predecessors appear to have been evicted from holdings on the island between 1852 and 1864.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, this man's claim as an evicted tenant was lodged as early as 1907, and we have evidence in the Land Commission to show clearly and definitely that this man's predecessor was evicted from this land somewhere about 1886.  By a curious coincidence there was no application received from the parties in whom the Deputy is interested until the scheme for the distribution of the land was practically ready to be put into execution.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;The language of Article 1, as to the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy, renders it desirable that I should remind Your Excellency that there are certain regions of the world the welfare and integrity of which constitute a special and vital interest for our peace and safety.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;His Majesty's Government have been at pains to make it clear in the past that interference with these regions cannot be suffered. Their protection against attack is to the British Empire a measure of self-defence.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;It must be clearly understood that His Majesty's Government in Great Britain accept the new Treaty upon the distinct understanding that it does not prejudice <Col N="1800" /> their freedom of action in this respect.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading.  This is a Bill to amend the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, in some details which are of a somewhat technical character, since they deal principally with matters affecting procedure. It also makes provision for the establishment of two additional Circuit Court Judges and for the appointment of four Assistant District Court Justices to take the place of those who are now doing the work temporarily during the illness or absence on leave or holidays of the regular District Justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will briefly go through the Bill, section by section, and explain, as concisely as I am able, the difficulties which this Bill is meant to meet.  Section 1 is purely interpretative and nothing arises upon it.  Section 2 is a section which enables the business, when the Chief Justice is either unable through illness or through absence from the Saorstát to transact it, to be transacted by the President of the High Court or, in the event of the President being prevented by illness or absence, then by the senior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court and if neither is <Col N="1801" /> available by the junior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court.  The necessity for that section arises owing to the fact that a Chief Justice has certain powers such as those in lunacy or infancy matters in which he has sole control. In the original Act no power was given to anybody except the Chief Justice to decide these matters and make rulings thereon.  It is impossible, without hindering the carrying out of these various matters, that a Chief Justice should leave the country or get any holiday at all.  I might mention that the Chief Justice has not, I think since 1924, taken any holidays.  This enables the authorities to be delegated and exercised by the other persons I have mentioned. Section 3 is this.  In the Lunacy Regulation Act of 1871 certain powers in making rules are transferred to the Lord Chancellor.  This simply gives the powers of making rules of that nature, powers which were formerly exercised by the Lord Chancellor to the Chief Justice.  Section 4 enables the Chief Justice, instead of describing people who are in the custody of his court as lunatics or as persons of unsound mind, to style them &ldquo;Wards of Court.&rdquo;  I might say before leaving that there has been a slight transposition of words in Section 2 where there is a typographical error.  In Section 2 of the Bill as it stands it reads &ldquo;in the event of the said President being prevented through illness or absence from Saorstát Eireann from exercising the said jurisdictions and performing the said authorities and functions.&rdquo;  It should be &ldquo;exercising the said jurisdictions and authorities and performing the said functions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the Court of Criminal Appeal in respect of three matters.  The first is that the Court may, notwithstanding that they are of opinion that a point raised in an appeal might be decided in favour of the applicant, dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.  If I might give an illustration to the House it might happen that a Judge at a trial might allow in some evidence against the prisoner which was not according to the technical rules of evidence, strictly admissible, but if that evidence was of a very trifling nature and there <Col N="1802" /> would be plenty of evidence upon which the prisoner should be convicted apart from that, it would be quite wrong that a ruling of that nature on an unimportant matter should affect the administration of justice so that an obviously guilty man should escape the punishment which he deserves for his offence.  Of course in that section it is perfectly clear that the court must be satisfied that there could not be any miscarriage of justice when they put the section into operation.</P>
    <P>The meaning of (b) is this: It sometimes happens that a prisoner might be found guilty on various counts.  He is found guilty on one count by a jury and the court is of opinion that there is not sufficient evidence to justify a verdict of guilty on that particular count, but that there was abundant evidence to find the prisoner guilty on another count.  This section, then, enables the court to discharge the finding of the jury upon the count upon which they found him guilty and to enter a verdict of guilty and sentence him on the charge which there is evidence to support.  I might take an example such as this: A man is charged with larceny and with receiving goods knowing them to have been stolen. Suppose the jury finds him guilty of larceny and the court comes to the conclusion that it was not clear that the man had actually stolen the particular goods, but that it was perfectly clear he had received them, knowing them to have been stolen, under this section it would be open to the court to discharge the finding of larceny and to enter a verdict of guilty of the lesser offence, that is, of receiving the goods knowing them to have been stolen.  I would suggest to the House that that is a very right and proper power for the Court of Criminal Appeal to have. Sub-section (c) enables the Court of Criminal Appeal to order a new trial. If I might take the illustration which I gave a few moments ago, in dealing with sub-section (a), suppose some evidence has been wrongly admitted and the court cannot make up its mind as to whether the jury would have found the prisoner guilty or not guilty, if this evidence had been excluded, then the Court will order a new trial <Col N="1803" /> and the matter will go before a fresh jury without this illegally admitted evidence coming before it.  The House will understand, of course, that these illustrations are not very exhaustive.</P>
    <P>Section 6 simply says that in the case of a sentence of death or corporal punishment the sentence shall not in any case be executed until the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal has been made known.  That is common sense, and, of course, has been acted on without any section of this kind.  Section 7 says that interlocutory applications to the Court of Criminal Appeal may be made to one judge and not necessarily to the whole court. The court consists of three members, and questions of giving leave to appeal or of finally deciding the appeal will still be heard by the whole court.  Applications such as to get the notes free of charge, to have the prisoner present in court or something of that kind are interlocutory applications, and not final applications.  These will be heard by one judge instead of by three.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with a matter coming up under the Courts of Justice Act. Rules were made for the High Court, and two interpretations of these rules might have been taken&mdash;one giving a considerable amount of power to the Master and the other a lesser amount of power.  The Master and various members of the legal profession thought that the Master had wider powers.  However, after he had exercised the wider powers, after some short period of time, the extent of his jurisdiction was raised by the court, and it was discovered that he had made certain orders&mdash;plain, ordinary, straightforward, matter-of-fact things, always undefended cases, which were really beyond his jurisdiction. This section simply puts matters right.  The orders were the same as would have been made by the judge. There was always an appeal from the Master to the judge, but these were cases in which no appeal was taken.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the appointments of two additional Circuit Court judges.  The necessity for this arises owing to the fact that in certain circuits judges have not been able to keep up with the work which has fallen considerably <Col N="1804" /> into arrears.  Under the original Act power was given to appoint two temporary circuit judges. The period during which the temporary circuit judges could act has now elapsed.  We come now before the House asking that two permanent circuit judges shall be appointed in addition to the existing one.  One of the principal areas in which arrears of work have arisen is the city of Dublin. The arrears there are very urgent at present.  There are considerable complaints, justly founded, by litigants that they cannot get their cases heard. These cases cannot be heard until we increase the number of judges.  In the northern and midland circuits there are also considerable arrears of work, and there is naturally discontent amongst practitioners, and especially amongst the litigants, in these courts. These judges will not be attached to any particular circuit.  They will be available to go round from circuit to circuit.  It is a matter to which I gave very careful consideration&mdash;there is a good deal to be said on both sides&mdash;as to whether it would be better to carve out new districts and appoint judges to them or whether it would be better to adopt this procedure by which these additional judges might take up work in different districts.  After very careful consideration and weighing the pros and cons as well as I could, I came to the conclusion that it would be better not now to carve out new districts, but to work the existing districts with this additional aid.</P>
    <P>The reasons which operated upon my mind were probably this: At one time, in one area, there might be a great glut of work, and an assistant judge might be wanted there.  At another time, in that particular area, there might be very little litigation, and possibly the spirit of litigation might have descended upon some other part of the country.  For instance, let me say, at one time the courts in the western area might be very full of litigation, at another time they might be empty, and the northern courts might be full at one time and empty at another.  The two periods might not coincide.  As well as that, the amount of business transacted will be, to a certain <Col N="1805" /> extent, dependent upon the personality of the particular judge who is hearing the case.  Some judges hear cases more quickly than others.  It does not always follow that the quickest judge is the best judge, but, in fact, some judges are quicker than others. That, too, might lead to there being a varying requirement of judges in different districts.  If it turns out that the original eight Circuit Judges are able to do the entire work without these two additional ones, it is not obligatory under the Bill that these two additional ones should be appointed. In fact, they are badly required at the moment, but possibly it might happen that they would not be required in the future, that eight would be sufficient. If that be the case, when one of the existing Circuit Judges retires the vacancy need not be filled up.  I want to make it clear that power is given, but it is not obligatory that the entire number of judges should always be filled.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a very simple section. It states that whenever a Circuit Judge is personally interested in a matter which comes before his court, or knows parties well, another Circuit Judge may be assigned to hear that particular case.  Section 11 deals with the question of Circuit Court appeals.  It has become necessary owing to the fact that the original Act stated that an appeal should be grounded upon shorthand notes.  Section 11 states that it shall be grounded on the evidence.  Sub-section (3) gives certain power to the court in case an official stenographer's note is lost.  At the present moment, if an official stenographer's note is lost, accidentally destroyed, or if anything of that kind happens, no appeal can be taken.  That, I may say, did happen in one case.  This section simply makes provision where a stenographer's note is not available, where it has been lost or destroyed, that the court shall have power to hear the matter.  That is all this section does:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The court may either determine an appeal by re-hearing the case, either on oral evidence or by affidavit or partly on oral evidence and partly by affidavit, or may order a new trial of the case to be had.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> Sub-section (2) is, except for (b), merely the old section&mdash;Section 62 of the Principal Act&mdash;repeated.  That is, power is given to re-hear the evidence of any witness whose evidence was contained in such report.  It is very doubtful if a witness, having been examined once in court, could have been, as the law stood, examined again by the Court of Appeal.  This section gives that power.  Only additional evidence could have been given.  It would be very doubtful if further questions could be put to a witness who had already been examined.  B makes it perfectly clear that they can.  It may seem to Deputies that some of these are very small alterations, but they are things which have actually occurred in practice.</P>
    <P>Section 12 enables four additional Justices of the District Court, to be termed Assistant Justices, to be appointed. Under the Court of Justice Act there are a certain number of Assistant Justices, with certain areas assigned to them.  When they are sick or when they go on vacation gentlemen are appointed temporarily to take their place, either barristers or solicitors.  It is probably not a very good arrangement. It is not always very easy to get at very short notice a competent practitioner who will take up these appointments. It is better that men who can be appointed permanently should be appointed because, naturally a person who is doing business at a profession would take a permanent appointment more readily than he would take a temporary one which would interfere with the ordinary work of his profession. Also the District Justices would become specialists in that particular kind of work.  There are a great number of people, both solicitors and barristers, who would know very little about this class of work.  A man might be a very admirable barrister in a great number of ways and yet not know a single line of the Licensing Acts.  Quite possibly a chancery lawyer would not know anything about the licensing laws or those sort of things which District Justices have to be very familiar with indeed. The salary of these Assistant Justices is to be £800 a year.  They are eligible to become on promotion full District Justices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> Section 13, in the case of District Justices, does exactly the same as Section 10 in the case of a Circuit Judge.  When there is a matter in which a District Justice is personally interested another District Justice can be called in to hear the case.  Under sub-section (2), in the case of illness or absence of a Justice of the District Court, a neighbouring District Justice may be assigned to do his work.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is necessary owing to a very ingenious and successful argument which was put up some time ago before one of the District Justices.  It succeeded in ousting a very considerable number of houses from the jurisdiction of the District Court.  It was this: £26 is the limit of the jurisdiction at the present moment of the District Justice. It was discovered that a house let at 10/- a week&mdash;and of course there are a very considerable number of houses let at 10/- a week&mdash;exceeded £26 a year. There being 365 days in the year the rent became about £26 1s. 5d.  This section raises the figure from £26 to £27 and it gives jurisdiction under the section to District Justices in cases where the rent was 10/- a week.  Ten shillings is rather a common figure.</P>
    <P>Section 15 gives to the District Court the powers which the Civil Bill Courts exercise under Section 82 of the Civil Bills (Ireland) Act, 1851.  That is in the case of permissive occupants. Under Deasy's Act, ejectment only lies in the case of a certain class of permissive occupants&mdash;herdsmen, caretakers or servants.  The ordinary permissive occupants, or tenants solely at will, were dealt with by the Civil Bill Act, 1851.  This section enlarges the powers of the District Justice in hearing permissive-occupancy cases.</P>
    <P>Section 16 alters the appeal from the District Court very materially. There were various appeals from the magistrates sitting at Petty Sessions under various Acts, the principal one of which was the Petty Sessions Act. There were limits where an appeal lay. By the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914, these limits were taken away, and an appeal lay in every case. The Petty Sessions Act procedure was restored by the Courts of Justice Act, but I do not think that was a wise <Col N="1808" /> step.  I would ask the House to hold that that was not a wise step, and that the giving of an appeal to a convicted person in every case is right.  It is rather unfair, I should say, that somebody is sentenced to a fortnight in prison and that he cannot appeal unless he goes to the magistrate and adopts a rather foolish sort of fictitious procedure&mdash;that is to say, gets the sentence of a fortnight increased to a month.  Under this section, an appeal will lie from a day's imprisonment. At the present moment, in order to appeal from a fine, the fine must exceed £1.  It is quite possible that a man's reputation and character would be very seriously injured by a fine of even 1/- or 2/-.  Somebody's reputation might be very much injured by a fine of 1/- for being drunk and disorderly on the public street.  I would submit to the House that it is right in a case like that that there should be an appeal from the decision of the magistrate. Therefore, we purpose giving, as was the law prior to the Courts of Justice Act, a right of appeal in every case.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 16 restores &mdash;or probably restores&mdash;the old procedure on appeal in the old class of cases in which an appeal lay.  It is doubtful &mdash;I cannot say it is clear whether or not, under the Courts of Justice Act, appeals which are given by special Acts survive.  The complainants in fishery cases, excise cases and illicit distillation cases can appeal from&mdash;from their point of view&mdash;an unsatisfactory decision of the District Justice. Whether the special sections of these Acts to which I have referred, which confer these special appeals, have or have not been swept away by the Courts of Justice Act, is not quite clear.  One Circuit Judge has held that, in fact, they were.  This section makes it clear that these rights of appeal still lie.</P>
    <P>Under Section 17 the word &ldquo;indictable&rdquo; is taken out of Section 88 of the Principal Act.  The reason of that is that under Section 88 of the Principal Act a Peace Commissioner has power to remand on bail a person who is charged with an indictable offence. He has no such power with reference to a person who is charged with a non-indictable <Col N="1809" /> offence.  In the latter case, he can only remand in custody.  An indictable offence is one which would be tried at the Central Criminal Court or at the Circuit Court.  A case which is tried before a District Justice is not an indictable offence, with the result that a man might now be charged with manslaughter and a Peace Commissioner would be able to admit him to bail, whereas if he were charged with some offence against the road laws, or anything of that kind, the Peace Commissioner would simply have to remand him in custody.  This enables the Peace Commissioner to grant bail in every case.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with a matter of High Court procedure.  A certain class of case, according to the present procedure, is tried without a jury unless the judge shall consider a jury to be necessary or desirable.  The present practice is that application is made at the trial to the judge for a jury and he grants it, or does not grant it, according as he thinks right.  If he grants it, it means that a jury has to be summoned. There is great delay, and witnesses are kept in court until the jury has been summoned.  This section enables the application to be made to the court before the trial and before the date fixed for the trial.  The court will decide as to whether a jury should be allowed or should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>Section 19 puts the District Court in Dublin on the same footing as the District Courts in the rest of Ireland. Dublin, at one time, was under a completely different system from the rest of Ireland.  It is now being brought into line with the rest of the Free State, and, accordingly, limitations which do not exist in the country are by this section done away with in regard to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Section 20 merely mentions the name by which the Act can be cited.  These are the entire provisions of this Bill. I am afraid that in explaining them I must have appeared rather dull to the House; but many things which are in this Bill are rather of a dull nature. I commend the Bill for Second Reading to the consideration of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: That the Bill be read a second time.</P>
    <Col N="1810" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was not a member of the Dáil when the Courts of Justice Act of 1924 was passed; but he was at that time a practising barrister and had considerable knowledge of how that Act would be likely to turn out in its working.  We have him now coming forward three and a half years after the passage of the Courts of Justice Act proposing a Bill to amend that Act.  I am sure no one realises the necessity for the amendment of the Principal Act more than the Minister, but I fear that the Bill as it at present stands will not meet the requirements of the case.  As the Minister will recollect, and as the House will recollect, the original Act was passed largely, not altogether, but largely, upon the report of a judicial committee consisting of lawyers belonging to the two branches of the legal profession.  I doubt very much if many of the signatories of that report would sign a similar report to-morrow from their experience of the working of the Act.  I would like, for the sake of information, to know upon what basis the Minister now brings in this Bill.  Has he set up a similar committee, or has he consulted either the Bar Council or the Incorporated Law Society?  Judging by the omissions in the Bill, I would be inclined to think not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill purports to amend the Act of 1924, and it goes, in some respects, very far indeed, too far, in my opinion, and in other respects not far enough. Take the section dealing with the administration of criminal law.  I refer to Section 5.  Section 5 is a tremendously drastic section.  It may be founded, to a certain extent, if not altogether upon the existing British criminal law, but at the same time it requires very careful consideration indeed before it should be passed by this House.  In effect it takes away a great deal of what remains or what is left to the accused man of his rights and liberties within the Constitution.  In sub-section (a) of Section 5 the Court of Appeal, even though they find some technical errors in the verdict of the court below or in the means of arriving at that verdict, is to be allowed, if they consider that in substance the prisoner is guilty, to return that verdict.  I <Col N="1811" /> think that requires very grave consideration indeed from Deputies in this House.  A man is put upon his trial, and he is an innocent man until he is proved to be guilty, and if there is any fault in the exercising or the functioning of the State either by a judge or by those prosecuting in the name of the State, or in the manner in which the trial has been conducted, even by the jury itself, that man, according to all recognised standards of justice, should be allowed to go free.  Take sub-section (b).  That goes even further. Under sub-section (b) the Court of Appeal is to be allowed in effect to change the charge against the man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if not to change the charge, to find him guilty upon a different charge.  That may be found not to be exactly the same thing, but as far as the man is concerned it amounts to this, that he may have been returned as innocent; he may have been entitled to a verdict of not guilty because the case has not been proved against him&mdash;on a certain charge&mdash;and the Court of Appeal may say: &ldquo;No, you have not been found guilty of that, but we will find you guilty of this.&rdquo; That is a matter that requires exceedingly careful consideration by this House.  When the Minister was explaining that sub-section he said, I think, that the man might be obviously guilty.  Perhaps I am wrong.  That is in regard to the next sub-section.  I think it was in regard to sub-section (a) where he said that that man might be obviously guilty and that the ruling that they made might be only on an unimportant matter.  But who are to be the judges as to whether the matter is unimportant or whether the man is obviously guilty?  In that matter, where once a trial has taken place and once a man by any means was not found to have been properly convicted, then, in my view, that man should be returned as not guilty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but might I remind him that there is no appeal except in a case where a man <Col N="1812" /> has been already found guilty by a jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite accept what the Minister says.  Of course I agree with him in that.  What I am trying to get at is this: that where a man has been found guilty of a certain charge and appeals, and the Court of Appeal find that they are bound to upset the verdict of guilty on that charge, then according to this proposal the Court of Appeal can turn round and say&mdash;and they are not a jury&mdash;&ldquo;we found that he was not guilty of the charge on which he was found guilty, but we also find that he is guilty of some other charge.&rdquo;  I say that is an exceedingly drastic proposal to make and it requires consideration.  I come now to sub-section (c).  There is the case where they shall have jurisdiction to make an order for a new trial, a re-trial. To that I certainly cannot subscribe. That is a section to which I cannot subscribe even, as I say, though this may be the law in other lands. When a man has been charged and found guilty, it is true in the first instance by a jury, but subsequently found not guilty owing to the interpretation of the Court of Appeal, then he has been found not guilty.  Once a man is found not guilty, it should not rest at any rate with the Court of Appeal to direct a new trial.  If a new trial is to take place it should be by direction of the authorities who instituted the original proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to certain other sections. Take Section 8.  With the provisions of Section 8 I have no quarrel. But Section 8 merely touches on the fringe of the question which has been exercising the minds of both the courts and the members of the legal profession for a considerable time.  That is the position of the Master, and I do suggest to the Minister that the whole question of the Master's jurisdiction should be seriously gone into because it is a matter that is seriously affecting the practice and procedure of the Courts. At the present time the conditions are such that very few practising members of the Bar can tell you what the Master's position is; I doubt very much even if the Master himself knows. <Col N="1813" /> There is subject-matter contained in the section which should have been the subject-matter of a very careful and complete inquiry before a Bill like this was introduced.</P>

      <P>As far as the additional judges are concerned, I will spare the Minister any pains.  He was not here during the discussion on the Courts of Justice Act, but if anyone cares to peruse the volume containing those discussions he will see that over and over again I suggested, among other things, that if they were going to have this new system&mdash;if they were determined to do away with the existing system and were determined to change for the sake of change, which they seemed determined to do&mdash;they must have more than eight Circuit Judges.  I dwelt at length upon the position in the city of Dublin.  I showed how the ex-Recorder in the city of Dublin did more than one man's work, and, with increased jurisdiction, a man would require to be a superman to do the work that the new Circuit Judge of the city of Dublin would be asked to do under this Act. Now we have, of course, this acknowledged by the proposal to create two new Circuit Judges.  It is time they were created.  I protested every time that it was proposed to appoint temporary judges to assist the Circuit Judges; I protested against the principle of temporary judges, and I appealed to the Government to appoint extra permanent ones.  Now they are about to appoint two permanent judges.  The Minister rather naïvely suggests that it might not be necessary to keep on filling the vacancies that may occur for these two extra Circuit Judges.  I can tell him now, as I told the House four years ago, that even with their ten Circuit Judges they will hardly have sufficient to meet, not only the work, but the nature of the work which they themselves have created by the Courts of Justice Act of 1924.  This Act of 1924 was going to revolutionise legal proceedings in this country; it was going to cheapen proceedings for the litigants <Col N="1814" /> and was going to make law almost a cheap pastime for the people. Everyone knows that the contrary has been the case, and everyone knows that the methods of Circuit Court appeals have not cheapened litigation, but have added considerably to the expense.  Now we have these two judges proposed.  I do not intend to oppose that section.</P>

      <P>Section 11 purports to deal with Circuit Court appeals. This was the whole kernel and crux in the discussions on the Act of 1924&mdash;the complete change that was made in the nature of appeals from what were then the County and are now the Circuit Courts.  There was a system in vogue, faulty, it is true, in many respects, but one which on the whole worked and could be worked satisfactorily; it was a system of appeals which, in effect, amounted to something in the nature of a re-hearing. That system was scrapped in face of forebodings and in face of the more or less general view expressed by both branches of the legal profession. What has been the result?  The result has been that the Minister has to come along now and has to tinker with this new system as he does in Section 11.  Why can he not scrap it altogether? What is the use of tinkering with it?  The Minister starts off by saying that the Courts of Justice Act is the Principal Act.  The appeals were grounded on notes.  Now, according to this section, they are to be grounded on evidence.  I would like the Minister to explain the position a little further. I cannot altogether follow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will allow me.  I tried to be clear, but this section deals only with and has no operation except in cases where the stenographer's notes have been lost.  The change of the word &ldquo;notes&rdquo; to &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; is necessary in order to effectuate that intention.  It is only when the stenographer's notes are lost or destroyed through no fault of the parties that this section becomes operative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that that is not under consideration in this Bill.  That is exactly my complaint&mdash;that it is not under consideration in this Bill.  I say it is absolutely tinkering with the question for the Minister to propose a serious amendment to the Courts of Justice Act and not have anything whatever to say to the working of the existing system of Circuit Court appeals. Let the Minister go to the Library and ask any of his fellow practising barristers, and let anyone who has anything to do with the Circuit Courts say that the Circuit Court appeals under the present system is working well and is suitable to the country.  He says the section only deals with cases with regard to which the stenographer's notes have been lost.  I think the pity of it is that the stenographer's notes are not lost in all cases, because the whole system is so ridiculous.  You have a case tried in the first instance at the Circuit Court, and then, for months upon months, you have an appeal waiting to be heard&mdash;I believe appeals have again accumulated since the Commissioners finished their previous work&mdash;and when the appeal does come on it is taken on the notes of the stenographer.  It really, in many cases, amounts to nothing short of a farce, so much so that appeals which <Col N="1816" /> would be taken in the ordinary course are not being taken, but, on the other hand, more appeals are being lodged, and in that way justice is being frustrated, because the time has been so great during which these appeals have been delayed.</P>
      <P>The Minister said nothing about the creation of extra High Court Judges. At the time of the passage of the Courts of Justice Act I suggested that if the Government were bent on having this new system they would have to have more High Court Judges than they proposed. What is the state of affairs to-day? With the Central Criminal Court fully occupied as, unfortunately, it is, and one judge being away from the High Court for that purpose, with the enormous number of these appeals that have accumulated from the Circuit Courts, and with the necessity for High Court Judges to hear these appeals, I say deliberately that there are not sufficient High Court Judges available for ordinary High Court work.  I do not know whether the Minister has investigated that matter or not.</P>
      <P>Now we come to certain other sections. With most of them I am in agreement, especially Section 16.  That is an admirable proposal and an amendment that was particularly required. I only wish that the principle underlying that section had been applied to Section 5.  It seems to me to be diametrically the opposite.  Under Section 16 a man found guilty is to get every possible advantage by way of appeal.  Under Section 5 a man found guilty is to have a great many of the advantages that he now enjoys, when a Court of Appeal has decided in his favour, taken away from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I object to mostly in this Bill is that it has not gone to the roots of the working of the Courts of Justice Act.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has considered the working of the whole Act in itself, or whether he has only just gathered together a few matters which have been brought to his notice and strung them together in the Bill, which he seriously calls a Bill to amend the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  I say to the Minister that no one will be satisfied&mdash;litigant or lawyer&mdash;until something is done to <Col N="1817" /> amend or improve the working of the Courts of Justice Act, especially in regard to Circuit Court appeals.  He knows that as well as I do.  That being so, it is disingenuous, to say the least of it, for him to produce a Bill like this and style it seriously as an amendment to the Courts of Justice Act.</P>

      <P>We purpose opposing this Bill.  Other Deputies of my Party will speak later, but as a layman I want to say that I cannot imagine anybody bringing forward a Bill pretending to be a Justice Bill with Section 5 in it.  Deputy Redmond has already pointed out the dangers of that section.  The first sub-section (a) says:</P>
      <P>The court may, notwithstanding that they are of opinion that a point raised in an appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.</P>
      <P>In other words, although they are convinced that the appeal should go in favour of the appellant, they are at liberty, if they want to, to dismiss the appeal if no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.  I should imagine that the object of a Court of Appeal mainly would be to decide a question of law, and you are now going to turn them into a general jury.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (b) says:</P>
      <P>Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and the jury by whom he was so convicted could on the indictment have found him guilty of some other offence, and on the finding of such jury it appears to the court that such jury must have been satisfied of the facts which proved him guilty of that other offence, the court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the verdict found by such jury a verdict of guilty of that other offence, and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed at the trial as may be warranted in law for that other offence.</P>
      <P>In other words, they set the jury aside because they choose to think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the judges, if they think that on the facts before them the jury would have found him guilty of this other offence, can find him guilty.  That is what it comes to, in practice, anyhow.  It means definitely, if words mean anything, that the Court of Appeal in examining the case will say to themselves: &ldquo;The verdict as found by the jury indicates that in their minds certain facts were proved,&rdquo; but that matter was not before the jury and they were not definitely finding these facts as such&mdash;it only comes in by a side-wind.  You are going to give the Court of Appeal power to make all these deductions from a verdict found by a jury.  I think that is absurd.</P>
      <P>Then we come to sub-section (c):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... where the Court reverse a conviction in whole, the Court shall have jurisdiction to make an order (in this section referred to as an order for a re-trial) authorising the person in respect of whom such conviction was obtained to be re-tried for the same offence as that which was the subject of such conviction and may by such order give such directions as to costs as they may consider proper, and may by such order or any subsequent order direct the person in respect of whose conviction the order was made to be retained in custody or to be admitted to bail on such terms as they think proper.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the sort of thing you would imagine would be brought up by somebody who had never heard of any general principles of law.  There is a well-established principle&mdash;and there are very good reasons as a rule behind those principles&mdash;it is usually put in the Latin form&mdash;<i>Nemo bis vexari debit.</i>  In other words, that a person is not to be pursued in this particular manner and <Col N="1819" /> tried twice for the same offence.  If he has been acquitted, he has been acquitted.  If the Court of Appeal finds that he is not guilty, or that he has not been properly convicted, he ought to go a free man and not be all the time subject to being pursued in this particular manner and told that he will be brought up for retrial and held in custody. That is what appears to a layman on reading this.  Certainly I expected, having read it, that we would get from the Minister some explanation for his turning the law.  as it has been turned, topsy-turvy in this matter.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters I wish to refer to by the way.  The Minister referred to Section 6 (a), which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sentence shall not in any case be executed until after the expiration of the time within which notice of appeal or of an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal may be given in accordance with Rules of Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said that that was always the practice&mdash;that it was a practice always acted upon.  I draw attention to the fact that that was not acted upon on a certain occasion when Erskine Childers was put to death while an appeal was pending.</P>
    <P>You are looking for further District Justices.  I think a certain case has been made out for two extra judges. You are looking for four extra justices here and I think we are entitled to hear a better case made out for the increase in the number than has been made out up to the present.  If there is any increase at all and if it can be proved that an increase is necessary&mdash;to my mind it has not been proved so far &mdash;but if it is proved then I suggest a knowledge of Irish should be taken into account.  However, I am assuming that we are going to be beaten in a division in this case again.  It occurred so often irrespective of common sense&mdash;no matter what common sense is put forward we have been defeated&mdash;but I hope, at any rate, that if a case is made out, and if there should be an increase of any kind in the number of District Justices that the importance of a knowledge of Irish will be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>In rising to support the Second Reading of this Bill I desire to do so with this reservation: that I do not desire my support of it to be taken as any support of the system of appeal under the Courts of Justice Act under which we are working at the present time.  In my opinion and in the opinion I must say of the whole of the profession, the Act and the present system is unworkable.  I support this Bill because I take it that it is brought forward by the Minister for Justice in order to carry on the present system for the purpose of giving it a more complete try out than it has had up to the present.  For that reason I support it.  As to the criticisms passed by Deputy Redmond and Deputy de Valera I do not wish to go into them at the present moment.  As regards Section 5 I am not satisfied as to the terms of that section and at the proper time if an amendment is not put down by some Deputies or the Minister I shall put down amendments.  I do not agree with Deputy Redmond's criticism of Section 8 which is the one dealing with certain orders of the Master of the High Courts which are not to be impugned. I take that to be a retrospective section that validates certain orders made by the Master before his jurisdiction was ascertained.  It was uncertain what his jurisdiction was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. RUTTLEDGE</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 has been criticised by Deputy de Valera and Deputy Redmond, and I think that while Deputy de Valera was speaking the Minister for Justice tried to join issue with regard to sub-section (b) of Section 5.  The sub-section says where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and the jury by whom he was so convicted could, on the indictment, have found him guilty of some other offence, and on the finding of such jury it appears to the court that such jury must have been satisfied of the facts which proved him guilty of that other offence&mdash;and so on.</P>
      <P>I think there can be no ambiguity about that, that you are putting the judges in the position of endeavouring to find out what was in the jury's mind. The jury pronounced on a certain indictment, and that is the only indictment they have pronounced upon. According to this sub-section the judges are to read into the jury's mind something that could not be and would not be in the jury's mind at all.  There can be no other deduction from the wording of that section.  In other words, you are substituting for the jury two or three judges who compose the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
      <P>Coming to Section 8, perhaps the necessity for that could have been obviated.  I do not know who the Rule-making Authority is, but I suggest to the Minister that if the Rule-making Authority had been supplied with some legal advice the necessity for this would not arise.</P>

      <P>The Rule-making Authority may consist of some <Col N="1822" /> legal men, but apparently when drafting the rules they were unable to draft them so that they did not run roughshod over the Constitution.  Subsequently when bringing in further rules they again ran across the Constitution, although they had three decisions before them to guide them as to the jurisdiction of the Master.  They came along and they gave jurisdiction to the county registrars and imposed judicial functions upon them.  They have had a lesson two or three times.  I suggest that the Minister might get some barrister in the library, someone who might not be too busy to give assistance.</P>

      <P>The Minister asks under this Bill that two additional Circuit Judges be appointed.  On the day that the Minister was himself appointed a member of the Executive Council it was stressed in this House by me and other Deputies that the cause of the delay with appeals in the Circuit Courts, generally, and the unsatisfactory condition they were in, arose mainly from sticking to the system that appeals were based on the stenographer's notes.  I do not think that the Minister could be under the impression, no matter how, elastic his imagination may be or no matter how he would shut himself off from the views of the outside world or the Bar library or legal profession, or convince himself that he could be under the impression that that system under which the Courts of Justice Act is still operating, and the system of appeals could have given any satisfaction.  I believe if that system had not been adhered to it would not now be necessary to be asking for further judges.</P>
      <P>After all, you have only to consider the position in the Circuit Courts to-day. Witnesses are brought up there. Every word spoken in the court has to be taken carefully in the notes, and instead of disposing of eighteen or even a dozen cases in the day, as in the old County Court system, you now make wonderful headway if you dispose of two cases in the day, as the Minister for Justice knows himself.</P>

The Minister pretends to make some improvement on that system, universally attacked, in Section 11.  The only portion which I can see that can be construed as any slight amendment of the system as it exists is sub-section 2, Clause (a).  It admits additional evidence, either orally or on affidavit.

      <P>I was not here when the Minister was speaking.  Clause (b) was dealt with already by the Appeal Judges in certain cases.  The question that does not seem to me to <Col N="1824" /> be of any importance to the Minister, and which might be considered, as has been pointed out already in this House, is the enormous expense to litigants to prosecute those appeals.  It is a barrier to justice, because in some cases it transpires that subsequent to the hearing before the Circuit Court Judge evidence can be brought before the Appeal Judges which might be able to prevent a wrong or injustice from being done.  As I pointed out previously, a very conservative estimate of a trivial appeal from the Circuit Court Judge is £80.  Hence at present, when you have not sittings through the country of the appeal divisions, it means that you bring down a senior counsel from Dublin to another part of the country.  The unfortunate client has to pay a fee of 25 guineas.  Under the old system you had the judges going on circuit and senior and junior counsel to select from.  I am not suggesting that system was admirable, but I am saying that a system on some lines that would avoid this unnecessary expense would be more in keeping with what should be put forward from this House.  I contend if some such system as that were devised that it would enable the cases coming before the court to be dealt with more speedily, and would avoid all this unnecessary delay.  Some time ago you appointed appeal commissioners when there was an accumulation of work.  At that time this House was told it was to wipe out arrears, and once that was done this system would work smoothly.  Now the House is told that the arrears are as bad as when they appointed commissioners. They ask now for four additional assistant district justices.  We were to assume that there would be certain economies in this system, but if the Minister wants to put side by side with the cost and expenses that obtained in other days when, as everyone knows, expenditure was on an outlandish scale, the rate at which the Executive Council is appointing justices, it means the judicial system will be as costly here to-day as it was under the other régime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what case the Minister can make for the appointment of four assistant district justices; <Col N="1825" /> so far as I have been able to ascertain the district justices have been able to deal with the work in the country.  In Dublin there may be necessity for an additional district justice.</P>

They are entitled to certain vacations in the year.  They also occasionally may get sick, and during the time they are taking their vacations or suffering illness it is necessary for someone to do their work.  At present gentlemen have been appointed temporarily for a fortnight or three weeks at a time, sometimes much longer.  These four are taking the place of the temporary district justices, and the extra expense, if anything, will be very little indeed.</P>

      <P>Surely when you were appointing Assistant District Justices it was only to deal with a particular emergency?  Now you are going to appoint&mdash;once the power is given by the House I am sure the Executive <Col N="1826" /> Council will act upon it&mdash;four additional Assistant District Justices. These are going to be four permanent jobs.  They will be four permanent officers, and we will want very strong proof to show that they are absolutely necessary.  As regards Section 15, under which additional powers are given to the District Courts, I certainly see no reason to complain of that.  I do not think that any Deputy who has had any experience of District Justices in the country will have any reason to complain of giving them extra jurisdiction. I think in a good many instances the District Justices that have been appointed have shown a much greater knowledge of affairs in the country, and that they were not so detached as some of the Judges.  In that connection from time to time it has been submitted to the Minister, that in appointing District Justices, he might follow the practice that was followed to some extent when the District Justices were first appointed.  That is, that he would not stick to what seems to be the inherited idea in regard to the privileges of the Bar.  It has been put forward by the Incorporated Law Society from time to time that solicitors should be considered for those positions.  I have no particular reason for saying that except that they are in touch and have been more in touch with the business that comes before the District Courts than persons such as barristers, accustomed to the seclusion of the Law Library.</P>

      <P>I know they were, but in recent times that has been departed from and the original practice has not been adhered to.  My chief objection to the Bill, however, and it is a serious objection, is on the question of appeals.  If the Minister would give some indication that he was going to recognise the position with which everybody seems to be dissatisfied in regard to the system of appeals as at present existing, and that he would do something to remedy that state of affairs and do away with the increased expense as shown by the working of <Col N="1827" /> the Act, it would go a long way towards removing the present dissatisfaction. If he decides still to continue the practice under which litigants are put to the expense of £80 in prosecuting an appeal in some trivial case whereas under the previous regime it could be done for about £19, it can only result in more delay and a greater feeling of dissatisfaction.  These are the facts, and no matter who is responsible for the system of appeals, and no matter what position they occupy, I think the House should look at the matter in a broad, common-sense way and ask itself what is the proper way to remedy a system that has worked so unsatisfactorily during the last two or three years.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get myself involved in a dispute between members of the legal profession.  I am reminded that the Bar is one of the strongest of Trade Unions.  I do not want to get into an argument between the two branches of the Profession but I have to say for myself that until the Minister can give the reasons which influenced him in putting Section 5 into the Bill I will be obliged to go into the Division Lobby against him.  I could not, under any circumstances, vote for this section in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of Section 5 there has been no attack made upon the Bill itself.  There have been attacks made not for what the Bill contains but for what it does not contain.  To deal with these attacks generally and on the whole administration of justice in the country generally, I will commence by making the statement that the Courts of Justice Act was introduced by the then Executive Council following upon the report of a Committee which had been set up. That was a very conservative Committee. It represented the Bar, the solicitors' profession, the commercial and trading institutions of this country. That Committee made certain recommendations which the Executive Council embodied in the present Courts of Justice Act.  The Executive Council carried out the recommendations of the Committee of experts, a conservative <Col N="1828" /> Committee, which they had set up. Now we are asked to change that Act in its fundamentals.  My answer to that is that we are not tied down to that Act and we are not tied down to any single detail in the Act.  All we want to do and all we are doing at the present moment is giving the Courts of Justice Act a fair chance.  We want to see it working.  If after we have seen it working it proves faulty or deficient in principle or in detail, then we will alter it, vary it or amend it, according as experience shows that it should be altered, varied or amended, but until such time as the Circuit Court is operating under the rules, until the system has been working, it is impossible for us to say whether it will ultimately be a success or otherwise.  I do not deny for a moment that the opinion of both branches of the profession is that the system of appeals is not good.  I am perfectly aware of that fact.  I am perfectly alive to the existence of that state of feeling in my own profession and in the solicitors' profession, but I consider it incumbent upon us to see that the system is not too hastily scrapped and not too hastily altered until we have seen that system working, under rules, as the person who designed that system expected it would work. It is not fair and it would not be wise to abolish the system.</P>
      <P>Now I come to this much-attacked Section 5.  Deputy Redmond used some very strong words.  He said that according to all recognised standards of justice there were things in that section which were completely wrong.  I would like for a moment to explain the history of that section to the House.  I should like from every part of the House reasoned suggestions for the amending of that section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would bear with me. Some time ago there was no Court of Criminal Appeal in this country.  The prisoner was convicted, and the verdict against him stood.  A Court of Criminal Appeal was set up some years ago in England, afterwards in Scotland, and then it was set up by the Oireachtas in this country.  The courts here <Col N="1829" /> administer what is practically the same criminal law as is administered in England. The Court of Criminal Appeal had been working in England for a great number of years.  It had also worked in Scotland.  They amended their Act.  They varied and altered their system into a system giving to the judges in England&mdash;it is the same in Scotland&mdash;the same powers as it is proposed under this Bill to give to the judges in this country.  Their experience has been the same as our experience.  It is perfectly right and accurate to say that the prisoner must receive the benefit of every doubt, that he is innocent until proved guilty, that he should not be put in danger twice, that he should not be harassed by the accumulation of proceedings against him.  All that is perfectly right. Every one of these sentiments is very excellent and very admirable.  But this Bill does not injure or destroy any of these nice, pious, excellent sentiments. The prisoner is tried; he is found guilty.  He comes to the court and says: &ldquo;There was one trifling bit of evidence&mdash;absolutely of no importance to the issue&mdash;let in, one little statement which was not evidence.&rdquo;  The whole trial is to go.  The whole verdict is to be set aside.  It is of paramount importance, in the administration of criminal justice, that no innocent person should be convicted, and that no innocent person should suffer.  That is of paramount importance, but it is of great importance to the community too that, notwithstanding pure technicalities, persons who may have committed grave and serious crimes against particular individuals of the community or particular citizens of the State should be punished for the crimes which they have committed.  There should not be a door through which guilty persons&mdash; plainly and obviously guilty&mdash;can escape.  The jury find them guilty. They have had the protection of the jury first.  They then come before the judges on appeal, and the judges find that a little, trifling mistake which could not have affected the minds of the jury was made.  The judges must be satisfied that there could be no miscarriage of justice.  Sub-section (b) says that if a man is found guilty of one offence, being charged with various <Col N="1830" /> crimes, the judges, if they think that, as a matter of law, there was no evidence to support the finding of the jury&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>They must be in the indictment.  The prisoner could not be found guilty of an offence with which he was not charged.  He cannot be found guilty under this sub-section of any offence which the jury could not have found him guilty of.  That is perfectly clear. If the judges see that the jury believed the witnesses who were called by the prosecution, that is perfectly obvious. The jury believed them, and, because the jury went too far and found the man guilty of a more serious offence than he had committed, because they leaned too much against the prisoner in their finding, the prisoner&mdash;a guilty man on the finding of the jury&mdash;is to escape scot-free.  I ask Deputies to consider that very carefully, to think it over very carefully, because it is important that guilty persons should be punished.  That is not as important as that innocent persons should escape when charged.  That is of primary importance, but it is also important to the community that guilty persons should be punished.  That is a sentiment in which, I am sure, every member of the House will agree with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. An indictment, I might venture to point out, as possibly there is some little difficulty about it, contains a count for larceny, a count for false pretences or for something else.  Certainly you would not have a count for murder and a count for larceny in the same indictment.  You would not be tried in the same indictment on what one would call two sets of facts.  You would only be tried on one set of facts, and the jury might find you guilty of having done the act.  As to whether the act amounted to one offence or another, the jury might be wrong in law.  Say the case is one of larceny or false pretences. An issue paper would be handed up to the jury.  They would be asked: Was the prisoner guilty of <Col N="1832" /> larceny?  Was the prisoner guilty of false pretences?  If they found him guilty of larceny they would say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the first question.  Take a case like this: Valuable goods are stolen.  A man is found wearing them.  They are marked with another man's name, and it is perfectly plain that there has been an offence committed.  It might be held that there was no evidence that this man actually stole the goods.  The jury may find him guilty.  It is perfectly obvious he has them knowing them to have been stolen.  Would it not be bad for the community if a man like that, because the jury found him guilty of larceny, when they ought only to have found him guilty of the lesser offence, should go free?  Take the new trial. There has been some bit of evidence let in, probably of a serious nature, and the court is satisfied that there was plenty of evidence, apart from this illegal evidence, to go to a jury, but they are not satisfied that the jury would of necessity find him guilty without this extra bit of evidence.</P>

      <P>Could there be anything better in a case like that than to have the man retried?  The proceedings are not over.  He has been tried for one offence, but there is an indeterminate verdict upon that.  He has been found guilty.  The court thinks that probably the jury might have acquitted him.  They do not preserve the sentence.  The court simply say: &ldquo;Let the case go back and let the jury decide in the case of this particular man whether he is guilty or not guilty upon legal evidence.&rdquo;  There is nothing in this section which really can be said to endanger innocent people. This section is simply an attempt, following out what has been done in other countries, to prevent men whom the jury obviously considered guilty, or possibly might consider guilty, from escaping.  What we are endeavouring to do is, as I have said before, to safeguard the innocent but not to make escape by mere technicality too easy for the guilty.  That is all Section 5 is designed to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  Take sub-section (a).  It is perfectly obvious that something immaterial, something which really could not have an effect on the minds of the jury at all, or only to a trifling extent, has happened.  It is perfectly obvious that the jury considered the man guilty, and that they must have come to that conclusion quite apart from this evidence.  There (a) comes into operation, but (c) comes into operation when it becomes a question of real difficulty. There has been possibly some admission of illegal evidence, or possibly some too-strong statement in the judge's charge or something of that kind&mdash; some pure technicality in the first instance, and something more serious than a technicality in the second instance. That is the difference.  In one case the judges affirm the findings of the jury; in the other they say a new jury should be empanelled to decide this question.  It is not only the experience in this country, but it is the experience of other countries where you have a court of criminal appeal, you must have some clauses of this nature.  That is the English and the Scotch experience, and they are particular as to the liberty of the subject in those countries also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rice explained the position.  The position is this: The Master made, under the rules, certain decisions which were wider than the rules justified him in doing.  He misinterpreted the rules of the High Court.  I may as well come to Deputy Ruttledge's argument on this also.  Deputy Ruttledge said it was unconstitutional, that it had been decided by the court to be against the Constitution.  I do not like being very definite in a question of this nature, because there may be some very recent decision that I have not heard of.  But all the cases that I know of, and I think all the reported cases, are to this effect, that the decisions made by the Master were not justified by the rules of the High Court.  There has been no decision in which there has been an interpretation given by the courts of what judicial functions mean in the Constitution, and I would very much like to know.  It came before the Court of Appeal recently, and they did not decide the question.</P>

      <P>That is very plain, but as to what are judicial functions is not so plain.  Take, for instance, an interlocutory application&mdash;as to whether that is a judicial function has not been decided, and it is a very important matter, and the real powers of the Master cannot be known until that has been decided.  Deputy de Valera raised a question about the four Assistant District Justices, and I was somewhat surprised to hear Deputy Ruttledge upon very much the same lines.  I think Deputy Ruttledge himself must really know the position.  We have had a considerable number of District Justices in the country, and these district justices are entitled to take a certain amount of holidays in the year.  There are not District Justices idling the whole year.  There are District Justices who are working the whole year.  They have a good deal of work to do, and it is by no means an easy position.</P>

      <P>I venture to think that, with the exception of Deputy Davin, Deputies will agree that the District Justices are a very hard-working and hard-worked body of men.  They are entitled to their vacations during the year.  There must be persons to take their places when they are receiving their vacation or when they get off for any other reason.  Under the Courts of Justice Act power was given to appoint temporary District Justices to do that work, because it was recognised <Col N="1836" /> that there were only sufficient District Justices each to do his own district. If one District Justice found that he could go in a little on the other District Justice's area and help him during illness or vacation, he is given power by this Bill to do so.  It is perfectly clear that if the courts are to be held while these District Justices are on their holidays, or sick, there must be more than the present number of whole-time District Justices.  The Courts of Justice Act enables temporary District Justices to be appointed to do the work of the existing District Justices, for a fortnight or three weeks, or sometimes longer.  It is in place of these men that these four permanent District Justices are being appointed. I have heard criticism again and again in this House directed against the making of temporary appointments to judicial offices.  We have stated that we consider that undesirable.  Now when we come forward doing away with the need of appointing temporary men to judicial offices we are attacked and, as far as I can gather, the view of the Opposition is this&mdash;that instead of having these permanent men exercising judicial functions we should have temporary men.</P>

      <P>No; as a matter of fact these four deputy-justices will have to work and to work continuously, and work the whole time, and in order that the arrangement may work smoothly it may also be necessary to interfere with the term of choice of the existing justices in the matter of the time at which they would take their holidays, in order that these whole-time men may be able to work full time, and that there may be no district left without a district justice.  Deputy Ruttledge's contention would be this&mdash;that the present district justices can in fact do their work without any temporary assistance. Well, that is not the general experience, and I think Deputy Ruttledge would be very sorry if that would apply to the districts in which he himself carries out his practice.  I think I have dealt fairly exhaustively with the criticisms which have been <Col N="1838" /> passed upon this measure.

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. GOULDING Mr. GOULDING">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOULDING</NameTxt>
      <P>It is satisfactory to hear the Minister say that the rates are coming down, but the rates will have to go a great deal lower before they are in consonance with the capacity of the people to meet them.  While I thoroughly sympathise with those who wish to improve social services, we must always take into account that we have to keep the social services so that the people will be able to meet the cost of them.  I do not wish to be considered a reactionary.  Personally, I should like to see the public health services very much improved.  I should like to see county medical officers of health functioning in every county.  I agree with Deputy Sir James Craig when he expressed the wish that a county medical officer of health should be set to work immediately in every county, but we must also face the fact that, however desirable that may be, and however desirable it is to have medical inspection of school children, the people are unable to meet the cost. I may be told that it would be better to bear this increased cost rather than that the health of the people should decline&mdash;that it would be very much cheaper in the end if these officers could start work immediately, as the result would be that the health of the school children would be greatly improved, and that would mean a saving to the rates in future of the cost of maintaining people who lose their health as a result of neglect in their early years.  But, as I have said, the people are not at present in a position to meet the cost that this would involve. The result is that many county councils object to the county medical officer of health and have refused to <Col N="1842" /> make arrangements for the appointment.</P>
      <P>I may be asked what alternative I have to suggest.  The only one I can think of is that the present dispensary medical officers be given power to carry out the inspection of schools and be given an increased salary for the increased work this would entail.  Many of them would be only too glad, if given the opportunity, to take out a post-graduate course and obtain a diploma in public health.  Of course the obvious objection to that is that these medical officers have private practice and that in the course of carrying out the sanitation part of their work they might come up against their private patients, with the result that a certain amount of pressure could be brought to bear on them and they could be prevented from fulfilling their public duties.  Perhaps that is what would happen, but I do not see any other way out.  The ratepayers and their representatives strongly resent these medical officers of health being forced upon them.  I know that the ratepayers are not in a position at present to meet the increased cost.  Possibly, at some time in future, people may become better off, and then I would be the last to stand in the way of the appointment of such medical officers of health.  At present I am against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of roads, I believe that the matter of making the trunk roads of the country a State charge has been before this House on many occasions, and it is time that serious attention should be given to it.  After all, the trunk roads are arterial highways and it is time that they should be taken off the local rates.  The people are grumbling, with very good cause, at the heavy charge on the local rates for the upkeep of roads.  Although there is a very good State contribution for the maintenance of trunk and main roads, the result of having to maintain such an excellent service of roads is that the smaller roads are neglected and many ratepayers are severely handicapped.  I may add, in passing, that it is rather anomalous that the road-making machinery should be taxed.  The engines used in the making and repairing of roads should, at least, <Col N="1843" /> be free from the road tax.  I may be told that it does not matter, because it comes back again, but it leads to a certain amount of irritation which could be avoided.</P>
    <P>As to the question of the unused workhouses, these buildings are becoming a rather serious charge on the local rates.  They are gradually deteriorating, and the councils are faced with a very heavy charge for upkeep.  Some effort should be made to utilise these buildings.  A few years ago a scheme was suggested to use some of them for homes for imbeciles.  The idea was set afoot in County Waterford to use one of the buildings there to maintain imbeciles from Waterford, South Tipperary and Kilkenny.  That scheme has not materialised, but it is worthy of consideration.  Probably it could be applied to other counties as well. Another use to which they could be put, and which would be very desirable, is that some arrangement could be made by which unmarried mothers in various counties could be put in charge of, say, some religious body in some of these institutions.  The present arrangement is not a desirable one and some of these buildings could be utilised to advantage for this purpose.</P>
    <P>With regard to combined purchasing, I am not against it, as I have realised the advantages, but there are some rather serious complaints in connection with it.  The hospital and the mental home in Waterford have been supplied with very inferior articles on more than one occasion, and the complaint made, apparently, has not remedied the matter.  Of course we are also faced with the complaint from local traders that they are practically excluded from tendering for supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOULDING</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will get the details.  I do not knew if I am precluded from dealing with the Appointments Commission.  It is another bone of contention.  Lately, at an inquiry in Waterford, it was said that a certain gentleman recommended by the Appointments Commissioners was not on the black list.  Quite a lot of people want to know what is the black list, and what exactly makes a person eligible for the black list.  I have no doubt that the Appointments Commissioners acted with perfect fairness, but whatever the result there is undoubtedly a feeling in the country that the thing is not always fair.  And although the best man may be appointed, it is not always the person most suited for the particular locality that is appointed.  I think the whole question of the Appointments Committee would be worth inquiring into. I do not wish to criticise the Commissioners unduly, but I must admit that in many parts of the country the selections made have not given satisfaction at all.  There is a considerable vexation and ill-feeling as a result of many of the appointments made.</P>
      <P>I was sorry to have to say anything with reference to increased medical services, but I must say that the people cannot afford them.  Just one word more on the question of the co-ordination of the medical service.  Since the passing of the National Health Insurance Act there has been a division of the Medical Charities Act, and I think it would be well worth while if the whole question of the Medical Charities Act and the National Health Insurance Act were taken up, and that they were revised.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to support the suggestion that the local authorities should be relieved of the responsibility for the maintenance of the main and trunk roads.  When I say that I do not mean to suggest that the ratepayers of the localities concerned should be relieved altogether of any financial liability.  I believe that this is the only road to the solution of the general problem of transport.  I believe <Col N="1845" /> that part of the way that we will have to travel towards the final solution of that problem is by taking the responsibility off the local authorities for the maintenance of the main and trunk roads and placing it on some central authority, whether it be in charge of the Local Government Department or the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>The ratepaying community of this country are not in a position to make use of the roads to the same extent nowadays as ten, fifteen, or twenty years ago, and I think that, seeing that is so, certainly they should not be called upon to bear the same charge for the upkeep of the roads to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies, led, I think, by Deputy John Daly, urged the Minister to promote schemes which would enable the local authorities to build labourers' cottages in areas where they are required, and at rents which the people looking for them would be in a position to pay.  I certainly support that suggestion. There is a demand for this in the area I represent.  I would urge the Minister, however, before proceeding with such a scheme, to endeavour to provide facilities for the Board of Health in the different areas to build labourers' cottages on plots already provided for that purpose.  I have been approached on several occasions and requested to make representations to the Minister's Department for the purpose of getting the Minister to persuade the Boards of Health to build cottages on plots provided years ago for these particular purposes.  I am inquiring to what extent grievances of that kind exist in other areas.  I <Col N="1846" /> think in North Tipperary, in Carlow and several Midland counties plots have been provided by the rural district councils where cottages have not been so far built.  I saw a case in a recent land division scheme where an individual who was in possession of a plot without a cottage was prevented from getting an addition to that plot because a house had not been built upon that plot provided for that purpose in this particular area.</P>
    <P>I suggest this is a serious matter.  I do not know to what extent or how many people are affected or what areas are affected but I think if plots were provided years ago for the purpose of enabling labourers to have cottages built upon these plots the Boards of Health should be allowed to proceed and should get facilities for building houses upon those plots.  I was informed by an official of the Minister's Department that if the Board of Health had to find the total cost of building cottages the rents charged would amount to 10/- or 12/- a week.  I only suggest to the Minister if it can be done that the Boards of Health should be put in a position to build cottages on those plots at a rent the labourers would be in a position to pay.  That is labourers of the kind who are entitled to have cottages built and provided as they were in the old days under the Labourers Acts.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister's statement in regard to the housing question is not very convincing.  From what I know of the views of the Minister and those who assist him they are doing all they can, within the limits of the powers of the recent Acts, to encourage individuals and local authorities to build houses urgently required in many cases all over the country.  The fact remains that as stated by the Minister the total number of houses built up to the 31st March by private persons was 8,727, of which 6,533 were completed.  The number of houses built by the local authorities was 2,278 which is clear proof that local authorities do not think they have the facilities to enable them to build the houses required all over the country.  I know several local authorities in the constituency of Leix and Offaly, particularly in Birr and Tullamore, where <Col N="1847" /> houses are badly needed, where they have prepared schemes giving an indication of the number of houses required and they say they cannot proceed to build those houses unless they get longer term loans than these under the present Housing Act.  It is impossible to expect people would proceed to build houses on the fifteen year loan basis; if people were anxious to get houses they would have to pay a rent of seven or eight shillings a week in towns where the workmen only receive 30/- or 35/- a week.  It cannot be done.  I know when the Minister visited Tullamore on a recent occasion to inquire into the question of local administration he visited some of the hovels that the unfortunate people live in.  I know he has sympathy for them and all I ask him is to make haste in the direction of providing a longer period for loans for local authorities so that they can proceed to do the work which they are anxious to do.  The fact that 2,278 houses have been built under the Acts of 1924, 1925 and 1926 shows that the Housing Acts, so far as they give facilities to local authorities, are a complete failure.  I know the President is interested in this question and I only express the hope that the conference now sitting will bring the results the Ministry are hoping for and one of the results I hope will be that the money necessary will be provided for a much longer period than under the previous Acts.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Local Government to see that the medical officers of health we have appointed&mdash; and I am quite in agreement with the appointment of those officers, and I think time will prove that they have very useful work to do&mdash;will ask for a return of the insanitary houses throughout provincial Ireland.  I want to refer to the agitation for the building of houses in Edenderry.  I have made representations to the Minister for Local Government with regard to the providing of houses under the Labourers Acts; the reason I have done so is that you have there the woodworking industry, which has received State assistance.  That cannot be carried on successfully unless the <Col N="1848" /> local authority, with the assistance of the Ministry, provide houses urgently required for the skilled workers, who will not go into Edenderry unless these houses are provided.  I have seen houses in which workmen live and it is scandalous to think that in any civilised country workmen should be called upon to live in them.  There are cases in Edenderry where workmen have to live in old stables.  I suggest to the Minister that there is no use in one Ministry providing a large amount by way of loans under a Trade Loans Facilities Act to enable the woodworking industry in Edenderry to be developed and at the same time not to provide houses required to induce skilled workmen to come in there.  Skilled workmen have stayed in Edenderry for a certain period and left because they could not find sufficient lodging accommodation in the town.  I mention the matter now because representations have been made to the Department.  They will have to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Board of Health to start a scheme for the reason I have quoted.  I have engaged in a contest with the Town Commissioners on this matter, but I found some of the members of the Town Commission owned some of the hovels in which human beings are expected to live.  I hope these people will have to give way, and that the Department of Local Government will not take any serious notice of any representations made to them by people with an interest in the hovels in Edenderry and in other places.</P>
    <P>I also support Deputy Sir James Craig, Deputy Dr. O'Dowd and others who have appealed to the Minister to give further facilities for the provision of water-works and sewerage schemes where they are required.  I admit that the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance have done a good deal within the narrow limits of the money made available.  The one point I want to make to the Minister is that he has provided a certain amount of money already to enable local authorities to carry out sewerage and water-works schemes.  Certain towns are without sanitary accommodation which ordinary towns in any civilised country should have at their <Col N="1849" /> disposal.  It is my opinion that these schemes cannot be carried out unless a certain amount of free grant is given.  The area of charge is the dispensary area.  Local authorities cannot be expected to provide all the money to enable them to carry out those schemes where they are necessary. I urge upon the Minister in considering the provision of money for this purpose to consider the advisability of giving a fair proportion of the money by free grant to enable these schemes to be carried out if the medical officers think such schemes are necessary.  I believe medical officers of health have been responsible for the carrying out of such works.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I would like the Minister to explain.  On March 6th the Minister was responsible for calling a conference consisting of representatives of the Committees of Management of the different mental hospitals throughout the country, and it appears to me his aim and object was to give them directions and assistance to reduce the salaries of the employees of those particular concerns.  I have before me extracts from one report in the &ldquo;Kerryman.&rdquo;  There is a report given by the representatives of the local people.  I have also extracts from the Clonmel &ldquo;Nationalist.&rdquo;  The report in the &ldquo;Kerryman&rdquo; states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;General Mulcahy, T.D., Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who was accompanied by Mr. E.P. McCarron, Secretary of the Department, and Mr. Collins, of the Mental Hospitals Section, opened the proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will not worry the House by repeating what was said.  It then goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A memorandum giving particulars of the action taken by each Committee with regard to the remuneration of their officers was read and a general discussion, in which most members present took part, followed, on the position created by the decisions in the courts in the several cases which have been taken against Committees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was proposed by one representative that a Committee of those present <Col N="1850" /> be formed, the objects of the Committee being:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  To ascertain the powers of the Committee of Management in regard to the reduction of the remuneration of both officers and servants;</P>
    <P>2.  To consider whether any general scheme of reduction is practicable, and if so,</P>
    <P>3.  How it can be made effective;</P>
    <P>4.  To report specially as regards the Mullingar scheme of inclusive cash wages, which was agreed to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that it appears, from reading a report such as that, that the Minister, rightly or wrongly&mdash;I think wrongly&mdash;took upon himself the responsibility of calling, as it were, the employers together and of discussing with them the advisability or necessity, as it was called, of reducing the wages of workers employed by the Mental Hospital Committees. I think the Minister, before taking any such step in future, if he thinks that the wages of the workers employed by the mental hospitals ought to be reduced, in calling a conference for the purpose of considering the advisability of reducing such wages, should provide that the conference would consist of employees and employers. I would like to ask the Minister whether he would agree, in cases where it may be advisable in future to call employers together to consider these matters, at the same time to consider calling into the same conference those who are acknowledged as the leaders of the workers in the mental hospitals.  I think it is not right, when such matters have to be considered, that one side should be called together and given directions without consulting the other side.</P>

      <P>It is to be regretted that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health does not appear fully to realise the economic conditions existing down the country and the absolute necessity for drastic economy in the administration of this Department.  He does not appear to be aware of the fact that those who live down the country and who mix amongst the farming community are fully aware that farmers <Col N="1851" /> who were comfortably off seven or eight years ago, to-day cannot make ends meet, and that unless there is the most drastic economy in the administration of the Departments of the Government, and more especially in the Department of Local Government and Public Health, a point is bound to be reached that will be the breaking point with many of the farming community. Many of them to-day are faced with bankruptcy or emigration, and some of them are faced with both.  The Estimate for 1927-28 under Sub-head A&mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;was £85,422.  For 1928-29 the amount under the same sub-head is £79,934, showing a decrease of £5,480.  That decrease is to a great extent a decrease on paper.  It does not exist in reality.  In that decrease there are two general inspectors with a salary of £1,024, one medical inspector with £700, the auditor with a salary of £775, making in all £2,499 shown, but these officers are actually Commissioners.  They are retained on the staff of the Local Government Department, and at any time when their services are no longer required as Commissioners they may return to the Local Government Department and take up office in their former positions. Their salaries at the moment are not paid out of this Vote, but there is no question about it they are drawing salaries and they are being paid by the ratepayers.  It is only the merest camouflage to put the salaries of these officers down as a saving in this year's Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. WARD Dr. WARD">
      <NameTxt>Dr. WARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the inspectorial staff.  The total estimated cost for the inspectorial staff for <Col N="1852" /> 1928-29, including travelling expenses, is £28,515.  That is an enormous sum of money to be spent in ensuring that the Department's regulations are carried out&mdash;to be spent on purely inspectorial work.  I think there is ample room for economy in this Department. For example, we have the medical inspectors&mdash;taking them first, as I know most about them, I suppose &mdash; for various sub-departments &mdash; medical inspectors to inspect mental hospitals, medical inspectors to inspect dispensaries, medical inspectors to inspect people who have been drawing National Health Insurance benefit, when the society comes to doubt that they are no longer able to work; medical inspectors to decide whether people are sufficiently blind to draw the blind pension; medical inspectors to visit sanatoria, and so on.  It appears to me that when a medical man reaches the position of being a medical inspector under the Local Government Department he should have sufficient qualifications to be able to inspect these various sub-divisions.  The same remarks, to the same extent, apply to engineers.  We have housing engineers, drainage engineers, and various other classes of engineers, and the result of it is that we have one group of inspectors following another around the country.  It takes the co-ordinating inspectors at Headquarters all their time to see that no serious clash occurs, and that many of them will not be at work in any particular area at the same time. Then we have unemployment insurance inspectors and national health insurance inspectors, and old age pensions inspectors, and the general inspectors, as I said, inspecting them all. This inherited system of local government is altogether unsuited to the economic needs of the country, and it will have to be broken up.  These watertight compartments of local government will have to be broken up before there is any effective economy in administration. I would suggest to the Minister seriously to consider the question of breaking down these watertight compartments, so that when a particular inspector for engineering or for medical matters comes to an area he will deal with most of the matters <Col N="1853" /> concerning his particular department as a whole and not have a procession of inspectors with practically the same qualifications following him round with the increased travelling allowances which that entails.</P>
      <P>No serious effort has been made by the Minister to reduce the salaries of the higher officials.  If all the salaries over £1,000 were reduced to that figure and if the cost-of-living bonus on salaries of £600 and upwards were discontinued, a saving of upwards of £7,000 could be effected.  I submit that the time has come when these matters must be seriously considered.  The Minister may say that £7,000 or £8,000 is not worth serious consideration but every £7,000 or £8,000 counts.  The economic conditions in this country are such and the state of poverty is such that the time has come when at least a demonstration must be made at the top and an example shown to the people in the country.  It must be shown that the people at the top seriously realise the economic conditions and are prepared to contribute their portion to the sacrifice that is necessary until the economic conditions improve.  Some of the Minister's colleagues on the opposite side of the House seem to have taken a very superficial view of the Estimate and were congratulating themselves on the reductions that had been made.  I find that the messenger staff in 1927-28 cost £1,683 and for 1928-29 the estimate of expenditure is £2,601.  The auditors' salaries in 1927-28 amounted to £10,675 and for 1928-29 the estimate is £10,451. If we add the salary of £775 of the auditor who is a Commissioner, we find that the auditors are actually costing more this year than they did last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Central Purchasing Department, in theory central purchasing is an excellent thing.  In practice, it is, to my mind, a fraud.  I believed enthusiastically at one time in this central purchasing system.  I have had very good reason to alter my opinion.  The Inspector in charge of this Department, while he may be an excellent official&mdash;I have every reason to believe he is&mdash;I hardly think is giving a return to the country which is worth £1,300 a year at the present time.  I have no doubt that the Minister can give convincing figures <Col N="1854" />&mdash;very convincing figures to those who do not know the facts&mdash;as to the economies that this central purchasing scheme has brought about.  But what is actually happening is: Inferior stuff, rubbish in many cases, is being dumped in the public institutions of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. WARD</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases it is being sent back, but the public do not always get to know about it.  I was reading during the week-end&mdash;I do not know whether it has been brought to the Minister's notice yet or not&mdash;a report of a meeting of the Monaghan and Cavan Mental Hospital Committee. Various articles supplied through the Central Purchasing Department were under discussion at that meeting.  The Resident Medical Superintendent reported regarding socks which were supplied.  The wool, of course, is far cheaper than the wool they used to get, but the socks made from that wool will not last more than a single day. As regards the soap, he reported that if you dissolve it in water, the water becomes black and muddy and gives out a most offensive odour.  In fact, he says it is impossible to use that soap for washing purposes.  That is the soap supplied by the Central Purchasing Department.  Regarding the whiskey used in these institutions as a stimulant for patients, the Resident Medical Superintendent of this institution declared that it would be a danger to give the whiskey that is supplied to human beings&mdash;that it is not, in his opinion, fit for human consumption. Members of the Mental Hospital Committee who have some knowledge, gained in different ways, of that particular drug, stated that the whiskey fit to be used as a stimulant could not be supplied at the price at which this stuff is supplied by the Central Purchasing Department.  I have no doubt that there is a very big saving in the use of this stimulant in these public institutions, but if what is supplied is an article little better than poteen, it is a form of economy that should not be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Materials supplied by the Central <Col N="1855" /> Purchasing Department have been returned. From this institution that I mentioned some considerable consignments of cloth have been returned in the recent past.  It was inferior in quality and it was short in weight. When it was brought to the notice of the contractor and to the notice of the Central Purchasing Department, the contractor actually complained that he had been supplying cloth of the same weight and of the same quality all over the Twenty-six Counties and that no other public body had questioned the matter.  Eventually, he had to admit that the cloth was short in weight and inferior in quality, so that it would appear he had escaped for a considerable time, and he had actually a grievance that he was caught at all. I do not know if the same contractor is still supplying the Central Purchasing Department, but I presume the Minister will inform us upon that point.</P>
    <P>There is another matter concerning the Central Purchasing Department that I want to refer to&mdash;that is, the supply of tar for road-making.  The central contractors for this tar, I understand, are MacCrae, Taylor and Company.  Some time ago, the county surveyor of our county came to the conclusion that he was not getting sufficient yield from the tar which he was receiving&mdash;that it was not going as far as it ought to go.  He had five barrels arrested at random and sent to the Civic Guard barracks.  He sent for a representative of the firm and a representative of the Trade Department. These barrels were examined and measured, and it was found that there was a shortage&mdash;a considerable shortage.  The contracting firm offered to supply 6,000 gallons of tar to make good the deficit.  The Local Government Department were prepared to accept that amount, but the very efficient and capable county surveyor estimated that the loss was at least 18,000 gallons and he would not accept the 6,000 gallons.  As a matter of actual fact, MacCrae, Taylor and Company put up the 18,000 gallons of tar.  I wonder if the same thing has been happening all over the Twenty-six Counties where these people have been supplying tar? <Col N="1856" /> I wonder if MacCrae, Taylor and Company are black-listed, or if they are still supplying tar to the various public bodies?</P>
    <P>There is an item in the Estimate under the heading of &ldquo;Child Welfare.&rdquo; I have no complaint to make on that score.  I believe there is no expenditure from which better results are got than expenditure on Child Welfare schemes, but until such time as the supply of milk for human consumption is regulated and until such time as steps are taken to ensure that the milk of cows suffering from tuberculosis will not go on the market for human consumption, Child Welfare schemes will be working at the wrong end of the rope.  A very big percentage of disease and death amongst children is caused by impure milk, and in present circumstances we are going to have all Child Welfare nurses, doctors, and all the rest devoting their energies to the cure of diseases that are caused by the impure milk supply.  I hope the Minister will take an early opportunity of dealing with the question of pure milk supply.</P>
    <P>There is a large expenditure on the treatment of tuberculosis.  With that we cannot find much fault, but again it appears to me that we are working at the wrong end of the disease.  Most of this expenditure is in providing sanatorium treatment and home treatment, but there does not appear to me to be much use in spending huge sums of money in building up people constitutionally in sanatoria or in other institutions if we are to send them back again to live under the same domestic conditions, the identical conditions which brought about the disease. Until a serious effort is made to improve the social conditions, to improve the housing conditions, to improve the sanitary conditions, to medically inspect the schools, to get at the disease in its early stages, until these steps of preventive medicine are seriously practised, there will be no headway made in this country under the Public Health Department.  To a great extent, except for the purpose of isolation, a whole lot of our effort and expenditure is wasted at the present time, inasmuch as it is entirely devoted to and centred on treating the disease without making <Col N="1857" /> any serious effort to prevent it.  Such preventive measures as a national scheme of afforestation, one of the most important preventive measures against pulmonary tuberculosis, because of the effect it would have on the climatic conditions, on the mean temperature, and on the condition of moisture in the air, ought to be taken.  Another matter that has a very close bearing on tuberculosis in this country is housing.  We find a big change in the Estimate for housing this year.  The grants to the various authorities for housing this year are reduced by £86,220.  We have an item of expenditure of £7,000 in the Estimate for the treatment of venereal disease.  That, too, is not giving a proper return.  We have these schemes in operation, I think, in most counties, but what actually happens is this: when a person contracts such a disease he will not go to the doctor who is known to be the medical officer for the treatment of this disease.  He will either go to a private practitioner or go untreated.  I think it would be far better if these people were brought to a central hospital in Dublin and if the £7,000 were spent in providing bed accommodation in one of these hospitals. I feel strongly on that, and I speak with a considerable amount of practical knowledge of it.  People suffering from this disease should be isolated until they are certified to be cured.</P>
    <P>Regarding the road grants, perhaps I might get some light from the Minister when he is summing up. There are some points that I am not clear about.  I understand that the national route mileages in the Counties Monaghan, Meath and Louth, for instance, are approximately the same. Louth, I think, is somewhat longer.  I find that £105,000 has been allotted to Meath for the past couple of years; £120,000 to Louth, and £56,000 to Monaghan.  I am not clear how the Minister or his Department arrives at the allocation of these grants, but it does seem strange to me that £2 per mile should be allotted to Meath for the £1 per mile allotted to Monaghan.  These are counties that are near me.  I am not in a position to compare how we stand with other counties throughout the Saorstát.  It is a matter that perhaps <Col N="1858" /> can be explained, but it certainly requires explanation.  If it means that the roads in Meath and in Louth are being made twice as good and twice as lasting as the roads in Monaghan, and if the argument be put forward for the larger grant that the valuation of these counties is higher&mdash;in other words, that the people are richer&mdash;that is an argument I would join issue with.  If twice as much money is spent on a particular road as upon another, it will naturally last twice as long, and when it comes to the upkeep of these roads the poor counties will suffer if their roads are not as lasting as a result of this initial expenditure as the others.  In that connection I would like to know what is the cost per square yard of the different roads.  Mileage is not a true indication, inasmuch as one road may be wider than another.  I would like to know what is the cost per square yard of the national route in the three counties I mentioned.</P>
    <P>On the question of amalgamation, it has been found in the working out that there are some practical difficulties.  It appears there is not any uniform method in operation of dealing with these difficulties, because I have found in discussing the matter with Deputies from various sides of the House that the same difficulties do not appear to exist in different areas. One of the great difficulties&mdash;a difficulty which is almost universal&mdash;is the difficulty of the unmarried mother.  I think the Minister should seriously consider the question of setting up separate institutions for that particular class&mdash;institutions to accommodate three or four counties.  I believe that, with the development of cottage industries in such an institution and with compulsory powers to keep the mother there for a year or so, such an institution could be made self-supporting. So long as unmarried mothers are housed in County Homes, the County Homes can never be what the pioneers of amalgamation meant them to be. There is a further difficulty&mdash;whether it is peculiar to my particular area or whether it is universal, I do not know. We find considerable difficulty in getting the poor man's wife into the County Hospital for the period of her confinement.  We find it impossible in <Col N="1859" /> some cases.  Married women have actually been refused admission to the County Hospital&mdash;I am dealing now particularly with the destitute poor&mdash; on the ground that the County Home was the place for them.  I think there should be very definite and specific regulations on this question.  The poor man's wife should not be sent into the maternity department of the Co. Home, which is accommodating that other class of the community to which I have alluded.</P>
    <P>I think it is altogether unfair and that there should be very definite regulations on that matter and these regulations should be universal. There is another matter regarding the hospitals and homes in some areas that is causing a very serious hardship.  That is the extreme difficulty in getting cases requiring special surgical or medical treatment to a city hospital.  There does not appear to be any universal standard or uniform regulation regarding this matter.  I understand in certain counties if the dispensary doctor forms the opinion that a certain case is one requiring specialised treatment, surgical or medical, he can send such a case to a city hospital.  He cannot do that in the part of the country to which I belong.  The local government inspectors have actually insisted that cases should go into the county hospital first and that it is only through the county hospital or the county home that these cases could be sent to a specialist for treatment.  Anybody can see the obvious hardship and danger of having to send a case first to the county home or hospital in order to have it decided there whether special treatment is or is not necessary.  There are cases of very great urgency and delay is extremely dangerous.  There should be no restriction put on the dispensary medical officer any more than in the days of the British Local Government. He should be enabled to send these cases direct to Dublin when in his opinion it is necessary for the saving of life to do that.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that these restrictions have been put on.  I know that they have been put on by his inspectors, either with or without his <Col N="1860" /> knowledge or consent.  I do not see why admission tickets could not be issued to dispensary medical officers for the institutions that are on the prescribed lists in Dublin, Cork, Galway, and elsewhere, where there are lists of hospitals prescribed.  The medical officer could estimate the amount that people could afford to pay.  People who could not pay the ordinary current charges in a city hospital could contribute something.  I would like the Minister to look into this question and remove the restrictions that are being imposed, and that sometimes actually result in loss of life.  I do not want to go into the thing in greater detail, but I could give unpleasant details.</P>

      <P>If the matter does not receive attention as a result of this discussion, it will have to be brought more specifically to the notice of the Department. I think it will be agreed that it is an undoubted hardship to have to take people 30 or 40 miles to a county hospital, and, if they are seriously enough ill, to have to send them back over that ground in order to go to a city hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding sanitation in general, I dealt with some of the difficulties that <Col N="1861" /> we had to contend with in certain areas, and they apply, I think, to most urban areas throughout the Saorstát. It does not appear that there is any change of heart in the Department regarding these schemes.  I grant you that a considerable portion of the relief grant was allocated to that purpose, but until the difficulties are fully realised, and until it is recognised that the local rates cannot bear the cost of carrying out sewerage schemes, and that financial assistance must come in the form of grants to local bodies&mdash; until that is realised and acted upon there will not be any headway made. Deputy Brennan suggested that there should be a flat rate for sanitary purposes. There will be objection to that inasmuch as you would have people in a county figuring out how much the flat rate in their country would be, and they would probably claim that the money should be expended whether or not sanitary works or other works were required in the area.  The flat rate would be unworkable for several reasons.  There are geographical reasons, and some towns and districts would be more difficult to arrange schemes for than others.  It should be estimated what would be a reasonable amount of rates that a particular area should bear for sanitary works, and if there are peculiar features in a district that would render such schemes more expensive than under ordinary circumstances the extra expense involved could only be met in the form of grants.</P>
    <P>I did not take part in the discussion on vaccination, but there is one matter I would like to suggest.  In populous areas it would be advisable if the Minister would take steps to have a special day set aside in a dispensary for the purposes of vaccination.  I think a good deal of the hostility to vaccination is due to the fact that the mother and the child are kept waiting for hours before being attended to.  Probably the child may be hungry, and the mother might want to go away to get the husband's dinner.  She might, on the other hand hear harrowing details about vaccination, and that does not help her mentality.  It would be well then to devote one special day to vaccination alone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1862" /> In connection with grants for housing, the point has been laboured by various Deputies that that problem too will not be solved until long-term loans for housing are reverted to.  I just want to add my voice to that demand. I have not seen yet any adequate reason why grants for the reconstruction of houses should be confined to urban areas, and why the rural areas should not have the same financial facilities for reconstruction as have been given to dwellers in urban areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HASLETT</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage of the discussion on these Estimates it would not be very easy for any Deputy to say much that is new.  I think I can say this much anyhow, that we do not envy the Minister in trying to meet the different opinions put forward. Listening to the debate has been very interesting.  We find that human nature is much the same inside the House as outside the House, and that has been exemplified by each speaker who at the start of his speech urged the cutting down of expenditure, and before he sat down one was driven to the conclusion that the Minister would want to ask for a double grant to carry out what a particular Deputy needs to have done.  I think that in discussing this Estimate, or indeed any other Estimate, we have got to consider <Col N="1863" /> our resources and to see then to what extent those resources will let us travel in the carrying out of our ideas. There are a great many things that we could do privately as well as publicly if we had some unlimited store at our command.  But we must, at this stage, understand that if we are voting money here we have then to come and raise it by some means&mdash;taxation or otherwise. I think we are narrowed down in this discussion more or less to see what we can do effectively in the carrying out of those schemes that are before us at the moment or that are in existence.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of things on which I would like to touch very briefly.  The matter of the purchase of labourers' cottages has been mentioned and a good number of Deputies gave voice to the idea that they would be in favour of the purchase of labourers' cottages by the tenants now in possession of them. I just want to say that I would agree to that on one condition and that is that provision is made whereby these cottages would be kept in repair and remain an asset to the State which they undoubtedly are at present.  We know that these labourers' cottages were erected at a time when materials were cheap.  They were a great boon and a blessing to the country, and we would all like to see the labourer as well as the tenant farmer having a stake in the country and realising that there was something in the country that he could call his own.  We have also the other side of the case to look to and that is that the cottage must be maintained so that in the years to come it will not become derelict or untenanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the combined purchasing scheme the position is that none of us can take up any paper in which he will not read of some condemnation of that scheme.  It would not be in order I am sure, sir, to move the abolition of that Act now, nor, if it were, would I be inclined to do so.  I agree with the principle.  I have read very carefully through the regulations governing this scheme, and in my opinion it has not been made watertight enough.  There are a great many things in it that could well be improved.  It <Col N="1864" /> is only natural, and it is only human nature that the merchants in the towns in which these institutions are situated should feel hurt when they find they are not getting the supplying of the goods to these institutions, at perhaps their own terms, or that they are not getting a fair show.  But there is one regulation which I think we might suggest in the matter and that is in regard to the time at which the list of the articles is issued.  There is a regulation in most institutions that the 31st March is the end of the half year and it is the custom, I believe, that these lists do not come down until the 1st April.  The practice has been that the members of the local bodies meet and ask for local tenders.  They meet, say, a week or a fortnight before the 1st April, and the tenders have to lie over until the list comes down, and then the tenders are compared with the list.  I submit that there is a sense of injustice in those who are tendering that their tender must lie there until it is compared with the list.  I am not suggesting that there is anything in it.  I do not go the length that some do of saying that information is given.  That does not seem very probable or very possible.  But there is this much about it that it would be more businesslike if the list were brought out a fortnight earlier and have the arrangements made whereby that list would be at the meeting and so let the whole thing be compared at the one sitting and have it settled once and for all who was to get the contract.  Then there seems to be a laxity in the regulations providing for a return of the articles.  In that matter there is a laxity and there is general agreement that the ratepayers are not getting value for their money in the case of the articles supplied.  It may be that the articles supplied are not of a high enough standard or that a high enough standard is not asked for.  That may be the crux of the whole matter.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has been purchasing household goods knows that low-priced goods are not always the cheapest, and if the standard of these articles were raised perhaps better value would be got.  If you take the case of soap, tea, wool, and so on, it will be found that the institution should be allowed <Col N="1865" /> to buy the high standard article rather than the low-priced one.  In ordinary life, the individual when buying goods for himself will buy the higher-priced article; and we would be serving the interests of the ratepayers better and getting better value for our money if we were to do this too.  To my mind, it is sometimes a very grievous hardship on the inmates of an institution to supply them with say, tea of a poor quality.  When a cheap grade of tea is supplied to persons who by their presence in the hospital indicate that their stomachs are not in the condition to take the class of food that persons out in the open air and doing a hard day's work could take, it is not at all economical.  I heard a good deal of complaint on that particular aspect of the matter when we were discussing this matter on last year's Estimates. The Minister told us last year that in the matter of soap he estimated there was a saving of £660.  We all of us know that tallow crown soap can be got at any price.  We can get soap at any price, and that is called tallow crown soap.  The question is to get an article that will stand the test.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that there is a great deal to be done in the working out of details in connection with the combined purchasing scheme, so as to remove a great deal of this hardship complained of and to help towards getting better value for the money expended.</P>
    <P>In regard to the matter of the roads. I have just been wondering if any of us visit districts other than our own. Those of us who do will find that the first thing that impresses us is the state of the roads in that particular district.  If our roads are not maintained in excellent condition, then what should be a national asset&mdash; the fair name of our country&mdash;is imperilled.  If a reduction in the Estimate for roads means that we are to have less efficient roads, then that is a matter to which I would not like to give my support.  I now come to the question of the County Councils. The County Council elections have already been discussed in this House. These elections will soon be upon us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> There are many phases of that centralisation which I think could hardly be argued with benefit, but there was one thing in connection with it which a great many of us looked upon as a great boon and blessing, and that was, that the taking of the local appointments out of the hands of the local people relieves these men of a great deal of difficulty.  One regarded it as a fair bid for purer administration, as lifting the appointments to a higher level, and that when that was done these appointments would be made on merit alone.  It will be a great thing if it is engrained in the minds of young people that merit is the only thing that will count with them in after life. There have been a great many appointments made by the new method which have proved very satisfactory, but there is another danger which is very apparent and that is, that sometimes this duty is delegated to local people. I do not mind how high-minded, how pure, and how anxious to do what is fair and right people may be, it is not a fair position to put a local solicitor, doctor, or other person in, to make an appointment in his own parish.  It is bringing the thing down from the higher to the lower plane, if we take the appointment out of the hands of elected representatives and put it into the hands of nominees.  I do not suggest that these people are anxious for this duty, but they are asked to do a thing which must be repulsive to them in many ways, and which, no matter what they do, can hardly be defended.  I make these suggestions to the Minister with the view of making Local Government work more effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. CASSIDY Mr. CASSIDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CASSIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to direct the attention of the House to the urgency of the rural housing problem at present existing and to point out to the Minister the necessity for the erection of additional labourers' cottages, particularly in County Donegal.  The Labourers Acts conferred a blessing on agricultural labourers in the shape of suitable cottages at rents which their slender purses could afford, but good as these particular Acts were, we of the Labour Party believe that they only touch the fringe of the situation and that the rural housing problem is <Col N="1867" /> so acute as to call for immediate Government attention.  Under the Labourers Acts, we find that there were 42,189 cottages erected in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Out of that number I have learned that there are only 1,473 cottages in County Donegal. That being so, I claim, as far as that particular county is concerned, that it has not received its proper quota of cottages.  It would be no exaggeration to say that the small farmers and labourers in Donegal have set a headline which is worthy of emulation by other counties, because according to the agricultural statistics recently issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce we find that there is a greater percentage of land tilled in Donegal than in any other county. These figures prove that there is a large number of agricultural labourers engaged in that county, but when you come to compare the number of labourers' cottages in Donegal, say, with the number in County Dublin, where the percentage of land tilled is much smaller, you will find that Donegal is being very badly treated.  These figures, I think, prove the necessity for the erection of more cottages in that county.</P>
      <P>Cases have been brought to my notice where people in that county find it necessary to leave the district in which they have been reared, owing to the fact that they are not able to get proper housing accommodation.  Other cases have been brought to my notice where young couples getting married are unable to secure proper housing accommodation, and have to go into the towns and cities.  As far as some of the cottages there are concerned, and I am referring now principally to those not erected under the Labourers Acts, many of them are in a dilapidated and damp condition, and many are unfit for human habitation. In fact, many labourers there are so hard pressed that they are living in what might be termed huts, which are not fit for human habitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin pointed out to the Minister that it was a pity that the Department did not call for monthly reports from the medical officers of <Col N="1868" /> health in regard to the state of some houses and cottages in the country, and I should like to quote an extract from a letter which I have received from a medical man in Donegal in regard to the housing conditions among the labourers there.  He says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is, in my opinion, a great deficiency of labourers' cottages in County Donegal, and the position is aggravated by the inability to bring the majority of the very old thatched cottages up to the present high standard of sanitation.  Cases of overcrowding are very frequently met with and under the present conditions there is no satisfactory means of remedying the evil.  It is also a serious matter that young couples are hindered from marrying and residing in certain districts owing to the scarcity of houses.  In all parishes the cottages at present in existence are occupied and many overcrowded. There is no denying the fact that there is a great scarcity of cottages in the county.  There are numbers of houses unfit for human habitation, and the problem is urgent and deserving of Government or local authorities' attention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the opinion of a medical practitioner in Donegal in regard to the inadequacy of houses and the insanitary condition of a large number of houses there.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the situation that has to be looked into is the question of emigration.  Owing to the shortage of labourers' cottages, it is necessary for many labourers to emigrate either to America or very often as they do from the North-west to Scotland.  I may be going somewhat outside the terms of the discussion, but I am just doing this in order to point out to the Minister the absolute necessity that exists for further housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ward referred to the fact that part of the amount voted in connection with tuberculosis could possibly be better spent if it were devoted to improving the sanitary arrangements and I think he referred principally to the rural areas.  One of the difficulties in regard to housing <Col N="1869" /> for labourers, as the Minister knows very well, is that the labourer is not able to pay an economic rent for his cottage owing to the low wages he receives.  I should like to point out to the Minister that very much is being done to cope with this problem of rural housing in England.  Under the Wheatley scheme brought into force by the British Labour Party when they were in office a large amount is being done to secure proper housing in the rural areas.  Certain Government grants are given for the erection of labourers' cottages.  In the Six Counties, I understand they are at present erecting additional labourers' cottages at rents which the labourers can afford to pay.</P>

I also draw attention to the Committee set up by the House with reference to the question of unemployment.

I understand the Minister for Finance said when introducing the Budget that we could borrow as much money as we desired at a reasonably low rate of interest.

      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing this Vote made it clear that a sum of £900,000 voted for the assistance of house-building had been already allocated, and that the policy of the Government so far as house-building in the future is concerned would depend largely upon the success or otherwise of the conference sitting at present inquiring into the cost of house-building.  I am one of those who believe in having moral courage in dealing with a subject such as house-building. I believe that house-building at the present time is financially impossible at the rates prevailing.  You cannot build a house at the present time and let it at an economic rent. Let us assume the Government intend to build labourers' cottage at an average cost of £200 a cottage, which is very small; it is a minimum estimate. Everybody knows if you raise money you have got to pay at least 5 per cent., and in the absence of long-term loans I believe the period allowed for the repayment is something in the vicinity of 15 years.  That would practically amount, for principal and interest, to anything from £12 to £14 per annum, and allowing for incidental expenses, insurance and depreciation, it would be impossible to build a house at the present time that would cost £200 or £250 and let it at a less rent than seven or eight shillings a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have to face the facts.  No labourer can afford by any stretch of <Col N="1872" /> the imagination to pay seven or eight shillings a week.  This is a problem which will require the united efforts of all concerned so that they may tackle the question and provide decent houses for our citizens.  It is a question that has to be faced both by the builders and the operatives, by the people who lend the money and by all concerned. It is a big, broad question.  Everybody knows that proper housing is one of the most pressing problems of the day in all countries.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious that the Minister would explain what he really meant by saying that the policy of the Government so far as housing is concerned will largely depend on the findings of this Committee.  Am I to understand that assuming the builders and the operatives in Dublin city and county fail to agree, that the builders and the operatives in all the twenty-six counties will also fail to agree.  I do not think it is right that the Minister should make that statement, and practically confine his operations as far as house-building is concerned to whatever agreement the builders and the operatives in Dublin will come to as a result of their deliberations in this Committee.  I sincerely trust that the Committee will come to some solution of this most important problem.  One thing I say here is that we have all got to recognise that if we want to solve this problem our resources are limited. We cannot afford to have everything we want at the present time.  We will have to make some little sacrifice, and I believe if people would only face the facts at the present moment a great many of these problems that confront us could be satisfactorily solved.  In connection with the building of houses I would like to ask the Minister what steps have been taken to see that houses already erected, partly through the subsidy given by the Government and partly through the contribution of those erecting them, have been treated in the proper manner, that proper care has been taken to see that the floor levels are at least six or nine inches above the adjacent ground level.</P>
    <P>Care should be taken to see that there is a proper damp course from <Col N="1873" /> three to six inches above the line of the adjacent ground, because I think it would be very unwise to allow houses to be erected without any proper care or attention being bestowed on the materials used in their construction. Rheumatism, as far as I can learn, is on the increase and one of the causes is, I believe, damp houses.  I have seen houses erected in the Free State that have been passed by the inspectors of the Local Government Department, and without fear of contradiction I say these houses are not fit for the beasts of the field to live in.  I have seen material supposed to be gravel and sand, and one might as well go into a ploughed field, mix the earth there, and put it into the walls as some of the material I have seen passed by the officials of the Local Government Department. So much has been said about the Central Purchasing Committee that I feel rather slow in mentioning the matter at all, except to say to the Minister that I think he should scrap the whole thing and dispense with the Central Purchasing Committee.  It has been a source of annoyance and criticism throughout the Twenty-six Counties. Some of the strongest criticisms come from the supporters of the present Government, and, as has been stated here, several of the materials supplied to local councils through the Central Purchasing Department have not been up to the standard set by the advertisements covering these contracts. I had occasion to bring before the Minister the case of disinfectants supplied to the Grangegorman Asylum. Fifty per cent. of the fluid was supposed to be cresylic acid, and the fluid was only found to contain 12.2 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. COBURN Mr. COBURN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I put it down is that I understand the Minister <Col N="1874" /> is sympathetic as far as Irish manufacture is concerned.  The Dundalk Chemical Company, a local firm which is second to none as far as the quality of its products is concerned, was one of the firms which contracted for the supply of this fluid.  It was only when they received an order from the authorities in Dublin that they found out what was wrong, 12.2 as against 50.  There have been numerous complaints about the Central Purchasing Committee, and I think, for the interests of all concerned, this Department could very well be dispensed with.  Our representatives are not so dishonest as to vote away public money for nothing.  They invite contracts, and the local traders, owing to the slackness of trade, are very keen on contracting for those supplies.  There is very little to be gained by purchasing through the Central Department, and there have been great complaints with regard to the quality of this stuff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all I have to say, except to ask the Minister a question in connection with two official who were superannuated.  One was named Jeffers, and the superannuation allowed to him was very little, something like £12 a year.  As far as my information goes this official would be entitled to a gratuity of something like £200.  I think the Minister should reconsider this man's position and either give him this gratuity or increase his pension.  I am not in favour of granting pensions wholesale, but this is an exceptional case.  He was under the old regime and could have got the gratuity if he retired before the passing of the Act.  I hope the Minister will make clear to the House the policy he intends to pursue as far as grants for housing are concerned and, failing agreement between employers and operatives, that he will at least continue to give some little subsidy to those who wish to build their own houses.  I also wish to join in support of the appeal made by some Deputy that some scheme should be devised whereby tenants of labourers' cottages and houses in urban districts would be able to purchase their houses.  I understand very many districts are willing to purchase, and the only thing that seems to delay this question of purchase is the fact that <Col N="1875" /> there is no uniform scheme at hand for the moment.  I hope the Minister will give these most important points serious consideration.</P>

      <P>There is one matter I have been asked to bring under notice in connection with a road near where we are sitting.  Deputies are aware that Merrion Street has been laid anew, during the past few years, at very great expense.  I think the road cost something like 24/- a square yard. It seems strange that before undertaking expensive work like that the City Commissioners had not the foresight to notify the property owners that they ought to look after the supply pipes in connection with their dwellings. Immediately that expensive work is complete the property owners get notice that their pipes are in a bad condition. The result is that that road has been torn up in several places, and a much greater expense is imposed upon the property owners than if they got that notice before the road was put down.  I have no desire to make a general case against the Dublin Commissioners. I have not the knowledge even if I had the desire, but I think it shows an extraordinary lack of foresight that it should happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events I have done what I promised.  I have called attention to the matter, and I leave it at that.  There was one passage in the Minister's speech that was rather interesting.  He said that, generally speaking, the relations between his Department and public bodies are of the most satisfactory kind.  I am not quite sure whether that means what I call the ordinary statutory relations or whether the relations mean that headquarters are helping local bodies in the very big difficulties that are confronting most of them at present.  I think local government, since its establishment, was hardly ever in as difficult a position as it is at present.  The Minister admits that the amount of uncollectable rates tends to rise.  Apart from that, there is hardly a single council which is not finding it difficult to carry on and to meet demands for new services, etc., that are being placed upon them.  I would like particularly to know whether headquarters are endeavouring to help individual councils that are meeting with special difficulties. A number of these bodies have very special difficulties in some cases difficulties that seem almost insuperable. I have in mind, for instance, the position of Wicklow Urban Council. There you have a body where there is already £35,000 of an existing debt. They require immediately a sum of £6,000 for the improvement of waterworks. The repair of damage to the  last year which has to be remedied, will cost something like £19,000.  There is a malicious injury claim hanging over since 1920 of £840, and I think there are arrears of income tax amounting to £1,600&mdash;altogether a sum of £62,000.  In that town a penny in the £ brings in £25 a year.  I think in a case like that it is up to the Department to try to help the Council in some way or other, if only with advice. I hardly think advice would be enough in that case.  I think the problem is so <Col N="1877" /> great that it cannot be met without some special grant from the Central Fund or something of that kind, but at least one would not expect the Department to say that all these things are matters for the body itself.  Take the item of £19,000.  It has to be met, and will have to be met from some source to repair the foreshore.  It is not due to carelessness or inefficiency on the part of the Council.  It is due to the very bad storm that took place last year.  Again, the £840 for the malicious injury claim arose out of the political trouble in 1920 during the anti-conscription campaign.  I am emphasising this because of a reply given by the Minister for Finance when he said that he knew that the claim existed, but he was not aware that the Urban Council could not hope to meet it within a reasonable period of years, and that the Government was not prepared to take any responsibility for it.  It struck me that if that attitude expressed by the Minister for Finance is also the attitude of the Minister for Local Government, a lot of the public bodies in the country are going to have a very hard time, because without the skilled assistance of headquarters in adjusting their position at the present time numbers of them, so far as I can see, cannot possibly hope to carry on.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of talk about roads, and I would like to ask a few questions with regard to them. What strikes one in connection with this whole Estimate is the very meagre information given by the Minister.  We are asked in this Vote for the sum of practically £270,000.  In asking for that the Minister just gives information which amounts to five columns of the Official Report.  That does not seem very helpful to the Dáil when we consider that the Department deals with such important questions as housing, roads, public health, and a number of activities.  One would expect that the Minister would have a great deal more information to give us than is contained in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that as far as giving information is concerned the reports of the Department, that is the annual reports are not in ordinary swing, for the reason <Col N="1878" /> that for a long period no reports were issued.  The reports up to March, 1925, have been already published, and they contain a good deal of basic information in regard to the Department.  The reports for the two years ended March, 1927, are being put together and will be published at an early date.  So far as the information which the Deputy required is concerned, there is no limit to the amount of information he can get by the process of ordinary question and answer in the House.  I do not know that it is quite reasonable to expect that Ministers in introducing Estimates will make a speech that will mean an annual report.  There is a place for an annual report, and there is a place and a manner in which Deputies can get any information they want. The introduction of Estimates is in order to get criticism from the House, not in order to give the House what might be an annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister's statement will be regarded as satisfactory by those who have been following this matter.  Certainly we on this side of the House expected that in regard to each Estimate we would be given, as far as possible, a general picture of the Department and what it was doing&mdash;I do not mean a necessarily detailed picture, but how far the money that was being spent was having results, and what were and were not the changes that were contemplated.  In connection with the roads, for instance, there was not a Deputy in this House, I venture to say, apart from those on the Front Benches, could understand the state of road finances at the present time; certainly, judging by the Minister's statement and the short bit of information that is contained in the Official Report, it must be one of the most difficult matters, because although I have read particularly the financial remarks several times, I still cannot grasp what it is all about.</P>
      <P>In connection with that, there is the sum of £2,000,000 which the Minister, I think, said would be spent by the end of next October. He asks us to be satisfied, to wait for the annual report of the Local Government Department or something of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of information required.  It would take a great many questions to get from the Minister all that is required, if we are to take these Votes seriously at all. For instance, with regard to that £2,000,000 expenditure, I think he might have told us what the position will be next October, when that £2,000,000 will have been spent.  How many miles of road are now in a position to last under the traffic that comes their way, and for how long a period?  How far is that 1,500 miles that the £2,000,000 has been spent upon of uniform durability?  In a statement that appeared in the Press the other day from Mr. Quigley, the roads engineer, it was stated that some county surveyors were getting twice as good results as others for the same money.  I have the statement here:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Some surveyors are able to get work done nearly fifty per cent. cheaper than others.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very serious statement in itself.  The Government, since it came into office, has spent something like £4,000,000 on roads.  At the end of that period, and after all that money has been spent, the chief roads engineer comes along with a statement that some surveyors are able to get work done nearly fifty per cent. cheaper than others.  Assuredly the Minister should have a remark to make upon that. Assuredly he should have something to say as to what steps are to be taken to bring the worst of the surveyors up to the standard of the best.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same statement it is asserted that maintenance costs increase in inverse proportion to the cost of construction per mile.  We should like to know what the Government policy is to be in the future in this regard.  Again, there is the very important statement that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;asphaltic macadam costing £5,750 per mile requires no maintenance outlay for ten years, whereas tar <Col N="1880" /> bitumen macadam at £3,227 per mile, plus ten years' maintenance costs, at £300 per annum, involves an unnecessary and excessive expenditure of £500 per mile.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is correct, we would like to-know from the Minister if he proposes to take any action with a view to a completely new system of road-making. It can hardly be satisfactory to him or satisfactory to the country that these extraordinary anomalies, involving such very big sums of money, should exist at the present time. Again, those who have read the very serious statement made by the road surveyor for Sligo, at a conference here about a fortnight ago, will be desirous of more information on this subject. We have such statements as this occurring up and down that engineer's statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the years 1923 and 1926 the character of the traffic had entirely changed.  Previously, the iron-tyred slow traffic, which preponderated, helped to consolidate the newly-rolled surfaces, which, for the first year or two, actually continued to become harder and usually had a life of five years and upwards before becoming seriously potholed. Now the usual experience is that a new water-bound road is often as badly potholed after five months' wear as after five years' wear under former conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the Minister informed us that the great bulk of the roads are being made by water-bound macadam at the present time.  Again, talking about the £2,000,000 scheme, the same engineer remarks that &ldquo;a large part of the system&mdash;possibly one-half&mdash;cannot be expected to last the ten years without heavy re-surfacing.&rdquo;&ldquo;A large part of the system&rdquo;&mdash;we want to know why it could not have been arranged, in view of the long time that the scheme was being deliberated upon, that the work would be as well done as the engineering skill of the country could do it; why such a state of affairs was permitted that after the work is done an engineer, who is himself taking part in the scheme, should come forward and make a statement like <Col N="1881" /> that&mdash;that a large part of the system, possibly half, cannot be expected to last for ten years unless with heavy re-surfacing.  I think the Minister for Local Government, at the time the £2,000,000 was being discussed, stated that the aim was to make a road that would last ten years without any expensive maintenance.  That is the comment upon that by a man who is himself taking part in the scheme.  Again, you have this very serious remark in the same paper:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is to be regretted that in many counties the improvement of a small mileage of roads in the national road scheme has been followed by a marked deterioration in the roads outside the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a pretty grave state of affairs. It is exceedingly grave for the bulk of the ratepayers, because the average farmer-ratepayer is not using the trunk or main road at present.  He cannot use it.  His horses will not travel on it.  He is much more concerned with the state of the ordinary county road.  Yet, it is stated in this paper that at the same time that the improvement on the main road is going on, there is a marked deterioration in the roads outside the scheme.  Then, again, there is this general summing up of the position in another passage in the paper:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Work on the national road scheme is now nearing completion; in about four months nearly all counties will have finished their share.  The exact terms on which the £2,000,000 for this scheme was borrowed have not been disclosed, but the repayment figure of £310,000 per annum given in the newspaper reports appears to be too high.  Probably the actual annual repayment is about £250,000.  Adding to this £200,000 earmarked for the contribution to maintenance costs, there will be available for improvement only about £220,000.  This amount, £220,000, is barely sufficient for the annual surface dressing of the improved water-bound roads, which, in the absence of this treatment, would quickly go to pieces.  As the councils will not provide more funds, the prospect is that all improvement work must cease.  Already <Col N="1882" /> machinery is being made up and skilled staffs dispersed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In face of statements of that kind, we here are concerned to know where we are being led on this question of roads.  What is the position now with regard to the 6,500 miles of main roads, for instance, that have been left untouched by the national scheme?  Is a corresponding sum to be spent on them and are the results to be as unsatisfactory as, apparently, the results of this £2,000,000 scheme have been?  The engineer who read that paper remarks:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any considerable growth in the Road Fund with the present rates of motor licence duties is not to be expected. Local rates are high, and road authorities will certainly refuse to add to them for facilitating new forms of traffic.  The problem is a serious one and demands immediate attention, failing which we must look forward to an extensive breakdown in our road system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that all that requires a very thorough and plain statement from the Minister.  We have been told here, during the past week, that there is a Road Traffic Committee sitting at present&mdash;an Inter-Departmental Committee&mdash;and that when it reports we shall know more about the future of motor taxation and all that.</P>

      <P>I accept the correction. However, if that is not in suspense we should be told now.  What is the exact position?  How far are we committed to making these roads which cost over £7,000 per mile?  Or is it the opinion of the Government that we can afford up to 8,000 miles of these roads?  How far will the expense of building and maintaining such roads affect the other roads, up to 38,000 miles of them, and all of which are of concern to numbers of families?  In view of the lack of information as to a housing programme and a road programme, and in view of the meagre statement generally of the Minister, we are not satisfied that this <Col N="1883" /> Vote is being justified, and I for one cannot vote for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>In this debate there has been criticism, even from the Government Benches, in regard to the building of labourers' cottages.  The Minister suggested that it should be an economic undertaking.  Was it not the intention of the framers of the Labourers Acts that the building of cottages for the workers should be an economic problem?  Of course, we have the business element, which Deputy Lemass is so interested in bringing on the public boards at future elections. At present we have some of these business men, along with even Labour men, building houses for workers in urban centres that are not a business proposition. The valuations of some of the urban areas are so low that when we have to take into account the paying back of old loans there is not very much left for social purposes.  I would suggest to the Minister that what we require are long term loans that would enable public bodies to build houses that could be let at reasonable rents to agricultural workers.  In urban areas we have the business element on the public boards.  I know of one area where they are building a large number of houses for the workers, but no workman could pay the rents that are being demanded.  No workman could pay a rent of £1 or 25/- a week, or even 12/- a week, which is the rent in some cases. It may not be popular, but what I would suggest in order to solve the housing problem is that we should remodel our plans and build a smaller type of house to meet the requirements of people who are in receipt of low wages.  I agreed at the time with the intention of the Department that by building larger houses a certain number of ratepayers would avail of them and that the houses which they would leave would be available for the poorer people.  That was not the case in Bray where you have 300 houses which are only hovels housing large numbers of families.  I would suggest that we should build two-roomed or three-roomed houses.  They would be an improvement on our present position.  A large number of people can only afford <Col N="1884" /> to pay from 2/6 to 5/- a week instead of rents of from 10/- to £1 which are being charged at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Ward in regard to medical services.  I think that the Department should insist on a medical officer for every county being appointed. They should not be influenced by the whims of people who are out for economy regardless of the health or social point of view.  Complaint was made here that the Department do not sanction the sending by dispensary medical officers of surgical cases to Dublin.  That has not been my experience.  I have always been in favour of the amalgamation scheme, but I think certain amendments of it are required.  The geographical position of some counties necessitates the county hospitals being very long distances from particular areas but the building of district hospitals would get over that difficulty.  We are doing that in our county.  I am not aware of the Department being opposed to the sending of any cases to Dublin for surgical treatment.  I know that the County Wicklow Board of Health gave permission to dispensary doctors to send cases, but we found that certain doctors were sending every available case rather than travel three or four miles on a red ticket to treat patients themselves, and we decided to hold any dispensary doctor who would send a case that was not of real urgency liable.  But no case has ever been refused treatment.  I am sure that there could be an improvement in some of the county homes where the patients are huddled together. If what some of the Deputies state is true then we should go back and have Commissioners for every part of the country even though that is undemocratic and opposed to our policy.  I am glad that the state of affairs that was mentioned by some Deputies here does not exist in my area.  We have a county home governed by a Religious Order and no one has the slightest objection to going there in his old age.  We have over 100 patients there.  They take an interest in the land attached to the institution.  They till it and the proceeds are used in the hospitals to the benefit of the ratepayers and the patients there.  Deputy Alfred Byrne's complaint was that Dublin was not <Col N="1885" /> getting all the benefits of the grant, that the benefits were going to the country where the public representatives were putting Section 13 of the Local Government Act into operation.  Our whole experience is, and it is the reason we condemn the Government, that more grants are given where there are commissioners than to places where there are representative public bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a case for argument. Deputy Brennan and others suggested a certain area of charge for sanitary works and for waterworks.  I put it to the Minister that, if he makes such an order, he will be compelling places that have spent thousands of pounds in providing waterworks and sewerage to pay for Roscommon and other parts that have not been doing their duty.  I recognise the position of certain small villages where waterworks and sanitation are required.  We all agree to having an electoral area, but that area cannot be spread over the county, nor should the people in the urban areas have to pay for providing such works for small villages in rural areas, where, on the grounds of economy, they refused to provide it themselves.  Having said so much on that subject I want to come back to the question of road grants.  The County Wicklow is the playground for motorists and tourists, not only from the twenty-six counties, but from all parts of Ireland.  We have over £670,000 in motor taxes, and duties of thirty-three and a third on motor parts, and I hold that the whole of that money should be expended on roads in the Saorstát. There are about seven miles of what is called the main road leading into Arklow, over which I would advise the Minister not to travel in a Ford car when he is going to Wexford.  We have appealed and the county council has passed a resolution asking the Minister to receive a deputation with a view to giving a grant to repair that road.  A reply was received that we must wait until the autumn.  If we do very few cars will be able to pass over it.  The ratepayers in that area should not be expected to bear the whole of <Col N="1886" /> the cost of maintaining that road, considering, as I said, that County Wicklow is the playground for motorists from all parts of Ireland, who visit on account of the scenery there.  I would ask the Minister to take into account the peculiar position of County Wicklow.  A very small grant was received this year for the maintenance of trunk roads.  I do not agree that 30 per cent. is sufficient for the tarring of certain roads.  I would ask the Minister to make a special plea to the Roads Section of his Department before he travels down to Wexford, so that the public will be able to travel over that road without endangering their lives or injuring their motor cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked by the Committee of the Grangegorman Hospital to bring before the Dáil the fact that the Committee are willing to build a large number of houses for attendants.  As the committee does not come under the description of a housing authority, although they are a public authority within the meaning of the Act, they are prevented from receiving a grant or subsidy.  I would ask the Minister if the Act could be amended in any way, so that this public authority will be in a position to avail of it.  If they could, it would be a benefit to the people of Dublin and two or three hundred houses would be built for the attendants.  Deputy Moore has mentioned an area in Wicklow.  In the urban area during the Sinn Fein and Labour days, before there was a business council, a large sum of money was expended there in works of utility.  In 1921 they spent over £7,000 on waterworks. They now find that they will have to spend another £7,000.  Through no fault of the business council the foreshore has been washed away in Wicklow, and £20,000 worth of property is in danger owning to coast erosion.  If we go to the Minister for Local Government we will be told that he is not responsible, and the Minister for Finance will put it on to some other Department.  We want to find out what Department is likely to come to the assistance of the Wicklow Urban Council and to give them a good grant for the saving of property estimated to be worth £20,000.  The urban council <Col N="1887" /> the railway company and others are prepared to bear their proportion of the cost, but the Government are expected to give a substantial grant to carry out the necessary repairs.  I am sorry the Minister has taken a different attitude to that he adopted previously regarding good relations between the councils and his Department.  I agree that the Minister should not be asked to receive deputations who only want to pay a flying visit to Dublin without doing anything practical.  Where, however, a public body asks to see the Minister, in order to put before him concrete proposals and to receive his sanction, if he refuses to receive them, whatever good relationship existed between the Department and the public bodies will not continue if that policy is adopted.  I see that the estimate for lymph for vaccination has been increased. The estimate has been increased presumably in the belief that there will be a wholesale rush for vaccination.  I promise the Minister that if I can do anything in my area the whole amount will be spent on prosecutions.  While that amount has been increased, we see that the estimate for meals and other social services has been reduced.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with other Deputies when they make wholesale attacks on officials' salaries.  On public bodies we are all familiar with a lot of the clap-trap that goes on at certain times.  In my experience we find that the only thing men who are pledged to reduce officials' salaries when they get into power do is to reduce the workmen's wages and to increase the officials' salaries.  I hope that will not be the position with some people.  I would ask the Minister to receive a deputation in connection with the foreshore, the waterworks, and the Arklow road, and I can assure him that the interview will not be waste of time. Genuine proposals have been put before him, and those interested are prepared to bear a proportion of the expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1888" /> We are not satisfied that County Wicklow is receiving the amount it should receive in road grants this year. I disagree with the Minister, when, as I understand, he proposes out of the money that was borrowed some time ago for the repair of the roads, to set aside £250,000 this year as a sinking fund in order to repay the amount in four or five years.  The life of a road is supposed to be longer than four or five years.  I think in some cases it is up to seven or ten years.  If, instead of four or five years, the money was to be repaid in ten or fifteen years there would be a larger amount available for trunk and main roads.  Of course a large number of roads have been certified as main roads by the Engineering Department, but our position is that some of these roads should in reality be trunk roads.  Deputy Coburn made a complaint about the inspection of houses which are being built, and said that there was not enough of inspection.  In the case of the few houses being built in my area the complaint is that the inspectors are too severe, and that they are not as reasonable as they would be expected to be to encourage people.  That is a contrast of opinion with regard to the positions in the two areas.  I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of changing the Housing Act to enable the Grangegorman Committee to build three or four hundred houses for their workers; also to provide a long-term loan for agricultural workers' houses, and to arrange for a smaller type of house to solve the housing problem in the slum areas.  The Minister should also enable the public bodies to provide hospital treatment for tubercular patients and non-insured people. We have non-insured people in many counties that have no scheme in operation, and as a result the people will only come to the doctor when they are in an advanced stage and when very little can be done for them.  I agree with Deputy Ward that this treatment is not a cure, but if it is not, it is a sort of education to patients who are in a sanatorium for a certain time, so that when they go home they will not be the danger to the community that they were before they went in.</P>

      <P>The only other matter to which I wish to refer is child welfare. Constantly in the courts in the City of Dublin, especially in the Children's Court, case after case comes up&mdash; I am not criticising the police&mdash;where children are prosecuted for playing games in the streets.  They have no other place to play in, and they are brought before the court simply because of the danger to their lives from passing traffic.  I think that comes under the administration of the City, and therefore under the Local Government Department.  Playing grounds for the children should be provided.  I would suggest the opening of the parks &mdash;Merrion Square, Mountjoy Square, and any other of the parks that would be available, and having proper playgrounds for children in these districts. The question of housing has been raised, but I would like to mention it again, because the Commission on Housing seems to have put the people to sleep.  Apparently the great move of the Government is to get a Commission to draft something attractive, and people are so taken with it that when the time comes they forget to raise the question because they think that it will be dealt with later by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1891" /> We cannot go on the promises of the Government; we can only go on facts, and the facts, so far as my constituency is concerned, are that there are people who have no place to live in and who are being put out of their houses in the City of Waterford because the houses are not fit to live in.  At present at least eight hundred houses are required for the workers of the City of Waterford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryBroderick" hpid="Mr. H. BRODERICK Mr. H. BRODERICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. BRODERICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the question of housing and to the amount allowed in the Estimate for this purpose.  The Minister has reduced his Estimate this year, but I presume he has allotted as much as the local authorities will be able to avail of.  Taking into consideration the terms under which local authorities have to borrow money, they will not be able to build houses as they would like. I do know that local authorities are anxious to build houses for the workers if they could borrow money for fairly long terms, such as thirty-five or forty years.  A matter to which I wish to refer is one where Government Departments have handed over houses that are already built.  The Minister for Defence has handed over a number of houses to the Mullingar Town Commissioners, and these houses are in very bad repair.  The Commissioners have to borrow £3,500 to put them into repair, and to build a wall around them to cut them off from the military barracks. The Department that is responsible for handing over these thirty-six houses is charging a rent of £143 a year to the Commissioners for them.  To my mind that is an impossible rent.  The Commissioners will not be able to pay it and charge a reasonable rent to the people who will be occupying the houses.  They will have to pay back this £3,500 they are borrowing, and they have to pay 4½ per cent. on it. This makes it an impossible proposition. I suggest that the Minister should charge a nominal rent to the Town Commissioners for these houses, and at the end of fifteen years, when the £3,500 will be paid back, the rent could be increased if the Department so desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment it would be impossible <Col N="1892" /> to rent the houses to the workers in Mullingar at what would be an economic rent.  If the Department is to get £143 a year for the houses, and the local authorities have to pay back the money that was borrowed, they would have to charge from 8/- to 10/- a week rent for these houses.  No worker in Mullingar would be able to pay such a rent.</P>
    <P>As regards the roads.  I would remind the Minister that the amount allotted from the Road Fund for the maintenance of main roads in Westmeath this year is only £12,600.  That is only one-third of the amount allotted last year, and it is altogether too small for the upkeep of these roads. If the Minister will consider that many of these roads at the moment are being widened to carry bus traffic, he must, I think, admit that the amount allotted is altogether inadequate for the present year.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider the advisability of increasing the road grant for Westmeath this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenJordan" hpid="Mr. S. JORDAN Mr. S. JORDAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. JORDAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter which I wish to refer to, and I hope the Minister, when he is replying, will definitely state his policy in regard to it.  I do not propose covering the ground that several Deputies have already passed over.  Most Deputies dealt with questions relating to sewerage schemes, public health administration, etc.  I presume that in Galway, where I come from, the local bodies there will make the necessary application and try to get these benefits for the people in that country.  There is one matter in connection with road work that has not been dealt with by any Deputy, and to which I desire to refer.  I hope the Minister for Local Government, when replying, will be a little bit more clear on it than the Minister for Finance was when I asked a question some time ago. It was mentioned in the House to-day that the Government had withdrawn the order as regards the wage clause that accompanies road grants to the different counties.  To some of us that was a big surprise.  We thought that the clause relating to 29/- a week wage was still inserted, and that it accompanied the grants given to the different <Col N="1893" /> councils.  There is one other clause inserted that is most objectionable, and that is as regards giving preferential treatment to ex-National Army men. Some time ago, when I raised that question here, the Minister for Finance told me that it was not of such an alarming extent as the Deputy thought.</P>

      <P>On that occasion, in attempting to answer the Minister for Finance, I was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, but I presume I am quite in order in discussing it now.  The Minister for Finance said that it was not of such an alarming extent as the Deputy thought.  I was going to cite an instance where the privilege was very much abused, but I was not allowed to do so.  I will do so now for the edification of the Minister for Finance and of the House generally. Road work opened in Athenry on a trunk road.  The clause came down with the grant for the work that preferential treatment should be meted out to ex-National Army men.  The result was that there were nine men wanted. There were five ex-National Army men employed and four ex- anything you like.  The five ex-National Army men were working for three days when the hay saving season arrived on the land of the Department of Agriculture at the other side of the town.  The wage paid by the Department was 45/- a week. Three ex-National Army men pitched the road job as they said themselves, and went over to work for the Department of Agriculture at 45/- a week. Three civilians took their places working on the trunk road.  They worked there for a fortnight.  When the hay saving finished with the Department, the three ex-National Army men returned to the road work and made the demand to the ganger that the civilians in their places should be sacked and that they should be given back their jobs.  If that was not abusing the preferential clause I do not know what an abuse of it would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is just one instance in regard to that.  There were other instances, but I am not going to delay the House reciting them.  I hold that while such <Col N="1894" /> conditions as I have quoted exist this preferential clause should be done away with.  When the unemployment debate was on here some time ago Deputies from all parts of the House were unanimously of the opinion that distress was universal throughout the country.  That distress still exists. When the ratepayers' money, that is collected irrespective of what a man's politics is, is being collected, the collector does not say to a particular individual, &ldquo;well if he is a republican we will not ask him to pay his rates.&rdquo; They take his money and it is spent on ex-National Army men in preference to any other body.  We pay our way the same as other people, and when money is being spent we want our people to get the earning of it, irrespective of what a person's politics is.  That should be the rule.  I hope that the Minister for Local Government, when replying, will state definitely whether or not this preferential clause will be withdrawn as regards any moneys that are being sent down the country.  I hope he will be a bit more explicit in dealing with the matter than the Minister for Finance was some time ago when I raised the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. CONNOLLY Mr. CONNOLLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOLLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Department of Local Government is one of the most elaborate of our Government institutions, and one that is very difficult to deal with.  It has control over all sorts of institutions.  The Department has made a noble effort to deal with the many questions that have come before it from time to time.  In making that effort.  I do not think that the Department, in all cases, has been met in a reasonable spirit by county councils or by urban councils.  Many schemes have been put up by county councils.  The Department has given sanction to them in most cases.  In others they returned the schemes to the local bodies and asked them to put up something reasonable.  The local bodies failed hopelessly to do it, or to discharge their obligations to the people they represent.  When they did fail in that respect, I do not think Deputies should come here and charge the Government with offences that they are not guilty of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy on the other side the other <Col N="1895" /> day charged the Local Government Department with not being honest.  He mentioned a case where he said a certain amount of rates were not being collected that could be collected.  He further stated that the rate-collector of the district to which he was referring told him that if he was given a reasonable opportunity he could have collected £800 out of £900 outstanding. The Deputy who made that statement is a representative of the council for which the rate collector acts.  I think before a statement like that is made it should be thoroughly investigated. From my knowledge of the conditions in that county it would be utterly impossible to collect the rates.  If the Deputy who represents that county stated the facts fairly and squarely he would state that if the collector went out to collect these rates he would be compelled to seize the last cow or the last article in the possession of those people, owing to the fact that last year they suffered very severely from the visitation of the fluke.  I do not think it is good enough for a Deputy to come to this House and charge the Government with something which he knows not to be an absolute fact.  Whether a Deputy is on the Opposition or the Government Benches he is equally responsible for the better government of the country, and that is a fact he should recognise.</P>
    <P>I would call attention to the difficulties experienced by some counties owing to the enormous bus traffic.  It would particularly refer to Longford county.  The town of Longford is the main artery for the North, West and South of Ireland.  It is a radiating point for traffic.  At present as many as 54 buses pass through the town, and the reason is that the nearest point of vantage for crossing the Shannon into the West of Ireland is Athlone, which is 26 miles from the nearest bridge in the county of Longford&mdash;that would be Lanesborough.  The next main crossing on the Shannon is Tarmonbarry, and that is six miles from Lanesborough.  The nearest to Tarmonbarry is Carrick-on-Shannon, which is a distance of about 14 miles away.  All buses leaving Dublin for the West of <Col N="1896" /> Ireland pass through Longford County, with the exception of those going South-West to Galway.  As I have stated, 54 buses pass through the town of Longford, and I understand it is the intention of the I.O.C. Company to put on an additional four buses. Buses from Dublin going to the West pass through Longford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. CONNOLLY Mr. CONNOLLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOLLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  Having regard to the volume of traffic passing through Longford, the amount allowed for road maintenance is altogether inadequate, being only £4,890, the smallest allotment to any county in the Saorstát, though we have the largest amount of traffic passing through any county, as Longford town is really a junction for the North, South, East and West.  Longford is entitled to a reasonable contribution for road maintenance.  I might say there is scarcely one of these buses registered in the county of Longford. I exhort the Minister to review this allocation of money and to see that Longford gets a reasonable share.  If that is not done the county council will be compelled to close some of the roads.  It is not possible for a small county to bear such a strain as is imposed on it, as there is not the rate-paying ability to maintain the highways for this enormous traffic.  With regard to housing, so far as Longford is concerned the conditions are pretty acute.  We made applications for and received loans.  We were met favourably and we succeeded in getting our houses built at a reasonable sum, which enabled us to let them at a reasonable rent.  Still we have not sufficient houses to meet the demands for them that exist.  The difficulty in the matter of housing is the short term loans.  I think it is a matter of general importance that long term loans should be given to the county councils to enable them to let houses at a rent of from 4/- to 5/- per week.  That should be the maximum rent in country towns for the working classes who cannot earn more than 25/- or 30/- a week.  I <Col N="1897" /> consider something should be done in the direction I have indicated.  I think if the representatives of the various parties here appointed a committee to go into the question of housing schemes for towns with a population of from 500 to 1,000, and also for cities and towns with a population of from 5,000 to 10,000, I am sure they would be able to formulate a programme for submission to the Minister that would be fair and reasonable.  Another matter to which I wish to call attention is the question of county hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOLLY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a sufficient number of hospitals in various counties, and as a consequence great hardship is imposed on people.  Some of them have to travel long distances of from 20 to 40 miles to get to these county hospitals, and they are not able to bear the expense of these journeys. In many cases it means that there has to be a local ambulance.  I suggest the workhouses that have gone derelictought to be given over to the counties, and that there should be a recommendation from the Minister for Local Government to have them apportioned so as to provide hospitals where they formerly were.  I think if dispensary doctors were placed in charge of such county hospitals that would relieve a great deal of the hardship that exists in many counties.  I am of opinion that disused workhouses should not be handed over as dwellings for poor people.  I think that is highly undesirable, because in these workhouses there is no proper sanitation or accommodation, and the conditions are not conducive to health and comfort.  While the existing conditions prevail there is great risk of disease breaking out in these workhouses.  In conclusion, I renew my appeal to the Minister for Local Government that in the allocation of grants for road maintenance more consideration should be given to the claims of Longford.</P>

      <P>The following amendment in my name is on the order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the question of granting leave for the presentation of a petition, purporting to be prepared in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution, be not further considered until the Oireachtas has prescribed the procedure to be adopted for the presentation of the petitions contemplated in Article 48 of the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I daresay I am not giving you, sir, or perhaps any Deputy in the House, any information when I say that I was extremely interested when I saw Deputy de Valera's motion on the paper.  I saw, of course, that the motion introduced many difficulties, and, no doubt, there were many others that I did not perceive.  As to which difficulties we should come up directly against, I could not foresee at the time.  As the debate proceeded, I saw more clearly many of those difficulties.  I think it was only when I heard of the amendment that the Labour Party had thought of submitting to the House, and heard the terms of that amendment, that I began, as I thought, to see clearly the way in which the House ought to proceed.  The reason why I thought I clearly saw the right course, I hope to give a little later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, with the permission of the House, if I can, to try to follow my own lines of thought throughout the whole debate.  Deputy O'Connell stated. I thought in an exceedingly admirable <Col N="1899" /> way, my thoughts in connection at first with this subject.  With much of what he said I found myself in complete agreement.  My first impression, in fact, was that this motion indicated a wish and an intention to proceed on constitutional lines and in a constitutional way.  With Deputy O'Connell I, as a supporter of constitutional government, am strongly of opinion that constitutional action, when taken in constitutional way, should be supported, and must be supported, by all who support constitutional government at all.  So long as that action is taken under an Article of the Constitution and is taken in a constitutional manner, it seems to me it must command support, and so far I am in entire agreement with Deputy O'Connell.  But I do not think that I have heard put forward by any of the speakers on this motion any contrary view.  So far as I have heard the opinions of the Independents expressed, Deputies with whom I am, perhaps, most in contact, it seemed to me that in this connection the position could be clearly stated in very few words; that so long as Article 48 is an Article of the Constitution, a constitutional operation of that Article cannot with reason be opposed by all who support constitutional government.  But again I say that I do not think I have heard that proposition contested by any of the speakers on this motion.  I think it ought to be regarded by all parts of the House as incontrovertible. Perhaps in stating the matter thus, I lay more stress on the words &ldquo;constitutional operation&rdquo; than has been formerly laid by previous speakers, and perhaps more than would be laid by various members of the House, even by some Independents.  It seems to me, however, that such operations of the Article must be in all their points constitutional.  It must carry out the express action that is laid down in that Article; it must carry it out in the method indicated in that Article and by the steps indicated by that Article.</P>
    <P>I think it was here that I began to diverge from Deputy O'Connell.  I do not think in a matter of this kind that <Col N="1900" /> we can pick and choose between what is important in the Constitution and what is not important.  If we wish to attempt to do a thing we have to do it constitutionally if it is under the Constitution, and to adopt a constitutional method of doing it, and constitutional steps for doing it.  In legal matters technical procedure is important.  If we depart from it we open the door to difficulties and dangers, and I cannot, with Deputy Lemass, be partly or slightly constitutional.  I think when once we depart from the constitutional line we become unconstitutional, and I do not think it is possible in such matters to say that one thing is important and that another is unimportant.</P>
    <P>The House will bear with me when I ask them to follow my analysis of Article 48.  I take four leading points in it.  The first sentence I regard as important though the time for its operation has elapsed.  It is important because it gives a clear definition of what the Initiative is intended for.  It is the initiation by the people of proposals for laws&mdash;I put in the word &ldquo;proposals&rdquo; for clearness&mdash;or proposals for constitutional amendments. If I were trying to make a case, which I hope I shall never have to do, before lawyers, I might be disposed to argue about the phrase &ldquo;constitutional amendments.&rdquo;  I do not wish to make any point of it here.  I am willing to take that in the way I think it is taken by the proposer of the motion.  I take it to mean amendments of the Constitution. It then refers to the initiation by the people of proposals for laws or proposals for amendments of the Constitution. That is all that I gain from the first sentence&mdash;the definition of what is meant by the Initiative.  Then I come to what I regard as the second point in the Article, and that is the petition.  I want Deputies to be absolutely clear as to what is meant by the petition. &ldquo;Should the Oireachtas fail to make such provision within two years, it shall on the petition of not less than ...&rdquo; formulate provisions for the Initiative or submit the question by means of a Referendum to the people.  The petition is merely to compel the Oireachtas to formulate proposals for the carrying <Col N="1901" /> out of the Initiative, or to take the other alternative&mdash;consult the people about it.  The petition refers to nothing else.  It is simply a petition for the formulation of provisions by which the Initiative can be worked, and if the Oireachtas does not choose to formulate those provisions it must take, as I understand the Article, the opinion of the people by means of a Referendum as to whether or not they wish the Initiative to be introduced.  I think it is a very important point.  The petition is only a petition to set that going.</P>
    <P>Then we come to what I regard as the third point in the Article.  That is, after the petition has been presented, the Oireachtas either does make such provisions for the working of the Initiative or it takes a Referendum of the people on the matter.</P>
    <P>It is only then, after that has been determined&mdash;we will suppose determined in favour of the Initiative&mdash;then and only then does the question arise of proposals for legislation which are not important for us to-day.  Looking at Deputy de Valera's motion, it seems to me that he has slurred over the various distinctions which I have tried to make clear as appearing, to my mind, to be contained in that Article; and that he has in this motion more or less merged together all the different steps which are indicated in that Article, even to the extent of specifying one particular proposal for the amendment of the Constitution, which I take it he hopes to introduce by means of this Initiative. I think it is that which has led to what it seems to me to be a great deal of confusion in the debate that followed.  I do not think it is any wonder.  In such a matter the only hope of proceeding properly is to proceed step by step.  The fact that all these things are more or less brought together in this motion would seem to me to be largely responsible for the diversity of opinion which has been expressed about this motion from the various sides of the House.  To such an extent was that the case that I think &mdash;and I hope I am not misunderstanding him&mdash;that one Deputy went the length of thinking that if the motion were passed, the Oireachtas would not only be bound to formulate a provision <Col N="1902" /> for the carrying out of the Initiative, but that the Initiative could be at once applied by bringing forward a particular amendment which was indicated not in the motion, but in the speech of the proposer.</P>
    <P>It was only when the motion was itself followed by the speech explanatory of it and the debate that followed, that the different points were raised and brought home to my mind.  As you said, sir, after the speech in which the motion was introduced, a general discussion became inevitable.  Different points were raised, and though I hope to base my case for the amendment on a very much more restricted line of argument, I hope the House will bear with me if I make a few remarks about the general points that have been raised in that discussion.  I do not think I could very easily avoid it.  The first point definitely to my mind that arose was, I think, a legal point.  As such I do not presume, as a layman, to think that I am offering an opinion of any value.  I can only state my own opinion as it seemed to be brought home to myself.  It seemed to me perfectly clear that the petition considered in the Article is merely a petition that the Oireachtas shall formulate provisions; for this petition, as explained by Deputy de Valera, is a complicated petition.  It included that provision, but it included more, and it is a legal question as to whether the inclusion of more did or did not vitiate the whole thing.  To my mind&mdash;I may be wrong &mdash;the argument that many of the signatures to the petition might have been obtained, might have been put to that petition, because the signatory wanted a particular amendment that Deputy de Valera wanted, and wanted it very badly, and therefore signed quite independent of what he thought about the formulation of the provisions altogether; that that argument was sufficient, and would be sufficient in a court of law, to vitiate the whole petition. That is only my opinion.  I do not pretend that it can be of any value at all to anybody else, but I give it as my opinion.  I have often told the House that I make no claim in matters of law to be anything but a mere layman.</P>
    <P>But the next difficulty was a still <Col N="1903" /> larger difficulty.  It was a difficulty as to whether it was possible to make use of an Article of the Constitution practically to subvert the Constitution; to introduce, as I think I had better call it, directly to introduce under an Article of the Constitution, an anti-Treaty amendment.  Now, that is the big difficulty which has been raised by this motion of Deputy de Valera's.  It immediately raises the question: What is the Constitution?  The Constitution consists of a series of Articles given in certain pages of the book I have before me here.  Those Articles are a schedule to an Act, the first schedule to an Act, and those Articles only have validity because of that Act.  They are given validity by Section 1 of the Constitution Act, and they are limited and controlled by Section 2 of that same Act. It is impossible to consider the Constitution as having validity at all apart from the Constitution Act, which gives it force.</P>
    <P>It may be for academic purposes an excellent study in Irish and English literature, or how to pass from one to the other.  But apart from the Constitution Act, the Constitution as specified in these pages of this Book in my hand has no meaning at all and no force at all.  It is impossible to consider it apart.  It has validity because of Section 1 of that Act, and it is limited and controlled by Section 2 of that Act, and Section 2 of that Act specifically states that &ldquo;if any provision of the said Constitution, or if any amendment thereof, or of any law made thereunder, is in any respect repugnant to any of the provisions of the Scheduled Treaty, it shall, to the extent only of such repugnancy, be absolutely void and inoperative.</P>
    <P>Now how under any Article of the Constitution which takes its force under that Act and which is controlled by that section could it be possible to introduce an amendment to that Constitution which is repugnant to the Constitution?  Or, putting the difficulty in another way, even if that amendment of the Constitution were carried by the Referendum, how can that amendment to the Constitution have any force whatever in view of the fact <Col N="1904" /> that it is controlled by that Section 2, which states that, in so far as it is contrary to the Treaty, it is void and inoperative? It seems to me to be perfectly clear that under the Constitution, by an Article of the Constitution, it would be utterly impossible to go contrary to the Treaty, or to break up the Constitution itself, which is what going contrary to it would do.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that if the Oireachtas were to set about the formulation of proposals for the Initiative it would be bound in the formulation to make such provisions as would make it impossible to introduce under the Initiative any amendment which would be contrary to the terms of the Treaty. I suggest that the formulation of those provisions necessarily involves the setting up of some scheme, some method, some plan, by which proposed amendments to the Constitution would have to be tested and sifted, whether it were done by the Judiciary or any other way that may be thought of. Some such sifting would be necessary in order to prevent the Initiative being set in motion to introduce an anti-Treaty amendment.  Whether that could be done is quite another matter, but it seems to me to be absolutely clear that those who want to bring about a change in the Treaty could not hope to proceed by means of the Initiative&mdash;that the only way in which such a change could be introduced would be by the direct method, by attacking the Treaty through the Government, by an Act of the Oireachtas declaring that we are no longer going to be bound by the terms of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>May I digress for a moment at the risk of being out of order, at the risk of speaking absolutely in vain?  May I appeal&mdash;and I wish that I could speak not as a plain matter-of-fact speaker, but with the eloquence which many Deputies have at their command&mdash;not alone to Deputies, but, in so far as my words are reported, to the country, for a cessation for a time at least of this anti-Treaty agitation.  It is true no doubt&mdash;I put the best interpretation on it&mdash;that that will mean for many the holding up of the fulfilment of ideals that they hold dear, but, if so, did not <Col N="1905" /> the acceptance of the Treaty mean for many the giving up of their views, their hopes, their ideals, too, and they sacrificed those in order that they might join with the majority of their countrymen in the hope that a measure of unity might be attained and that all together might work to bring peace and prosperity to the country.  I think those who made sacrifices, and they were sacrifices, have loyally attempted to carry out what they set out to do. They have co-operated, they have done all that in them lay to make that cooperation effective, and to support all attempts to bring prosperity and peace to the country.</P>

      <P>They have attempted to bring that peace by stages and by seeking unity.  Is it worth while to take away the plank on which such a measure of unity has been attained? Is it worth while to put everything into the melting-pot again, to set even those who have joined together adrift, to bring us back to the stage when we were all taking different lines?  Are there not enough things calling for us all to join together?  Are there not hundreds of problems waiting for us to attack and work at?  Are there not unemployed calling for us to do something to give them employment?  Are there not thousands living in dwellings who appeal to us to put our brains to work to see how we can make things better for them instead of wasting time?  I do not use &ldquo;wasting&rdquo; in the sense of saying anything which will hurt anybody's feelings in the matter. After all, these theoretic points are theoretic points and they are not getting at what is really calling us to work.  There are hundreds of things which we might be working our brains at.  Can we not, for a time at any rate, set aside further talk about the Treaty?  Can we not get to work? What good will it do?  Put everything, as I say, into the melting pot, smash hopes of unity throughout the country. Can we not try and work for unity everywhere in the country and get one country and see how things work?  I apologise for this digression, as I know I am out of order.  Perhaps I am <Col N="1906" /> too optimistic in hoping that even at the eleventh hour some such thought may prevail, and that it may seem to us all that it is more patriotic to put aside our hopes of satisfying all our ideals, more patriotic to see if we cannot work on better terms together, and try and do things that are urgently wanted throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I come back to the point on which I was speaking, and that is, how can an attempt be made under the Constitution to wreck the whole Constitution, because that is what such an amendment to the Constitution as that which was mentioned by Deputy de Valera would inevitably do.  It is quite clear to me that the way to do that is not under Article 48, but if the determination to proceed on these lines is adhered to, the only way to do it&mdash;the only way to do it by which we can keep our self-respect, at any rate&mdash;is to go straight for the Treaty itself, and see if we are prepared to abandon that Treaty.</P>
      <P>I wish to come really into touch now with the amendment of which I have given notice.  In that amendment I confined myself to very much narrower limits than those within which the debate has hitherto been confined.  I have indicated the various steps which Article 48 seems to me to show are the necessary steps if we wish to bring about action under the Initiative.  My amendment simply confines itself to the first step.  As I have said, if we want to proceed clearly and constitutionally, we must only go one step at a time. My amendment confines itself to the first step, that is, the presentation of the petition.  It seems to me that if a petition to formulate provisions for the Initiative is prepared and presented constitutionally, Deputy de Valera's motion is quite unnecessary, and the passing of his motion would not lead us one whit nearer, whether the petition had been prepared and presented constitutionally or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we all, or many of us, at any rate, hold very diverse views as to whether it was or not.  I cannot say that I have any view at all on that matter.  I do not know whether it was or not.  I think you yourself, A Chinn Comhairle, said that you were unable to say whether the petition had been prepared and presented in accordance <Col N="1907" /> with the Constitution.  I go so far as to say that nobody can say with certainty, because until it is laid down what is the constitutional way to prepare and present a petition&mdash;and that can only be determined by the Oireachtas&mdash;until that is done, nobody can say whether the petition was prepared in accordance with the Constitution or whether it was not.</P>
    <P>Now the words of my amendment differ from the words of Deputy de Valera's amendment intentionally, but not in a depreciating way.  Deputy de Valera refers to an amendment prepared in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution.  I do not question his belief that it is so prepared, but I submit that that is not enough for a parliament.  There must be some way in which Parliament can judge as to whether it has been prepared in accordance with the Article or not.  The only way in which it can be said to be prepared and presented constitutionally is when the Oireachtas itself has determined how it is to be prepared and how it is to be presented, to whom it is to be presented, on behalf of the Oireachtas, because the whole Article deals with the Oireachtas&mdash;the presentation of the petition to the Oireachtas, the act of the Oireachtas, formulating provisions for legislation by the Oireachtas&mdash;and until that is laid down I say it is impossible to say even if the motion is passed whether we are a bit nearer or not.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be perfectly clear and a thing that ought to commend itself to every Deputy in the House, whether he wants to proceed with this measure for the Initiative or not, is that so long as Article 48 remains in the Constitution, and it refers to the presentation of a petition, that the first thing to do is for the Oireachtas to determine how that petition is to be presented, to lay down what is the constitutional and proper way to do it. And, accordingly, I have put down as a substantive motion that the House should proceed to get advice from a Joint Committee of the Dáil and the Seanad as to what that Committee thinks is the right method to adopt for the proper presentation of such a petition. That is my case for the amendment. <Col N="1908" /> I contend that the passing of the motion itself will not advance us.  There will be no other way of saying afterwards whether this is constitutional or whether it is not.  What we ought to do is proceed by proper steps and determine first what is the constitutional way of preparing a petition.  It might easily be that when a proper method is established that that method would require supervision for the preparation of a petition from the very start, and not alone an inquiry into it when the position has been obtained.  It might require that we should have signatures obtained to it under proper attestation to be accepted by the Oireachtas as satisfactory proof of the genuineness of the signatures.  But I contend it is quite clear that the first thing we ought to do is to make up our minds as to how we want a petition to be presented to the Oireachtas and how it can be presented.  I do not think I am quibbling in the least.  I contend it is an essential feature of the Article that every bit of constitutional procedure is essential, and we must be careful in carrying out any Article of the Constitution that we follow it with meticulous care through all its steps if we wish to be constitutional.  I beg to move that Deputy de Valera's motion be amended in the way in which I suggest, in the amendment on the paper in my name.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who moved the main question has a right to conclude on that question, but if an amendment is proposed and the amendment is carried the Deputy who moved on the main question has, I think, lost his right to conclude the debate.  As a matter of practice the Deputy who moves the main question, under procedure of this kind, should always have an opportunity of speaking on the amendment, and it has been found the practicable method to allow that Deputy, by agreement, to conclude the debate.  I suggested that procedure already.  I think, in another case.  I have no objection to it in this case.  On the amendment before the <Col N="1909" /> House, the Chair will tend to prefer Deputies who have not already spoken, with the proviso that the Deputy who moved the main question must be allowed to speak before the matter is brought to a conclusion.  I think, if there is no objection, he may be allowed to conclude the debate on the amendment itself.</P>

      <P>I hesitated to rise to support Deputy Thrift's amendment because I happen to be an Independent Deputy, holding views perhaps in 99 per cent. of cases different from those held by Deputy Thrift, but in this one instance of one per cent.  I find myself in total agreement with the arguments he has put forward in support of his amendment.  First of all, I welcome this amendment as bringing the House back to a sense of its dignity in dealing with an exceedingly large and important question&mdash;the question of the Constitution of the Irish Free State.  I heard a good many speeches upon this motion, and for a time, I should say, I had made up my mind to vote in favour of it.  (A Deputy: Why change?) Deputies laugh and ask me why change.  I shall tell them why I changed.  It is because I was elected an Independent member of the House to change my mind if I like and not to have somebody else making it up for me.  I belong to the peculiar type of politician who tries to make up his own mind after having appealed to the electors.  They said to me: &ldquo;We put our case in your hands to act on our behalf and we believe you will act straight,&rdquo; and I am trying to act straight on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to be led off the path of straightness.  When I was interrupted I spoke of the dignity of the House, and also of the fact that up to a point I was entirely with Deputy de Valera in his motion.  Nobody could find fault with Deputy de Valera's motion that leave be given to present a petition prepared in accordance with the provisions of Article 48 of the Constitution. I do not want to prolong this debate, except to adopt almost every word that Deputy Thrift has used in connection with this question of the petition.  There are many legal <Col N="1910" /> aspects of it, and the ordinary layman will find himself in a maze of legal difficulties. I will not attempt to extricate myself from them at the moment.  I think the House is also in a difficulty. I find in dealing with this motion that we have had put on by one side the constitutional smashing of the Constitution and by the other the constitutional misuse of the Constitution.  That is not a position, I think, which should be taken up either by the Opposition or Government benches.  If those of us who believe we have a Constitution are really serious, and if we want to amend it, we are not going to amend it by tricks or quibbles.  One side said that this was a quibble; the other say it is a trick.  We want to do it in a dignified way, which will appeal not so much as a debating point here, but which will appeal to those we are representing, and we will see that the Constitution is not to be broken by tricks or quibbles.</P>
    <P>There is very little else I want to say.  I could say a great deal, and I, with Deputy Thrift, do not wish to take this opportunity of scoring a point off the Opposition or off the Government, but I unite with him in making a plea that if we are serious in doing anything for the country, there is a constitutional way of doing everything. There is even a constitutional way, as Deputy de Valera has found out, for breaking the Constitution.  I am not out to break the Constitution. I would ask the House to deal with this matter by leaving it over until such time as the machinery is put into operation for dealing with Article 48 of the Constitution, whether it be right or wrong.  I express no opinion whatever as to whether the Initiative or Referendum is a good thing, but, right or wrong, there is a way of dealing with Article 48 of the Constitution, and that is by adopting the amendment which Deputy Thrift put before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. HUGH LAW Mr. HUGH LAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGH LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that the Government will see its way to accept the amendment Deputy Thrift has put before the House.  I think he offers us a dignified, proper and right course among many conflicting interests and different courses which we might take. <Col N="1911" /> I say quite frankly that I do not think it would have been sufficient to have based our opposition to Deputy de Valera's motion on the grounds put forward by the President or some other members of the Front Bench.  I say it for this reason, not because I think those grounds to be wrong, not that I think they were put forward in error or bad faith, but because, in my judgment, they were somewhat too narnow for popular understanding.  It may be that there is something in the distinction which the President drew between the presentation of a petition to the Dáil and the presentation of a petition to the Oireachtas.  It may be there was substance in the point raised by the Minister for Defence&mdash;I think there was&mdash;that the petition should relate to one clear point and not to two points. At any rate, if we had before us no other choice than the one put forward by the Minister for Agriculture, I, for one, would have been prepared to adopt the line he recommended.  I think politics are, in the main, a choice of evils.  One must be content, for the sake of doing great good, to do a little wrong, and if there was no other choice possible than to commit ourselves to a technical illegality for the sake of avoiding the overthrow of the Constitution, it is plainly setting before us an action which must be under a provision of the Constitution liable to be challenged in the courts and upset as contrary to the Treaty.  If that had been the only choice before us, I for one, because my conscience has been hardened after something like a quarter of a century of politics, would have been prepared to agree with reluctance to that course.  All the time there has been another course.  The amendment which Deputy Thrift has moved gives us a plain, simple, legal and dignified course.  I venture to commend it to the House and hope the Government will accept it.</P>

      <P>I presume that on previous occasions on speaking on this amendment we had full liberty to discuss not merely the amendment and its connection with the motion <Col N="1912" /> but also the motion itself, and so far as the motion itself is concerned, I cannot, any more than you, sir, take seriously the suggestion of Deputy Lemass that we are discussing something <i>in vacuo,</i> that we are merely discussing the abstract principle that it is a good thing to receive a petition we know nothing about, we never heard about, to be presented to the Dáil if it is in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution. The motion is that a petition be received, namely, the petition described, alluded to, and read out by Deputy de Valera in his opening speech.  It is quite true that Deputy Lemass's suggestion may not have been seriously meant, but I prefer not to take the responsibility of deciding. Many of the arguments I heard I should not care to decide whether they are seriously meant or not.  I gather from Deputy Lemass's own leader, in an interruption of a subsequent speech of the Minister for Agriculture, that he himself regarded that suggestion more or less as a quibble. Therefore I leave it there.  It is not the reception of any motion that we are in reality here discussing.  It is the acceptance or rejection of a particular motion that purports to be drawn up and presented here in accordance with Article 48 of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that any Party or any Deputy in the House ought to be under any illusions so far as that is concerned. I was surprised, though I am not quite sure about it, to learn from speeches made by the Labour Party in this House.  that they are not sure whether it is an abstract principle we are discussing or this very concrete Petition that was presented to this House.  I wonder does Deputy de Valera himself wish us to believe that it is merely an abstract principle or whether it is his own very definite motion.  the fate of which has to be decided as a result of this debate.  Of course it is quite correct to say that we have seen what purported to be the Petition.  We have seen the bundles that one day made their appearance in this House for a short time.  We do not know what is in the Petition or what it is about, but we are told that <Col N="1913" /> it asks us to deal with two things&mdash;that it is to deal with the general question of the setting up of machinery to put what is known as the Initiative into operation.  And not merely to do that but to do it for a particular purpose, namely, to get rid of Article 17 of our Constitution.  Really that is what in essence we are told to do.  Our attitude as a Government towards that proposition has been very clearly indicated by the three members of the Government who have spoken&mdash;by the President, by the Minister for Defence and by the Minister for Agriculture.  I think they made our attitude quite clear on the various questions that were raised on this matter.</P>
    <P>Let us remember there are two distinct questions involved.  One is Article 48 of the Constitution&mdash;I will deal with that in a moment&mdash;the Government's attitude towards Article 48 of the Constitution and the second is this Petition that we hold is not in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution so far as that Petition has been explained to us by the mover of the motion.  Our attitude towards Article 48 of the Constitution is one thing.  Our attitude is quite definite. There should be no cause or no reason for misunderstanding.  Our attitude towards the petition, that claims to be under that Article, and that we claim is not under that Article, is an entirely different thing.  It may be asked why we found it necessary not merely to state what our attitude is towards the Petition, but that we found it necessary also to state our attitude towards Article 48 of the Constitution.  May I answer that question by asking another?  If we did not do so, and if we then proceeded to introduce a Bill, as we are entitled, to remove that Article from the Constitution, I can easily imagine that we would have been accused of deceiving the Dáil and of keeping silent on this particular Article when this Petition was being discussed. I think it was the duty of the President and the other members of the Government who spoke, to make clear their attitude, not merely to the Petition, but also as to Article 48, and I think that is what they did.  Our attitude towards both of these matters, towards Article <Col N="1914" /> 48 of the Constitution and towards this Petition, that claims to be drawn up in accordance with that Article, is strictly, fully, and entirely constitutional. It is animated with full respect for the Constitution.  The suggestion that the contrary is the case, the accusation that we are willing, so to speak, to play with the Constitution, is only possible if people confuse our attitude towards these two very different matters.</P>
    <P>So far as Article 48 of the Constitution is concerned, I ought to point out that it is a two-fold one.  Article 48 is an Article of the Constitution.  It is portion of the fundamental law, therefore, of this country, and as long as it remains portion of the Constitution it must be honoured.  That is quite clear.  We are fully within our constitutional rights&mdash;and I challenge anybody in the Dáil cogently to prove anything to the contrary or to suggest the opposite&mdash; in moving for the deletion of the Article if we think fit.  That is quite clear.  I think it is because people were for one reason or another inclined to confuse our attitude towards Article 48 as it stands, our honouring of that Article, which we hold must be done, and our very definite intention to try to induce the House to remove that Article as soon as possible that a case can be made for the light charge of unconstitutionalism that is so easily levelled across the floor of the House at the Government.  I think there should be no room for hesitation or doubt that as long as that Article is in the Constitution, it must be honoured, but equally clear is this, that by the Constitution itself any party in this House and any member of this House is entitled fully within the Constitution, and using a constitutional right, to move, if he thinks fit, for the deletion of that Article.</P>

      <P>This Constitution was passed by the Dáil in <Col N="1916" /> 1922.  No member of the Dáil that passed that Constitution had the slightest doubt that it could in many ways be amended.  There is no doubt that it could be amended, and the Dáil that passed the Constitution was quite clear on the point.  The Deputies then clearly foresaw that amendments would be necessary to the Constitution that they had passed. They provided, in the Constitution itself, for the passing of amendments to that Constitution.  Even though they were only starting the Government of the Free State at that time, they, having wisdom, foresaw&mdash;or, perhaps, I should say they saw clearly&mdash;that it was one thing at the beginning of the political life, so to speak, of this country to draw up a Constitution, but that coming years would give wisdom that was not then possessed, and that amendments would be necessary.  They provided for that.  They foresaw that probably in the early years of the Constitution it would be desirable, in the interests of the Constitution and in the interests of the nation, to make the passing of amendments easier for the first eight years than would be the case in the subsequent years.  Hence, it is that in the initial period the passing of certain amendments to the Constitution was made easier and lighter than in subsequent years.  Reference was made here&mdash;I think by Deputy Davin&mdash; to the view expressed, during the Constitution debates, by the late Minister for Justice.  His murder has, of course, removed from us his great wisdom on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But let it be quite clear that long before Deputies opposite had the intention of entering this House that Minister had made up his mind, as others had made up their minds, that this particular Article of the Constitution was a flaw in the Constitution and ought to be removed.  How, then, that being the case, can anybody suggest that there is anything in the slightest degree unconstitutional in the attitude taken up by the Government, that this clause ought to be removed from the Constitution? We are perfectly within our rights in proposing to amend or entirely to delete Article 48.  There is nothing unconstitutional <Col N="1917" /> in proposing that.  It is quite true that other members of the House may not take the same view as we do about that Article.  Other members of the House may think that the Article is important and valuable.  It may seem to them to be, in a certain sense, more democratic than ordinary Parliamentary institutions are democratic. But we are certainly within our constitutional rights in believing the opposite.  Personally, I believe that though this Article has, on first examination, the appearance of giving more rights to democracy, in reality I think this Article, and other Articles like it, are in the long run more calculated to thwart the will of the people than to help to secure the victory of the will of the people.  We believe this Article is capable of gross abuse.  We believe it is capable of being used to subvert all good government in the country.  We believe it is capable of being used&mdash;as it would be used, for instance, if this motion were passed&mdash;to defeat the declared will of the people.</P>

We hold that as long as we are members of this House we are entitled to put our views before the House and to ask the judgment of the House upon them.  The President, both now and previously on relevant occasions&mdash;last July, and again a week ago, when it was equally relevant&mdash;did think it was his duty to point out what the attitude of the Government was to this particular motion.  We believe it serves no useful purpose; that it is bad for the State and that it ought to go.  I am not going into detail.  The time will come, I hope, when the Article itself can be debated on its merits&mdash;when we can debate and argue definitely here whether or not this Article ought to remain a portion of the Constitution.

      <P>I was going to make this one point as an illustration. Suppose there is a general election in this country, and any Government gets returned with a two-thirds majority of this House.  Then there is <Col N="1919" /> a petition for the Initiative.  The Government refuses to act, because the Government believes, rightly or wrongly, that the particular matter asked for in the petition would be fatal to the country, and would be against the policy that the Government has stood for and must stand for, according to its own lights.  Let us suppose the Government refuse to act.  The next move is that the petition must be referred by way of referendum.  Let us suppose that what has happened in most of the countries where the Initiative and Referendum have been in force happens in this country, and that only about one-third or one-fourth of the people vote.  What is the situation then?  A small fraction of the people, a fraction possibly representing one-sixth of the people&mdash;that has occurred in cases where this Referendum was in force&mdash;will decide that a certain policy must be carried through.  The Government, just returned after a general election, is incapable of adopting that particular policy.  Is there any method of solving the particular crisis that on that occasion arises?  In the long run, the result of the Initiative and of the particular machinery connected with it is not the triumph of the will of the people, but the triumph of well-organised interests.  But as Deputy Davin is so anxious to have explained, as long as the Article is there it must be honoured.  But a petition has only to be honoured when it is shown to us that it is in accord with Article 48 of the Constitution.  We do not believe that this petition, which is attempted to be presented to this House, is in any sense in accord with Article 48 of the Constitution.  Full respect for Article 48 of the Constitution does not mean any obligation on our part to vote for the acceptance of a petition that we believe not only not to be in accord with Article 48 of the Constitution, but that we believe to be contrary to the whole Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing inconsistent in full respect of Article 48 of the Constitution and the line that we are taking up on the matter of this particular Petition.  In this Petition we are asked to do two things.  An effort is made <Col N="1920" /> to force us, under plea of constitutionalism, for the moment, anyhow, to accept something that we believe we are not constitutionally bound to do and, secondly, to force us to do what constitutionally we believe we are forbidden to do.  Are we to be tricked into doing what we believe to be wrong?  Are we to be tricked into a violation of the Constitution simply because a charge of unconstitutionalism is likely to be levelled against us, because we do not accept the first Petition that purports to be in accord with Article 48?  Are we to be tricked into undermining and flouting the Constitution itself?  That is our position. This Petition purports to be according to Article 48.  We deny that it is according to Article 48.  That is our firm belief and, as long as we believe that, it is not possible for us to vote for the motion that Deputy de Valera has proposed.  As Deputy Thrift, in one of the best pieces of analysis I have heard since I came into this House, pointed out.  Article 48 has one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to deal with the Initiative and the machinery of the Initiative.  It has got nothing to do with the presentation of amendments to the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The first portion of the Article is permissive.  It simply states that the Oireachtas may adopt the Initiative.  Remember the Oireachtas is quite within its rights in not taking steps in that direction.  It is a matter for the will of the Oireachtas, but if it does not do it then the Article goes on to state that on a certain thing, namely, a petition signed by seventy-five thousand people the Oireachtas <Col N="1921" /> may do one of two things.  It still may refuse to put the machinery into operation, but if it does so it must refer the matter by Referendum to the people; but, as I say, this Article deals with a petition of one kind and one kind only, a petition dealing with the machinery of initiation.  I believe, as Deputy Thrift believes, that from the start this Petition is vitiated by the fact that it put before the people a confused issue. It is not in accordance with Article 48 and it destroys the whole idea of the Initiative by putting a confused and double issue before the people.</P>

      <P>What did the alleged petitioners mean when they signed this?  Have we now to decide that?  Supposing you do accept it, what is to be submitted to the people &mdash;this petition or a different thing altogether? What right have we to change what other people have put up to us?  If you accept this you will submit to the people again a confused issue, and we will not know what they stood for.  If Deputy de Valera has not taken the ordinary precautions to bring this petition within the four walls of the Constitution, by what process of reasoning are we bound to help him out of his difficulty?  Why are we bound when he himself has, I believe, failed to observe the rules of the Constitution, when he failed to proceed according to the directions laid down in the Constitution?  Why should others come to his assistance to help him out?  Have the majority of this Dáil, have the majority of the people in the country, no constitutional rights?  Why are they to be compelled to do what they think to be wrong, simply because if they do not do it a certain petition cannot be presented in the way Deputy de Valera wants? The petition, I believe, was vitiated from the start.  No clear issue was submitted to the people.  If Deputies think there was a clear issue, let them read the speeches of those who stated they intended to support this motion, and they will know definitely from these speeches whether the main purpose is to set up the Initiative or to <Col N="1922" /> get rid of a certain obnoxious Article in the Constitution and in the Treaty.</P>

      <P>It is also bad, as Deputy Thrift has pointed out, for another reason.  I spoke of what those who drew up the Constitution did in the way of providing for future amendment of the Constitution, but they laid down certain limits within which amendments could be made.  As Deputy Thrift pointed out, that was done in an Act to which the Constitution itself is a Schedule&mdash;namely, the Constitution Act.  It was also done in Article 50 of the Constitution.  As long as that is there, taking the Constitution as such, it is impossible for this Dáil to pass legislation of a type such as is demanded in Deputy de Valera's petition.  Even supposing that Article 2 of the Constitution Act and Article 50 of the Constitution itself were not there, surely Deputies opposite know well that international agreements cannot be abrogated in that particular way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>An international agreement over-rides municipal law, and by doing so it becomes municipal law.  It cannot be negatived by legislation.  It can be altered in either of two ways, and only in either of two ways, either by negotiation and agreement between the parties who made it or by denunciation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. CARNEY Mr. CARNEY">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be altered in either of these two ways, and only in either of these two ways. These are the only means known in international law of changing agreements between two countries.  Even apart from that, as Deputy Thrift pointed out, it is the more manly thing, the thing more in keeping with the dignity of this House and of this nation, to face the issue fairly and straightly and call for the denunciation of the Treaty, and not try to do it in this way, in a hopelessly unconstitutional <Col N="1923" /> manner.  You have one way of gaining your end, by peaceful means; that is to see that the people elect a Government that is willing either to negotiate a change in the Treaty or is ready to denounce that Treaty.  Until the people of this country elect a Government that is prepared to do either of these two things, then I see no manly or constitutional method of changing that Treaty or getting rid of it or of getting rid of any fundamental article in that Treaty.  It may be, of course, that that would be quite easy. As Deputy Little put it, with great knowledge of the methods by which political negotiations are carried out: &ldquo;It is always possible to change treaties&rdquo;&mdash;of course it is&mdash;&ldquo;and if there was a united vote of the Irish people and of this House in favour of the removal of that Oath, it would be a mighty easy thing to face the English Government and say that the Oath has to go&mdash;to re-open the Treaty and get rid of the Oath.&rdquo;  It would be a mighty easy thing for any party to ask another party to do anything. Now, when that thing happens, when the people of this country make up their minds to repudiate the Treaty, or to repudiate fundamental Articles in the Treaty, I hope there will be no indefiniteness about it, either on their part or on the part of the people who invited them to that particular policy. But if there was a wrong way to go about removing this particular Article it is the way that has been chosen by those who got the people to sign this particular Petition.  It is in reality a trick to undermine the Constitution. Then what about verification?</P>
