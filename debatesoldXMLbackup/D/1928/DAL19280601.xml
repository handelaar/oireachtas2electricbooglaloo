    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That a sum not exceeding £116,012 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for the Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education, including the cost of Administration, Inspection, etc.&rdquo; (The President).</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Sheehy resumes might I ask for an indication as to the course the debate is to take?  In the course of the debate up to this a number of points of detail, not merely on this Estimate, but on the various Estimates for the Department of Education were mentioned.  When introducing this Vote I dealt with the educational policy of the Department <Col N="2494" /> as a whole.  That statement of general policy dealt not merely with this Vote but with the other Votes for the Department.  I consider that aspect of the question has been sufficiently covered, so far as I am concerned, by my introductory statement on general policy.  I know, of course, it is exceedingly difficult to distinguish on a matter of this kind between what is a matter of detail and what is strictly speaking, a question of general policy. When replying I should like to reserve to myself the right, even though matters of detail are mentioned in the course of the debate on this particular Vote, to deal with them in what seems to me to be the more appropriate place, namely, on the particular Estimate with which they deal.  Deputy Fahy, for instance, in addition to dealing with the general policy of the Department, mentioned quite a number of other things.  I think he mentioned a number of questions of detail, not merely on the Vote for Primary Education, but on the Votes for Secondary and Technical Education as well.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to say how the debate should be conducted.  My own view, expressed at different times before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, is that a debate of this kind should be conducted by allotting to it a certain number of hours, and if all these hours are taken on Vote 45, then Vote 45 should be put, and Votes 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 without debate, if necessary. If all the details are debated on Vote 45, I presume that so much discussion would be saved on the other Votes. The Minister's point, as I understand it, is that the discussion of details should conclude on Vote 45, the Estimate that we are now dealing with.</P>

      <P>As the representative of Munster on the old Technical Board of Instruction, I wish to endorse all that has been so well said by the Minister for Education as to the activities of that Board for 25 years.  Technical education was carried out by that Board all over the country.  The chief <Col N="2495" /> officer associated with the work, Mr. Fletcher, although an Englishman, gave great services to the old Board of Technical Education here.  The building up of the institution of technical instruction went on here for the long period of 26 years.  It would be a bad thing for the country if, by any act of the Dáil, the activities carried on during that period were to cease now.  I was glad to hear the Minister for Education lay particular emphasis on that question.  As the head of the present Education Department, he is prepared to take up the work of the old Board in that respect.  In doing so, I can tell him that he will have the best wishes of the parents of the children in this State.  On that Board, I had as a colleague Deputy Kelly.  We had representatives on it from Belfast and Londonderry and from Connacht and Munster.  During the four years that I attended the Board up to its dissolution there was not a single division taken at its meetings.  The members of the Board, representing the four provinces of Ireland, discussed every question affecting the progress of technical education.  They were all filled with the one idea&mdash;namely, to utilise the funds placed at the disposal of the Board for the best advantage of the rising generation.  Two members of that Board struck me as being most sincere men.</P>

      <P>All I will say, then, with regard to the old Board is this, that they have left a legacy of work to the Minister for Education which I feel is precious.  I realise that the Estimates before the House cannot be much criticised, because the money to be voted will be utilised for a great and a good object&mdash;namely, the education of the youth of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his address in connection with this Vote mentioned that boys and girls who leave the National Schools at 14 years of age no longer walked out into the wilderness, but were taken up and trained by his Department in such a manner that they could face the battle of life with confidence <Col N="2496" /> and would be able to go into trades and callings in their own land.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a small point, but still one of importance. It is concerned with the question of arranging the summer holidays during the season when beet thinning and mangold and turnip thinning take place in the tillage areas.  Agricultural labourers who have not very high wages depend to a large extent on the few pounds the children earn during that period to buy boots and clothes for them.  This is a class of work at which the children are quite as proficient as people of mature age.  They are also a great help to the farmers, for it is difficult to get help for turnip thinning during that period.  I know that up to the present there was a difficulty about arranging to have the school holidays in that period, which I would say would be from the end of June to the time that the summer holidays extend.  The difficulty before this, I believe, was that teachers had to attend Irish classes in the month of September. If the Minister could see his way to arrange the holidays, say, from the end of June to whatever time they extend at present, I think it would be a matter of great convenience to the parents of these children and to the farmers.</P>

      <P>For years we have debated the question of pensions. I understand that the pensions scheme has now been adopted as far as secondary teachers are concerned.  I should like to know from the Minister when this scheme is coming into operation. With regard to teachers in primary schools who have been promoted, some time during last year I asked a question as to whether the period during which they had been teaching would be added to the years that would entitle them to a pension.  The answer I got was that the Minister was sympathetic &mdash;I think that it was the Minister for Finance who answered me&mdash;but that he could not introduce the necessary legislation until the result of the actuarial examination which was being carried out was known.  I should like to know whether the result of that examination <Col N="2497" /> is now known, and whether the Minister is going to take any precautions to have those teachers who have been promoted inspectors having the years added during which they were acting as teachers.  I learned with great pleasure that 350 new schools have been provided during the year. A point that has attracted our attention for years is that occasionally during the winter time no fires are provided in these schools.  There is no proper ventilation, and the children rebreathe the air until they are perfectly stupid. I should like to think that in those 350 new schools the ventilation and sanitation have been attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the sanitation of schools was referred to, I think, in connection with the Department of Local Government Vote.  When it was asked whether it was possible to make an alteration in these schools we were told there were certain means by which a manager could be compelled to provide proper sanitation&mdash;that is to say, he could be brought into court.  Has it ever happened that a manager has been brought into court because of the insanitary condition of schools?  Another point that has attracted attention for a number of years is the question of the provision of playing fields.  Nothing has impressed itself more on me as the years proceed than the necessity of providing school children with some place where they can play.  Where children are allowed to play on the roads owing to the increased traffic in every direction it is almost impossible that they would not fall victims to accidents that would end fatally.  Therefore, I think an endeavour should be made to get a piece of land on which children may play.  Another matter was touched upon in connection with the Local Government Vote, and it is on that is always very near to my heart, that is the provision of meals. My memory goes back to my own school days, when I had to walk over two miles to school, and I had eaten my little lunch before I reached school and had to walk home at 4 o'clock to hungry and tired that I was incapable of eating a decent meal at that time. Since then I have always thought it would be a very good thing if we could give the children a cheap meal, and by <Col N="2498" /> that I mean a glass of milk and a slice of bread and butter.  In these three you have the ordinary constituents of food that are necessary, and are better than beef-tea, cocoa, and all those things we hear talk about.  The farmer is not getting more than sixpence a gallon, I understand, for his milk, and it would not take a great many gallons to give children at least half a pint of milk.</P>
    <P>It would not take a great many loaves to give the children a couple of slices of bread during the middle of the day.  There are people who are able to provide lunch for their children, while others cannot give them even a decent breakfast, with the result that children are sent in an ill-fed and ill-clad condition to school in which there is not much firing or warmth, and nothing but disaster can follow from such conditions.  You cannot raise a high standard race under such circumstances. Wet feet, bad ventilation, insanitary conditions in a school where you have ill-fed and ill-clad children, are all against children improving their education.  I want to call attention to a rule which exists in connection with the national school system, a rule which, I understand, has been in existence for some time, but the sooner it is eliminated the better.  I just want to put the case of a teacher in County Cavan, who had an assistant teacher working under him.  When it came to the Christmas holidays he had forgotten the fact that he had taken a certain number of days off for elections and other events, and without any conference with or knowledge on the part of the assistant, he fixed for three weeks' holidays.</P>
    <P>As I say, the assistant was not consulted and the three weeks' holidays were given and taken.  The assistant had made arrangements for going away, but she had to remain in the place and pay extra.  That, however, does not come into the matter, but what does come into it is, that when the teacher was penalised, as he justly was, by a deduction from his salary, the poor girl who was never consulted, had £3 taken from her salary.  That is a most unfair rule.  I do not care who made it. The sooner it is withdrawn the better. The girl had no voice in the matter, <Col N="2499" /> but she had her salary reduced.  I spoke to the Minister several times about the matter, and he said he was unable to do anything because there were about forty other cases under the same rule.  If there are, I say that the sooner the rule is changed the better, because it is not fair that a person who has no voice in the matter should have three or four pounds taken off her salary through no fault of hers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJKillane" hpid="Mr. KILLANE Mr. KILLANE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KILLANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few words to say in reference to new schools about to be built.  One thing which I would like the Minister to take into consideration in the building of new schools is the installation of modern patent appliances.  Old methods are apparently regarded as being good enough for new schools in rural districts. It is about time, however, that new heating arrangements were put in so that the heat would be diffused throughout the school generally, and not left for the benefit of the teacher and a few children standing near him. Some consideration should be given to the children all over the school as it is useless sending a child who is hungry, wet and cold to school in the winter. I also want to draw the Minister's attention to the needs of drinking water in the schools.  I know schools where there is not a drop of clean drinking water provided for the children, even within a reasonable distance. In such cases there should be, at least a vessel to carry the water every morning from a well, but, if there is no well, a pump should be supplied, as it is necessary that children should be provided with God's own gift, clean water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to draw attention to some facts in connection with school holidays in rural areas.  It is all very well to provide teachers with holidays in seasons when they can go away and enjoy them, but what about the children who have to go to school, hail, rain or snow during the winter months and who often spend their holidays uselessly hanging around during fine weather when they should be getting the benefit of education?  I do not expect that an immediate remedy will be provided for that, but I wish the <Col N="2500" /> Minister would take into consideration the fact that some scheme should be developed to provide substitute teachers during holidays, if they are absolutely necessary.  Children who may not be able to go to school during the winter, should, in my opinion, be allowed go to school during the summer.  Some Deputies seem to think that this is a joke, but, perhaps, they had not to go over the hills three or four miles to school.  They probably have had the advantage of a school being close to them or of going to a boarding school.  There is more in this than a mere joke.  Perhaps it would be well if we could transport some of the jocular Ministers, whose risible faculties are easily excited, and send them down to go to school across the hills in Longford in the depth of winter.  Their risible tissues would then become calmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know very much about education, but I have a few points to put to the Minister for his consideration.  I do not know if this particular position arises in other counties, but I know that in County Meath we are faced with the position, especially on the edges of the county, of having schools very close together. There are cases, however, especially in areas where the land has been divided, where cottages have been built, and where there are many children but no schools.  These children often have to walk three or four miles to school.  That seems to be a case of redundancy, and it could be easily relieved by doing away with one school and building another in a more central position.  I, personally, knew cases where it amounted to absolute cruelty.  I have known cases which can be proved to have turned out fatal, where children have actually died owing to the necessity of having to walk long distances in bad weather.  It always struck me as being very peculiar to hear people speaking about cruelty to animals when, in fact, there exists the source, such as I mention, of great cruelty to children. It is also in after years a source of grea expense to ratepayers.  A number of those children when they grow up naturally are unhealthy.  They never seem to get over the hardships of these <Col N="2501" /> long walks.  I hope that that is peculiar only to the County Meath, that the peculiar circumstances in County Meath have given rise to it, but it is certainly a case in which some definite steps will have to be taken to relieve the children. I know a particular area in which there are three schools within a couple of miles of each other, and the district I speak of is at least three or three and a half miles away from these schools. Some steps must be taken to relieve those children.</P>
      <P>Another point which has struck me is that no attention whatever is paid, as far as I know, to the teaching of local history in the schools.  I think it is very important that not alone should local history be taught, but that a certain amount of instruction should be given regarding local industries peculiar to a district.  I think it is very important that children should know something of the local history, something in which they can take a pride, so that in after years, when they become men and women, they can intelligently explain to visitors or strangers the history of the different historical centres in their locality.  It is unfortunate, I suppose, that in Ireland we do not possess any authentic history.  There is, especially, no history of local ancient monuments or historical centres.  I think that an effort should be made in those schools. By the teaching of local history an appetite can be created amongst children for a knowledge of whatever historical associations happen to be connected with their localities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'DOWD Dr. O'DOWD">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'DOWD</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the plea made by Deputy Sir James Craig for the provision of school meals for children, particularly in the rural districts.  In some districts at present children have to walk as far as three and four miles to school.  These children cannot get home before 4 p.m. or 4.30 p.m. in the evening.  At that time they are not able to eat a decent meal, so that it would be very highly desirable if provision were made for a meal of some kind for the children at the schools.  A meal such as Deputy Sir James Craig suggested, a slice of bread and butter and a glass of milk, would not cost very much, and would contain <Col N="2502" /> all the important ingredients necessary for the food of children.  The matter of playgrounds is also very important. If children do not get proper exercise they cannot be healthy, and they certainly will not be able to attend to their studies as well as they otherwise would.  The provision of proper playgrounds would mean the encouragement of games and the encouragement of games and the encouragement of education go hand in hand.  If children have an interest in games they will return to school after play hour satisfied, and they will do better work.</P>
      <P>Another very important matter in reference to schools in rural Ireland is sanitation.  When the Local Government Estimate was under consideration I asked the Minister for Local Government to state in his reply if the sanitation of schools was under the control of the local authority.  I did not hear the Minister's reply, but I understand he said that there was a method of compelling managers to keep schools in a proper sanitary condition. The method, I understand, that is being adopted at present is that when the ordinary school inspector visits the school to make his annual inspection, he inspects the sanitary accommodation attached to the school. I would like to know to whom does he make his report on the sanitary condition of the school, and if the report is acted on.  If the report is made to the Board of Education, I presume the Board of Education sends the report to the Local Government Department, otherwise the local authority&mdash;which is the sanitary authority&mdash;cannot act on the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'DOWD</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical officer of health, as far as I know, simply makes a report to the local authority.  I have done it time and time again, and the matter has ended there.  In some schools I have been informed by the teachers that the dry closets attached to the school have not been cleaned out for upwards of forty years.  There are schools in my own particular district, upon which I have reported for four and five years, and they are still insanitary. <Col N="2503" /> If the Minister for Local Government meant that there was a way of enforcing the sanitary laws by taking the managers into court or some other way, the sooner it is done the better, because when one makes reports to the local sanitary authority, the Board of Health at present, it simply means that the matter ends there.  If the Local Government Department have the power they should enforce the sanitary laws, and if it is a matter for the Education Department, that Department should enforce them.  They should see that schools are kept in a proper sanitary condition, otherwise the children cannot continue immune from the various diseases to which the sanitary conditions of the schools would render them liable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to be anything but very brief, and propose rather to mention points than to argue questions which they might cause to arise.  On general matters I would like to support what Deputy Sir James Craig and Deputy Dr. O'Dowd have said in reference to the urgent need for considering what can be done to change the conditions under which ill-clad, ill-fed, poor children are being taught at present.  I think it applies equally well to the town districts as to the country.  In many parts of the country there are districts which are slum districts in regard to the conditions prevailing, and it is hopeless to pretend to educate children under conditions like those. Deputy Sir James Craig stated the case in connection with those matters very well.  I do not want to say any more about it, but it raises a big question. I am not prepared at the moment to say how the problem is to be tackled, but it raises a question of whether this State is to undertake the feeding of those children.  Beyond any dispute something ought to be done.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that he has reason to believe that the Compulsory Attendance Act is giving promise of working well.  My information is that that is quite true, particularly in country districts, though I have heard that it is not working well in many <Col N="2504" /> town districts.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister whether that is so or not.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to save time by mentioning in a group many points in connection with the various estimates which I desire to have referred to.  I would prefer that rather than take up time on the various heads of the Estimates. I think that is what the Ceann Comhairle indicated.  With regard to primary education there are two points I would like to mention.  I would like to know from the Minister whether the policy of the Department has altered at all with reference to the position of what used to be called the first of first-class teachers.  In the time of the old Commissioners of National Education an agreement was made as to the teachers' salaries, and one point of doubt which was ultimately held by the Commissioners to be established by those first of first-class teachers was that they were entitled to a special bonus which was awarded under that agreement.  If the Commissioners had remained in office there is little doubt that that agreement would have been adhered to in that respect.  I understand that the Department did not feel themselves obliged to carry out that agreement, and yet it does seem as if a prima facie case, or at any rate a strong equitable case, had been made out for giving the bonus to the first of first-class teachers which was agreed to under that agreement.  In that connection it occurs to me that very often before I urged the Department to consider whether, in view of the pension fund, something could not be done to relieve the position of the pensioned teachers who retired over thirty years ago.  Many of them are still in a condition of deplorable poverty.  There are quite a considerable number of them still living and in receipt of pensions varying from £40 to £50 a year.  Their position, as has been pointed out by me already, was attended to in Northern Ireland, but their position has not been alleviated at all in the Saor-stát. The amount of money involved is very small.  To my mind there is an urgent case for helping them to some extent at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to secondary education, three points which have been <Col N="2505" /> separately debated on these Estimates hitherto, include the salary scheme on which I just want to make one or two remarks.  The scheme, on the whole, may be said to be working well, but I think it leaves room for improvement. It is unsatisfactory that there should be any teachers who are not in receipt of this help to their salaries.  There may be difficulties in securing that.  The figures that the Minister supplied in reply to a question two or three weeks ago, indicated that the financial difficulties could not be large.  It is unsatisfactory, to my mind, that there are still secondary teachers who are not receiving any benefit at all from the help that the State is giving to secondary education.  I think it would not be at all impossible to devise a scheme with no great cost that would enable the secondary teachers who are qualified and efficient to get the help which they need to their present small salaries.  The second point is, that many of these teachers are in a very doubtful position as to tenure.  Reasonable stable tenure ought to be possible to secure for secondary teachers.  No attempt has yet been made to give them that security.  The third point on which I have often spoken before is a question of pensions for secondary teachers.  To argue that point is quite unnecessary, and probably not in order, but I think the principle has been admitted by the House that a scheme of pensions for secondary teachers should be provided.  The point I want to stress is the delay that has occurred in producing such a scheme. The matter has been under consideration for.  I think, more than two years. It would be a misfortune if this session came to an end without there being some definite declaration from the Department and from the Minister for Finance as to what they propose to do with reference to that proposed scheme for pensioned teachers.  There are very grave difficulties in the management of schools owing to the holding up of this scheme.  In many schools old teachers are being retained simply because they are waiting for the promulgation of this scheme, and the management are unable to make their arrangements for pensioning the teachers who ought to be pensioned, because they do not <Col N="2506" /> know to what extent their funds would be called upon to supplement any grant that may be made for that pension by the State.  I have the strongest hope that the Minister will see his way to indicate, at any rate before the close of the session, the scheme which he proposes to introduce and the date at which that scheme may be expected to come into force.  In such a scheme I hope he will see that provision is introduced for providing certain allied points which are of importance to secondary teachers.  There is the small but important section, namely, the students training colleges, for which at present there is no provision at all for pensions for the staff.</P>
    <P>I also feel obliged to refer to the fact that the inspectors of schools in the different branches are in this position, that any service they gave as teachers before being appointed to the inspectorships does not count when their claim for a pension comes to be considered.  That seems to me a position which cannot logically be defended for a moment.  The services they gave as teachers were services that qualified them for performing their work properly as inspectors, and it seems unreasonable that such services should not be counted when their length of service for a pension is being calculated. These are periods of their service in respect of which they should be entitled to a pension.  The present conditions are such that from the time an inspector starts work as an inspector he is not able to qualify for a full pension to which he would be entitled under this scheme owing to his not having served as an inspector long enough.  I have not delayed very long in arguing these points because I know it would take a very long time to put the whole case.  That is because we all feel that in connection with these Estimates the time is very precious and that it is necessary for us to put our points as briefly as we possibly can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Professor Thrift in the appeal which he has so ably made for the pensioned teachers.  It is within my own knowledge that many of these deserving old men and women who have given <Col N="2507" /> very good and faithful service to the State as national teachers are now living on the borders of poverty.  In the city of Cork to-day there are a few of the old pensioned teachers of the first-of-first class, the old class which many Deputies in this House will remember, and, to my knowledge, they are so badly off that they are nearly on the verge of starvation. They are precluded by virtue of the small pension from getting anything under the Old Age Pensions Act and, in like manner, they are precluded from getting anything in the form of Home Assistance, so that the plight of many of those old teachers is very pitiable indeed.  I would appeal to the Minister, with Deputy Thrift, to take the case of these teachers into his serious and sympathetic consideration.</P>

    <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer very briefly is in connection with the children of the very poor. In Cork City, as most Deputies must be aware, there are many National Schools, some conducted by lay teachers and others by monastic orders. I have on many occasions seen children congregated about the doors of the National Schools, frequently half an hour or an hour before the schools open.  Many of those children are sent to school without any breakfast.  To my knowledge, many of the National teachers have, out of their own pockets, subscribed the wherewithal to give something in the form of nourishment to these very poor children.  There is one aspect of the whole question of national education which, I think, has not been touched upon.  It is the cost of school utensils and books.  As one who has taken a very deep interest in the whole question of education, I have gone to the trouble to make some inquiries of National teachers and others, and I find that in one school something like 30 per cent. of the children had unemployed parents or guardians, as the case may be.  These poor children would find the sum of sixpence or eightpence far beyond the means of their parents and guardians, and whilst it might appear a very trivial matter to the child of the well-to-do, to the child of the poor unemployed person it is a very different matter.  Something <Col N="2508" /> should be done, if not in this year's Budget, at least in the next, to secure that those children, many of them very bright, intellectual children, should not, because of that particular drawback in the nature of want of money to provide necessary books and utensils, suffer educationally.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention, namely, the position of teachers in Convent and Monastery Schools and junior assistant mistresses in relation to their pension rights.  As that matter would take up a good deal of the time of the House, I would ask the Minister to be good enough, at some future date, to receive either a memorial or a deputation on their behalf that would go at some length into the details connected with this matter, and it would obviate the necessity for me to make any lengthy statement now in that connection. I am, however, interested in another phase of education with which I would like to deal at some length, but as I will be able to deal with it under another heading I will reserve it for that particular heading, even though it might not be an appropriate heading. I think I could raise it on Vote 46 (Primary Education) or Vote 47 (Secondary Education).  I refer to the question of University extension.  It is quite appropriate and quite proper that I could deal with it now, but if the Minister will assure me that I will have another opportunity of referring to it at a future date I will be quite satisfied.</P>

      <P>I would like briefly to touch on the whole question of adult education and University extension, but the time is very limited, and I had intended to deal with it in detail.  I know there are other speakers who wish to follow me on the question of national education and, therefore, I will be as brief as I possibly can.  Whilst not wishing to make any invidious comparisons between this country and America, or this country and England on the question of education, I would, at the same time, like to point to the fact that you have operating, in England and <Col N="2509" /> other countries, Workers' Educational Associations and, of later date, National Labour Colleges.  I do know that the very name of National Labour College would not have a very strong appeal to this House, and particularly to some of the educationists; but I have some experience of what that movement means, and perhaps it would be just as well if some of those who do not know much about the movement in other countries listened while I recapitulate, in a very brief way, what has happened across the Channel and in other countries in the workers' educational movement. Not because of its prefix &ldquo;workers&rdquo; must it be thought that it is a movement which deals merely with elementary education.  It goes something beyond that, and when I tell you that the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford have taken the matter up, and that some of the leading Universities in America have taken the matter up, perhaps that in itself will commend it to the opinions of some of our Deputies. Some of these colleges, run under the auspices of the Workers' Educational Association and under the auspices of the National Labour College movement, have a curriculum which ranges over a very wide number of subjects, including history, economics, civics, literature, philosophy, music, botany, etc.  This course, I may remark in passing, extends over three years in the majority of cases, but special arrangements are made whereby the process can extend over only one year.  That, of course, as you can readily understand, is a fairly intensified process.  The management of those classes&mdash;I do not want to detain you by going into very minute details&mdash; is in the hands of the students themselves or their organisations, with the co-operation, of course, of the professors from the universities.  What I want to stress more than anything else is this: the aloofness, the detachment, of our Irish Universities to what is going on around them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out, some of the old and somewhat exclusive universities across the Channel have come out of their shells, so to speak, and identified themselves with these democratic colleges.  In this country we have universities standing quite aloof from democracy, and in that connection <Col N="2510" /> I might say that some of the new aristocrats of the newly rich tribe are about the greatest offenders in that respect.  What I suggest for the serious consideration of the Minister is the fact that these university extension courses are established across the Channel, and they are in other countries, so that there is no reason why university extension courses should not be established in this country, unless perhaps it be the inherent antagonism of the university dons to modern though and progress. I admit that there is something new in that, but I say that we have not shown in our universities anything approaching the progress, either material or moral, that has been shown in other countries.  I would ask the Minister to take into consideration the advisability of establishing these tutorial classes throughout the Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>When one listens to the debate and to the views of the Deputies, one sympathises to a certain extent with the Minister if he is to try and please all parties.  Deputy Killane pointed out how difficult it was for children to attend school in bad weather.  He said that it would be much better if an arrangement could be made so that the children would attend school in the summer time, when the weather is more favourable.  If Deputy Killane had been here a few years ago, when the Act providing for compulsory attendance at school was passed, he would have found considerable opposition to that idea.  The Farmers' Party wanted quite the opposite; they wanted the children to attend school in bad weather in order that they might help their parents during the fine weather in saving the crops.  I think there is a lot to be said in that respect, and if the Compulsory Education Act was before the House now I am afraid it would meet with more opposition than it did then, because although the Act has many advantages it has also disadvantages. I was told by a District Justice how unreasonable it is to expect children to attend school in certain circumstances, how they are sometimes forced to go, and that when the real facts are revealed on a prosecution it is discovered that absence was not due <Col N="2511" /> to inattention, but very often because the parents had no breakfast to give them.  That may not be the reason always for keeping children at home, but I think the District Justice should be able to exercise leniency when cases of that kind occur.  At present the District Justice has no option but to impose a fine.  He should be allowed to exercise some leniency.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to plots of land for playing purposes. While I agree that there is a certain amount of education to be derived in that respect, I think that the plots might be extended, so as to have demonstration plots for children who are inclined to follow an agricultural life after leaving school.  The sanitation of the schools has been touched upon in the debate.  If there is proper sanitary accommodation in the school, it helps the children in after life to take an interest in sanitary matters. I desire to refer particularly to the condition of a sewer at Ardagh School. I raised this matter some years ago.  I can recollect speaking about it after a particular meeting I attended, which was held in the Seanad room to discuss the Border question.  That was four or five years ago, and nothing has since been done.  The sewer remains in the same condition, and in warm weather the children complain about it.  In fact the teacher will almost have to close the school unless something is done to remedy matters.  I spoke to the sanitary officer, and he told me that he was tired writing letters about it.  I have mentioned the matter in this House two or three times, and I went before the Board of Health, but nothing has been done.  One Board shifts the responsibility on to another Board, and nobody seems to be responsible. Having called attention to the matter now, I hope that I will get some satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise what Deputy Sir James Craig said about a <Col N="2512" /> lady school teacher.  I think it was unreasonable.  It may be as the Deputy stated, that there are 30 or 40 other similar cases.  If there are, that is all the more reason why something should be done.  It seems very peculiar that one teacher can dismiss another teacher, and close the school. In this particular case it was against the wishes of this teacher that the school was closed.  She got notice one day that the school was going to be closed the next day, and that was all.  She was simply told by the principal that the school would be closed on the following Monday or Tuesday, although this teacher was living on the premises.  She had made no arrangements to go away, yet her salary was stopped, all through the mistake or otherwise of the principal teacher.  I would like to emphasise all that has been said on behalf of first-of-first teachers.  I think their case is pitiable, and that the position with regard to them is unreasonable, and that they should receive some consideration.</P>

      <P>I feel very much inclined to throw back Deputy Anthony's accusation against the university dons, as he calls them, on his own head, and to say that nobody has shown himself more remote from the current world in that respect than Deputy Anthony has done, by the remarks he made concerning universities to-day.  I have no desire at all to argue about extension lectures.  On that I would probably find myself very largely in agreement with him, except that the work done by extension lectures in other countries is to a large extent done by the universities in their ordinary everyday work here.  What I want to discuss with him is the attack upon the remoteness of dons. It is a favourite charge against dons, and was made by a distinguished English writer 40 years ago, so that I am afraid Deputy Anthony is living at least 40 years back in this respect.  He is so remote from the modern world that he has failed to realise the unprecedentedly large number of dons and ex-dons that he has as colleagues in the Dáil.  It has often been said in this country that the difficulty is to keep them out of public life.  I would like <Col N="2513" /> to have Deputy Anthony discuss with the author of this pamphlet on &ldquo;The Case for a Tariff on Flour&rdquo; which I have here, the question whether that gentleman, who is a distinguished don in Deputy Anthony's own town, is a remote and ineffectual don.</P>

      <P>There may be some question as to his effectualness, but I think no one can accuse him of remoteness.  I am afraid I am inclined to find myself, on a number of questions that are annually discussed here concerning education, occupying a rather illiberal and conservative position. I may perhaps be justifying Deputy Anthony's accusation to that extent. But I have always felt&mdash;at least up to this year&mdash;that discussions on the Education Estimates were somewhat too much taken up with the externals of education.  We have too much of a tendency to think that if we provide palatial school buildings, perfect sanitation, school meals for every child, and a number of expensive adjuncts of that kind to education we have done all that is necessary for education.  I quite agree that there is a great deal to be done still before we have reached perfection, so far as our resources will permit, in these respects, but I would suggest that there are other things in education, and I am glad to see that this year in particular most Deputies have adverted to these other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other things besides school buildings and meals for children. There are a great many other matters on which we could spend money more effectively than on, say, the provision of free meals by the State for school children.  Not that I am opposed by any means to the idea of free meals for certain types of school children, but I do believe that we would be adopting a more business-like attitude if we had some plan by which the provision of school meals, and of cheap or free text-books, would be taken over by the local people instead of being made a State charge.  When the State deals with matters of that kind you are always liable to have a great amount <Col N="2514" /> of overlapping and an amount of money misspent by the mere fact that the State is an enormous institution and cannot very easily deal with remote cases.  I do not think that the State should ever look forward to the time when all school children would be getting free meals.  I do not think that that would be an economic proposition. What you should deal with is individual cases of hardship, which certainly should be remedied, not as a matter of charity at all, but as a matter of duty.  I agree with the Labour Party in that respect, that it should be the duty of the community to remedy what hardships there are with regard to school meals and text-books, but I say that it would be much better and more efficient if that duty fell on the shoulders of a small local community rather than on the shoulders of the State.  I think that there would be a much better chance of making progress in that way&mdash;and it is a matter we ought to try to make progress in&mdash; if we tried to work out some scheme by which school managers, at any rate in country districts, would be induced and encouraged to see after the provision of free school meals and cheap or free text-books.</P>
    <P>There were two or three points in what Deputy Fahy said to which I would like to advert and emphasise.  I was glad to see that he paid a great deal of attention to programmes and to a number of questions which are old cruxes in regard to education, and which need to have a certain amount of light let in on them.  He made one request to the Minister which I should like to reinforce.  He asked that consideration should be given to the possibility of providing an official series of National School books, both in English and in Irish.  I know that at present that is a very expensive proposal, and I yield to no one in my dislike of further expenditure in these matters; but I am not so sure that the advantages to be gained by instituting such a series of text-books would not outweigh whatever extra expenditure would be incurred.  I do not think that there was anything more admirable, from their own point of view, in the whole British system of education in this country than the series of text-books <Col N="2515" /> which used to be issued by the Stationery Office, and I do believe that since the introduction of the rule in 1900 that these text-books were to be departed from in the schools, primary education has suffered a great loss.  I am interested in that matter, not so much as regards the teaching of English, although I believe it is an important thing, but that if you have a uniform and good series of special text-books, not necessarily compulsorily used, but used as far as possible, you will get better value than you get now by relying on the taste or on the capriciousness of some publisher.</P>
    <P>But what I am interested in is the question of Irish text-books.  We are spending a good deal of money on the production of books in Irish for secondary and other schools, and I have every admiration for the work that is being done by the committee that the Minister has set up to deal with that.  But I do believe that even better work could be done if the question of providing a series of text-books in the Irish language on the lines of the old National School text-books issued by the Stationery Office, were followed. What we want more than anything else is some kind of co-ordination and carefully selected reading matter of the best kind in Irish for our primary schools.  What we have at present is a rather haphazard system by which, as a great many people know, everything in Irish that comes out from a publisher is regularly put on the programme when it comes out, whether it is good, bad or indifferent.  There is very little criticism of these books; there is very little tendency to select what is best; and above all, it seems to me that there is very little tendency to make use in our education of the immense amount of good work that was done by the Gaelic League and other bodies in the publication of Irish books.  I would like to see in use a series like the old Gaelic League series, a very large number of the books of which are out of print at present, and even a series like that of the Irish Texts Society, or perhaps a selection made from them, and cheaper issues of them brought out and made available for secondary schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2516" /> In that connection, perhaps my attitude is rather a conservative one, but I do believe that we will get more value and that we will go further in the teaching of Irish if we rely a little more than we do on the literature that is in Irish already, and if we are not in such a hurry to try to force a literature out of people who are not capable of producing it at present in a very large number of cases.  I would like very much to see either the State or somebody else reproducing a number of the Gaelic League text-books, which were very useful in their time, but which are now out of print, and making them available for primary schools, and I would like to see more care taken in the selection of the text-books used in primary and in secondary schools and in university education, in modern Irish.  I have heard serious complaints from people who are unquestionably authorities on this matter with regard to the books used in the preparatory colleges for the training of teachers. Two text-books were mentioned to me both of which I know are altogether unsuitable for that kind of work, and are almost unsuitable for any work at all.  I have been told that teachers, who have been taken at the expense of the State and given a course in Irish in the summer, have had their time taken up with learning these useless text-books, and that a great deal of money was spent in the process.  They are then turned out and expected to be able to teach Irish after that.  I think that is a very dangerous thing if it is happening.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that much greater care ought to be taken in the selection of the type of Irish text-book that is being used from the bottom to the top.  Above all, I should like again to emphasise the desirability of instituting as soon as possible&mdash;and here I think the question of cost might be almost left on one side as the matter is of such importance &mdash;a series of text-books in the Irish language on the lines of the old National Board text-books.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on what I think is a real step in advance, and that is the proposed institution of a primary school leaving certificate.  I quite agree that we have far too many examinations in this country, <Col N="2517" /> but I believe that the authorities at the time made a mistake 28 or 29 years ago when they abandoned the system of regular examinations in primary schools almost altogether.  I think that not only our primary, but our secondary and university education, has been suffering ever since from the fact that we threw over the old results system altogether too completely, not only what was bad, but what was good in it.  I think that this proposal to institute a leaving certificate for primary schools will give us what was good in the old results system, and not too much of it, while, at the same time, we have, of course, adopted a much less rigid and much more manageable and liberal system of primary education than we had 40 or 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>There was another point that Deputy Fahy raised that I would like to hear discussed, and that is the very large percentage of girls who fail in the Intermediate in subjects like Latin, Mathematics and Science.  I can speak with a certain amount of authority on the question of Latin, at any rate, because I have put a considerable number of girls through my hands in the University in the subject of Latin.  I have always found that their knowledge was very much inferior to that of the boys. There is something the matter with the teaching of Latin, at any rate&mdash;I can say that for certain&mdash;in the secondary schools for girls.  I think that it would be worth having some investigation into, because it is rather important.  It has a most peculiar result in the University. The fact that girls come to the University from secondary schools without any knowledge of Latin influences their selection of courses for one thing, and influences their whole future in the most surprising way, it might be said. I have been making inquiries from some of the people who can speak, perhaps, with most authority on this matter, and from some of the girls themselves, as to what exactly is the reason for this failure in Latin on the part of girls in secondary schools.  One reason that has been suggested to me is rather peculiar. It is, that up to recently at any rate&mdash; I do not know whether it is so up to the present&mdash;there is no such thing as women inspectors of secondary schools. We have never had such an institution. <Col N="2518" /> I do not know whether we have it now, but we certainly had not until quite recently.</P>
    <P>It was represented to me that all men have a sort of fixed idea in their minds that girls cannot learn either Latin, Mathematics or Science, and that therefore girls are not encouraged to take Latin, for example, at a sufficiently early age in the secondary schools to learn it in a thorough way.  Girls, of course, are compelled to take Latin for matriculation in the University.  The result is that they take Latin in their last year and try to cram a sufficient amount into their last year to enable them to get through the matriculation, with the result that they may get through the matriculation, but when they come up to the University their knowledge of Latin leaves a great deal to be desired.  I think that is a point that is worth putting forward.  It is a matter that might be remedied.  I do not know whether the suggestion that we should have women inspectors is too big a proposal to make for such a small point, but it is a suggestion that is perhaps worth consideration.  In any case I am glad Deputy Fahy raised the point, because it is a serious drawback in secondary education and deserves to have consideration given to it.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to a matter raised by Deputies Thrift and Anthony, and that is the question of pensions and better rights for secondary teachers.  I wish to join with these Deputies in asking that the matter should be dealt with at the earliest possible moment.  It is clear to any observer, considering our whole scheme of education, that the greatest defect in the system at present, and for many years, has been the position of the secondary teachers, not only in regard to pensions, but also in regard to their status, their salaries and the conditions of their work.  It is a remarkable tribute, as a matter of fact, to that most hard-working and most patriotic class of men that they have given such extraordinary good results as they have given to the country under such miserable and poor conditions as they have to work.  I think that if any proposition to spend money on education, such as we had yesterday, is put before the Dáil almost the first matter that <Col N="2519" /> should receive consideration is the question of secondary teachers.  Even if it is necessary to find money in order to deal with that question, I think it should be dealt with as soon as possible, and I hope that before the adjournment we will have some indication of a proposal for legislation to give some satisfaction to the secondary teachers as regards pension, and that when the legislation appears we shall find that our secondary teachers are coming off at least as well out of that legislation as are their colleagues in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>As nobody else seems desirous of speaking on this particular matter, I take advantage of the privilege of concluding on the amendment.  The only really serious speech, in my opinion, apart from the speech of the leader of the Labour <Col N="2520" /> Party, in this debate has been that of Deputy Thrift in introducing the amendment.  I disagree altogether with his conclusions, and I hope to go fairly closely along the lines that he has travelled.  There is very little necessity to deal with and analyse Article 48 of the Constitution.  He did that very thoroughly, and I only regret that he did not think it worth his while to take up the Petition and parse and analyse it for us in the same way as he did Article 48.  If he had done so I do not think he would, for a moment, have suggested that there was anything slurred over or that there was any attempt to do anything in respect of this Petition except in the most strictly constitutional way.  I took the pains to read what was said when this Article 48 was passing through the Provisional Parliament, and I may have occasion, as I go ahead, to deal with some of the remarks made then. The first sentence is this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas may provide for the initiation, by the people, of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now this was discussed in the Provisional Parliament, and the only point raised in connection with it was whether it should be mandatory on the Oireachtas to provide whether the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be put in there.  The only reason given as to why it should not be made mandatory was that the circumstances of the times were such that it was not certain that within a year or two it would be possible for the Oireachtas to fulfil the obligation which &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would impose upon it.</P>
      <P>Now, let us come to the next sentence.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Should the Oireachtas fail to make provision within two years, it shall, on the petition of not less than seventy-five thousand voters on the register, of whom not more than fifteen thousand shall be voters in any one constituency, either make such provisions or submit the question to the people for decision in accordance with the ordinary regulations governing the Referendum.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrast these two sentences with <Col N="2521" />&ldquo;may&rdquo; in the one case and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the other.  If you take into account the debate that took place at the time there is no doubt that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; there is obligatory.  There is a definite obligation on the Oireachtas on the Petition. It does not say on the receipt or on the presentation of the Petition, but &ldquo;on the Petition.&rdquo;  Why was it put in by lawyers?  I have seen the draft signed by three of the judges either of the Supreme Court or of the High Court.  I gave the names when I introduced the Petition.  Are we going to assume that these people did not know what they were doing, just the same as we are asked to assume in connection with Article 17, that Lord Birkenhead did not know how to make a thing obligatory or not in his draft? I say here that that was deliberately put in to compel the Oireachtas on a Petition being signed, and not to give the Oireachtas the simple way, and by saying, &ldquo;Oh, no, we will not look at this Petition of yours.  You may sign it as long as you like, but by the simple process of turning our backs and refusing to receive it we can get out of any obligation to receive it.&rdquo;  I say there is a moral obligation, and that anyone who wishes to perform his moral obligation is bound to receive it, on its being signed when he satisfies himself that it fulfils the particular provision made there.  Now what are the provisions made in Article 48?  The provisions made there are that it shall be signed by not less than &ldquo;seventy-five thousand voters on the register, of whom not more than fifteen thousand shall be voters in any one constituency.&rdquo;  The Oireachtas is bound, and this Dáil, as part of the Oireachtas, is bound to do its share when the Petition has been signed and presented, or rather when made aware of the fact that it is signed it is bound to fulfil its obligation in this matter.  I say you are not fulfilling your moral obligation, as imposed by this Constitution, if you try to get rid of it by the simple process of saying you are not taking it; &ldquo;you may present your bill, but I am not going to examine the account and pay my debts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now what is it the Oireachtas is <Col N="2522" /> compelled to do?  What is it that is made mandatory on the Oireachtas to do on being made aware of the signing of this Petition?  It should, of course, satisfy itself, in the first place, by the setting up of examiners that the Petition is of the character indicated or intended in this particular Article.  It should satisfy itself, that seventy-five thousand voters, of whom not more than fifteen thousand voters have come from any one constituency, have signed it.  I hold that once this Petition is brought to its notice, as having been duly signed, it is the business of the Oireachtas to set up examiners to see whether the conditions here imposed are being fulfilled, and when that is done and if it cannot show that the conditions have been violated, then I say it is its duty to do one of two things made mandatory in the Article. What are the two things?  One is that it should make provision for the Initiative. Those are precisely the terms of the Petition which has been signed.  I shall take that Petition later and do some of the parsing on it that Professor Thrift did on some of the Articles on the Constitution.  The Petition was most carefully drawn up. I knew perfectly well, from the attitude of the Executive Council, that if there was any chance by any legal quibble they would get out of their obligations. And in order to make sure that they could not get out of their obligations I got it drafted by the best legal authority that I could find, and one by the way who is not associated with our political Party, who could take a calm, impartial view, and who did it from a purely legal standpoint.</P>
    <P>The phrasing is objected to on the pretence that there are two Petitions, and this by men who admit themselves they are only laymen.  I say if they read this as ordinary English they will see it is correctly drafted.  These men put themselves up, although they disclaim any such intention, against a legal authority upon this matter.  In the drafting this legal authority took the precise words of the Article.  When I brought this first before An Ceann Comhairle we had a long talk in connection with procedure, but there was never a suggestion for a moment that this Petition was a double-barrelled <Col N="2523" /> Petition, or that it was drawn in any way except in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution.  The first suggestion of that kind came from the President.  Deputy Little, on our side, stressed a certain argument which was quite legitimate, but to a point in which he made a mistake.  He said that this Petition having been signed, if it is accepted, when the Initiative was set up we might use it afterwards for another purpose.  Of course, that could not be done.  First of all the Petition would be impounded here with the Clerk of the Dáil or the Clerk of the Seanad or somewhere else and, therefore, that Petition would not ordinarily be available for a second purpose.  In any case there is no need to do it.  If there is any difficulty about it later, I shall get Deputy Little's argument and show that it was a perfectly legitimate, natural argument as to the difficulty, in fact, the most extraordinary hardship, we put upon ourselves to get this thing signed, by making it quite clear that one of the constitutional amendments which we propose to use the Initiative for ultimately was to get this constitutional amendment, namely, the elimination of Article 17.  I hope I have made it clear that the Oireachtas is bound to act on this Petition.  On this Petition being presented here formally, it is quite clear that no one, wishing to put an obligation on the Oireachtas, would leave such an easy way out as for the Oireachtas to say, &ldquo;We will not look at it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next thing is this: &ldquo;Any legislation passed by the Oireachtas providing for such initiation by the people shall provide,&rdquo; and it goes on to say that if the Oireachtas acts on this Petition, either by starting out of its own initiation at once on receipt of the Petition to make the necessary provisions for the initiation, or if it prefers to refer the matter to the people, then let the people decide whether there should be initiation or not.  It says in either case that any legislation passed by the Oireachtas providing for such initiation by the people shall provide&mdash;&mdash;.  It limits, in other words, the powers of the Oireachtas as regards legislation in respect to the Oireachtas in these <Col N="2524" /> particular matters.  The first point is, that such proposals may be initiated on the petition of 50,000 voters on the register.  That means that if you are making legislation, as a result of a petition being signed and brought to your notice, you must if you are to keep within the Constitution provide for these proposals for legislation by the people.  When the people start to make proposals for legislation they must be initiated by them on the petition of 50,000 voters on the register. That is the matter of voters necessary in order to initiate the legislation.</P>
    <P>The second point is that if the Oireachtas rejects the proposal so initiated it shall be submitted to the people for decision in accordance with the ordinary regulations governing the Referendum.  That is, if there be a petition from the people for certain changes in the Constitution, or requesting that certain laws be enacted, and if there be a petition signed by 50,000 voters to that effect, this Oireachtas may of course accept or reject, but if it is going to reject then the questions which have been initiated by the people shall be submitted to the people again for decision in accordance with the ordinary regulations governing the Referendum.  The third limitation on the powers of the Oireachtas as regards legislation in the matter is, that if the Oireachtas enacts a proposal so initiated, such enactment shall be subject to the provisions respecting ordinary legislation or amendments to the Constitution as the case may be. That means that legislation that would be passed as a result of the people's initiative would have to conform to the limitations which are imposed upon ordinary legislation in this House.</P>
    <P>This House, I take it, is not going to be the judge in disputed matters. Where legal matters are in dispute, we have, time after time, heard it here that these matters are referred to the courts.  There is a definite way for deciding whether certain things are ultra vires in accordance with this Constitution or not, and surely such a decision as that would not be taken.  This House would not presume, if the people on their initiative want a certain thing passed, to sit as a court of judgement and say, &ldquo;No, that thing is not possible <Col N="2525" /> in accordance with the Constitution.&rdquo; The people, I take it, are above us.  If we are going to deal with this thing properly as a democracy, we must take it that the supreme sovereign authority in the country are the people.  I, for one, have never denied that proposition.</P>
    <P>I take it the people, and by the people I mean the people of the whole of this island, under present conditions are not able to apply that particular test.  But, surely, this House is not going to take on the position of interposing itself between the desire of the people to do a certain thing and say: &ldquo;No, you cannot do this because it is not in accordance with the Constitution.&rdquo; That is a matter to be settled otherwise.  What Deputy Thrift and those associated with him propose is, because they think that this thing is ultra vires, that they should interpose at this stage and stop it.  We say that they have no power to do it.  I have got the written opinion of four senior and three junior counsel on this very matter.  Every one of them holds that Article 17, as it stands in the Constitution, need not stand in it at all, and still the Treaty be strictly carried out.</P>
    <P>What excuse has been put forward&mdash; what decent excuse, and I use the word advisedly&mdash;for rejecting this Petition and refusing to receive it, to examine it, and see whether the Petition is signed in the proper manner or not?  I see none.  I do not see anything in Deputy Thrift's suggestion but a means of shelving the whole thing, and of getting out of a moral obligation by another process.  It is simply the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; attitude.  I am prepared to take it that Deputy Thrift was acting in good faith, just as the Labour Party were probably acting in good faith when they suggested here some time ago that there should be machinery put up here to determine the procedure that would be necessary in connection with this Petition.  I am quite willing to admit that.</P>
    <P>This is a petition to the Oireachtas, and the Oireachtas does not sit in one place.  Laws are made by the Oireachtas but, as I have said on a former occasion, the Oireachtas does not sit together.  It is a stage in a certain process. The most natural thing in the <Col N="2526" /> world is that if you want to present a petition to the Oireachtas you present it first to the Dáil, which, I take it, is the democratic House and the House in which legislation usually originates. After this House had done its duty in the matter&mdash;we have done our part, I take it, for instance&mdash;if there was a real Executive here that wanted to carry out its obligations and wanted to act as a real Executive for this assembly, it would, on this petition being presented and on being made aware that such a petition was in existence, straight off, with its legal advisers or otherwise, devise a process by which this thing could be done.  But to say now that you are not going to do this, and particularly when we have the threats made from the other side, from the Minister for Education, the last day, the definite assurance that they were going to remove this Article from the Constitution, in view of all that I say that I cannot regard Deputy Thrift's amendment as anything but a means of shelving the whole thing, of causing delay until such time as those who do not want to act on the obligations can side-track them.</P>
    <P>Let me come back to the terms of the Petition itself.  The Petition, as I have said, is signed in accordance with Article 48.  The first part is introductory: &ldquo;We, the undersigned, whose names are set forth in the second column hereof, and whose addresses are set forth in the third column hereof, being voters on the registers for the constituencies and registration units indicated.&rdquo; Then it goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We, the undersigned,.... hereby request that provision be made for the initiation by the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments,&rdquo; and in particular for a certain constitutional amendment which is indicated.</P>
    <P>Take the words of Article 48: &ldquo;The Oireachtas may provide for the initiation by the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments.&rdquo;  The identical words, the very words which Deputy Thrift, when dealing with the first sentence, said defined for him the Initiative.  They request, therefore, that provision be made.  What they request the Oireachtas to do is, to make a certain provision, and nothing more, <Col N="2527" /> and the moment the Oireachtas or the Dáil gets that request, it is morally bound in duty, if it has any respect for moral obligations, to accede to the request to make the provision or put the matter to the people whether they want the Initiative or not.  Confusion is caused by the existence of two &ldquo;fors.&rdquo;  I was not responsible, and the lawyer that drafted this was not responsible for that.</P>
    <P>The question is when you have a request that &ldquo;Provision be made for the initiation by the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments, and in particular for the constitutional amendment following,&rdquo; is there anybody here who would say that this English sentence is capable of any interpretation but one from the context, particularly when it has reference to an Article of the Constitution in which the intention is quite clear.  If more was asked, then the Oireachtas is not bound to give it.  The Oireachtas clearly would only give that which it was bound to give, and refuse to recognise anything else.  If there was any intention, which there is not, to ask the Oireachtas to do something more than it was bound to do, then those who do not want to do that would have a good case for refusing to do it.  But it is not asked to do anything more than to receive or consider a request: &ldquo;That provision be made for the initiation by the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments.&rdquo;  That is, pro vision be made so that the people may make these proposals for laws or constitutional amendments, and in particular may make proposals for this particular constitutional amendment which they indicate.  If they are at liberty to make proposals for constitutional amendments in general, surely it does not in any way interfere with their rights by indicating a special one &mdash;that kind of constitutional amendment they want.  It does not, of course.  They simply indicate a certain one in which at the moment they are particularly interested.  Some people may be interested in the Initiative for one purpose, and some people may be interested for another.  For instance, I indicated earlier that I was particularly interested in the Initiative because <Col N="2528" /> it gave people the opportunity of changing the Constitution when they wanted to do so, and I think that a very valuable power, for history shows, I have said already, that wherever there is a cast-iron constitution&mdash;it was tried very often in France and in other countries&mdash;and when any attempt by means of such cast-iron instruments was made to defeat the will of the people, it has generally resulted in the whole thing being swept away.  I do not say that fundamentally a law, particularly if that law had the full approval of the people, could be easily changed.  I do not say that, but if there is a strong desire on the part of the majority of the people to change it, then the people ought not to be defeated in their desire by any instrument of this particular kind.  Therefore, I say the Initiative would save the nation from the danger which I foresee, and would save it from the action which is bound to come. Now, I will be told in a moment that whenever I mention an argument of this kind I am threatening, and gentlemen on the other side will say they will not be threatened.  That is nonsense.  It has nothing to do with the question. The fact is that if you tell people there is a fire there, and that if they put their fingers into it they will be burned, that is not threatening.  It simply means you are indicating that certain reactions will follow if they put their fingers in the fire.</P>

      <P>That is not the lesson of Irish history, and it is not the lesson of history in other countries.  I say that you ought to act in a commonsense way and give no reason for anything of the kind.  I think you will agree with me that whatever Deputy Gorey's views may be as to whether the fire is there or not, that as long as it is the opinion of a large number there is such a fire, and when you take the existence of the Free State Army to an extent which is regarded as abnormal, and the existence of a very large police force, these and other things of that kind do in fact indicate there is something there at any rate.  I say that the simplest way to save yourselves the expense <Col N="2529" /> of arrangements of that kind is to put out the fire, that the best way is to try and make arrangements that such instruments would not be necessary at all.  That is my chief interest in the Initiative.  It gives people the opportunity of changing the Constitution and preventing it from being a cast-iron instrument.  Some member of the Labour Party&mdash;Deputy Davin or somebody&mdash;suggested that Party were interested in the Initiative from another point of view.  They were interested in it as a means of enabling them to pass laws which might not otherwise be passed in an Assembly like this.  I understand and appreciate that.  I said that I was not strongly interested in the Initiative from that point of view, but I am not going to object to anyone making it possible to change laws or to have laws passed on the initiative of the people.  I know there are complications and difficulties which would not exist in the case of using the Initiative for changing the Constitution.  This Petition is simply a request that the Oireachtas will make provision for the initiation by the people of proposals so that the people may initiate proposals for constitutional amendments.  When the time comes to put it to the test we will put it to the test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to whether the particular constitutional amendment herein indicated is or is not within the Constitution, because you see that a certain use of the Initiative might bring up a question in which you think that an issue might be raised which would be ultra vires as far as the Constitution is concerned, are you going to put up a barrier to prevent the question being considered at all?  I say you have no excuse for that.  Anybody with a sense of moral obligations is not going to allow these obligations to be side-tracked by considerations such as are being adduced here.  I have not dealt with some of the arguments brought up by the other side.  I do not know whether it would be better not to deal with them, because if ever there was a case in which I had the satisfaction, and I confess it was a great satisfaction, of seeing falsehood wriggling, twisting and turning in front of truth, I had it when I saw the wriggling, twisting and turning <Col N="2530" /> on the other side in connection with this matter.  It was a satisfaction to see the situation which always exists when you have truth facing falsehood.  Can anybody here tell me how you are going to get out of this obligation?  Is there anybody here who can tell me there is any honest way in which you can turn your back upon a petition that has been signed in accordance with this particular Article?  I do not see any.  That is why I am opposed to Deputy Thrift's amendment. It gives a way of killing it.  If they are going to do that let them do it with all the moral obliquity attached, and tear it in front of the world, but do not go behind back doors to do it.  We have indicated, so far as we are concerned, our view as to the extent to which this is morally binding on the Irish people.  Our attitude towards it is that it is not, that this Constitution which was, first of all, made subject to a Treaty which was imposed on the Irish people by force&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of parliamentary procedure, the position is that the Treaty is a schedule to the Constitution and is therefore law.  From that point of view except on one procedure and by one method the Treaty cannot be criticised.  There must be some finality in regard to such a statement as &ldquo;the Treaty was imposed by force&rdquo; and so on.  The position is that these matters are law and they cannot be criticised inasmuch as criticism of them is criticism of the House itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is when proceedings under Article 48 take place.  The criticism of that Article which did take place here was during proceedings on a Bill, which, among other things, proposed to exclude Article 48 from the Constitution. In general, it is quite a reasonable position to say that when you pass a Statute you have to leave it there until you amend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>But before you proceed to amend anything you must show where it is defective.  This particular petition will be one of the reasons brought up by those who say that we are asking&mdash;which we are not &mdash;in this petition to have Article 17 eliminated.  We are not asking that at this stage, because we could not do so. Article 48 has nothing to do with it. That will come when the Initiative is set up and when provision is made to have it removed.  Then you can talk on that matter, but at present it is not relevant.  I have, however, to deal with it because there has been confusion created by having this red herring, or whatever you like to call it, drawn across the track.  It is important, because it may have some influence on the minds of Deputies as to whether this particular amendment indicated here could, when the right time comes, be dealt with under the Constitution. I say it could.  We have been fortified in that opinion by several lawyers of the highest standing, and by the fact that those who drew up the draft Constitution, which was taken to England, did not have any such oath in it.  We take it that these men drew up that in accordance with the Treaty as they were supposed to do.  They said that they were taking the Irish interpretation of it.  Very well.  In that Irish interpretation there was no oath.  It came in at a later stage.  It was not obligatory.  I think I could quote the Minister for Finance from reports of the debates of the time showing what his opinion was so far as that was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is that lawyers who have taken this and interpreted it coolly and calmly hold that in the Article of the Treaty which governs the Constitution that oath is not obligatory.  What is made obligatory is, if we read that Article, that if any oath is to be taken it must be this one.  If there is to be an oath to be imposed it is the one indicated. That is the considered opinion of some of the principal lawyers here in town, who have not any direct affiliations and who gave their opinion as professional men.  I hold that if provision is made for the Initiative, and if we proceed in that particular way to get this Article removed, it can be removed <Col N="2532" /> and we would still be within the Constitution&mdash;that it will be so held by the court, if it goes to the court.  That is my position.  The Ceann Comhairle objected to my talking about the conditions under which the Treaty was signed or the conditions under which this particular Constitution was drawn up, as his ruling is that what is the law is there.  Very well; that makes it all the more reason why we should in our ordinary daily lives outside&mdash;no matter what we have to do here to conform to order&mdash;when we see this thing, want to find a way in which it will be remedied. It is through the Initiative we hope to remedy it.  It is not likely, apparently, that it will be quickly remedied in this House.  That brings up another question dealt with on the last occasion here.  I think the Minister for Education made the astounding statement that it was not democratic.  It is not democratic to go to the people and put a definite issue, untrammelled with other issues, and ask them whether they are in favour of or against it.  That is a new theory of democracy.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is more democratic to go to them with a thousand and one things entangled and in which personalities, especially at a general election, are involved and say that we are going to get a clearer decision from the people than we would if a single issue were submitted to them.  I think that every reasonable man will see that one of the values of the Referendum is that the people get an opportunity of deciding on one particular issue.  When voters want to vote for an individual they often want an honest representative and one who will stand up for their interests.  They may not altogether be satisfied with his policy, but sometimes they are prepared to take a certain amount of chance with regard to policy, as they believe that they will get better service from an honest representative of whom they have knowledge than from one with whose professed policy they may be more inclined to agree.  All of you who have been through elections know that it is true that elections are not a proper test of the opinion of the people on individual issues.  You cannot separate them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2533" /> The reason why in modern democracies you have the Initiative and Referendum is precisely to get over that difficulty.  If I were talking here on the value of a Referendum purely and simply, apart from the Petition, I would hold that it would be good and proper to set up machinery by which separate issues like that could be put before the people.  We are not really settling the question here as to whether the Initiative is good or bad, though we have mentioned it in the debate.  We are not dealing with the question as to whether it is within the Constitution or not to remove Article 17.  The one sole question we are dealing with here and which I put to any honest-minded Deputy&mdash;and those of you who have a conscience on this matter will remember that you have taken a solemn obligation in connection with this particular matter to act honestly in accordance with this instrument&mdash;and the one question we have to decide on, now that this Petition has been brought to your notice, is whether it has been signed in accordance with the specifications.  I say it has been, and that there is no other secondary question involved, no question of attempting to do a thing by unconstitutional methods, no attempt whatever to use, as has been suggested here, the Constitution to break up itself.  Nothing of the kind.  This is a definite case in which an Article of the Constitution is being invoked in order to have established for the people the Initiative. I find it very difficult to think that anybody who has any regard for moral obligations is going to agree to the amendment which simply means doing a thing in an indirect way which you do not want to do the other way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thrift's amendment simply seems to be following out the suggestion: &ldquo;Do not tear up the Constitution in public.  Do not do it, because Fianna Fáil, when the time comes along, will be inclined to do the same thing.  You will have set a bad precedent, and they won't be slow to take advantage of it to do something else. Gain time and give the Executive, who have clearly indicated the view that they do not want this Article in the Constitution, an opportunity of bringing in an Act to do away with Article <Col N="2534" /> 48.  Give them time to pass this Act. Keep this thing out of the public eye. Do not tear it up in public, but tear it up in private.&rdquo;  Deputy Thrift made an appeal for unity, and he said to us that there are important things that we could do in the country.  I admit there are important things all round us, but what we have been trying to do for a number of years is to put matters on such a stable foundation that we could get on, without any distraction, to deal with the things that are necessary&mdash;social programmes, etc.  I doubt if the people whom Deputy Thrift spoke of as making sacrifices are prepared to do as much or to go as far as we are prepared to go on social lines.  On every occasion, on the question of unemployment, the question of education, the question of old age pensions, we have been on the side, not of those who are wealthy, but on the side of the plain people, and on that side we hope to remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>If &ldquo;no income tax&rdquo; has been suggested from these benches, it has been suggested only with the idea that there might be more work and more opportunity for the working people.  It has not been suggested as a means of differentiating or discriminating in favour of the richer class.  I have not put forward that proposition, but I know it was put forward because those who put it forward thought it would result in better opportunities for the working people. If it could be proved for an instant that it was going to have the opposite result, I for one would oppose it, no matter who brought it forward.  I say to Deputy Thrift, in connection with his appeal for unity, that there is no section of the people more anxious for unity, not alone in the twenty-six counties, but throughout the whole of Ireland, than we are.  We are trying to bring about unity here, where we believe we can help to do it, and I would suggest to the people for whom Deputy Thrift speaks that if they would try to influence the people with whom they have greatest influence, the <Col N="2535" /> people who are trying to prevent the people of Ireland from being a united nation, they have a sphere of activity there in which they would do good. We, on our part, know the conditions down here at any rate.  We know them somewhat better than Professor Thrift, amongst the plain people for whose unity we are anxious, and we say that there is a division here which can be got rid of, if an opportunity were given for all the people to be represented here.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to say that because all the elected representatives of the people happen to be here, that the whole people are represented.  They are not.  There is a large section of the people who are not represented and they are kept from being represented mainly in my belief&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash; because of the existence of that Article 17, which I believe can be removed.  I am most sympathetic with any appeal from any quarter in regard to the unity of the people down here.  I have worked for unity in the only way in which I think we can have unity, and that is on the basis of the full satisfaction of the desires of the Irish people.  I believe that we are building on sand on any other conditions, and I am trying to get to some bedrock on which we can put aside these political questions which are running across and which have run across Irish history and Irish efforts for many centuries.  I would say to Deputy Thrift that if he would go back on the history of those years he would find that when the Irish farmers were striving for their land, they were opposed by this particular section, who fought every inch of the way for their privileges.  I do not want to go back on those things but I would like to say that as far as we are concerned, to bring in those people and to get them as part of the assembly representing the nation is a more meritorious work than even to get unity on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that the people for whom Deputy Thrift speaks are represented here.  There is no one who worked in the Sinn Fein movement who did not think that it was a pity for Ireland that the teachings of Thomas Davis were not hearkened to <Col N="2536" /> by the Unionists and the Imperialists whose home, intellectually, at all events, was across the water.  We regret that, and we believe that they are a big loss to the nation.  We regretted that they fought, as they did stubbornly, every inch of the way.  We regret still more that there is a section up there in the North which is still fighting against what is the natural course of things.  There is not one in the whole country or no section who would not be satisfied and delighted, even among those on whose behalf, though not at their request, I am trying to get this thing established, to see unity.  I want, for the good of the nation, to get people who have energy, ideas and enterprise, and who would be of infinite value here, working along the lines in which it is proposed to work here.  I say, no appeal for unity from the opposite benches, or from any quarter from which it comes, no appeal for the advantage of the nation, and for the uplifting of the people, will fall on deaf ears on this side.  I say that to Deputy Thrift.  I say if he would ask those for whom he speaks to work amongst the people with whom they are most likely to have most influence as we are working now, amongst the people with whom we believe we have influence, then he will be serving the country.  It is going to be very bad for the country, I hold, if when there is an obvious and an easy way by which these difficulties can be removed down here, you are going to get away from your moral obligations by referring this matter to a Committee which really means shelving it.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by a few words with regard to procedure.  The leader of the Labour Party has suggested that the idea of this thing was all right, but that I had adopted the wrong procedure. What procedure could I have adopted? There was a clear indication of the intention of the Executive here to have nothing to do with Article 48&mdash;to cut it out.  They do not want the Initiative. They were beginning to come to a point like our people in the North, where they wanted to get rid of even Proportional Representation.  They were in power, they were in office, and anything that threatened that is just like the big <Col N="2537" /> nations at present when they want to get into a compact which will relieve them in the matter of all they grabbed by force.  These people are in power, and all their interest is to try to put up barriers around themselves so that they will not be deprived of that power.  The Executive clearly showed their hand in that regard.  Were we to come along here and ask the Executive, who are a majority here, to arrange the procedure by which this Petition could be presented? It was clear that it was necessary to do it by some way in which there would be some compulsion, and we adopted the way there would be compulsion, moral compulsion, if it has any influence.  That is the way we adopted it, and there was no procedure necessary further than this&mdash;to present the Petition to the Dáil, and if the Dáil wished it could make further procedure in accordance with the wishes of those interested in the Petition.  The only thing that the Dáil should interest itself in as regards the procedure is to see whether this Petition is what it purports to be, namely, a Petition signed by 75,000 voters, and then to set up the examiners.</P>
    <P>I will not keep the House any longer. I am deliberately refraining, particularly on account of the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, from going into some arguments used by the other side.  I <Col N="2538" /> think, on the whole, that perhaps it is just as well.  Our position is pretty well-known through the country and is pretty well-known to the Deputies, and there is no need to keep on constantly repeating it.  I will simply ask the Deputies&mdash;I will ask all those who believe in honour, I would put it at that, who believe in acting honourably and straight, to refuse to accept Deputy Thrift's amendment, because it can have only one result in my opinion.  The people have signed this.  They want it. At least, that is the indication as far as a particular test which the Constitution imposes is concerned&mdash;namely, that you should have 75,000 voters.  We got 96,000.  We got them from every part of the country.  The fact that at the last General Election we had 410,000 voters would show that we can get the biggest number that was suggested at any time as the number necessary for the Initiative&mdash;the very biggest number that it was suggested would be sufficient to get the Initiative started.  If the number were 200,000 we could get them.  I have no doubt we could.  Therefore, there is a substantial section of the people who have signed this Petition in accordance with Article 48, and I say it is the duty of this House to act in accordance with the wishes of those people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now put the main question as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you going to permit this to be discussed as an original motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>It has already been sufficiently discussed as an amendment.  The usual procedure is that when a question is put down and an amendment to it is submitted, both the main question and the amendment are discussed.  The procedure adopted in this particular case, as in another recent case, was that the mover of the motion was allowed to conclude the debate.  It was understood, I think, that he was concluding the debate on the whole question.  That is the usual procedure.  I understood that Deputy de Valera asked me, after the amendment was proposed, whether he would have a right to conclude, and the procedure was then clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not so clear to me.  The only matter I wish to draw attention to as regards this is that if it is going to be debated as an original motion, then, first of all, there is a question of petitions in it.  It is quite obvious what was intended in the Constitution was only one petition. There cannot be a number of petitions. There is only one petition&mdash;the petition &mdash;and then it is a question of arranging procedure.  My opinion, as I indicated, <Col N="2541" /> is that this is quite contrary to the whole intention of Article 48.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you put the question, I suggest that that particular amendment ought to be discussed with special relation to the last two lines. The point Deputy de Valera has just raised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy raising a point of order as to whether the amendment was, in fact, in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not raising a point of order in connection with the amendment, but I am making this suggestion: that up to this stage the amendment has been discussed purely in relation to Deputy de Valera's original motion, and we had not considered that particular aspect of it that it would rule out, or it might be held afterwards that the acceptance of this amendment by the House would rule out, certain petitions on the grounds that they were not contemplated in Article 48 of the Constitution.  Before the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question of order, is it not?  The passing of this motion, the Deputy suggests, would rule out certain other motions that might be subsequently put forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned only with the motion for the presentation of a petition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the question of granting leave for the presentation of a petition, purporting to be prepared in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution, be not further considered until the Oireachtas has prescribed the procedure to be adopted for the presentation <Col N="2542" /> of the petitions contemplated in Article 48 of the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that sufficient attention has not been directed to that aspect of the amendment.  The wording is: &ldquo;of the petitions contemplated under Article 48 of the Constitution.&rdquo;  By the insertion of the definite article there, it is assumed that there are certain petitions which might be presented to this House but which would not be petitions of the kind contemplated under Article 48 of the Constitution, and I think that is a matter that we ought to discuss fully before we take a vote on the amendment as a substantive motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever about the procedure that was to be adopted, and I think it was understood&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I did not understand it in that sense.  I purposely left over what I regarded as minor matters to this particular stage.  I dealt with the amendment rather in its relation to the original motion.  There is another question that, of course, immediately comes up once you look at this as the original motion, and that is, how long is it to be deferred?  Is it to be sine die?  If you fail to arrange for the procedure it can never come forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that we are really in rather a difficulty if we do not face this and debate it as a special issue?  It seems to me that the two motions are related as follows: The motion is that &ldquo;I do marry Alice.&rdquo;  Now, the alternative is that &ldquo;I do not proceed to marry Alice until I have the consent of her mother.&rdquo;  The second motion is proposed and seconded.  There is no reason in the wide world why I should accept the motion, which now broadly means that as soon as I get the approval of the mother I shall marry Alice; I mean that the two things seem to be quite irrelevant.  A Deputy may vote quite reasonably for Deputy Thrift's amendment as against the original proposition, and may be thoroughly averse to marrying Alice. What I suggest is that we have not <Col N="2543" /> solved the problem at all.  All that we have done is, as between two courses of conduct, both of which may be objectionable, we have decided which is the least objectionable, but have not decided that either is desirable, and until we do debate Deputy Thrift's motion we have not decided anything of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What about voting on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly no doubt about the procedure, and the analogy that was adopted was that of the debate on the Unemployment Motion, which was proposed by Deputy Morrissey.  A certain amendment was proposed, and it was then decided that Deputy Morrissey should conclude the debate. It was that particular procedure that I had in my mind when I answered Deputy de Valera's question on the 23rd May.  Deputy de Valera said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As a question of procedure and order, is it my right to close the debate on the amendment as mover of the original motion?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Deputy who moved the main question has a right to conclude on that question; but if an amendment is proposed and the amendment is carried, the Deputy who moved on the main question has, I think, lost his right to conclude the debate.  As a matter of practice, the Deputy who moves the main question, under procedure of this kind, should always have an opportunity of speaking on the amendment; and it has been found the practicable method to allow that Deputy, by agreement, to conclude the debate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Subsequently I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think, if there is no objection, he may be allowed to conclude the debate on the amendment itself.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2544" /> That may have led to some misunderstanding, to the belief that there would be a subsequent debate upon the main question as amended, but that certainly was not the intention, and I feel personally, as I said, that the practical scheme appeared to me to debate the two things together, and if necessary have two divisions, having allowed the mover of the main question to conclude the debate.  But I cannot say how the main question, as it now stands, can be debated at all without repeating all the arguments already used, and without, in fact, debating a motion which is on the Order Paper, namely, a motion for the setting up of the Joint Committee.  I think that any argument that was to be used against the amendment should have been used in the debate on the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>From what you have just read, I can see that it might have a meaning different from that which I attached to it, and that was, that in closing the debate on the amendment I was closing the debate as a whole when I spoke on the amendment. That was not my understanding at first.  I purposely left aside certain considerations until this would become the main question, because I did not want to bring in matters that were relatively small in connection with the choice between the two.  One of these points is the Petition.  It is clear that there is only one Petition contemplated in Article 48.  The moment you have got a petition signed by 75,000 voters there is only one, and therefore it should be &ldquo;the petition.&rdquo;  Then there is another matter that is of importance in this connection, and that is: Does this mean postponing sine die the whole question?  Because it is quite clear that unless the Oireachtas has prescribed the procedure, unless a definite limit is set, they can postpone settling the procedure for ever, and therefore this matter would never be considered again.</P>

    <Title>PRIVATE DEPUTIES BUSINESS. - LOCAL AUTHORITIES (OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES) BILL, 1928&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Bill, 1928, be read a Second Time.  The Act that this Bill is intended to amend is the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, No. 39.  That Act provided in the main for the setting up of a Local Appointments Commission and, generally, made provision with respect to appointments by local authorities.  We propose to amend that in a number of respects, the chief one being that where the Act provides for sending down the name of one person, it shall be discretionary for local bodies to ask that instead of a single name being sent down to them for an appointment, a panel of names shall be sent to them. The difference in effect would be this, that the local bodies whose officers the appointees will become will have a choice before them when making the appointment.  As every Deputy knows, there has been a good deal of discontent with the manner in which appointments have been made up to the present. The local bodies have felt that this particular Act gives the Commission power to send them down a certain person and that they have no choice whatever, the result of which is that they have become purely ratifying <Col N="2548" /> bodies; in fact they have not that power.  They have hardly the power to refuse, so that their functions in the appointment of their own employees are practically nil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I take it the reason why the original Act was passed was because there had been a certain amount of dissatisfaction in the country with the way in which appointments were made when the full power of appointment remained with the local bodies.  But I think the Act went to the other extreme, and now we have a great deal of dissatisfaction with the Local Appointments Commission.  The talk about corruption which formerly was fairly frequent with respect to the local bodies is now turned on to the Local Appointments Commission.  I am not going to go into details as to whether there is any justification for that or not.  Other Deputies will be speaking and will probably refer to certain appointments.  As far as I am concerned, I am dealing with this thing on general lines.  I think there will be far greater confidence if we use the existing Civil Service Commission as the machinery by which candidates for appointment will, so to speak, be examined. Take the position of an ordinary local body and confine yourself for the moment to technical and professional appointments; a certain professional or technical appointment has to be made.  Members of the Board will not regard themselves as competent generally to judge of the professional or technical qualifications of the candidates.  They would like to set up some technical or professional examining body to report to them on the qualifications.  I am assuming that you have a local body anxious to be perfectly fair.  To get the best possible servants it would be well, I think, to have a certain amount of uniformity in the method by which qualifications would be examined.  Whilst we are anxious to give to the local bodies the fullest possible power consistent with certain safeguards, we think that it would be well to have the qualifications of all applicants examined by some central body that would act for the country as a whole.  So the effect of getting this work done through the <Col N="2549" /> Civil Service Commission would be really to establish a central examining body for all local appointments instead of having each local body setting up technical and other sub-committees or professional committees to examine into the qualifications in each case. What damage can be done?  I believe it will restore confidence.  I am asking myself, and generally the Deputies here, what possible damage can be done if you send down to the local bodies if they ask for it a panel of candidates, those who have been examined with regard to their qualifications and whose qualifications have been found satisfactory by a central body like the Civil Service Commission.  You may say to me: &ldquo;Why change from the Local Appointments Commission to the Civil Service Commission?&rdquo; The reason I do it is because I believe ultimately there will be a moving forward towards having generally a national service as far as local appointments are concerned, and I think it would be a step in the right direction.  I think it would lead probably to greater confidence and also to possible economy by having it all done by the Civil Service Commission. We think on those grounds there is no point whatever in having a special local appointments commission.  The Civil Service Commission can act for the local bodies just as well as they are supposed to act at present for the central authority.  You will mark, therefore, that the main change, at least as far as Section 7 is concerned, is that we are making it optional for the local bodies to ask for a single person if they want to.  If they wish to rid themselves of any question of having to select themselves, if they do not want to exercise the power of selection, then they can ask for one, but if they do not wish to hand on that power to the Civil Service Commission then they can ask for a panel of persons.  If they ask for a panel of persons then there must be sent down to them a panel of not less than three.  If the Civil Service Commission are prepared to submit a larger number of names then that is all right, but they must, at any rate, send down three unless there have been fewer than three qualified applicants and if fewer than three applicants who are qualified <Col N="2550" /> come along they send down the total number of those who are qualified.</P>
    <P>The two things aimed at so far are, first of all, transferring to the Civil Service Commission the powers at present vested in the Local Appointments Commission and, secondly, this giving to a local body the option of asking for one or a panel.  From that point you see that any charges or suggestions of corruption or favouritism or anything of that kind will be got rid of, at least very largely, because the local people can only exercise a choice amongst perfectly qualified condidates, the best the Civil Service Commission have been able to find from amongst the applicants.  As far as the central body is concerned, it is pretty clear that they cannot be using that power to put in any particular individual. At least the possibility of favouritism from the centre is limited to the extent that they have sent down three applicants and cannot at least send down the particular one for whom they want the appointment.  Before I pass away from the suggestions of corruption and all the rest, there is a broad feeling that in the past, if there were anything of the kind in local bodies everyone knew about it.  It was so well known that it became the talk of the countryside, and to that extent there would be a check upon it.  For instance, if a doctor was not really a suitable officer they knew perfectly well if the local bodies selected such that the poor people in the neighbourhood would have to suffer and there was a responsibility on the local body therefore.  They were known locally and that responsibility was perfectly clear to them and the people who elected them knowing that they would have responsibilities of that particular kind to discharge so that I say the difference in the whole case people feel is this: formerly corruption was nearly almost always revealed.  There was a check, therefore, by publicity on it.  But they feel at present, if there is favouritism of that particular kind at the centre, there is no check of any kind upon it; and it can be done in a much more wholesale way when all is said and done. There is just as likely to be pressure <Col N="2551" /> of a wrong kind brought upon a central body of that particular kind if the complete power of making appointments is in their hands.  You are distributing the making of the appointment by sending down three candidates and you are, therefore, to that extent, you cannot do it absolutely, doing away with any basis for charges or suggestions of corruption. I think it is very important that there should be public confidence that appointments of this kind are made in the interests of the community as a whole and not to give jobs to friends or anything of that particular kind.</P>
    <P>I will pass on to another feature of the Bill.  Section 5 of the existing Act gives authority, in certain cases, to the local bodies to make appointments.  It would be, perhaps, as well to read the section as a whole, so that we may thoroughly understand the effect of the amendments.  The section is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  An appointment of a person to fill an office to which this Act applies may, subject to the sanction of the Minister&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have heard some discussion as to whether that means prior sanction or subsequent sanction.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;be made by a local authority without requesting or obtaining a recommendation from the Commissioners under the subsequent provisions of this Act if, but only if, the appointment is made within three months after such office became vacant, or (in the case of an appointment to a new office) was created, and the person so appointed is a person who at the time when such office became vacant or was created (as the case may be) either (a) held a pensionable office under the said or any other local authority, or any two or more local authorities, the duties of which related to matters the same as or similar to the matters to which the duties of the vacant office relate; or (b) was in receipt of an allowance from the said or any other local authority, or any two or more local authorities, in respect of his having ceased to hold an <Col N="2552" /> office under the said or any other local authority, or any two or more local authorities, the duties of which related to matters the same as or similar to the matters to which the duties of the vacant office relate...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We propose to insert an addition to that section.  We propose that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Principal Act shall be construed and have effect as if the following words were inserted after paragraph (b) thereof, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Provided that in the case of a vacancy for an executive office under a local authority the person appointed to such vacant office is a person who held a pensionable office for not less than five years on the clerical staff of the said or any local authority or any two or more local authorities and that such person shall have passed a qualifying examination conducted according to regulations made by the Commissioners; and</P>
    <P>Provided also that in the case of a vacancy for a professional or technical office the local authority shall have power to appoint or promote an officer holding a similar pensionable office under the said or any local authority or any two or more local authorities subject in all cases to the ratification by the Minister of such appointment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Act as it stands allows local authorities to make appointments within a certain period and to select and appoint those who hold a pensionable office in their own or a similar local authority or those who were in receipt of an allowance from a local authority.  Our addition provides that the person shall have held office for not less than five years on the clerical staff and shall have passed a qualifying examination according to the regulations to be made by the Commissioners.  As regards technical officers, it is provided that they shall be eligible if they have held a similar pensionable office under the said local authority.  The effect of that is to give powers of promotion and transfer and to give them under definite conditions, the persons affected having passed a certain qualifying examination. <Col N="2553" /> It envisages the setting up of examinations for important offices and that those who have five years' service shall, on passing the examination, be eligible for appointment.</P>
    <P>The offices to which I refer are the chief executive offices&mdash;that is to say, the office of secretary to a county council, the office of secretary to a board of health, the office of accountant to a county council, the office of secretary to a county committee of technical instruction, the office of secretary to a county committee of agriculture, the office of chief clerk to a county council and the offices of clerks to borough and urban councils.  We think it is only right that there should be an opportunity of promotion for existing clerical officers and that they should be enabled to qualify for such promotion by passing an examination after five years' service. When a member of the clerical staff has five years' service and passes an examination to be held by the Civil Service Commission, he will be eligible for a local appointment.  Similarly with technical and professional offices.  In the case of technical and professional appointments, they could promote an officer who held a similar pensionable office under the said local authority. The effect of that is to offer a career in a sense to the officers of local bodies. You give the local bodies an opportunity of selecting from those who are qualified.  The qualifying examination is to be held by the Civil Service Commissioners. The Commissioners, by this Bill, would be given power to make regulations of various kinds, either with respect to particular appointments or with respect to a class of appointments. These particular regulations would be published and brought to the notice of the Oireachtas by laying them on the Table in the same way as regulations made by the Civil Service Commissioners at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is the further point that in the case of examination for technical and professional appointments local connection and local experience should be a particular consideration.  I think that most people will agree that that is fair. You have a certain amount of local patriotism and it is not a bad thing at all.  Local rates are burdened sometimes <Col N="2554" /> with scholarships to provide for the education of some brilliant children of the community and in the case of a person who is brought up in a certain community, who has lived amongst them, and is as able as an outsider&mdash; things being equal otherwise&mdash;there is no reason why that should not be taken into account and a special preference given to such a person.</P>

      <P>To make assurance doubly sure will not be any harm. Deputy O'Kelly will deal with the matter in more detail than I propose doing.  I am confining myself to the main features.  First, as to restoring confidence as regards appointments, there is a strong demand that the appointments should go back to the local authorities as they were.  I think there is the possibility that if the present system is continued, and if as much dissatisfaction continues to be expressed on it as there is at present, it will ultimately mean that the local bodies will demand that they get these powers back.  I think that would be going to the other extreme.  I think that we should do the thing which is done in other cases, and done very satisfactorily, and that is send down a panel of fully qualified candidates from which an appointment could be made. I hope we are all agreed on this, that it is advisable to give the local bodies as much independence as possible and to throw as much responsibility on them as possible.  The more government becomes complicated and the <Col N="2555" /> more central governments are charged with duties which they would not have had to perform some fifty years ago the more advisable is it that details should be left to local bodies.  There seems to be a tendency here to concentrate. There is seemingly a feeling of jealousy that no one but the central authority can act honestly and right. I think that is unfair.  I think that in the case of local bodies there ought to be as much anxiety amongst them in regard to their local services as there is here in the central body, and that we ought not to say that the local bodies are going to be corrupt or that this particular centre is going to be the model.  We are all drawn from the same people.  We are all supposed to be representatives of the people.  If the people in the constituencies and in counties select Deputies and send them here, they similarly select representatives for the local bodies, and I do not think you can on any fair grounds say that there is a better chance of having a thing done more purely here at the centre than by having it done locally. If it is so, then there is something particularly wrong, and the best way to cure that is to throw responsibility upon them and use a certain amount of supervision.  I do not say you ought to lead them into temptation.  By no means.  I say that temptation is just as likely to have its force at the centre as down locally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did not the Deputy ask what the procedure was?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard a good deal about the procedure, and had a great number of complaints.  I have definitely refrained myself from dealing with some of these matters, but I feel they will probably be dealt with by others.  I do know the procedure at present.  I took pains myself to go and see people who were called in for certain purposes from the point of view of examining certain candidates and so on.  I do know something about the method that is in force at present.  As I have stated, I am not giving my own opinions on this thing.  There is a strong feeling abroad that things are not as they should be.  Any distrust <Col N="2556" /> of that kind is bad, and it means there is unnecessary friction.  The object of sending down a panel is that you are keeping whatever is good. There is one justification for having a common examination body and that is that you get equality of standard.  You can have a certain standard and see that it is kept up throughout all parts of the country.  I do not think that any local body will object to have passed on to an expert body this special examination which otherwise would be carried out by some committee of their own.  If we are to throw the responsibility on local bodies we ought not to go out of our way to do things which they can only interpret as indicating suspicion.  If there are local bodies that do not want to take these powers we should give them an alternative, and they can ask that only the name of a single person be sent down.  I believe there are some who will do that.  There are occasions in which local bodies would be rather glad to get out of certain difficulties that would arise by asking a central body to make the appointment.  They will have their own choice.</P>

      <P>I do not suppose I shall have much opportunity of dealing with the Second Reading of the Bill now.  It has three main objects. First, to secure that the Local Appointments Commissioners would consist of the same personnel as the Civil Service Commission; second, to secure that the discretion which is vested in the Local Appointments Commissioners by the Act of 1926 in regard to the sending down of one or more than one person to be recommended to the local authorities shall be removed and vested in the local authorities; and third, that the discretion in the matter of selection shall be similarly effected. The other changes are minor ones. The Deputy has overlooked one serious flaw in this Bill which I suppose he will attempt to remedy.  By repealing one of the sections of the Principal Act which enables a staff to be paid, there would be no staff left to discharge the duties that would fall to be discharged.</P>

      <P>It would be <Col N="2558" /> under the Local Appointments Commissioners. It will be within the recollection of the older members of the Dáil that when the Civil Service Commission was set up it consisted of two civil servants with the Ceann Comhairle.  That comprised the personnel of the Civil Service Commissioners. The work of the Commission itself is pretty extensive.  To ask that the same body with the Ceann Comhairle, who is a member of the Civil Service Commission, should do this work is certainly not appreciating the extent of the time and the work that is involved.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
