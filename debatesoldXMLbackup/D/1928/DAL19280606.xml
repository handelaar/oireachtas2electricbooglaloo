    <Speaker pid="SamuelEHolt" hpid="Mr. HOLT Mr. HOLT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOLT</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been drawn to a report of an interview with officials of the Agricultural Credit Corporation published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 31st ultimo, stating that only persons of such economic standing as would entitle them to expect credit from a bank are the persons who could expect a Corporation loan; and whether, in view of this statement, he will state what steps he proposes to take to expedite the granting of loans to farmers who are not of such &ldquo;economic standing&rdquo; as is indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The Deputy will appreciate that considerations that must weigh with any body of persons engaged in the making of loans are the probability of success of the undertaking proposed and the security offered for repayment; the Government could not undertake to bring any pressure to bear on the Directors of the Corporation with a view to having these primary considerations waived.  It is anticipated, however, that many farmers whose credit and economic standing would not, if taken by themselves, entitle them to borrow from the Corporation, will be assisted to obtain the funds they require through Agricultural Credit Societies.  No time will be lost in pressing forward the formation and development of such credit societies in the Saorstát.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the considerable delay which has arisen in the preparation of certificates for subscribers to the Dáil Loan of 1919-20, due to no fault of the subscribers, he will consider the advisability of granting interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on the bonds, such interest to date from the 1st June, 1927, when the bonds became payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="5" />
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to agree with the suggestion that subscribers to the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan are not in any way responsible for the delay which has occurred in authorising repayment in certain cases.  I would remind the Deputy that although public notices were inserted in the Press in the beginning of 1925 inviting subscribers to apply for repayment, not more than a very small proportion did in fact apply within the prescribed time.  The majority of subscribers did not apply until after the 1st June, 1927.  In many cases in which application was made, the particulars furnished by the applicants did not correspond with those recorded in my Department, while in many others it was not possible to authorise repayment because those responsible for the collection of subscriptions in certain areas did not furnish particulars of the subscriptions collected.  Efforts are being made to obtain these particulars in cases in which they are still outstanding.</P>
      <P>An amendment of the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act, 1924, would be necessary to enable me to pay interest as suggested by the Deputy, and I am not satisfied that a case has been made for the introduction of legislation to that end.</P>
      <P>I should like to say in addition that I attended at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and promised to make a general statement to the House on the procedure adopted in regard to the verification of applications for repayment of the Dáil Eireann Loan; the position which has now been reached; the difficulties which have to be contended with; and generally to make Deputies themselves understand the position better when they are face to face with constituents who may ask questions on it.</P>

He has had several opportunities of showing that the answers of the manager are not correct, but he has not done so.  I suggest to him that he is needlessly wasting the time of the Department and the House in further pursuing this matter.</P>

      <P>Actual claims to compensation have been received in very few cases.  The usual procedure is for negotiations in settlement of compensation to be initiated by a valuer acting on my behalf.  Agreements as to compensation have been reached in 80 cases and 50 cases are in the hands of the valuer. The usual cause of delay in arriving at settlements, where it is not unreasonable claims by the occupiers, is the difficulty experienced in getting proof of title from the occupiers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the advisability of appointing some separate section of his Department to deal with this?  My information is that those people are looking for compensation, and their title is that which most people have for their holdings in country districts.  These people are incurring a good deal of hardship and suffering from want of compensation.  In some cases I know the houses are unfit to dwell in because <Col N="8" /> of the injury done them.  The lands have been acquired and they have received nothing for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a section of my Department specially arranged for dealing with this; secondly, the mere fact that a house is damaged, and compensation is not given, is not proof either of unreasonableness on my part or delay on the part of the Department; it depends upon the claim made; and thirdly, I cannot discuss these cases in the vague.

      <P>The measures taken by the police in Co. Mayo to check the speed of omnibuses are similar to those employed generally throughout the Saorstát.  One stop-watch was issued to divisional headquarters, which made arrangements for the establishment of secret controls in the various districts comprised in the division, the stop-watch being passed as required to the officer concerned.  In view of the recent growth in motor omnibus traffic in Mayo, it has been decided to allocate another stop-watch for use in that division.</P>

I would like to know if he considers that one stop-watch is of any <Col N="13" /> use whatever to the Gárda to check the speed of motors.  In addition, I would like to know from the Minister if he considers that one stop-watch is sufficient where the length of the county is eighty miles and the breadth fifty miles, and where hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent on road-building and maintenance. Then, I would like, A Chinn Comhairle, with your permission, to read a letter I have here from the Chief Superintendent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The years of service in respect of which the pension was granted make up the period from the 23rd April, 1916, to the 30th September, 1923.  The Board of Assessors reported to me that Seán O Muirthuile rendered service as required by the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, throughout that period.</P>

      <P>Inquiries have been made into this case by the Commission's outdoor staff, and benefit to the amount of £3 13s. 9d. has now been paid to Wm. Mulligan.  It seems delay, for which the Department was not responsible, was due to some doubt as to what Approved Society he belonged to.  With a view to a possible increased payment of benefit further inquiry is proceeding.</P>

      <P>With your permission, A Chinn Comhairle, I want to ask <Col N="32" /> if a decision has been arrived at by the Committee upon Procedure and Privileges, with reference to the question of sittings of the House on Catholic holidays.  I am reminded that this question will come up again, on account of to-morrow being one of the most important Catholic holidays of the year.  Not having heard whether a decision has been arrived at, I would ask you, sir, to let us know how the matter stands and if it would be in order now, if there was general agreement in the House, to bring forward a proposition to adjourn over to-morrow, seeing that it is one of the most important Catholic holidays in the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kelly raised this matter on the 11th May, with regard to sittings during the following week.  I suggested then that it was one which might be discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and promised that I would have it raised there.  The question was raised at the Committee of Procedure and Privileges and this is the relevant minute of the Committee of Thursday, May 17th: &ldquo;Sittings on holidays of obligation.  Following upon the reference made in the House on Friday, May 11th, this matter was considered by the Committee.  It was pointed out that it had not been the practice heretofore, that the Dáil should adjourn over a holiday of obligation, and as it appeared that sittings on only three, or possibly four, of the holidays, were likely to be affected, and on these days mainly when the holidays occurred on Thursdays, it was agreed that no action should be taken at present.  The matter would, however, be reviewed if there appeared to be a considerable volume of opinion in favour of a change in practice.&rdquo; In other words the Committee did not come to any decision that there should be any change in practice.  In fact, the Committee did not really consider the matter of putting it to a decision, as to whether as a matter of practice we should not meet on Church holidays.  To that extent I think Deputy O'Kelly has not been met.  That is to say, a decision has not been come to, on the question of altering the <Col N="33" /> existing practice, or as to whether or not the House should meet on Church holidays.  If the Deputy desires to pursue the matter further, the Committee can be asked to report formally to the House on the question of meeting on holidays of obligation, and let the House take a decision.  With regard to the question of sitting to-morrow the question, of general agreement, could be settled now.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any agreement to adjourn the sitting over to-morrow but it might be possible, if there is any volume of opinion in favour of it, to let the matter be considered again by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and to have representations made from the different Parties to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  There does not seem to be any reason for departing from the custom we have followed up to the present as far as to-morrow is concerned.</P>

      <P>Would Deputy O'Kelly be satisfied if the matter were taken to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and if the Committee were to report to the House on the matter?  The Committee in this case will be glad to hear any Deputy who desires to make representations on the matter.</P>

      <P>I think I can say on behalf of Deputies on this side of the House that our opinion is that we ought not to sit on a Catholic holiday. However, I suppose that will come up again, and that somebody will take the initiative and bring the matter before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I suppose we may take it that there is no likelihood of an adjournment over to-morrow?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention to shelve this question?  There appears to be a lack of moral courage amongst Deputies in dealing with the question. I, for one, suggest that there is nothing to prevent anybody from attending to his religious duties to-morrow and coming here to do his work afterwards, but I do not see why this House should be called to adjourn over any religious holiday.  We are here for three days of the week, and if we are not to sit <Col N="34" /> on holidays we will be letting a lot of Deputies loose on the public who would be much better engaged in this House, where they would probably commit far less sin.</P>

      <P>There are two alternatives from the point of view of the Chair: that we ought to discuss the question in the House, or that we ought to refer the question to a Committee.  I think, if there was agreement, the matter should be discussed in Committee.  As a matter of fact, there is nothing before us which would enable us to discuss the matter now.  Deputy O'Kelly, having given me notice that he would raise the matter after questions, was entitled to do so. The matter will come before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and if the Committee report to the House it can then be discussed.  I suggest that we should pass from it for the present.</P>

      <P>The object of this Bill is to put a corporation into the same position as an individual for the purpose of taking out probate.  As the law stands at the moment, a corporation may be appointed an executor or trustee, but there are certain defects from which the corporation suffers. There is no provision in the law as it stands enabling a corporate body either alone or jointly with individuals to take out a grant of probate.  The result is that where a corporation is named executor in the will the administration of the will must be granted to the nominee.  The whole Bill is aimed at allowing corporations to act either alone or jointly with others.  Of course, it is understood that the whole matter is still left practically at the disposal of whoever appoints trustees or executors.  There is nothing in this that changes that position.</P>

      <P>(1)  In addition to the jurisdictions conferred on the Court of Criminal Appeal by Section 34 of the Principal Act, the Court of Criminal Appeal or, on appeal, the Supreme Court shall have the following jurisdictions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Court may notwithstanding that they are of opinion that a point raised in an appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred;</P>
      <P>(b)  where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and the jury by whom he was so convicted could on the indictment have found him guilty of some other offence, and on the finding of such jury it appears to the Court that such jury must have been satisfied of the facts which proved him guilty of that other offence, the Court may instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal substitute for the verdict found by such jury a verdict of guilty of that other offence, and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed at the trial as may be warranted in law for that other offence;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  where the Court reverse a conviction in whole, the Court shall have jurisdiction to make an order (in this section referred to as an order for a re-trial) authorising the person in respect of whom such conviction was obtained to be retried for the same offence as that which was the subject of such conviction and may by such order give such directions as to costs as they may consider proper, and may by such order or any subsequent order <Col N="41" /> direct the person in respect of whose conviction the order was made to be retained in custody or to be admitted to bail on such terms as they think proper.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever an order for a re-trial is made under this section by the Court of Criminal Appeal or the Supreme Court the person in respect of whose conviction the order was made may, notwithstanding any rule of law, be again indicted and tried and, if found guilty, sentenced for the offence which was the subject of such conviction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole of this Section 5 hangs together. The object of Section 5 is to prevent persons who have been found guilty by a jury and who have appealed to escape the consequences by making use of pure technicalities.  I submit to the House that that is wrong.  I submit that the proper course for us to adopt is to have a code of administration of the Criminal Law which will be perfectly fair to the prisoner, and, at the same time, will not unduly load the dice in the prisoner's favour.  There may be a mistake made by a jury, because that is really what paragraph (b) deals with, and not a mistake, as Deputy Little suggests, made by the judge.  That would come under (a) or (c).  But this is a mistake made by the jury.  Take a case where the jury <Col N="42" /> has evidence before it that a man is guilty of a particular crime.  He is charged with two offences, and the jury find him guilty of one which, as a matter of law, the Court thinks they should not have found him guilty of on the facts as found to be proved; and they have acquitted him or disagreed upon the charge which in the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal is a charge upon which they should have found him guilty.  I think because a mistake of that nature has been made &mdash;and I submit this to the House&mdash;that it would be unfair to the community if that man got free.</P>
      <P>Let me take a case.  Suppose a man is indicted, let me say, for rape, and that he is indicted at the same time for indecent assault.  The jury can find him guilty of one or the other according as the facts before them justify finding him guilty of one or the other.  Suppose the jury find him guilty of rape in this case and the Court of Criminal Appeal is of opinion that he was not guilty of rape, but that he was, in fact, guilty of indecent assault, then they would have, as the law stands now, to quash the finding altogether.  That means that a man who would be a menace and a danger to society would go scot free and unpunished through what is nothing more than a mere technicality.  It might happen in a huge number of cases, for instance in the case of larceny and false pretences. There is no doubt, let us say, that the man did a criminal act in the case to which this section refers.  It is perfectly clear that the man did a criminal act.  He has been found guilty.  The facts have been found by a jury and the Court then rather on a question of law says that the jury found him guilty of crime A and not crime B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the House to reject this amendment.  I consider, however, that this Section 5 and the whole thing which lies under Section 5, is a matter of great importance.  I do not think that it is our Party and our Party alone which should be interested in the clean administration of justice in the country and in the punishment of guilty persons.  What I said on the debate on the Rules of Court I am going to say again here.  The responsibility of administering the law is the responsibility <Col N="43" /> of the whole House and the whole House should be interested in it. I am not going to make this a Party question in the slightest.  I am going to leave this entirely to the mature judgment of the House.  But I leave it to their judgment with the strongest recommendation that I can give and perhaps the House will pardon me for a moment if I say that at one period of my life the atmosphere of a criminal court was not completely strange to me. I leave it with the strongest recommendation that I can give to the House, knowing that nothing could be worse in the matter of the administration of justice in this country than that a guilty man should escape on a mere technicality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister is taking up this attitude on Section 5, because we on this side are also keenly interested in the administration of justice.  We are interested in having the law administered in the most perfect manner that is possible. We consider that if sub-sections (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) are omitted and sub-section (2) left out that the Bill would be improved, because the courts have power under paragraph (a). Under paragraph (a) the court may, notwithstanding that they are of opinion that the point raised in an appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal, if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. So that the judge has power to decide the question on a substantial miscarriage of justice without going any further.  We say that the Bill should not give to the judge the power which belongs to a jury.  It is a wrong principle to give a judge the power which is the power of a jury and it is because we are interested in the fundamental principle of law that we object to paragraphs (b) and (c).  We believe that the Minister would get all he wants without these two paragraphs. The judge has full power, for if the judge considers that it is a case where a substantial injustice would be done and that there would be a miscarriage of justice he may dismiss the appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Little's interpretation. Deputy Little seems to think that sub-section (a) would cover sub-section (b).  That deals with a completely different subject-matter.  I would point out to Deputy Little and to the House generally that sub-section (2) is at present in the English Act and that it is at present in the Scottish Act.  As a matter of fact, I have the Scottish Criminal Appeal Act, 1926, and it is, word for word, the same as this section which we are asking the House to introduce into this Bill.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and the jury could on the indictment have found him guilty of some other offence and on the finding of the jury it appears to the Court that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved him guilty of that other offence the court may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the verdict found by the jury a verdict of guilty of that other offence, and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed at the trial as may be warranted in law for that other offence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So there is no wonderful departure here.  It is the experience of other countries and the experience of our own courts we are going on when we ask the House to pass this sub-section.  I promised on the Report Stage that I would add certain words to that sub-section. Deputy Rice has an amendment to this sub-section which I purpose to accept.  On the Report Stage I will, myself, add those particular words.  I mentioned that, I think, in my reply speech, on the first day.  Perhaps the House would permit me to draw their attention to the words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and the jury by whom he was so convicted could on the indictment have found him guilty of some other offence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court sees the facts which the jury found and nothing else, and they say those facts in law do not amount to the offence, either greater or lesser, that the jury found him guilty of, but <Col N="45" /> they do refer to another offence.  It is really a question of law they decide. They decide no new facts; they act simply on the finding of the jury.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly. Take the example I had.  Suppose a man were properly found guilty of larceny, but a certain amount of illegal evidence had been admitted of matter which was not very relevant or important.  Then under (a) the court would say no substantial miscarriage of justice has been done.  But if instead of being found guilty of larceny he had been found guilty of false pretences though he should have been found guilty of larceny, then (a) would not apply at all, (b) would apply.  I suggest to Deputy Little if (a) contains (b) what is the objection to having (b) in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Because (b) contravenes a principle of law.  It usurps the power of the jury.  The other attitude under the case is&mdash;the jury has made a technical mistake, if you like, though I think the jury would not make a mistake if the charge were not wrong.  In any case, I think in the case of (a) the judge would decide that there was not a substantial miscarriage of justice and would let the matter rest.  By letting it rest it is not interfering with the jurisdiction of the jury.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied that this section should pass.  I am looking at it simply as a layman and I think the only protection for the citizen is the protection afforded by trial by jury.  I see here a means by which the judges would be able to say, by inference, that the jury thought so and so or must have thought so and so. I think that is a wrong principle.  The point is that it is set out here &ldquo;on the finding of such jury it appears to the court that the jury must have been satisfied of the facts which proved him guilty of that other offence...&rdquo;  There is inference there by the judges with which I do not agree.  As to the question of prisoners getting off on technicalities, I take it that the technical processes of law have been built up in order to make it possible to administer justice properly and to prevent injustice. I take it that these technical processes have been developed from that point of view and I am not prepared to say that we should simply set those aside because a man might get off on a technicality.  If these technicalities exist, I take it there is some good reason for their existence.  The reason, in effect, is that there have been abuses or that it is foreseen that abuses would occur if these technicalities were not observed.  Unless a better case is made by the Minister, I propose to oppose this sub-section.</P>

      <P>Nobody in this House has a higher respect for the knowledge and experience in criminal law of the Minister for Justice than I have.  I am exceedingly grateful that he is giving Deputies on his benches, and those allied with him, an opportunity of supporting this amendment.  I propose to support the amendment in the name of Deputy Ruttledge.  I can <Col N="47" /> claim some slight experience in criminal courts in a number of capacities and in a variety of places.  My experience is how what it was thirty-five years ago when I started in the humble position of an advocate defending the dock.  My experience is now, as it was then, that it is a very dangerous thing to tamper with the existing principles of the criminal law.  I entirely agree with what Deputy de Valera has said.  When a man is tried by jury, the jury, let us say, finds him guilty of an offence.  The Court of Criminal Appeal finds that that conviction is unsustainable.  But that Court of Criminal Appeal, before whom he has never appeared in person, find him guilty of another offence and he is sentenced behind his back.  I do not think that is fair.  It would be introducing entirely unconstitutional procedure.  I, with full conviction, support the amendment standing in the name of Deputy Ruttledge.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy de Valera and to <Col N="48" /> Deputy Wolfe, I should like to point out that this is an entirely new matter. The Court of Criminal Appeal is quite a new court.  These are not technicalities that have grown up through the ages.  Up to the passage of the Act which set up the Court of Criminal Appeal here, the finding of a jury was, for practical purposes, final.  There were possibilities of a case being reserved on a question of law for the Court of Crown Cases Reserved.  But that seldom happened and, on mere questions of fact, the finding of the jury was final.  Prisoners were later given a right of appeal and you must bear in mind that it is only the prisoner, and not the prosecutor, who has the right of appeal.  I submit to the House that that right of appeal which was given should be so safeguarded that it will not afford an avenue of escape for a guilty person but that it will carry out what was in the minds of those who framed it and will be an avenue of escape for the innocent and for the innocent only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 2 (a) on behalf of Deputy Ruttledge: &ldquo;In sub-section 1 to delete paragraph (c).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading I pointed out the objection I had to paragraph (c) as to paragraph (b), and I dealt with the reasons very fully.  Here is a very fundamental principle of law being violated again.  This is one which I think the Minister for Justice translated by saying that a man is not to be put in danger twice.  That is a fundamental principle, and for the reasons I advanced with reference to paragraph (b), namely, that these principles have grown up with a view to protecting the private citizen against the organised powers of the community, I suggest that it ought not to be violated without very good cause shown.  If a man has been tried and the Court of Appeal find that he has been wrongfully convicted, and the conviction is quashed on that account, that man should be allowed to go free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera repeated very much the same argument that he put on the Second Reading.  I think that Deputy de Valera has misunderstood the Latin maxim, &ldquo;Nemo debet bis vexari&rdquo;: that no man should be put in danger twice.  The law, as it stood before the introduction of the Courts of Justice Act, which set up this Court of Criminal Appeal, was that a man after the final determination of the charge brought against him could never again be tried upon that charge.  He had the right to plead in the old form of pleading in Anglo-Norman French: &ldquo;Autre-fois acquit,&rdquo; if he had been acquitted; and &ldquo;Autre-fois convict,&rdquo; if he had been convicted.  That was a complete answer.  If a man had been convicted and served his sentence, he could not be again charged with the same offence; and if he was acquitted of the charge, he could never again be charged with it.  In Scotland there is a kind of half-way house&mdash;there is a verdict of &ldquo;Not proven.&rdquo;  That does not exist here.  That principle still exists, and, as I understand that principle, it will exist whether the man is guilty or not guilty, whether this sub-section becomes law or not.  The maxim does not mean that no man should be ever tried twice.  Men are tried very often a second and third time.  Whenever a jury disagrees&mdash;when there has been no final determination of the case&mdash;a man can be tried another time; or, if a nolle prosequi has been entered by the State, a man can be tried another time.  It is only when there has been a final decision.  Winding up the proceedings, so to speak, that he cannot be again tried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> What happens under this section, if this becomes law, will be: there is a verdict of &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; by the jury&mdash;that would be the final verdict at one time; it is not now&mdash;it goes to the Court of Criminal Appeal and they can say, if this becomes law, that the trial was unsatisfactory. The man may be guilty or he may be innocent, but, according to the course of the trial, it has not been satisfactory, and he will be sent down to be tried a second time.  He is in exactly the same position as if a jury had disagreed.  That is precisely what happens.  He is no better or worse off than if the jury had disagreed.  Deputies will notice that in case there may be any hardship upon the prisoner the question of costs is left to the discretion of the courts.</P>
    <P>I submit that that is a badly-needed reform, and I ask the House, at any rate, not to defeat it by a &ldquo;short head&rdquo; as in the last race which we had. This is the considered opinion of the Chief Justice upon this matter&mdash;I am quoting from the &ldquo;Irish Law Reports,&rdquo; of December, 1927, in a case called the Attorney-General v. Smith:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This appeal suggests a question whether it would not be desirable that the Court should have power in certain cases to order a new trial.  It appears sometimes unfortunate that we have no alternative to quashing a verdict, where the complaint is simply that the real issues have not been tried at all, or that the manner of trying them has been so unsatisfactory as not to lead to a well-founded verdict.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not the opinion of an amateur; it is the considered opinion of the Chief Justice, who was, of course, giving judgment for three members of the Court&mdash;he was giving a judgment in which Mr. Justice Johnson and Mr. Justice Hanna concurred.  That is an expression of the opinion of our judges who find defects in the working of this code as it is.  It is a new code.  If you are breaking through any old-established principles, they were broken through when an appeal was given in criminal cases.  That was the breaking through &mdash;not anything we are doing now.  We <Col N="52" /> are dealing with a new Act passed in 1924 and we are dealing with it because we have found flaws in it, and, in the opinion of the judges who are administering it, this is a flaw.  I would ask the House to pass this and I submit that it is a perfectly fair and proper provision.  Our object ought to be to have the law perfectly fair, but not to have it in such a condition that it enables obviously guilty people to escape and dangerous criminals often to be at large&mdash;men who are a source of menace to the State to be at large&mdash; because there has been some slight error made in the trial of their case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that the accused would be in exactly the same position as if the jury had disagreed.  With great respect to the Minister I think that statement is entirely erroneous.  If the jury disagreed surely the court has not power to order a new trial.  If there is to be a new trial it is not the Court that determines whether there shall be a new trial or not.  Rather it is the authorities, perhaps the Attorney-General or perhaps the Minister for Justice who will have to say whether when the jury disagrees the prisoner shall be brought forward once more upon the same charge. Therefore I think that the accused is in an entirely different position where, as is proposed by this section, the Court itself shall be given the power to order a new trial.  The Court has not that power at present, that discretion rests entirely with the judicial authorities. But apart from that this is, in effect, introducing the Scottish system of &ldquo;not proven.&rdquo;  It is questionable whether that is a wise course or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a citizen of this State has been convicted on a criminal charge and he has appealed against that conviction and the Court of Appeal determines that it was not a proper conviction, I admit, that that may not be exactly tantamount to acquittal but it should not be, I submit, for the Court to determine whether there shall be a new trial, or not.  It should not be for the court to say this man should be brought forward again on the same charge.  It should be rather as it was before the introduction of the system of the criminal <Col N="53" /> appeal, a matter entirely for the Attorney-General or for the Minister for Justice.  In that case he must be guided by the nature and character of the charge and the evidence that was adduced at the original trial and also by the conduct of the court in both instances.  I do submit that it should not rest with the court itself to say that a man should be brought forward for re-trial upon a charge that the court has determined was not properly brought against him in the court below. The same argument, only to a greater extent, applies against this sub-section as against the previous one.  It is no use repeating the statement made by myself and others on the occasion of the Second Reading of this Bill against these proposed incursions as I might describe them into the existing liberty of the subject in the State.  I for one certainly if this matter goes to a division will vote in favour of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that as the Minister for Justice has left the last sub-section to the free vote of the House he will allow the same vote in regard to this present one.  Deputy de Valera told us that all the arguments used against the last sub-section could be repeated against this one.  I go, with Deputy Redmond, a step further than Deputy de Valera has gone, because not only can the arguments used against the last sub-section be used against this sub-section, but I go so far as to say this sub-section, creates such an innovation in the criminal law that the arguments are quadrupled against it.  The Minister for Justice most fairly told the House that what it was proposed to do was to take away one of the oldest planks in the liberty of the subject, the right of pleading autrefois acquit or autrefois convict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>You are taking away what was always understood by the plea of autrefois that no man should be tried twice for the same offence.  If that is not taken away by this sub-section, then I do not know what is.  It takes away from the subject the right, to a great extent, to the main principle of liberty which has been enjoyed for hundreds of years by the subject, namely, that no man can be put on trial twice for the same offence.  These principles are being taken away by the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they are.  It is a fact that a man can appeal against his conviction and if he successfully appeals what this sub-section attempts to do is to take away from him the right which he has always enjoyed that he cannot be put on trial twice for the same thing.  He has been tried once and if he appeals and is successful this sub-section gives power to have him put on trial again for the same offence.  I submit to the Minister that in the interests of justice and constitutional freedom and in the interests of the liberty of subjects in the Saorstát nothing could be more prejudicial than to make an innovation entirely unknown to the criminal law and to destroy one of the oldest planks in that system, and any such inroad should be resisted by every citizen of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion is made that because a man escapes by a technicality he should not be put on trial again. Technicalities form portion of the rights to which a man charged with a criminal offence is entitled and if you take that right from him you will be interfering with his liberty.  This is a sub-section which no criminal lawyer could for one moment defend.  I cannot understand what induced the Minister for Justice&mdash; himself an able and experienced criminal lawyer&mdash;to try and put on the Statute Book such a law as this.  He tried to get some authority, but the only authority he could get was a judge who never saw the inside of a criminal court.  I do not want to criticise judges but I ask the Minister to give some authority from anyone experienced in <Col N="55" /> criminal law in favour of this.  I do not think he will find any book or any such authority.  He has said something about having dangerous criminals abroad. Criminals are not the only cause of danger.  Judges who sit in criminal appeal without any experience of criminal law are, themselves, a danger, and it is left to a court such as this to say whether a man is to be twice imperilled. I am opposed to that and I shall continue to oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with every word which Deputy Redmond and Deputy Wolfe said in connection with this amendment.  The arguments which held good in the last case hold good in this even with greater force. When the Minister was reading the quotation from the Chief Justice it became quite clear to me that he was referring to cases in which mistakes were made by those who drew up the indictment. There is, however, another principle involved.  The whole machinery of justice is there against a man who is being tried.  The law authorities have ample opportunity of making the charge against him absolutely correct, so that if they make a mistake they must stand by it.  There was a judgment in the courts recently which was of a political nature and in which Mr. Justice Wylie gave a decision against the law authorities, pointing out that if a mistake is made on the pleadings the authorities had ample opportunity of doing the thing properly, and so they were not going to get an opportunity of going back and mending their hands &mdash;that the man must be tried there and then on the merits of the case as presented. It is unfair to the individual that the machinery of the law could be used so that frequent changes could be made by the authorities.  The reference to new trials after disagreement by the jury is, in my opinion, unfortunate from the point of view of the Minister, because anybody with a knowledge of Irish history knows very well how that power of the law officers has been abused in the past, and how when disagreements of juries took place in agrarian and political cases the prisoners were put back time after <Col N="56" /> time to be re-tried simply because it suited those in office to do so.</P>
      <P>That is an unfortunate precedent to quote in a case like this, where it might be argued that similar prejudice might be used to put prisoners back for re-trial. Although I admit that it may be a good thing to follow the experience of a country like England or Scotland on a particular point of law, and no one will deny the capability of lawyers there, we must take into consideration that conditions in England are different to those prevailing here. The amount of crime in England, possibly owing to the large industrial population, is considerably greater than here.  Undoubtedly there is more crime in England within a week than there is in a year in Ireland.  We are not on all fours with the position which exists in England, and it is not necessary for us to be as severe as they.  For that reason it is just as well that we should act on the principle of giving the greatest possible amount of mercy, and, in my view, it is better that ten criminals should escape through technicalities than that one innocent man should suffer an injustice in Ireland.  If it were otherwise, and if Ireland were a country where crimes of various kinds were very numerous and where a particular situation had to be dealt with, it might be a different matter.  That, however, is not the case, and I suggest to the Minister for Justice, in view of the temper of the House and the vote recorded on the last amendment, that he ought to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The attacks made on this section started off with a most extraordinary attack made by Deputy Redmond.  He said that the courts had power to order a new trial and that it rested with the Department of Justice or with the Attorney-General to say whether there should be a new trial.  I was astonished to hear such a statement from Deputy Redmond who, after all, ought to know something of the existing powers of the Attorney-General.  Whether under this section a new trial is ordered by the court or not, the power of entering a nolle prosequi remains with the Attorney-General, and Deputy Redmond <Col N="57" /> ought to be aware of that fact. Deputy Wolfe was tremendously eloquent about the liberty of the subject and made a very moving speech, but it appeared to me that he was shedding tears about a danger which exists entirely in his own imagination.  He started off by talking about the sanctity of the liberty of the subject.  We have extended by our legislation the cloak of liberty which is put around the subject to protect him.  We have given this Court of Criminal Appeal, which at common law did not previously exist, and it is because we have extended it that we do not want to see the extension which we have given, the added safeguards we have given, to the liberty of the subject, abused.  We want to see that the added safeguards, the added protection which we have given to the liberty of the subject shall be properly used and shall not be abused.  Deputy Wolfe said that we were taking away the old sacred plea &ldquo;autrefois acquit, autrefois convict.&rdquo; We are not.  When there is final determination of a case, when ultimately and finally the jury hear a case, and when on a new trial they come to a conclusion that a man is either innocent or guilty then such case is finished.  In the old time the moment a jury found a man guilty he had to suffer whatever sentence the law imposed on him.  That does not necessarily happen now.  He has this Court of Criminal Appeal to go to.  He has not been convicted.  His sentence, so to speak, is in the air.  He has been convicted on paper, perhaps, but not in fact.  He does not go to prison or pay a fine.  He remains in the position of a man about whose case the jury had disagreed.</P>

      <P>I thought I made that clear to the House. As to Deputy Little, he talked a considerable amount about political cases, and his whole speech seemed to be inspired by some political view.  We must bear in mind the fact that political cases are a very small proportion of the cases tried.  There might never be a political case to be tried under this section which we are now discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not dealing with political cases.  As I say, we are dealing with the ordinary administration of justice and ordinary crime.  We want to have a good and a fair system of administering justice.  Deputy Little says that the authorities have got great power, that they make mistakes and should <Col N="59" /> stand by them and that they should not be allowed to mend their hand.  That has nothing to do with this sub-section. This sub-section does not deal with mistakes made by the authorities.  This sub-section deals entirely with mistakes made by a judge or jury.  The particular case that I mentioned is the case of a judge, speaking of his own knowledge of matters that should have been proved, a relationship of certain trades he happened to know and which he happened to state to the jury without calling evidence.  The whole verdict was quashed.  Whether the man should have been convicted or not, I do not know.  It was only a case of larceny and was not important.  Deputy Wolfe made an attack on the court which decided this particular case and he said that the Chief Justice had never been inside a criminal court.  I do not know whether he was or not, but I know that he is a judge of very great eminence, and I believe he has the entire confidence of the community, whatever remarks Deputy Wolfe might make about him.  To say that Judge Johnson and Judge Hanna had never been inside criminal courts, as Deputy Wolfe said, is going a little too far, because I fancy few men have defended more prisoners in the country than Judge Hanna.</P>

      <P>I know.  He does not state it in such a way that it should be quoted here as a definite expression of opinion by the judge.  That was why I was anxious to have it re-read. The Minister for Justice spoke about a final determination in these cases.  I take it that the object is to get some final determination.  By putting them back for re-trial, then, you are defeating the principle that there must be some final determination, and I think the Court of Appeal ought to be the final determination in this case.  I need not repeat what I said about legal technicalities. It would probably be all right for a layman to sneer at legal technicalities because he would not understand them, but it seems to be wrong for a lawyer to sneer or to talk slightingly about legal technicalities in that way.  We all know these technical processes have been built up for the definite purpose of seeing that justice is properly served, and that a lot of the dangers in connection with the administration of justice have to be prevented by these legal technicalities and by being rigid in their observance. Where a layman attempts to try a case he is not conscious of the dangers which lawyers throughout the centuries have been trying to avoid.  I take it that if a person is guilty of a crime that the community, through its organisation, has the power and the authority to pursue such an offence in a proper and legal manner, and, if the person is guilty, to go through the legal way of finding him guilty.  In the first instance, if he has not been properly proceeded against, I think it is most unfair that the door should be open to the vexatious continuation of a prosecution in this manner.</P>

      <P>It seems hardly fair to Deputy Wolfe's argument to argue about the present personnel of the Courts.  It may be that at the present time one or two judges have a considerable knowledge of criminal work but the law is not going to be made for these judges only.  This thing is going to be here for all time.  It is conceivable you may have good judges, but they may not be suitable for criminal work.</P>

      <P>As regards Section 9, I would like some information as to the necessity for appointing two extra Circuit Judges.  I have been making inquiries and I find that there are Circuit Judges to spare half the year who could come to Dublin and do some of the work in arrears there.  I have been told, and I have taken the opportunity of verifying it, that there are districts where the Circuit Judges work on an average four months in the year.</P>

      <P>I did not expect the Minister would ask me that question, but anyhow I was prepared for it.  The position is that civil bills in most districts are under £25, and they go to the District Courts, and for five or six months of the year there are Circuit Judges idle and they could take up this extra work.  Could the Minister give us some information upon that point? I am not making this statement offhand. I have taken the trouble to find out whether it is true, and I am satisfied that it is true.</P>

      <P>There is a very considerable amount of arrears in Dublin, and there is also a considerable amount of arrears in the North-West, and in what is called the midland counties.  These are the only places where there are arrears.  In the western circuit I know myself that the judge there works very hard.  It is very difficult for him indeed to cope with all the business, and I think it is exactly the same with all the other judges.  I certainly have satisfied myself that it would be impossible to ask any of the Circuit Judges to do more than they are doing.  If you take Deputy Hogan's area, you will find that that is what used to be the area of the County Court Judge of Clare.  The one Circuit Judge is now doing the County Clare, the County Kerry, and the County Limerick.  In each of these areas there used to be a County Court Judge, and now there is a Circuit Judge doing the work of the three counties. That is an example of the extra amount <Col N="65" /> of work that is put on the Circuit Court Judges.  Every one of them is hard-worked, and to add to the jurisdiction of any of them would be quite impossible.</P>

      <P>The work of the Circuit Judge is going to be increased considerably, owing to the recent decision and to Section 8.  The recent decision will result in the judge having to do the work which the Master of the Court did previously.  It has not yet been defined what the jurisdiction of the Master of the Court is going to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Section 8 was passed rather quickly. I happened to be looking up another matter when it was passed&mdash;that the Minister would find some other way of meeting the difficulty caused by a recent certain decision of the court, and it is a very serious difficulty&mdash;this question of what is a judicial decision. It is only a judge can define that.  The Master of the Court, under the recent decision, can only decide certain matters where questions of law are not involved. Questions of law may be involved in any matter and will be <Col N="66" /> pleaded in any case.  The practical effect of that decision is to take away the whole jurisdiction from the Master of the Court.  What would happen then is&mdash;his functions are gone.  The object here, however, was to save the time of the judges.  That business is going to be thrown back on the judge.  I would like to ask the Minister what way he proposes to deal with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer is that until there is a real determination by the court of what is the meaning of the words &ldquo;judicial act&rdquo; it is impossible to do anything.  The courts have not usually decided.  They have given no definition.  Perhaps the judgment of Mr. Justice Murnaghan is the most enlightening of them, but still it does not lay down any general principles from which it is possible to infer what powers are to be given to the Master at the moment.  But if you assume that the sort of questions he had been dealing with are questions which he cannot, according to the Constitution, deal with, then either one of two things will have to be done; you will have to amend a section of the Constitution or else the Master is not to exercise these powers.  For the present, at any rate, we will not amend the Constitution; we will simply have to try and carry on for the present, at any rate, giving the Master only subordinate powers.  I do not think at the moment the difference would be sufficient for the convenience of parties to bring in a Bill&mdash;though I daresay it would be non-controversial&mdash;to amend that section of the Constitution by putting in a few words.  That is our attitude.</P>

The sections which I seek to repeal, Sections 87, 88 and 89 of the Act 30 and 31 Victoria, chapter 114, give a right of appeal from the Local Admiralty Court to the Admiralty Court of the High Court. There is also a general right of appeal <Col N="69" /> given by Section 61.  My proposition is that the confusion and doubt which now exists should be got rid of by repealing these sections and making it clear that &ldquo;an appeal from any judgment decree order or decision of the Circuit Court in an Admiralty case shall lie under the provisions and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 61 of the Principal Act.&rdquo;  In other words, put all appeals on the same footing and get rid of the doubt that exists where there are two statutory rights of appeal, one to one court and one to another.</P>

      <P>I regret that I cannot accept Deputy Fahy's amendment because it is not practicable at the moment.  It is highly desirable, as the Deputy said, that in the Gaeltacht&mdash;in Tirconaill and Galway and other counties&mdash;there should be judges able to speak Irish.  As a matter of fact, the permanent District Justices in both Tirconaill and Galway are able to speak Irish.  But the difficulty is that the number of Irish-speaking persons who would be qualified and suitable for this position is very small.  As a matter of fact, I do not know of even one&mdash;that is, a person of good standing and ability with a knowledge of Irish, who would be willing to accept the position.  It is of the utmost importance that in the Gaeltacht the poor people should have their cases heard by competent judges &mdash;by men of ability and standing.  It would be a cruelty to the Gaeltacht and a serious injury to the Irish language if an incompetent person were appointed solely because he knew Irish. It would not help Irish at all; it would do harm.  While I have the utmost sympathy with Deputy Fahy's amendment, I am afraid that, on practical grounds, I cannot accept it.

      <P>They hang together.  As far as the future is concerned.  I might possibly be able to help the Deputy to some extent.  But 1935 would be too near a date.  We would probably have to put it off until 1940, or later than that.  Before we <Col N="71" /> can have barristers and solicitors who are qualified and competent to speak Irish and who also have spent a sufficient length of time at the Bar, a considerable time will elapse.  I would venture to suggest to the Deputy that this is a matter which could come up again on some future occasion.  The general view of the Executive Council on this whole question, as the Deputy knows, is contained in their comments upon the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission.  They set out there that in view of the fact that the use of Irish in the courts is handicapped because of the few solicitors or barristers who are capable of doing their work in Irish, the Government is of opinion that no person who is under the age of 16 years at the date of the issue of the White Paper should be admitted to be a barrister or solicitor without a competent knowledge of Irish.  That is the Government policy&mdash;to try and secure that that be carried out.  At the moment, there are not a number of qualified persons who could be appointed to the positions.  If you take the Dáil, there are very few persons who can really carry on debate in Irish. I most frankly confess that I found it difficult to follow portions of Deputy Fahy's speech, although he is very clear.  There are not, at the moment, sufficiently qualified people with a knowledge of Irish to make this amendment practicable.</P>

      <P>I spoke only on the first portion of the amendment.  I did not refer to paragraph 3 at all.  We are told that 1935 is too near a date.  We are told, in the Gaeltacht Report, that one of the obstacles to the advancement of the national language is the law.  I do not know that the Incorporated Law Society or the Benchers have ever been great advocates of the Irish language.  I know that there are charters, and that it is very difficult to make Irish compulsory for the examinations. But it could be done indirectly by a definite enactment that no appointments be made unless of persons with a knowledge of Irish.  That might speed up the learning of Irish by the two branches of the legal profession. <Col N="72" /> I should like to see some definite date fixed from which this amendment would be operative.  If it is not to be 1935, then what date is it to be?  I should not think 1935 too soon, considering that Irish is being taught so well in the primary and intermediate schools and that we have compulsory Irish in the National University.  I wonder what the National University has been doing if, during the last 13 years, it has not turned out men who, by 1935, would be competent to discharge the business of the courts in Irish, either as justices or as advocates. If the year 1938 were fixed, it would give the ten years which is generally required at the Bar before a barrister is appointed to the bench, and it would give ten years to qualify in Irish.  But some definite date should be fixed.  If the Minister cannot find two or four assistant justices qualified in Irish, would he even give a promise that he would appoint one Irish-speaking Justice out of the four?</P>

The Minister could surely find one Irish-speaking practitioner in the 26 Counties who would be qualified?  Of course, I know that the Irish-speaking lawyers are all such able men that there are very few of them anxious to take up these posts.  They are too well off already. I should like to have some statement from the Minister as to what date the second portion of my amendment would come into operation.</P>

      <P>I happen to know one very good Irish speaker at the Bar.  He is a man of considerable standing at the Bar.  He was approached and asked to take a District Justiceship but he refused. That was when the first appointments were being made.  The same gentleman would still refuse.  I would find it very difficult to fix upon an exact date.  I do not think I could fix it for the immediate future because some time would be necessary.  There are people already at the Bar who are now too old to learn <Col N="73" /> Irish.  It would be unfair to cut them out for all time&mdash;men who have already been called and who would be the next persons to go on.  Such a provision would require very careful thinking out. It would have to refer to persons called to the Bar after a certain date and to state that such persons would not be appointed to these positions unless they had a competent knowledge of Irish. That is the only way we could work it out.  When I say &ldquo;called to the Bar&rdquo; I include admission as a solicitor.  That is the only way the matter could be worked out in actual practice and something of that kind could be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Fahy in this amendment.  As I said on the Second Reading, we ought to be able to get along without having to appoint four Assistant District Justices. Even at the start, if you were not able to get two Irish speaking justices, as Deputy Fahy suggests, I think if you were able to get one, you should only appoint three justices.  That would get over my objection to appointing the whole four.  The question is: what is going to be the policy of the Government with respect to Irish speaking justices?  It would appear from what the Minister for Justice stated that there is very little hope, in our lifetime, of seeing the law administered mainly through the Irish language, even in those areas in which the ordinary language of the people is Irish. If one of the justices in these areas requires to be replaced and you do not appoint one at least of the assistant district justices who will be an Irish speaker, it will mean that the work in that area will have to be put aside until such time as the permanent justice returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole object of this Bill is to meet the case of justices going on vacation, accumulation of work and so on. The situation in the Irish speaking areas is not going to be met by this Bill unless at least one of these justices is an Irish speaker.  I do not see any reason why we should not insist on having two of these justices Irish speakers at this stage.  I have not examined the names of persons who would be eligible for these appointments <Col N="74" /> but I cannot satisfy myself that there are not outstanding men of ability at the Bar who know Irish and who would be prepared to take these positions.  I have to take the assurance of the Minister that he has tried to get these men.  At least, he has suggested that he has tried, and I take it that he has gone through the list and endeavoured to ascertain whether there were such men available or not.</P>

The present condition is bad as far as the administration of the law is concerned, as is admitted by the Government.  Are we not going to take some steps to amend that condition of things?  I think we ought to do it now, and I hope that Deputy Fahy will hold firmly by his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Or admitted a solicitor. The Minister must remember that on the passing of this Act in 1924 an honourable arrangement was come to with his predecessor, which was honourably carried out, that these positions should be divided &ldquo;fifty-fifty&rdquo; as between the barristers' and solicitors' professions.  That arrangement was carried out in the first instance, and I think I can claim, and that the Minister will bear me out in saying, that the members of the solicitors' profession who were appointed District <Col N="75" /> Justices have been an ornament to it, and that they have discharged their duties with the full advantage that their previous practice and knowledge of the old justices' jurisdiction gave them.  They had unusual opportunities as solicitors of learning the duties of District Justice.  I hope that that honourable undertaking, at the end of four years, is going to be carried out and that in future, as in the past, these positions will be divided &ldquo;fifty-fifty.&rdquo; Looking back at the appointments made of temporary justices since 1924, I am afraid, perhaps unintentionally, that there has been some breach of the undertaking and that for some years past, at all events, the positions of temporary justices have largely, if not entirely, been filled by barristers. I do not think that is fair, and I hope we shall get an assurance from the Minister that that, which I regard as a much more serious objection than the one raised by Deputy Fahy, will be put right.</P>
      <P>There is also a further objection. Cork boasted that it was one-eighth of the entire of Ireland, and so far as the partitioned portion of the country is concerned, you may say that Cork is practically the entire of Ireland.  Yet, from the city of Cork, and from the great West Riding of the county, I do not think a single District Justice has been appointed.  I hope that that also will be put right and that the Minister will learn the geographical position of Cork.</P>

      <P>I accept the corrections.  I oppose this amendment, not on the ground of expediency, but on the ground of principle.  The Minister <Col N="76" /> may find it easy to ride upon two horses; I do not.  The Minister voted&mdash; at least I presume he did&mdash;with his Party for the appointment of an official of the House who, admittedly, did not claim to have a competent knowledge of Irish.  I do not think that it would have been impossible to have found someone in this House who had a competent knowledge of Irish to occupy that post.  I voted in favour of one who had not a competent knowledge of Irish.  I did so because, as I said then and as I say now, I do not believe that compulsion in any class of appointment in the way of knowledge of Irish is the best means of furthering a knowledge of Irish.  In order that a Judge or District Justice should be a proper person to occupy any of these positions, is it seriously contended that, at any rate, in nine-tenths of the country, a knowledge of Irish will make him a more competent Judge or Justice I presume it is not.  I presume that the whole object of this amendment is, as the movers of it think, to propagate a knowledge of and the use of the Irish language.  I believe that it not only will not succeed in that direction, but that it will actually have the opposite effect.  I am against the compulsory principle in regard to the appointment of Judges or Justices, just as I am against it in regard to the appointment of a dispensary doctor or a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  For that reason I oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been far more honest on the part of the Minister if he had followed the course he adopted in voting for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and said that it was not to be the future Government policy that positions should be filled by people who had a competent knowledge of Irish in preference to those who might perhaps have a more competent knowledge of the subject under which they would have to exercise their functions in their new appointment.  That being my position. I think that the suggestion of the Minister, that at some future date it might be possible to accede to the request of the mover of the amendment, is all moonshine.  He might have made the same suggestion in regard to the appointment of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, <Col N="77" /> but no such suggestion was made. Why should it be made in regard to these appointments?  I do not know what a competent knowledge of Irish means.  Who is to judge the competency of that knowledge and to say whether a barrister or solicitor who applies for one of these positions has a competent knowledge of Irish?  Will he have to pass an examination, and what will be the character of and who will be the examiners in that examination?</P>
    <P>To my mind, a competent knowledge of Irish would be a very good thing in Irish-speaking districts.  It might be possible to get people qualified in other directions who have that knowledge.  At the same time, when one realises that there is practically no one in this country who cannot speak English, and that there are few who can speak Irish, the proposal to make Irish compulsory for judicial offices, any more than in any other office, is, in the first place, a wrong principle in regard to the particular appointments to be made, and, in the second place, a wrong way of bringing the Irish language into more prominence in the daily life of the people.  I wonder when these gentlemen who might have a competent knowledge of Irish are appointed, how often they will use the Irish language from the Bench.  How often is it used in the Dáil?  I do not know whether there are any Circuit Court Judges with a knowledge of Irish, but I know that there are District Justices.  How often is it used by them?  It may be used in Irish-speaking districts, but when they are appointed to districts which are not Irish-speaking, how, I ask, is that going to advance the knowledge and learning of Irish in those districts?  How often is the Irish language used by those District Justices when administering the law?  I feel that in the first place, on principle, and even if the principle were not there, in the matter of expediency, I must oppose the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. RICE Mr. RICE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RICE</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment, and for this reason&mdash;that the amendment, if adopted, will leave the Minister no area of choice from which to appoint District Justices.  The number of persons, so far as my knowledge goes, who are competent to speak Irish &mdash;that is to say, those who have such a knowledge of Irish that they can conduct proceedings in court in Irish&mdash;is so restricted that he has no area of choice.  To my mind, the Minister, who considers his responsibility and considers the extremely onerous duties that a District Justice has to discharge, must take gravely into consideration the qualification by temperament, by training and otherwise, of the person he proposes to appoint.  The rights of poor people are very gravely affected by the qualities of the Justice.  As things stand at present, there is no area of choice.  To my knowledge there is not a sufficient number of persons who have a knowledge of Irish and who can show at the same time that they are persons who could decide judicially as between man and man in those cases that come before the District Courts.  For some reason or other I do not think that Irish is used to a great extent in the courts, even by persons with a knowledge of Irish.  I do not pretend to know why that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the fact that in Clare, which Deputy de Valera represents, and where there is a considerable number of persons who speak Irish, there was, for a number of years, an interpreter who received a salary as interpreter&mdash;he only died recently&mdash;and <Col N="79" /> attended the sittings of the County Court regularly, and it did not happen sometimes that he was called on even once in the year to do his duty as an interpreter of Irish.  The people who were native speakers of Irish and came into Court had a right to use the Irish language in the Court, but they preferred to speak English.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>No. My point is this.  People do not like to plead through an interpreter, and even though it might be only their second best language, if able to speak English, they are inclined to use it in a case of that kind; that is to the detriment of the Irish language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. RICE Mr. RICE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RICE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of those people who confine themselves to facts of which they have some knowledge.  I am referring to the fact that in Clare there was an official interpreter of Irish.  He attended at session after session, and he was not called upon on an average once a year to interpret the Irish language.  I do not think that Deputy de Valera's explanation is quite satisfactory.  It is true the judge in Clare did not know Irish, but that does not appear, to my mind, to be any answer to the point, because there was an interpreter who knew both Irish and English, and if any witness or litigant desired to make his case in Irish he was entitled to do so.  The necessity did not arise, because the people were willing to carry on in English.  I would accept entirely the principle of the amendment if I thought there was a demand for it and if I saw any prospect of the Minister being able to select justices who could speak both languages.  I would support the amendment strongly if I thought the Minister had the choice <Col N="80" /> of people suitable through their training and whom the Minister was satisfied were persons of judicial temperament as well as having a knowledge of the Irish language.  But I do not know of any such persons, and I do not see that he should be restricted in the way proposed where the choice would be from an extremely limited number of persons.  At the present moment, unfortunately, there is no demand for Irish speaking in the Courts that the amendment appears to suggest.  For that reason I do not intend to support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister speaks, the remarks made by Deputy Rice and Deputy Redmond suggest that it would be no harm to say a few words more about the appointment of Irish speakers for these Courts. Deputy Rice may not be aware that there are large areas in this country in which the people use Irish as their everyday language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>And that there are districts in which it would be very difficult, and in some cases impossible, for the people to speak any language but Irish.  Are you going to leave these people to an interpreter as they had in Clare, apparently, in those times referred to by Deputy Rice, to plead their case?  I think that is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanation as regards Clare is very simple.  There are several possible explanations that would fit in.  One is that people who speak Irish do not go to court as often as other people.  I am, however, leaving that aside.  It ought to be obvious to Deputy Rice that, with solicitors and justices who speak English only, a man who did not know English and who had to deal with an interpreter all the time would feel badly off.  He would not understand what was happening. I think litigants in cases of that particular kind would try to keep out of court as much as possible, and would be inclined to allow matters to go by default if handicapped in their efforts to get redress.  There are areas in which Irish only is spoken.  We believe <Col N="81" /> that the national policy should be to preserve and extend the use of the language in such areas.  These official channels are means by which the English language is interfering with that policy and is making inroads on the language in such areas.  We want to see that stopped, and to see that in areas where the ordinary language is Irish the court proceedings will be conducted in Irish.  This Bill is intended, so far as I understand, to give assistant justices to areas in which the work has accumulated or to provide deputies for existing justices when on holidays. How could you send justices who speak only English to Irish-speaking districts unless you are going to use the courts as a means of introducing English into such areas?  I think that anyone who is anxious about preserving and extending the use of the Irish language should insist that a certain proportion of justices should know Irish.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply to me indicated that he had not surveyed the whole ground regarding the possibilities of getting suitble justices who know Irish from the Bar or the solicitors' profession.  Those of us who know the country well believe that, if a proper effort were made, suitable persons could be found, and, in my opinion, a certain proportion of the places should be kept open until such persons are found.  The Minister should make a proper search and study the ground carefully in that respect.  An inducement should be held out to such persons by keeping two places open out of the four assistant Justices to be appointed.  Surely Deputy Redmond will not hold that Irish is not essential in the cases I have indicated.  He gave a very unfortunate example in the vote he gave on the last occasion.  It could be made very awkward for An Leas-Cheann Comhairle if those of us who speak Irish did so constantly because he would not understand us.  I held on that occasion that a knowledge of Irish was essential for such a position as his, and is also essential to that of a District Justice.  You might as well send people with a knowledge of the Czech language to administer justice here as to send English-speaking justices to Irish-speaking districts. <Col N="82" /> From the larger point of view of national policy I cannot understand how anybody can advocate an appointment of four assistant justices at this time of day none of whom has a knowledge of Irish.  I think there are very few of the existing justices who know Irish.</P>

      <P>In reference to what Deputy Rice has said, I may mention that in Donegal there is a Justice who has a very competent knowledge of Irish, and who insists that the people who are Irish speakers shall present their case in Irish before him.  This is not a joke, though it may sound like one; the people in that area who are Irish speakers are under the impression that if they are guilty of a misdemeanour they will receive a lighter sentence if they go before him.  I need not say that there is no truth in that impression.  The fact is that it is impossible to translate the idioms of one language into another.  If there were an interpreter he would try to put idiomatic Irish into English, and that is impossible.  When appearing before a Justice, such as the one I mentioned, the people are able to plead their own case and the Justice is able to understand them.  An interpreter would not be able to put the case before the Justice in the same way as the people themselves do.  It is essential where the people are Irish speakers that the Justice should have a knowledge of Irish.  A practical illustration of that is to be found in the case of District Justice Walshe in Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I must entirely dissent from certain views put forward by Deputy de Valera.  The first consideration in appointing a District <Col N="83" /> Justice should be: is he competent to administer justice fairly and impartially between man and man?  It is of much less importance whether he knows or does not know Irish.  The first thing is to get a competent man. Deputy de Valera asked me what would happen in an Irish-speaking district if only an English-speaking Justice went there, and if Irish-speaking witnesses went before that English-speaking Justice. I have had considerable experience of practising in a part of this country where at one time Irish was very much spoken.  When I went into practice first in the County Court of Mayo, there were around Ballinrobe a great number of purely Irish-speaking or semi-English-speaking people.  Nowadays that has completely changed.</P>

The only disadvantage in the administration of justice is&mdash;and it is not on the side of the Irish speaker&mdash;that it is almost impossible for an advocate to cross-examine through an interpreter, especially to cross-examine a witness who knows English and who answers in Irish, because there is a very considerable amount of time spent in making out the answer.  Far from it being a disadvantage to a witness to answer in Irish, I think it is a great advantage to him and a great assistance to him.  If the system of interpreters fails to have justice done it fails because it works too much in favour of the Irish speaker.</P>

      <P>I think I have dealt with that point as fully as I could.  All I can say is that when the Executive Council come to make appointments the first consideration will be efficiency, and we ought not to tie the hands of the Executive Council by saying that two of the appointments should be given to persons who are able to speak Irish, whether they are competent persons or not.  It is certainly an amendment I could not accept.  Deputy Wolfe made a plea as to the personnel, and said that if this Bill becomes law we should not forget County Cork.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that I find some difficulty with regard to the first paragraph of Deputy Fahy's amendment.  If the amendment is to be adopted both paragraphs go together.  I think there is something in what the Minister says as to the difficulty in getting District Justices who are fully qualified otherwise, and who at the same time are willing to act and have a knowledge of the Irish language.  Deputy de Valera does not believe that, but I am only giving him my own personal knowledge for what it is worth.  It may not be worth much in this connection.  I am inclined to believe that the position is, as stated by the Minister rather than as stated by Deputy de Valera, and that, in fact, it would be very difficult to get two fully-qualified District Justices who would have a competent knowledge of the Irish language.  It would be no use their having a reading knowledge or a haltingly-speaking knowledge of Irish.  It would be necessary for the District Justice to have such a knowledge of the language that he would be competent to conduct the business of the courts in Irish.  No other knowledge would be any good in this connection.  If Deputy de Valera said that these four Justices are not necessary, that is another point from the economy aspect.  I think when the Minister comes to the House and says <Col N="86" /> that four are necessary, unless we are in a position to show that four are not necessary, we ought not to tie his hands.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second paragraph of the amendment, I would be certainly inclined to press that, and to say that a date should be fixed, not 1935, but perhaps 1938 or 1940.  If Deputy Fahy were in a position to move these as two separate amendments, I would vote for the second, while I would have some difficulty, in view of what has been suggested, in supporting the first.  If I might make a suggestion to Deputy Fahy, it would be that he should withdraw the amendment and put down these two paragraphs as separate amendments on the Report Stage.  Perhaps then we would be able to get further along the line which he and many others are anxious to follow.  That is, we would have something gained in regard to the position of the language&mdash;that after a certain date it would be obligatory on the Executive Council to appoint District Justices who would have a knowledge of Irish.  I would suggest to Deputy Fahy the advisability of considering that course.</P>

      <P>The position of the Minister and his Government is even worse than we expected.  It is not merely that he is opposed to the amendment as it stands, but he is not going to make any effort to assert the principle of the language of Ireland in any way at all.  He put up a proposition himself which was extremely moderate, far too moderate from our point of view, but since he put it up he ran away from it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>He suggests that; but he has not stood up to it, and I must confess that I am amazed, because it proves more and more the condition of complete <Col N="87" /> hypocrisy in this matter.  It is not merely a question of the Irish-speaking districts.  It is the status of the language. There may be reasons as to why it is difficult for men practising to learn the language now.  It is very difficult for a man practising now to learn the language, but I cannot for the life of me understand a Government that claims to stand for the language and for national principles in some shape or form, not standing for a principle like this where no one is to suffer.  After all, it is a question of the education of the younger generation, and it is as easy for them to get a knowledge of Irish as it is to get a knowledge of anything else.  I must say that there is no excuse at all in this matter.</P>

If that had been accepted, then I would consider carefully what could be done and what dates could be fixed.  That would be a matter for consideration. But that was not accepted.  I understood that the attitude of the Deputies opposite was that that was not sufficient. They wanted it here and now. I think that makes it perfectly plain that I have not run away from my position.

      <P>References have been made here to interpreters being employed in the courts in which the Bar and the judge did not know Irish.  I think it was in 1917, when I was in a court at Derrynagh, in Connemara, that the services of an interpreter were required.  There were only four people present in the court who knew Irish.  The magistrate, in my hearing, spent ten minutes abusing two witnesses because they could not speak English.  Fortunately, they did not know what he was saying.  I would not like to see that spirit continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest it does. But if in those courts people saw office <Col N="88" /> associated with those who not only did not know Irish but despised it, it is all the more necessary that people in those courts should have a knowledge of Irish, and that whether in the Court, the Bar or the Church in the Gaeltacht, Irish should be used.  From the way Deputy Redmond spoke one would imagine that the Gaeltacht was a sort of reservation to keep there the last remnants of the race for all time for show purposes.  Is it not the purpose, the alleged purpose, and I hope the genuine purpose of the Government to make Irish the language of the country, spreading out from the Gaeltacht? With regard to the second portion of the amendment I have suggested, if the Minister had agreed to appoint even one of the four an Irish speaker, to have one of the four assistant District Justices appointed a competent Irish speaker, I would not have pressed for the two.  But he has held out no such hope.  As regards the second, I think it is permissible to raise it on the Report Stage if withdrawn now.</P>

      <P>I will withdraw the second portion of the amendment, and I shall move it on the Report Stage. As regards that, I might say that if the Minister for Justice had considered whether he would be prepared to accept an amendment to my amendment setting out that in 1938 even half the appointments should be given to people with a knowledge of Irish, an understanding might be come to.  But no date and no numbers have been mentioned by the Minister; only a vague suggestion has been thrown out, and that is not sufficient.  If we are in earnest about reviving the national language, we will have to give some definite effect to our intentions, and make Irish obligatory for all posts within a certain time.  Let it be a fixed time, ten, twenty, or thirty years.  We would attain our purpose gradually, <Col N="89" /> no doubt, but a beginning must be made some time.  It is unfair to have compulsory Irish in primary and secondary schools and possibly in the university, and then, when it comes to a case of an appointment it is dropped. <Col N="90" /> I ask the leave of the House to withdraw the second portion of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of Section 14 the following words &ldquo;and by the addition at the end of the said clause (iii) of the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and where in the case of an ejectment for non-payment of rent such ejectment is now maintainable under the provisions of 23 and 24 Victoria, chapter 154, section 52.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move the amendment under these circumstances: under the original Act of 1924, probably through inadvertence, a right of ejectment for non-payment of rent, which had been decided by a District Justice, was given in the case of a weekly tenant.  I do not think that was ever intended.  I do not believe it was ever intended that an ejectment should be given against a weekly tenant.  That right did not exist in the case of a weekly, monthly, or quarterly tenant, but it did in the case of a yearly tenant.  The present extraordinary condition of things is that in the case of a weekly tenant who owes a week's rent, he can be evicted by the District Justice for non-payment of the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He cannot be proceeded against for non-payment of rent either in the High Court or Circuit Court, and the District Justice has got jurisdiction which is not given to the Circuit Judge or the High Court Judge.  In the case of Section 52 of Deasy's Act, as the Minister for Justice will bear me out, there is not only the right of ejectment for non-payment of rent, but there is a period of default fixed, and the period of default fixed is the non-payment of one year's rent.  By a thing that I think was a slip in the preparation of the 1924 Act, the right of ejectment for non-payment of rent was extended to tenancies of every kind and description, including those excluded from Deasy's Act, and there was no period <Col N="92" /> of default fixed.  If you take the extreme case of a weekly tenant whose weekly rent is payable in advance every Monday, if that tenant pays his week's rent on the following Tuesday week, he would morally owe a day's rent, whereas when 12 o'clock strikes on Monday night he could be proceeded against before the Justice for non-payment of the following week's rent.  It is because of the absurdity, and it is to get rid of what would be an act of great oppression to weekly tenants that I move this amendment.  The present position was never intended by the original Act.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy has worded his amendment in too wide a fashion, because in Section 52 of Deasy's Act power to grant an ejectment for non-payment of rent is given to the County Courts up to £100, and beyond that to the High Court.  Now the Deputy's amendment would give unlimited jurisdiction to the District Court.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that is what the effect of the Deputy's amendment would be as it stands.  An ejectment is now maintainable under the provisions of 23 and 24 Victoria, chapter 154, Section 52.  I am afraid the effect of the Deputy's amendment would be this: that now a District Court would have jurisdiction in all cases, no matter what the valuation of the premises was.  I now gather that is not the Deputy's intention, that that Deputy wishes to keep the jurisdiction within the £27 limit, but to cut away powers of ejectment for weekly tenancies.</P>

The early part of the section fixes the maximum rent at £27, and the addendum I suggest cuts it down by saying that £27 can only apply in the case where under Section 52 of Deasy's Act, an ejectment for non-payment of rent is maintainable.</P>

      <P>The position at present is that a Peace Commissioner must remand in custody unless the offence is an indictable one&mdash; that is, an offence which will be tried finally before a jury.  In these cases, he can let out the prisoner on bail or remand him in custody as he thinks right. As the law stands at present, where the offence charged is a minor one&mdash;simple drunkenness, for instance&mdash;the Peace Commissioner has no power to release on bail at all.  He can only remand in custody.  That was an obvious slip in the Act.  It is grossly unfair that a Peace Commissioner should have to remand in custody for a small offence. This Section enables him to remand on bail when the offence is small.  On Report Stage, I propose introducing an amendment to this Section to provide that, instead of having to remand a prisoner to a court which might be a considerable distance away and very inconvenient to the prisoner, he will be enabled to remand to a court in the neighbourhood.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 94 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of all words from the words &ldquo;unless the Judge shall consider&rdquo; to the words <Col N="95" />&ldquo;on the application of any party so order&rdquo; now contained therein and the insertion in lieu of the words so deleted of the words &ldquo;unless the Court on the application of any party instituted within seven days after notice of trial or on its own motion at the trial shall consider a jury to be necessary or desirable for the proper trial of the action and shall so order.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 14 to delete the word &ldquo;within&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;at any time not later than.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to clear up what may be only an ambiguity. Under the law as it stands, in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, parties are not entitled, as of right, to a jury in actions for liquidated sums of money or actions dealing with contracts or actions for the recovery of land.  This section is designed to give them the right to claim a jury in certain cases. The words of Section 18 are &ldquo;unless the Court on the application of any party instituted within seven days after notice of trial...&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;within&rdquo; suggests to me that the limit might apply each way.  It would appear to me to be open to the interpretation that it would preclude a person desiring to have a jury from serving his notice at an earlier date.  To get rid of that ambiguity I propose this amendment.  If parties are only served with notice that a jury is required a few days before the trial, it will mean an adjournment until next term.  In order to avoid anything of that kind and to make it clear that parties are entitled to serve notice at an earlier date, I move my amendment.</P>

      <P>I understood from the Minister's speech on Second Reading that it was his intention to bring the City of Dublin into line with the rest of the country as regards the period during which an offence under the Dublin Police Act could be heard. On re-reading Section 19, I have come to the conclusion&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that the section as drafted will leave no period of limitation at all.  The matter stands thus: Under the Dublin Police Act, 1842, there is a limit of six months fixed for both the hearing and determination of charges of this character. It is proposed by this section to delete entirely that portion of the Dublin Police Act.  Section 41 of the Petty Sessions Act, 1851, provides that the period during which these charges shall be heard but not determined shall be six months.  It goes on to declare that the Petty Sessions Act shall not apply to the police district of Dublin at all.  If this portion of Section 70 of the Dublin Police Act is entirely deleted, the Petty Sessions Act will not apply, and there will be no limit of time for the hearing of those charges. I do not know whether the Minister will agree with that interpretation or not.  I do not think that the interpretation I have put on the section is the one that the Minister desired.  If, however, he agrees to my reading of the section, I should like to ask him if he would be prepared to introduce an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Tar éis an méid cainnte do bhí againn iniú ar chúis na Gaedhilge, is dó liom go mba cheart chur síos ar cúpla ní san mheastachán so.  Le sé bliana anuas&mdash;o cuireadh an Stát so ar bun&mdash;tá a lán daoine sa tír&mdash; chim cuid acu iniú ar an dtaobh eile den Tighe&mdash;agus níl siad sásta le polaisí an Rialtais chun Gaedhilge do chur i bhfeidhm i ngach uile shlí.  Is dócha ná raibh siad sásta an cheist do chur dá plé annso.  Nuair ná fuair siad sásadh annso, chuaidh siad amach fén dúthaigh agus bhí siad ag síor-chainnt ar na comhairlí puiblí agus á rádh nár cheart an méid sin airgid do chaitheamh ar mhúineadh na Gaedhilge agus a bhí á chaitheamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>D'ainneoin a bhfuil ráidhte ag an <Col N="98" /> Aire agus d'ainneoin an dul-ar-aghaidh atá déanta ag an teanga, nílimíd-ne, ar an dtaobh so den Tigh, sásta nach féidir a thuille do dhéanamh.  Cuir i gcás ceist na leabhar agus ceist i dtaobh lón do thabhairt do scoláirí n-áiteacha bochta ar fud na tíre.  Chó maith le sin, is dó liom go dtiocfadh leis an Aire níos mó do dhéanamh ar son cheoil Gaedhalaigh&mdash;go mór mór nuair a fheicimíd an méid feiseanna atá ann fá láthair ar fud na tire.  Ba chóir don Aire níos mó do dhéanamh ar son cheoil na tíre ná mar tá gá dhéanamh aige.</P>
    <P>Os rud é gurab é an cuspóir atá againn go mbeidh, i gcionn 20 no 40 bliain, gach duine atá ar scoil anois in án an Ghaedhilg do labhairt go flúirseach, ba chóir a thuille aire do thabhairt do stair aiteamhail agus ba chóir píosaí dramaíochta a chur ar an ardán agus saghas mór-shiubhal nó pageants a chur ar bun.  Cuirfeadh na daoine óga níos mó suime in obair dá leithéid sin ná in obair ar bith eile, b'féidir.</P>
    <P>Tá cúpla poinnte eile agam a ba mhaith liom a nochta.  Nuair a bhí an t-Aire ag labhairt i dtosach dubhairt sé go raibh ceist an cheárd-oideachais gá scrúdú aige.  B'féidir go mbeadh a thuille le rá aige mar gheall air sul a mbeidh an díospóireacht so thart.  I dtuarasgabháil Choimisiún na Gaeltachta moladh ranganna leanúnacha do chur ar bun le haghaidh talmhaíochta, iasgaireacht agus déantúisí na háite do mhúineadh do na daoine óga.  Thall i Sasana tá dlúth-bhaint&mdash;go mór mór sna hárd-ranganna&mdash;idir oideachas na ndaoine agus saol na ndaoine.  Ní mar sin atá an sgéal againn-ne.  B'féidir go mbeadh sé costasach ranganna leanúnacha do chur ar bun in gach uile áit ar dtúis ach b'fhéidir go mbeadh an t-Aire ábalta níos mó a dhéanamh chun dlúth-bhaint do chur ar bun idir saol na scoileanna agus saol na ndaoine.</P>
    <P>Tchím o leabhairín beag go bhfuil, ins na ranganna is aoirde i bhfurmhór na scoileanna i Londuin, breis is cúig h-uaire a chluig tugtha d'ealadhain agus do chleachta oibre agus is dó liom gur féidir níos mó a dhéanamh annso chun dlúth-bhaint do chur ar bun idir teagase agus talmhaíochta agus cuntaisí feirmeóireachta i dtreo go mbeadh <Col N="99" /> níos mó suime ag na daoine óga san tír agus go bhfanfadh siad annso&mdash;go mbeadh colus acu ar stair na tíre agus colas cruinn beacht acu ar dhéantúisí na tíre agus ar na céarda atá ar fáil acu annso.  Tá beárna mhór idir na bun scoileanna agus na meadhon-scoileanna annos.  Tá fhios ag an Aire ná raibh dlúth-bhaint idir saol na mbunscoileanna agus saol na ndaoine.  Chó maith le sin, d'fhágadh an chuid is mó de na scoláirí an scoil tar éis an chúigiú ranga do shroichint agus go minic san nGaeltacht ní bhiodh scoláirí san scoil i rang ar bith níos aoirde ná an tríomhadh rang.  Táim sásta go mbeidh feabhas ar sin faoi'n Acht atá i bhfeidhm anois.  Mar sin fhéin, is dó liom go dtiocfadh leis an Aire níos mó do dhéanamh ar son na scoláirí san dhuthaigh.  Cuir i gcás na scoláireachtaí.  Tá a lán de na scoláireachtaí ó na bun-scoileanna go dtí na meadhon-scoileanna ag dul go dtí na scoileanna ins na cathracha agus ins na bailte móra.  Is dó liom go mba cheart an scéim sin do leathnú amach agus scoláireachtaí do thabhairt do scoláirí na nGaeltachta agus do na scoileanna fén dúthaigh.  I scoil fén dúthaigh ná fuil innte ach máistir amháin, ní féidir an traenáil chéana do thabhairt do na scoláirí agus is féidir do thabhairt i scoil mhóir i mbaile mhór.  Ar an abhar san, is dó liom go mba cheart scoláireachtaí áirithe do thabhairt do na bun-scoileanna ar fud na tíre.  Chó maith le sin, chun dlúth-bhaint do dhéanamh idir saol na ndaoine agus saol na scolairí, ba cheart scoileanna leanúnacha do chur ar bun.  Nuair a fhágann na scoláirí na scoileanna ar a 14 bliana d'aois, tá an méid airgid a híocadh ar a son san beagnach caillte go minic.</P>
    <P>Isé an rud is mó agus is bunúsaí in oideachas ná an scoláire a bheith ar scoil go dtí 14 bliana d'aois agus iad a choinneáil ar scoil éigin ina dhiaidh sin &mdash;scoil leanúnach nó scoil cheárdoideachis. Muna bhfuil scéim dé leithéid sin ann, ní féidir cose do chur ar imirce thar lear.  Molaim don Aire ranganna nó scoileanna leanúnacha do chur ar bun agus scéim na scoláireachtaí do leathnú i dtreo go mbeidh seans ag na páistí ins na bun-scoileanna fén <Col N="100" /> duthaigh dul go dtí na meadhon-scoileanna agus, chó maith le sin, scoláireachtaí do chur ar bun i scoileanna na gcéard.  Ní dubhairt an t-Aire aon ní mar gheall ar athrú i scéim na scoláireachtaí atá i bhfeidhm fá láthair chun scoláireachtaí do thabhairt do scoláirí i scoileanna na gcéard. Nuair a thiocfas an cheist sin ós cóir na Dála, tá súil agam go mbeidh scéim ag an Aire chun scoláireachtaí do thabhairt ó na bun-scoileanna go dtí na meadhon-scoileanna agus go dtí scoileanna na gcé ard chomhmaith agus ó na meadhon-scoileanna go dtí an Ollscoil.</P>
    <P>Dubhairt Teachtaí áirithe, nuair a bhí siad ag cainnt Dé hAoine annso, ná raibh siad sásta leis an gclár nua. Léighim litreacha sna bpáipéir anois agus arís á rá ná fuil na daoine atá á sgriobhadh sásta, d'ainneoin an méid atá sa chlár, le múineadh mathematice agus a leithéid agus ná fuil an múineadh chó maith agus mar tá sé i dtíortha eile.  Tuigim go bhfuil an tAire chun Coláiste Oileamhain do chur ar bun i nGaillimh.  Is maith liom go bhfuil an Aireacht chun daingniú do dhéanamh idir na coláistí Oileamhain agus an Ollscoil agus nuair a bheidheas sin déanta i nGaillimh tá súil agam go mbeidh có-oibreachas níos fearr idir na Coláistí-Ollscoile eile agus na coláistí Oileamhain.</P>
    <P>Anois mar gheall ar na múinteoirí idirmeadhonacha, fuair gach Teachta leitir uatha sin agus tá fhios againn go léitir na nithe a theastuíonn uatha.  Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá i dtaoibh na mban i dtosach.  Tá an cúigiú cuid de na mnaibh atá atá ag teagasc i scoileanna an tSaorstáit nach bhfuil a fáil an bun-tuarastail atá leagtha síos le haghaidh na muinteóirí cláruighthe. Mar a bhfuil siad cláruithe féin, táid oilte agus teisteas aca agus ba chóir tuarastal ceart a thabhairt dóbtha.  Tá siad ar fad beagnach tar éis cúrsa fada a dhéanamh i meadhonscoil agus tar éis ceithre bliana a thabhairt san Ollscoil ag baint amach céimeann agus teisteas oideachais.</P>
    <P>D'aimhdheoin é sin níl siad a fagháil an tuarastail atá ag na Gárdaí Síochána féin.  Tá £178 sa bhliain ag na Gárdaí agus níl ach £2 de dheifríocht idir sin agus bun-tuarastail na mban-mhúinteoir <Col N="101" /> cláruithe&mdash;gan trácht ar na mnáibh nach bhfuil le fagháil an méid sin féin.  Tá cléireigh agus chló-scríbhneoirí abhfad níos féarr as ná iad.  Níl pinsean ná breiseanna sa bhliain ag an cúigiú cuid de na mnáibh nach bhfuil cláruithe mar tá ag lucht na StátSheirbhíse.</P>
    <P>Níl aon phost seasta ag na múinteoirí seo.  Tá aithne agam ar chuid aca seo agus cuireadh as a bpostanna iad, nuair a d'fhéil sé don bhainisteoir agus iad tar éis thar 15 ná 20 bliain a thabhairt ag teagase sa scoil.  Ní féidir sin a dhéanamh i dTuaisceart na hEireann gan cead ón Rialtas.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé mar sin annseo chó luath agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh cheist na bpinsean, nuair a thiocfas an scéim os cóir na Dála tá súil agam go dtiurfaidh an tAire agus an tAire Airgid lán-chreidheamhaint do na múinteoirí as ucht a gcuid seirbhíse fada agus tá súil agam go mbeidh siad chó maith ar gach cuma faoi an scéim agus táid sa Bhreatain Mhóir.  Ní féidir dul ar aghaidh le cúrsaí oideachais gan cóir agus congnamh o na múinteoirí féin agus táim ag fanacht leis an lá go mbeidh comhairle agus baramhail na múinteoirí ghá n-iarraidh agus ghá nglacadh ar chúrsaí oideachais.</P>
    <P>Tá faitchios orm go bhfuil cuid de na scoileanna atá a fagháil deontais ar son teagasc na Gaedhilge nach bhfuil in dáiriribh agus nach bhfuilid ach ar nós cuma liom.  Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ón Aire cad iad na rialacha atá ag bainnt le deontaisí a thabhairt; an mó scoláire atá riachtanach i gcóir na deontaisí seo do thuille?  Ba mhaith liom focal a chur isteach chó maith ar son na múinteoirí páirt-ama faoi na coistí Céard-Oideachais.  Anois nuair a bhéas scéim an cheárd-oideachais ar fad dhá scrúdú ag an Aire tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé rud éigin chun iad a fheabhsú agus postaí seasta a fháil dóbhtha.</P>

      <P>The remarks that I am going to make are in the nature of iteration of what was said before by certain others in this House.  I would like to join those who for years have been pressing on the Ministry the claims of the secondary teachers for pensions.  I realise that this Government <Col N="102" /> has been the first that has done anything for the secondary teachers, and that their increment system was the first gleam of sunlight that struck that most deserving class of the teaching profession.  I hope that the Government, or some future Government, will see their way to improve that increment scheme, to bring the increments in the Free State within favourable comparison with those that hold elsewhere. That I suppose is impossible at present, but, perhaps, the Minister might be able to do one thing: to interpret the arrangements or the scale that determines the number of recognised teachers, so as to ensure that every secondary teacher who is working whole-time at that task should receive an increment.</P>

      <P>And while I am talking about increments I would urge the Minister to see that music teachers should be eligible for receiving increments. Though music is one of the approved subjects, the music teachers are, at present, excluded on the grounds that teaching must be class teaching. Of course, music is a subject that does not lend itself to class teaching.  It is pre-eminently a case of individual teaching, but the work is just as arduous, and the subject is an approved subject, and it is of capital importance in the educational curriculum.  The increment scheme is loose at both ends. I do not think, while the secondary school teacher has got a minimum salary fixed, he is, anyhow, sure of it. He has not got what he wants&mdash; security of tenure.  He is still racked with the anxiety that always follows a man who does not know where he will get his bread and butter six months hence.  The salary the secondary teacher gets will not allow him to make any provision for old age.  The Government has promised and promised for some time a scheme of pensions.  I do hope before we separate this summer that that scheme will be in being. The secondary teacher has waited long enough for it, and I hope it will be a fairly generous scheme.  At the beginning it would cost very little.  At the present moment there are teachers <Col N="103" /> of 65 and indeed 70 years of age hanging on.  They cannot be doing good work, and it would be just as well they should take their increments as pensions.  If some scheme of that sort is initiated it would not for the first few years of working cost the Government very much.</P>
      <P>In this scheme of pensions for secondary teachers, I hope the Minister will see his way to include the staffs of the training colleges.  They are small in numbers.  It would not be very costly to take them in, and they pre-eminently deserve some consideration. Until, I think, the year 1922 their salaries were very meagre.  Indeed, I do not know yet, though I tried to get the information, whether the salaries they receive to-day are those recommended by the minute of the National Board of 1922.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether that is so or not. but they are certainly deserving of the fullest consideration we can give them, and I think they should be brought into this pension scheme, and that that scheme should be rapidly established. In that connection, too, I hope the Minister will not lose sight of the fact that many of the professors in the training colleges were drawn from the ranks of the secondary teachers, and I hope he will be able to see his way to count as years of service those years they spent as secondary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the suggestion he threw out of filling the gaps in our educational system, of establishing post-primary curricula, linking up secondary and technical education, and developing the technical schools to the standard of the secondary schools.  I certainly concur in his view that there is no reason why the technical schools should not give as fine a quality of education as the secondary schools.  I congratulate him also on the reorganisation&mdash;perhaps that is the wrong word&mdash;on the new way that he is using the instruments at his hands&mdash;the inspectorate. He is not employing this staff to labour continually and ceaselessly on reports, and he thinks it is not necessary that every national school should be inspected formally every year, and that <Col N="104" /> reports should be sent in on every school, and that the inspectors might be used to pay unofficial visits to the schools, and in a friendly way co-operate with the managers and teachers in the development of the school.  I have often thought that if the Department of Education had a kind of supplementary inspectorate at their disposal, a class which it could send down as itinerant teachers with special lectures&mdash; lantern lectures&mdash;if necessary, especially in the distant schools, such men might throw a little colour into what must be at times a rather drab curriculum, and might stimulate the imagination of the students, and call forth that spark that often lights a man to great success in life.  That perhaps is only a dream.  But the Minister indulged in visions, I think, himself, and I was glad to see him doing it.  But I do appeal again to the Minister to see that that pension scheme which was foreshadowed two years ago is in being before we break up this summer.</P>

      <P>I listened with very close attention to the very excellent, logical, commonsense exposition that the Minister for Education gave to the House, an exposition that was marked by an impartial review of the merits and of some of the demerits of the system.  Various criticisms have been passed upon various items connected with education, such as meals for necessitous school children, better school equipment, better school accommodation, and things of that kind.  To my mind, these are only minor considerations in comparison with an examination of the primary system of education itself.  In a house of 150 Deputies, there was not one word of analysis, there was practically no word of criticism passed upon the system of primary education.  We have in this House representatives of the great universities and of the teaching profession, and not one of these had a single critical remark to pass on the primary education that now exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may be anticipating what Deputy O'Connell has to say, but I think that the honour of <Col N="105" /> winding up the debate rests with the Minister.  What I have to do is to start at the bottom of the subject and endeavour to deal with something which up to the present has not been dealt with, and which in my humble opinion should have been dealt with.  The question I want to ask the House is this: Is the system of primary education so flawless, are its results so satisfactory, that no criticism can be directed by any Deputy to the system itself?  I am sure Deputy O'Connell will agree with me when I say that the real want to-day is the universal education of the masses. I suggest that that is the main principle upon which primary education rests&mdash; that upon the education of the masses depends the real and true development of the country.  It has been said by one of the greatest authorities upon educational matters&mdash;Pestalozzi&mdash;that primary education is the chief weapon in the arsenal of the social reformer.  To use the words of Pestalozzi&mdash;if I might quote them to some of the smiling Deputies&mdash;&ldquo;The golden head of education touches the clouds, but popular or primary education, which should bear that head, has feet of clay.&rdquo;  I suggest that these words are applicable in every detail to our system of primary education at present.</P>
      <P>What is the actual position of primary education?  Is it perfectly efficient&mdash;is it as efficient as it should be? Are its results productive of the satisfaction that parents of children, who are really interested in primary education, would expect from it?  I would challenge some of the representatives of the Universities before this debate closes to say if the students who enter the Universities are generally sufficiently equipped and have reached a sufficiently high standard of education to avail of the advantages that University education confers.  I have heard very frequent and bitter complaints made of some of the material that enters the Universities.  I have heard some of the most eminent of University professors declare that a great deal of time had to be wasted upon rudimentary education in order to equip the student to go forward on his course.</P>

    <P>I turn from the Universities to the technical schools, and would ask: what <Col N="106" /> percentage of the pupils leaving the primary schools to-day are fitted to avail themselves of the benefits of technical education?  What percentage of them are fit to pass the technical school examination?  In support of that statement, I quote the words of the Minister for Education, who, in dealing with that particular aspect of the case, gave us facts which, to any Deputy who takes any interest in education, were facts of common knowledge. He said that children reaching the age of fourteen had not reached the sixth standard, and very often had only reached the third.  The technical schools had to undertake a lot of strictly primary work, and he hoped that the School Attendance Act would rid the technical schools of that task. He went on to say that laissez faire methods might have been well enough a generation ago, but that these would have to go.  These are words I have extracted from the Official Report of the Minister's speech.  Did these words deserve no criticism at the hands of Deputies?  I think that these admissions coming from so eminently fair a critic as the Minister call for serious attention.  They are admissions that show&mdash;to put it in the mildest possible way&mdash;that the primary system of education to-day is not certainly what it ought to be.  They go to show that its efficiency is not what it ought to be. After all, under the Education Vote, a sum of four and a half million pounds is being expended annually.  I do not say that that sum is actually being spent upon primary education alone, but I suggest that the House has been voting for some years a sum of four and a half millions for the education of the youth of the country, and it is a matter of common knowledge that that four and a half million entails a considerable sacrifice on the part of the country.  For that sum we should get the best return possible.</P>
    <P>I venture to suggest, with all respect, that irregular school attendance is only a subsidiary cause, is only a minor cause, of the facts to which the Minister has drawn attention.  I venture to go further, and say that if the Compulsory Act were functioning perfectly to-morrow, and you were getting <Col N="107" /> a satisfactory attendance, you would still have the deplorable result to which the Minister has referred.  I can inform the House that I have known of children going to school regularly from five to fourteen years of age, who were only in the fourth standard.  I can even go further, and say that I have known children to go to school regularly, except in the case of sickness, from five to sixteen and seventeen years of age, and when they presented themselves for the elementary leaving certificate they hopelessly failed in the examination.  What are the causes of these defects?  Are they to be lightly passed over by the House?  Are they not to be analysed?  If they exist, is the attention of the House not to be drawn to them?</P>
    <P>What percentage of the girls attending convent schools, when they present themselves for the junior leaving-certificate examination, are able to pass in mathematics?  I would go further and ask what percentage of teachers who teach those children are qualified to teach mathematics?  I have had wide experience of children going to some of the best institutions, institutions which bear a high name in the educational world and which have obtained very satisfactory results, but, after all, the percentage of satisfactory results to the percentage of failures is a sad thing for this House to contemplate.  I ask the Minister frankly to tell us whether he is satisfied with the present system of primary education.  I would ask him to tell us what methods exist to test the progress of children in primary schools from five to fourteen years of age.  Take a lad going to an ordinary school.  He gets from year to year what might be termed a superficial examination, a kind of class examination, which is entirely valueless. He goes on to the leaving-certificate stage, and then his parents discover that he is a complete failure.  Is there no sacrifice to-day entailed on parents in these hard times of economic depression to feed, clothe, and educate children up to fifteen or sixteen years of age, and then find out that they are practically useless?  Would it not be in the interests both of parents and <Col N="108" /> children if there were some tests to ascertain at reasonable intervals the progress of children from primary to secondary standards?</P>
    <P>I regret to say that I have very practical proof of the statements I have made in my own family.  I do not wish to exaggerate the position of affairs, but I say that defects exist in the present system.  I suggest to the Minister that if there is any alteration that should in his opinion be brought about, every thinking man in this House would be behind him in carrying it out. The Minister told the House facts which, in my view, are of outstanding importance.  He told the House plainly that his Department does not educate the youth of the country, that it can stimulate and aim at uniformity in the educational system, but the education of the youth of the country ultimately rests in the hands of the teaching profession itself.  We have been told by a representative of one of our great universities that some of the members of the teaching profession have already reached the age of sixty-five and, in some cases, seventy.  How can satisfactory results be obtained from men at that period of their career?  As I have already said, if the Minister has some proposals to make for improving the present primary system I ask him to let us know what they are.  The results of that system are not satisfactory.  If children go regularly to school for a number of years, and if, when they reach the age of fourteen, they are only in the third standard, what possible hope can there be either for them or for their parents?  As I have said, these deplorable results are not due to lack of regular attendance, and, so far as I can see, the School Attendance Act will not remove this cancerous growth from the primary system.</P>
    <P>If the Minister believes that the teachers are inefficient or that the system of control is something which it should not be, I suggest with all respect that he should inform the House in what respect the system is lacking, and in what way he would wish to have it improved.  Anybody with experience of education on the Continent or across-Channel is aware that the system of education in this country is fifty years <Col N="109" /> behind as compared with that of Great Britain, and a hundred years behind in comparison with that of the Continent. I suggest that perhaps the present system aims at doing too much.  When I was at school the curriculum which I had to tackle was not half so vast as that which children have now to deal with.  Perhaps the old story of the boy and the nuts is applicable to the present system.  We may be attempting to grasp too much and we really grasp too little.  Very simple requirements are necessary to give primary education to children.  If our curriculum is too large we should attend to it, and, if it needs alteration, make the most drastic alterations if necessary.  If teachers are inefficient&mdash;I do not care whether they are primary or secondary&mdash;they should make way in the interests of the State for those who are qualified to teach, and who can give good results to the country, which cannot afford to go on spending four and a half millions on the results which are obtained to-day.  We were told by the Minister that that Vote will probably be on the increase. It certainly will not be on the decline. Are we receiving value for that four and a half millions?  I suggest that we are not.  If the Minister is of opinion that he has not got sufficient control in matters educational, and if he informs the House of that fact, or if there are any other remedies which in his experience would prove beneficial in wiping out the deplorable things which he brought to our notice, I would ask him frankly and in all sincerity to let this House know, and I feel sure it will stand behind him to the last man.</P>

    <P>I should like to add to the references made already with regard to the provision of playing grounds for children. Deputy Sir James Craig at the start of the debate appealed to the Minister to consider that problem in all its aspects to see whether he could not devise some scheme whereby, especially in urban areas, suitable playing fields for children could be secured.  Anybody who knows the towns in this country knows how absolutely impossible it is for children to take suitable recreation in the vicinity of schools without becoming a hindrance to the traffic, and will realise that is certainly a pressing question that should receive more attention from the Department than it has received up to the present. I would like to support Deputy Sir James Craig in that plea, and I trust that the Minister will find it possible to devise some scheme whereby these facilities can be given in the towns especially.  The lack of suitable facilities for recreation does not apply so much to the rural areas, but certainly in urban districts, where the schools are in a cramped position, it would be a great boon to children if some system were adopted to facilitate them in that direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> When Deputy Fahy was speaking the other evening he said that there was no oral test in Irish for the lower grades of the Civil Service.  The Minister for Finance put in that there was now an oral test for junior clerkships.  That is very welcome information, because last autumn, when there was an examination for female writing assistants between the ages of 16½ and 18½, there was no oral test in Irish.  As this is one of the few examinations for which pupils of national schools can compete, it is very desirable that there should be an oral test in Irish so as to popularise the language in the schools. After all, if the children are given to understand that the mere reading and writing of the language in itself, or a book knowledge of it, will not get them anywhere in examinations, it is going to do a tremendous amount of good in popularising the language amongst the children as a spoken language.  Between leaving school and going to work there is a tremendous gap, and if that gap is to be filled in any way it will be filled by insisting that in examinations such as these there shall be an oral test and in making the children get a thorough grasp of the spoken language. Perhaps the Minister would state in his reply whether the oral test has been extended to such examinations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Professor Alton a few moments ago impressed upon the Minister the desirability of securing an itinerant teacher who would be able to use a cinema and lantern slides.  I would like to support him in that plea because of the fact that in remote districts, such as in West Cork, an innovation of that nature would be valuable not alone from the educational point of view but would give the children an added interest in school.  In other countries the cinema has been used for the teaching of different subjects, such as natural history, geography and history, and if it were found possible by some means to use lantern slides and cinemas it would be certain to have good results. If the Minister can find any means of doing it he will receive nothing but blessings, from the children especially, and from everybody who takes an interest in the development of education <Col N="112" /> on modern lines also.  There was a reference made, I think, by Deputy O'Reilly to the teaching of local history. That is a subject that has been neglected to some extent in most schools up to the present.  As it is the basis upon which all good citizenship rests, and the foundation upon which children can get a good groundwork for learning the later stages of the country's history, I think more attention should be devoted to it, especially in view of the fact that there are no areas in Ireland which do not possess a fund of local interest which would serve as a groundwork for learning national history afterwards and for imparting to the children the traditions associated with each district.  I hope more attention will be paid to this matter in the future because of its importance and because of the comparative neglect with which it has been treated up to the present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Professor Tierney made a very eloquent plea for the provision of cheap or free text books, because the cost at present on the average father or mother is too high.  Not alone that, but there is no standard series of text books, especially in Irish, and when children have to buy new text books each year, it is a practical impossibility for parents to provide their children with the requisite text books.  Something should be done to provide children with text books.  If a scheme cannot be formulated in that way, at least there could be a scheme for the standardisation of text books, and to supply and produce them more cheaply than at present.  I hope consideration will be given to that when the Minister is replying.  With regard to the suggestion of Deputy Fahy, that it would be advisable to enable county councils to give scholarships for training colleges, such scholars would remain in Ireland with consequent benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>I think that such scholarships are particularly desirable in the case of local authorities administering portions of the Gaeltacht such as the county councils of Cork, Kerry, Tirconaill and Waterford.  All agree that the Gaeltacht is an asset that must be preserved.</P>

This is a matter on which the Minister will possibly give us some information in the course of his reply. There is one other thing to which I would like to refer while on the education Vote, and that is the grant to the Aisteoiri Gaedhilge&mdash;that is, the grant to the Irish players and to the Abbey players.  I am in favour of such grants which have a national educational value.  In this connection, a few words of criticism may not be out of place.  So far as I can understand it anyhow, there seems to be no display of national sentiment in any of the plays so far produced under the auspices of these bodies.</P>

      <P>Na h-Aisteoiri Gaedhilge, the Abbey players, the body to which State assistance has been given. So far not a single word has been used which would run counter to the glowing tributes to this saoirse that we have.  I do not think that a playwright should be hampered in his activities and in the production of plays. I do not suggest that the stage in the Abbey nowadays should be used for propaganda purposes or for revolutionary drama, but I do say that encouragement should be given on the system I have outlined, whereby plays of a national aspect could be produced, and not have them circumscribed by the confines of this freedom about which we hear so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have nothing else to add to what the other Deputies have said, except, as I have said, that I wish to congratulate the Minister on the efficiency and progress of his Department during the past five years.  I had an opportunity of looking at some history papers for <Col N="114" /> an examination yesterday, and I must say in all honesty that there is 100 per cent. improvement in the subjects taken since I went to school, and that is not such a long time ago.  I do not think there is anything else I could usefully add to the debate.  I trust that the Minister will see his way to deal with the points raised by the different Deputies, particularly the point with regard to children's playgrounds raised by Deputy Sir James Craig.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrVincentJWhite" hpid="Dr. WHITE Dr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Dr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>In what I have to say, I will be very brief.  I have one or two ideas to put before the Minister.  I do not know whether he will consider them brilliant or not.  But I desire to bring them before him.  I had intended putting down a question about the possibility of our having ten minutes of the time in the elementary schools devoted to what is called Swedish drill or physical drill.  I do not mean military drill.  In all countries, in Europe and America, the physical development of the child is looked to with as great attention as the mental development.  I am not aware that physical drill or Swedish drill is practised as a routine in the elementary schools in Ireland.  Any of us who take an interest in our people and who mingle with the children of the country, would be at once struck by the lack of deportment&mdash;or the &ldquo;tout ensemble&rdquo;&mdash;the general way in which they carry themselves.  If this physical drill was included in the curriculum now, it would help to build them up physically.  When the child is developed physically, it means that that child will grow into a strong man or woman.  I would respectfully ask the Minister if it is at all possible to do this to mention it when he is summing up.  Another point that struck me was this: could not the class-rooms in the elementary schools be utilised for the encouragement of Irish manufacture? The children of this country or for the matter of that, the man in the street, knows very little about what is manufactured in this country, when all is said and done.  And if suitable brochures were published and suitable diagrams hung up in the class-room showing the treatment of the raw product, how the raw material is treated <Col N="115" /> until it is turned into a manufactured article, I think we would be cherishing an interest in the minds of the children. I think you would have very important media here in which you might work.</P>
      <P>Another point I would like to have information on&mdash;I am not sure whether Algebra and Euclid are taught in the elementary schools, but if they are, I think Euclid and Algebra should be made walk the plank and some subject or subjects of interest to the children taught, such as elementary biology or something about the minerals of Ireland. Ireland abounds in minerals, and it would be an encouragement and excite an interest in a subject that is capable of great development.  Speaking as a medical man, I would say that when the weather permits there should be more outdoor classes every day where possible.  The children in our elementary schools should be brought out beneath the greenwood tree, if they can find a tree, and let the class be conducted there.  I know there are some Deputies who are connected with the teaching profession, and they may not agree with me in this matter.  They may tell me that there are difficulties in the way.  But we here in the Dáil know what it is when the atmosphere gets very hot on a warm day, and it must be a great deal hotter and closer in these elementary schools.  I think when it is done in other countries, that there should not be any difficulty about it in Ireland.  The teachers could take the children out into the open and teach them there.  I merely want to congratulate the Minister for Education on the sound, solid statement he has made as regards education.  We must all admit, as far as I can see anyway, speaking as a plain Irishman, that the education is all that could be desired.  I do not take the pessimistic view that my colleague, Deputy Byrne, takes of elementary education, which is truly national.  The Irish language, we are all agreed, is one of the sheet anchors of our nationality. It occupies the premier place.  I have just merely put forward these few points, and I hope it is possible the Minister will take up some of them and put them into action if it is at all practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>We have arrived at this stage of the debate that it would be impossible to say anything new or anything very new.  Deputy Alton has emphasised that.  But there are some things that do not do any harm by being repeated and emphasised several times, and one of the things that impressed me most, and I have come in contact a good deal with it, is the very deplorable condition of some of the pensioned teachers, teachers who have retired on a starvation pension, a pension on which it is absolutely impossible to live.</P>
      <P>I have been asked by several of them to bring their condition to the notice of the Dáil, and through the Dáil to the notice of the Minister.  No doubt he is well aware of very many cases of that kind.  I am sure Deputy O'Connell also would be.  But there is certainly need for going into a good many of these cases, because their condition is deplorable in the extreme.  There are, in fact, some labourers who are far better off than some of those teachers who have served their country and who did their work well in times that are now becoming ancient history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be glad to know how the Compulsory Education Act is working in the rural districts, I have no doubt.  I suppose he has a very fair idea.  I should like to tell him about the part of the country where I live. There seems to be a vast improvement in the attendance at school of the children. There is one thing, however, that I notice, and that is that the schools as they are at present arranged seem in many cases to be inconveniently placed.  Some of them are too near to one another, and there are certain districts that have no schools at all.  I am sure that in the school-building scheme that will come into force sooner or later this is a matter that will naturally engage the attention of the Minister, but at the same time I should like to emphasise the point now.  In certain districts a drawback to the attendance of the children is the frightful distance that some small toddlers have to cover, in the winter time particularly.  In fact, in many cases it is impossible for the youngsters to walk that distance and give the attention to the work that is <Col N="117" /> required in order to obtain any knowledge that would afterwards be of use to them.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of schools, I would like to ask the Minister if the new school he promised for Allenwood, near Robertstown, is making any progress towards erection.  He promised that that matter would be seen to.  It was a very pressing matter, and the Minister arranged to look into it.  I should like to know if this school is being built.  I hope also in the new schools that are going to be built there will be attention paid to play-grounds. There is nothing that would have a better effect on the physique of the children than having proper play-grounds. In England a great many of the schools have small gymnasiums, nothing elaborate, but such things as parallel bars, horizontal bars, clubs and so on.  Those things are all to the good, and they have a very useful effect in keeping the children active and in engaging their attention in what is useful and healthy for them.  I have not noticed those things in any of the schools here.  They may be there, but I have not seen them.  In England it is quite a common thing in the primary schools to see the children making use of those things.  The children appreciate them, and no doubt they get a good deal of benefit from their practice. What Deputy White says about Swedish drill is, I am sure, very excellent advice, and it is carried out in many schools both in England and abroad.</P>
    <P>I think also an extension of university lectures throughout the country would be an extremely good thing.  It would make the winter less dull for the children if the subjects were interesting. They would be a great source of interest and instruction to the young people of the country, and many things that are not within their reach now would be brought to their knowledge by means of these lectures.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that children should be taught the archæology of their own district is very valuable indeed.  I think everybody ought to know the history of his own immediate neighbourhood. There is interest in every neighbourhood and in every county, and in that respect I am glad to see that most <Col N="118" /> counties have an archæological society. I invite anybody who takes an interest in that subject to join the Co. Kildare Archæological Society, which is a very flourishing institution.  If this subject is taught generally in the schools it will give the children an interest in things of the past, and will enable a lot of articles that are being destroyed through ignorance and want of understanding, things of great historical interest, to be saved, and it will prevent the wholesale destruction that has gone on throughout many parts of this country largely because of lack of knowledge.</P>
    <P>I hope through the combined new instruction that is being given to the children in the schools, both mentally and physically, that a race will arise in our country that will hold for us high places in every part of the world, both from the point of view of physical fitness and intellectual ability.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Wolfe stated at the outset is, I think, more true now than since he started speaking&mdash;that it is impossible to blaze a new trail through this Estimate. It has been canvassed from every angle, and I would like to look at it from another angle, if I could possibly find a new one.  With the various criticisms that have been levelled at it, I am in the main in accord.  I agree that some of the school buildings are deplorable, and that the sanitary conditions in some cases are indescribable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want particularly to do is to focus the Minister's attention on another aspect of education.  Deputy Anthony undertook to break the lance with what he described as university dons and Deputy Tierney essayed to defend them by telling us that the great trouble was in keeping the university dons out of public life.  Most of us will agree that it is almost impossible to keep a good many of them out of public life.  What they have brought into public life from the universities that is of value to public life is a matter that we might have a good deal of difference of opinion upon. That is the reason that I would like the Minister to give some consideration to the point as to whether the curricula <Col N="119" /> in the constituent colleges or in the university are not responsible for something of that.  What do the universities teach in the way of what might be described as social science? How are they at grips with the various real problems that face the country? What have professors who have entered public life contributed towards the solution of these various social problems that face the country?  With two brilliant exceptions, possibly none of them has given anything in the matter of a contribution towards the solution of these problems.  Have the universities ever considered the desirability, the necessity, of doing something in the matter of establishing professorships or lectureships or Chairs of Social Science in the universities? They are matters of vital concern to the people of this country, and matters of vital concern, indeed, to the people of every country.  It may be argued, and I am sure will be, that the people who are interested in studying these social science matters are people who are not otherwise interested.</P>

      <P>The University Colleges Vote is Vote 28, and is accounted for by the Minister for Finance.  If the Deputy will look at the list on the Order Paper he will see that the present votes are for the Office of the Minister, for primary, secondary and technical education, for science and art, reformatories and National Gallery.  It excludes from the Minister for Education university colleges, under which this would seem to arise, although whether the Minister for Finance, at any time, or any other Minister, could be blamed for the conduct of university professors in public life is another matter.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I <Col N="120" /> want to make any further suggestion beyond this: that possibly it would be urged that these people who would be interested in the study of social problems are not by their general education fitted to take full advantage of anything like a university course, and that for any entrance examination for a series of lectures or a course of studies in a university they might be debarred on that account.  I think, in matters of this kind, if it were necessary for them to proceed to a degree in social science or to get a diploma or a certificate, arrangements might be made so that the entrance or matriculation examination might be of a level that would enable them to take it without necessarily reducing the status of the university itself.  I do not know that the universities have given any consideration to that.  I know, and it is likely the Minister himself is very well acquainted with the arrangements that have been made across Channel between different colleges in such matters as social science and the various old universities in England. These matters are, I also understand, given attention elsewhere.  I hope the Minister will not turn the thing down, and that he will not treat it as something of a fad or in the nature of an Utopian idea.  I think it is something that is practicable, and that ought to be given consideration.</P>
      <P>There is also the matter of extension lectures.  I would like to know whether any consideration has been given to this, or whether such matters have been considered by the Minister.

      <P>The Minister may say that such matters are not relevant, and that it is the contact with university life that gives the culture, polish, and finish.  That may be true.  There are <Col N="121" /> many students throughout the country to whom the examinations would mark a stage in their progress, but at present they have no possibility of marking a stage.  Examinations of that kind would prevent a dry rot setting in and discouraging people in their studies.  I know scores of such people.  We want something that would take the place of the old Royal University, or the place that the London University is taking. That would be useful to the country. Dropping from the high and mighty matters of the university down to primary matters, there is one matter to which, I think the Minister should give consideration, and that is the number of places which have been given to ordinary candidates for entrance to the training colleges.  It has been suggested to me that it was only last autumn notice was given to a good many of these boys and girls, and they have suffered a great deal of hardship because of the few vacancies that are allotted.  I ask the Minister to consider whether something might not be done this year in order to give these people greater facilities.  Possibly, the matter may not be so difficult for the boys as the girls.  A great deal of time has been spent, and some money, by these boys and girls who have been preparing for the entrance examination. It has been suggested to me that it is not exactly just that they should be cut out on such a short notice as has been given.  I hope the Minister, if it is at all practicable, will make arrangements that will facilitate them, and give them a greater modicum of justice than has been given them up to the present.</P>

      <P>One matter which suggests itself to me is the position of <Col N="124" /> some junior assistant mistresses.  I have knowledge of very great hardship resulting from the treatment meted out to them, which I presume arises from the existing regulations.  These girl teachers are subject to rigorous rules in the matter of attendance, their position being dependent upon the average attendance in the schools.  From time to time it happens that the attendance goes down, with the result that these girls, in order to retain their position, keep on attending to their duties.  I have known cases where such girls have not been paid a salary for a period of twelve months, although they have continued to teach.  I am sure that these girls when they are teaching give good service.  If they absented themselves from the school during that year, as they could have, I expect that the children would not have gone back to the school.  As it was, the school regained its ordinary average and they were able to draw their salaries.  I think that is an undue hardship to inflict on these people.  In view of the fact that the average was merely a few below the standard required, and that it went up again to the required standard, it is unfair to deprive these girls of their salaries for the period in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards school buildings, particularly in the West, they are certainly very bad.  I know there is a scheme by which new schools can be built.  Some of the schools I have in mind are ninety years old and cannot be replaced, as it is impossible to raise locally one-third of the money.  I was speaking to a manager in one of the congested areas in the West, and he told me that one of the schools under his control was condemned as unsuitable by the Department twenty years ago.  Negotiations were begun with a view to erecting a new building, but it was found impossible to raise the portion of the capital required locally, with the result that that school is still in existence.  I put it to the Minister and the House that if the economic conditions in a locality are such that the people are not able to put up the required quota for the erection of a new building, and if the building is unsuitable for a school, it is not fair to inflict on the children and teachers the extreme inconvenience and <Col N="125" /> hardship that they sustain, physically and otherwise, in having to continue in such a school; that it would be only fair that this condition should be withdrawn in connection with new schools in the poorer areas and that the building should be undertaken by the State without any local assistance.</P>
    <P>As to the heating arrangements, it is painful in some parts of the country to see little children going to school carrying sods of turf in their arms, which is the only means of heating the school. In some of the poorer areas the children are poorly clad, and have to travel two and three miles to school in the winter. As a result, they often get very wet and have to depend on the turf they bring to the school to dry their clothes.  That is certainly very primitive, and the matter requires more attention than it has received.  The fact that these children have to remain in school, under the conditions I have mentioned, and without a meal, is also an extreme hardship, and it does not show any great interest on the part of the legislative body here that some provision is not made for the better care of the children and for providing meals for them.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Vote, but I cannot allow some of the allegations made by Deputy Byrne to go unchallenged.  He spoke of children of fourteen having only reached the third or fourth standard, and attributed that to the system of education in vogue.  I have some experience of teaching in primary schools, and I would answer the Deputy by saying that this condition of affairs cannot justly be laid at the door of the present system of education nor at the door of the teaching profession, but is due to the fact that God did not endow these children with sufficient brains to enable them to assimilate the instruction imparted to the classes in which they were enrolled.  I would point out to Deputy Byrne that there are many children who, if they attended a primary school, or even a university, would not at that age have attained the proficiency requisite to enable them to pass the third standard.  I should also like to suggest to the Minister that he should consider favourably the claims of the <Col N="126" /> old &ldquo;first-of-first-class&rdquo; teachers, and I also suggest that Irish dancing should be encouraged in the schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the largest Votes that comes before us for discussion.  The discussion up to the present has ranged over a wide variety of subjects&mdash;it has in fact been difficult to keep it within reasonable bounds.  I think we can classify our criticisms under three or four heads, such as administration, buildings, the attendance of the children and the training and qualifications of the teachers.  We are labouring at a considerable disadvantage, and what is more important, those responsible for carrying on the work of education&mdash; the managers and teachers&mdash;are labouring under a great disadvantage, owing to the fact that since this Administration came into being in 1922, there has not been issued to the schools any edition of the rules.  If a teacher or manager wishes to find out what the rules and regulations are on any given subject at present he has very great difficulty indeed.  Men have come into the service during the past three or four years who have never seen a copy of the rules and regulations.  Managers complain that they do not know what the rules and regulations are.  As a result of that, teachers are appointed to positions, and in three weeks or a month, sometimes even longer, the manager and teacher are informed that the teacher is not qualified to accept that particular position.  The teacher has left his former post, and it has been filled up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has been complained of year after year for the past three or four or five years, and while I can understand that at the beginning there would be some difficulty in compiling and co-ordinating the rules and adapting them to the new situation, still I maintain there is no possible excuse whatsoever for the delay which has taken place.  Surely if there was real earnestness upon this matter of codifying the rules as they existed, that could be done inside a period of six months. That would be a reasonable time to do it. There is considerable inconvenience to teachers and managers in not knowing what the regulations of the Department <Col N="127" /> are.  There have been regulations issued from time to time in the past five years in the form of circulars.  These circulars are sent to the managers and to the principal or head of the school.  But managers change about and new managers are appointed, and they may never have seen these circulars.  They come to the head of the school, they are filed away perhaps, and the assistant teachers may never see them.  It is as important that they should see them, as it is that the headmaster should see them.  The rules and regulations of the Department should be codified and issued in book form as they were under the old Commissioners of National Education.  That should be done immediately.</P>
    <P>That is the first criticism I offer and that is a matter entirely under the control of the Minister.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of inspection, as the Minister has said, a new system is about to be inaugurated, and, therefore, I am glad that he has listened to the criticism offered here from time to time with regard to the inspection system and taken the sensible step of setting up a committee to look into the whole question and devise a new system.  That new system is about to be brought into operation on the 1st August and we must wait and see how it is going to function before any criticism can be offered.  As the new system is going to be put into operation there is no use now offering any criticism of the system which will come to an end on the 31st of July.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word on the question of the inspectors generally, and perhaps some people may think it rather strange that I should say a word for inspectors.  But I would like to put in a word for the inspector of national schools.  I think he does not get as much freedom as he is entitled to get, that he is too much tied up with red-tape, that he has too many regulations, that he is tied too much to the apron strings of the office and has not sufficient independence in his own area. He should be regarded as I have often urged as a director of education for his particular area.  He should not be <Col N="128" /> expected to give an account of his doings, not only from one week to another but from one hour of the day to another, to the office in Dublin, where they are so full of that machine mind that they must have particular accounts of where every inspector is every hour of the day, every day of the week, and every week of the year. I do not think that is necessary.  I think it hampers what ought to be the real work of the inspector.</P>
    <P>I know many inspectors who work hard during the week, visiting schools, giving what help they can to the teachers and looking generally after the work of education.  They have to sit down on a Saturday or a Sunday to write long and detailed accounts of very small matters indeed, to fill up numerous forms of one kind or another.  I often compare the position of the national school inspector to that of the superintendent or inspector of police.  The police inspector has his office and his staff to help him.  The school inspector, who is at least as important to the community as the police inspector in any particular area, has to do all this official work himself.  He has to write up elaborate and long reports giving accounts in all their details of his various inspections.  I think much might be done there if the Minister and the chief officials of the Department would look into it to relieve inspectors of much of the work that they have to do at the present time and set them free to do what I regard as very much more important work, namely, the general direction of education in their particular areas.</P>
    <P>There have been some recommendations made by the programme conference to which reference was made by Deputy Fahy, Deputy Mullins and others.  One of those recommendations is that in connection with school books. I quite agree with much of what is said&mdash;that there is no regular standard of uniformity so far as our school books are concerned, and that applies especially to the books of the Irish language.  The programme conference which sat a year or two ago drew special attention to that, and recommended to the Department the appointment <Col N="129" /> of a permanent committee whose function it would be to supervise, and even to veto, books used, and to indicate the conditions in which new books will be sanctioned, and if necessary to take charge of the production of suitable ones.  I do not know what became of that committee, or whether it has ever been set up.  I have not seen any results from such a committee if it is in existence, but I do not believe there is such a committee.</P>
    <P>Recommendations were made for the issuing of suitable maps of particular areas for the purposes of teaching local history.  It is impossible, I believe, to find such maps at the present time.</P>
    <P>It being nine o'clock and Private Members business being set down by order, the Committee decided to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained on the last day the purpose of this Bill was to effect three main changes in the Act of 1926 which set up the Local Appointments Commission.  The first was to transfer to the Civil Service Commission the duties that now devolve on the Local Appointments Commission, calling the Civil Service Commission the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second was tó give local authorities a discretion, which up to this has been vested in the Local Appointments Commission&mdash;that at the request of the local authority a panel of not less than three names be submitted. The third was an alteration in the methods of selection.  I went on to discuss the personnel of the present Civil Service Commission.  It was explained by the Minister for Finance on the introduction of this Bill in 1926 that one of the three members of the Civil Service Commission was unwilling to take on the work of the Commissioner <Col N="130" /> of the Local Appointments Commission for reasons best known to himself.  I explained on the last day that to my mind it was rather an unreasonable suggestion that, in addition to other responsibilities and duties that he discharges, he should be asked to take on this particular work.  However, even though it were unreasonable to ask him, the Executive Council was quite willing to ask and to press that particular member to take on this work and, as they have been unsuccessful so far, I might invite the Deputy who moved this Bill to see what effect his powers of persuasion would have in this connection.  It comes to this, namely, that if this Bill were to pass and if that member persists, as I believe he would, in objecting to take on the responsibility of the duties of a Local Appointments Commissioner we would be faced with finding the personnel for a new Civil Service Commission or, at least, finding one other person who would undertake the responsibilities of that office.  The other member of the Local Appointments Commission could not undertake that duty.  The time which he devotes to the work of the Local Appointments Commission is at present as much as can be afforded, perhaps, more than can be afforded out of the time allotted for other duties.</P>
    <P>We would then be faced with the position under the amending Bill now before us of having two Commissions upset, and, I presume, having to look outside for another Chairman of the Civil Service Commission.  At the moment, neither of these bodies costs the State anything in respect of personnel. Two civil servants with the Ceann Comhairle act on the Civil Service Commission.  Three civil servants act on the Local Appointments Commission.  That work is done in addition to their other duties in the Civil Service.  I take it that that point is quite clear, because we are invited to upset two Commissions.  Going through the statement of the Deputy who moved the Bill, it would appear as if it were the simplest matter in the world to change the administration so that the Civil Service Commission <Col N="131" /> would discharge the duties now discharged by the Local Appointments Commission.  The second point, however is the material one in this measure.  The Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, was introduced for one main purpose and that was to secure in the appointment of officials of local authorities the very best qualified persons for each post vacant.  Stripped of all its language and verbiage, that was the main consideration.  The main consideration in this Bill is to secure that some person, other than the best qualified, will be appointed.  Local authorities are being invited, if this Bill becomes law, to ask for a panel of persons, not less than three.  Obviously, if you have others in competition with the best qualified candidate, all the canvassing, all the local influence, about which so much was said on the introduction of that measure two years ago, will be resurrected and, obviously, the best qualified candidates, when they have to run the gauntlet of the Selection Board, or an examination plus influence with the local authority, will not be attracted in coming forward for examination in such case.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of sending down more than one name except to invite the local authority to appoint someone other than the best?  That is the purpose of this measure, to secure that the best qualified person will not be appointed in future.  The Deputy may smile, but that is its meaning, stripped of all the language which he used during the last few days, and this measure to restore public confidence will be really a measure to invite local authorities to appoint others than the best qualified. The standard of candidates appointed under the 1926 Act has been high and the general result has been good.  After all, the Central Government have a right to some voice in connection with these appointments.  The distribution from the Central Fund last year to local authorities was about £3,000,000.  What do we ask in return? What do you deprive local authorities of in this connection?  Simply patronage, and preventing the appointment of persons not best qualified.  That is a <Col N="132" /> matter that is affecting public confidence, and the method of restoring it, according to the mover of this Bill, is to enable local authorities to appoint persons other than the best qualified.</P>
    <P>What about the poor man's son? What about the rights of democracy if there be not some premium for talent and capacity to fill these offices?  The Deputy has not explained how the poor man's son will secure by merit alone appointments under this Bill if it be passed.  What will the confidence be of those best qualified in applying for those positions?  It would simply be waste of time on their part unless they have a local pull.  Amendments to the same effect were moved here in the Dáil and got very little support when the Bill was introduced in 1926. Amendments to effect the same purpose, to provide a panel of candidates, were moved in the Seanad, and the Minister stated that he would prefer to withdraw the Bill than to have amendments of that character placed in the Act.  There is a discretion at present in the Commissioners as to the sending down of more than one name. That discretion has been exercised on one or two occasions, and on one occasion the candidates' marks in the examination were given.  In one case the Commissioners were roundly denounced for placing the responsibility of selecting one of two names on the local authority.  They were asked to select the best candidate, and the Commissioners were criticised in respect of that.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners, early in the sphere of their administration of this Act, had to make up their minds as to whether they would send down more than one name, and the first consideration which presented itself to their minds was the necessity of sending down the name of the best qualified candidate.  Secondly, if the Commissioners presented more than one name, where were they going to stop?  I noticed that the Deputy, in moving the Bill, referred many times to qualifications. He said &ldquo;a person qualified.&rdquo; I think he mentioned that at least on two occasions in the course of his speech. Secondly, he mentioned &ldquo;perfectly qualified&rdquo;; and, thirdly, I think he <Col N="133" /> mentioned a person &ldquo;over whose qualifications the Civil Service Commissioners would stand.&rdquo;  The Commissioners were satisfied that if more than one name were to be sent down, their first consideration&mdash;the best qualified candidate&mdash;would go by the board.  Their second objection was, where was the line to be drawn; and the third was that mentioned already &mdash;that if more than one name were sent down, the attraction for the best qualified person for the position would not be as keen as it had been up to then.  If there is one thing that has been achieved in appointments made under the Local Appointments Commission it is that the standard of the applicants for the various posts has been good.  With that degree of public confidence which the Deputy affects not to see, not to hear, and not to know, there has come a marked improvement in the standard of candidates for the various positions.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say more in connection with the third main consideration; that is, to restrict the discretion of the Commissioners in the matter of the selection of the best qualified candidate for appointment, and put it in the hands of the local authority.  I will just mention one particular case. We will suppose that a vacancy occurs for a dispensary doctor, and that it is within the competence of the local authority to ask for a written competitive examination.  I need not say that the time of the Minister and the time of the local authority would be wasted to a very considerable extent in pointing out that that would not be a suitable method for selecting the best person for appointment as dispensary doctor.  As regards the minor points in the Bill, Section 3 is unnecessary, as all those posts have been brought by order under Section 2 (c) of the Act of 1926, with one exception. That will be brought under the Act when the occasion arises for the making of an appointment under the Act. That is the case of the appointment of a chief clerk to a County Council.  As I have said before, Section 4 of the principal Act, which this Bill proposes to repeal, must go out if we are to have a staff for doing the work of the <Col N="134" /> Local Appointments Commission.  As I stated in the course of the Deputy's speech, a preference is given to candidates with local knowledge and experience, but not to such an extent as to allow for the appointment a person whose qualifications would be seriously under the standard of those of a person not having local knowledge or experience. The passage of this Bill would, to all intents and purposes, throw a certain veil of respectability over the old method of appointment.  It is a retrograde step.  It is an unnecessary, useless and bad Bill, and I recommend the House to reject it.</P>

      <P>I am of opinion that all appointments, whether under the central government or under the local authorities, and the method of making these appointments, are matters that ought to be above Party.  The method of making them should be such as to inspire general confidence amongst all sections of the people.  This Bill, apart from its substance, is a bad Bill from the point of view that it is about the worst example I have seen, since I came in here, of legislation by reference.  It is objectionable from the ordinary layman's point of view.  He wants to be in a position to take up an Act of Parliament and to know, in a general way in any case, what the law is.  But the main consideration which caused me to put down the amendment in my name is this: I agree with Deputy de Valera that there should be general confidence in the method of making appointments and in whatever methods or provisions we have for making appointments to these local authorities. I am not at all in agreement with him when he says that this Bill will give that general confidence.  I do not think there is much in the Bill, in the first place, and I do not think it goes to meet the objections which have been made such as I know them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the proposal to substitute the Civil Service Commissioners for the Local Appointments Commissioners. I do not think there is anything really in that either.  The other is the main consideration, that is, the question of the panel, and I think sound objections can be made to that even from points of view different from those <Col N="135" /> mentioned by the President.  I do not think, for instance, that a man would apply for a position and run the risk of being placed No. 3 on the panel and have the fact published far and wide that there were at least two other men who were better than he.  He might find himself applying for another position and find himself No. 3 again. I think that would be open to objection from the point of view of the applicant. I do not agree with the President that the position at the moment is such that it is not open to criticism of any kind. There have been complaints, and the President knows that there have been complaints, from local authorities and other people, and I would venture to say from the point of view of the Local Appointments Commissioners and the Minister for Local Government himself, that there might be something in the present Act that they would like to have remedied.</P>
    <P>I believe this is a matter on which there ought to be general agreement among all Parties.  Therefore, I do not like the idea of a Bill being introduced by one Party and being opposed by another Party who think that their own particular Act is perfect in all its forms.  What I would like to see is general agreement, and that is the one thing that will restore confidence in the administration of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act.  If there is general agreement among all Parties in this House with regard to the provisions such an Act should contain, and if any flaws which may be discovered in the Act are amended by general agreement it would be more satisfactory.  I, therefore, have suggested that instead of voting for the Second Reading of this Bill that the Bill be deferred and that a committee be set up, as I have suggested in another motion set down here in my name, which is really part of the amendment&mdash;that a committee be set up to examine and inquire into the Act.</P>
    <P>We have on all sides of the House men who are in very close touch with local authorities, members of local authorities, those who understand the work of local authorities and who know the complaints that have been <Col N="136" /> made from time to time with regard to the operations of this Act.  I suggest that a committee mainly composed of men in touch with local government in the country should be set up to examine into the working of the Act. I want to make it quite clear that I do not mean that this committee should go into particular appointments that have been made under the Act.  I want to make that quite clear.  I do not propose that the particular appointments that were made, or the methods used by the Local Appointments Commission of finding out who would be the best candidate for any particular appointment would be inquired into in any particular way.  What I do wish would be to get a committee together which would find out what the general complaints are with regard to the working of this Act generally, and what defects have been shown in its working and in its operations.  I believe that the Local Appointments Commissioners themselves would be able to give a good deal of information with regard to the defects which may have been found in the measure.  I believe that a body like the General Council of County Councils could give valuable information to the Committee, and possibly the Association of Local Officers and the Association of Municipal Employees could also give information that would be useful.</P>
    <P>If general agreement could be come to by a committee of that kind, it might be found, for instance, on investigation that there were really no material complaints at all, or defects in the original Act, or the committee might agree on a measure based on the evidence that would be put before them.  But I think the Committee would be likely to find that there were some defects at least that showed themselves in its working during the past two years, and in that case if an agreed measure were introduced into this House, a measure giving effect to the findings of a committee of this kind, I believe that would go far to restore public confidence.</P>
    <P>We know the nature of the complaints, the usual kind of complaint in which there is no real substance.  This arises largely from the fact that, as they <Col N="137" /> say down the country, anything that is done in Dublin cannot be right especially if it is done by one particular Party.  I am afraid that there is a feeling in the country, fostered, to some extent, as I have said before, by the particular Party which happens to be in power at the time, that only one Party can ever do what is right.  Now, that feeling is held largely by people who are not supporters of the present Government Party.  I think sufficient thought is not given to the fact that there is at least a possibility that sooner or later some other Party may come into power.  I would urge the House and I would urge the proposer of this Bill on the one side and the Government Party on the other side to consider these points that I am making&mdash;that it is necessary for the sake of good local government in the country that there should be the utmost confidence amongst all sections of the people in the method of making appointments to the local bodies.  There is not that confidence at the present time that one would wish. I think that confidence can be got by having something in the nature of an agreed Bill.  I do not like this present Bill and I think that in some respects, while purporting to give greater powers to the local authorities, it ties their hands more than they are tied at present. I could not see my way to vote for this Bill but I do believe that it will be to the advantage of all concerned if a Committee of this House, Deputies who are in close touch with local government, should be set up and go into this Act and inquire if there are any defects in the present measure as shown by its working during the past few years.  This matter ought be the subject of a measure which would be passed by general agreement in the House.  I have no doubt if that were done it would achieve what the proposer of the Bill says is his main object, namely to restore public confidence in the working of this Act at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very largely in agreement with what Deputy O'Connell has said but I could not, for one or two reasons, support his amendment as it stands.  First, I think, that while it is a good thing to set up a Committee to <Col N="138" /> examine the working of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, the motion which would do that ought to be somewhat differently worded, because as the amendment stands, if it became a substantive motion and were passed, the Committee would have power to send for all the papers of the Local Appointments Commissioners. There are some of these files which are confidential and which I think ought not to be examined by a Committee of the House, because it would damage the future working of that particular body.  For instance, there are on the files comments by the Commissioners on the people suggested to serve on Selection Boards and some of these comments might be very frank and unpleasant to the people concerned and it would be undesirable that publicity should be given to them.  Further, people who have acted on Selection Boards have been given an assurance that their reports would be treated confidentially.  They were given a guarantee in the following terms:&mdash;&ldquo;All communications and information which the members of the Board receive as such are to be regarded as strictly confidential and the Commissioners will so regard any reports or information which a board forwards to them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have acted on Selection Boards and have been able to put down their views quite freely and candidly in the belief that they would not be given publicity, and there should not be publicity given to them.  There are reports on the characters of the applicants and I do not think that it would be reasonable or fair that these reports should obtain publicity.  It would be possible to have a Committee with slightly different terms of reference which would inquire into the whole business, which would examine the Commissioners, examine them as to the procedure and which could have before them the officials of the Appointments Commissioners and which would have, if they were willing to come, as I am sure many of them would be willing to come, outsiders who have acted on the Selection Boards.  It would be possible to alter this amendment so as to get <Col N="139" /> the inquiry which I believe would be extremely useful and which would tend, because of the publicity that would follow, to increase confidence in the working of the Commission.  It would give an opportunity for any amendments to be brought forward which might be necessary and it would give information to the members of the Dáil that I think would satisfy them.  There might be small points in the Act which the Committee might wish to change but I think it would satisfy them as to the general working of the Act.  If this particular matter which is now on the Paper were out of the way the Government would be prepared to bring forward a motion for the setting up of a commission which would inquire into the working of the Act and into the working of the Commission set up under the Act.  I am opposed to Deputy O'Connell's amendment simply for one reason &mdash;it keeps in a state of animation what I regard as a preposterously stupid Bill and I think that Deputy de Valera's Bill should be given the fate that it deserves and thereafter we could take up such a motion as Deputy O'Connell has put down.  There might be some slight alterations.  It seems to me that the Bill proposed by Deputy de Valera is about as bad a Bill as it would be possible to have.  It seems to me that there is only one respect in which the scheme of things that it proposes would be better than the arrangement that existed prior to the passing of the Act of 1926.  I will state the one respect in which I think it would be better.  Prior to the passing of that Act the local authorities had, most of them pious resolutions in their books that preference should be given to all candidates who had a knowledge of Irish but when the appointments came to be made no preference was ever given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be possible, by the machinery which Deputy de Valera proposes to set up, to secure that the actual preference would be given, but in every other respect we would have these defects of the old <Col N="140" /> arrangements.  As the President has said, it is left to the local authority to say if there should be some method of selection other than written competitive examination, because, I take it, competitive examination means a written or mainly written examination. It is left to the local authority to decide whether or not some method of selection other than competitive examination is to be resorted to.  If some local authority, for any reason whatever, decided not to make representations to the Commissioners, and a dispensary doctor had to be appointed, or, perhaps, a surgeon in a county infirmary, there would be no means whatever of appointing him except by means of competitive examination.  I think I am perfectly right in that, because Section 10 provides:</P>
      <P>Whenever a local authority or the Minister requests the Commissioners to recommend to them the names of a person or persons qualified for appointment to an office to which this Act applies and the local authority in consultation with and with the concurrence of the Minister is of opinion that having regard to the knowledge and experience necessary for the efficient performance of the duties and qualifications prescribed under this Act for that office, the person or persons to be recommended as qualified for appointment to that office cannot be satisfactorily selected by competitive examination the Commissioners with the sanction of the Minister may dispense with the competitive examination required by this Act....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only power that would remain in the Bill for dispensing with competitive examinations.  It is provided that there is to be no choice; the local authority is to have no choice if there is to be competitive examination. I do not see why there is to be no choice in the case of competitive examination while there must be choice by the local authority in the case of competitive selection.  If selection could be made improperly, competitive examination could be carried out improperly, and it would be just as easy to carry out a competitive examination <Col N="141" /> improperly as to carry out competitive selection improperly.</P>
    <P>I will leave that aside, and I think everybody will agree that for the technical posts and, in fact, for the posts where experience and something more than the qualifications that one wants for a junior entrant are required, that there is no method of choosing the candidates other than by means of a selection board.  One of the results of the present system whereby one name is selected and the best qualified person is sent down to be appointed by the local authority, is that there have been great numbers of candidates coming forward.  In the case of dispensaries where there are two vacancies we have had something like fifty candidates, and a larger number of candidates have come forward for all the important posts, posts of value.  That shows that as far as the professional people are concerned they have confidence in the method, and we have been able to secure all sorts of leading professional men to act without any remuneration and in the public interest on the selection boards.</P>
    <P>If we allow three names to go down to the local authority, the position is immediately changed radically for the worse.  In the first place, the number of candidates would fall off. People who are good and who are willing to take those posts and are desirous of having them, if they are to get them on their merits, would decline to enter if they had to go through the ordeal of canvassing the members of local bodies after having been recommended by the Appointments Commissioners. In that case substantial numbers of the very best candidates who have gone forward would decline to compete for the vacant posts, and that would reduce the number of candidates. Then, again, people who would not have any money to spend, and who would not have pull or influence, and who could not get other people to canvass for them, would refuse to go forward; and there again the number of candidates would be reduced.  Then there would be no certainty, but the very opposite, that the best candidate, even amongst the reduced number going forward, would be appointed.</P>
    <P>It is admitted that the local authorities <Col N="142" /> would have no means of judging the respective merits of the various candidates.  It would be simply a matter of election, a matter of pull and influence.  That is no reflection on the local authorities.  It could not be otherwise, especially in view of the habits and the system which existed before this Act was set up.  If this Act had been in operation for fifty years, and you had nobody accustomed to the canvassing methods in operation, you might get members of local bodies asking professional men for advice in trying to come to some decision on the merits.  But in present circumstances nothing else could happen than that perhaps, the candidate who could spend most money and secure the support of the most influential men on the local body would be appointed.  When that would have happened for some considerable time, you would have a very unsatisfactory result compared with present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have been informed, and I believe it is true, that medical men who have some experience and who contemplate going forward for local vacancies have been taking out post-graduate courses and doing everything towards improving their qualifications, in the knowledge and belief that they would improve their chances of appointment. This Bill would stop all that work that has been going on; all that work would be brought to an end.  Leading members of the various professions would not be willing to give their time on selection boards if the third-rate man was as likely to be appointed as the first-rate man, and if the number of candidates coming forward was restricted by lack of confidence.  More important still, lack of confidence in the system of the selection boards would render it more difficult to constitute those boards satisfactorily.  Considerable expense would have to be incurred with them, and perhaps doubtful results would follow.</P>
    <P>As far as I can make out, the idea that Deputy de Valera has in connection with this Bill is that responsibility must be spread, that you must have the Commissioners reducing the number of candidates who may be appointed to three or so, so that you get somebody above the average standard <Col N="143" /> and that some one of those entering must be appointed, and that then, lest the Commissioners should be tempted to put their own candidate who is no good at all at the top of the list, you have three names sent down, and you allow the local authority to correct the errors and undo the misdeeds of the Local Appointments Commissioners by allowing them to select from three. As a matter of fact, there is inherent in the present arrangement a check of that kind, because the Local Appointments Commissioners do not themselves make the selection.  In all cases they are assisted by a well-qualified Selection Board.  There are reputable and well-known outsiders on these Selection Boards, and if the Local Appointments Commissioners refuse to send down to the local authority, without cause which they can make known and be understood, the name of the candidates recommended by the Selection Board as the best qualified, there is going to be publicity, and publicity of a most damaging character to the Local Appointments Commissioners. When the recommendations are sent in by the Selection Board to the Local Appointments Commissioners documents accompany them, such as the candidate's application forms and testimonials.  The Local Appointments Commissioners are able to, and as a matter of fact do, scrutinise these application forms and testimonials.</P>
    <P>An official of the Local Appointments Commissioners, their secretary, is present at the meetings of the Selection Board, and if there was any trickery being done by the Selection Board the Local Appointments Commissioners have the means of checking and countering that.  It is possible for them, if there seems to be any matter for suspicion, doubt or any lack of care or consideration on points of importance, to re-assemble the Selection Board and ask the members of it to look into or explain points that seem to be obscure.  The check that Deputy de Valera seems to seek exists already.  It exists in a form which has no harm in it but which undoubtedly gives confidence.  It allows for the existence of confidence in candidates, <Col N="144" /> and ensures that the best men be appointed. It does away with all the canvassing and, in certain cases, the corruption which existed under the old scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there was any other argument that seemed to be one of substance in Deputy de Valera's speech, except where he referred to the right that local authorities have to make appointments.  I see no reason at all why officials should be chosen by the local authorities under which they are going to serve, just as I see no reason why officials acting in a Department of State should be chosen by the Minister.  The officials of local authorities are no more the personal employees of the Council under which they serve, than civil servants are the personal employees of a Minister.  The Minister is there temporarily acting on behalf of the public.  Members of local authorities act similarly, and it seems to me to be quite proper that in both cases the selection of individuals to be employed should be made by the machinery which exists and which was designed to get the best value for the public by getting the best person in. In that way, you do a democratic thing: you give the best qualified person the appointment.  There is no reason why a council that is in existence to-day, while half of its members may not be local representatives next month, should make appointments rather than that they should be made by the machinery which was designed for the definite purpose of securing fair play and efficiency.</P>
    <P>The President referred to other points in connection with this Act. The only legal obscurity in the existing law is left untouched by this Bill, and by Section 6 of the Bill new obscurities are created.  I think if anybody were to read Section 5 of the Act, as amended by Section 6 of this Bill, he would find that it would be quite impossible to gather what the effect of it was.  There would be no saving in having the same persons Civil Service Commissioners and Local Appointments Commissioners.  The staff is a joint one, and there could be no reduction of expenditure by making the change suggested.  As the President <Col N="145" /> pointed out, the only effect it would have would be to force a change in the personnel of the Civil Service Commission and in the personnel of the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>If we could have got all the present personnel, with the present Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to act as Chairman of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  We would certainly have appointed him, but as he was not willing to act we had to make other arrangements.  We thought that his services in every respect were too valuable as Chairman of the Civil Service Commissioners to force him to resign if he would not undertake this new duty, which, while it is mechanically the same, is different, I think, essentially.  There is no value in that part of the Bill.  As the President pointed out, there are drafting defects in the Bill.  I suppose they could be remedied, but at any rate it is unworkable as it stands.  If we thought the present system was bad, there are various ways by which we could effect changes, but I see no virtue at all in the system proposed to be set up under this Bill.  I think that we should not hold this Bill over, but that we should deal with it on its merits, that we should reject it, and that is the reason why I object to Deputy O'Connell's amendment.  I do not think that we could hold out any hope that this Bill would be passed later on, or that it would be passed with some amendments. I think it is a bad Bill.  I think it is an ill-considered Bill, and that it is perhaps the result of an attempt to reconcile conflicting opinions within a political party.  It is illogical and unworkable.  I think it is entirely a bad and useless Bill that ought to be forthwith thrown out.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Connell, but as there has been criticism, very ill-founded, and suspicion an inquiry would enable members of the Dáil, and through them other members of the public, to see exactly how the Local Appointments Commissioners work and the difficulties they have to contend with.  That would be valuable, and the Government would be prepared to set up a committee which <Col N="146" /> would do what Deputy O'Connell desires, except that we would draw the terms of reference in such a way that certain kinds of papers that ought to be confidential because of their personal effects could not be called for and made public.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance seems rather puzzling in the statement he has made.  I wondered why the Executive when they tackled this problem recently did not adopt the Civil Service system completely. Probably that step might have saved all this trouble and would also have saved the Minister the trouble of using all these adjectives as regards the present Bill.  This Bill would not have been introduced only that there were very good reasons for doing so.  I believe the question we are examining to-night is a very important one for the future of the country.  We all must remember that we are a new country, a country that has had no opportunity of learning how to govern.  We have been without universities and, up to the present, without a proper system of education. The people through the country have had no opportunity of getting self-confidence so as to prepare themselves for the government of the country. As far as I can see, the Act is aimed very directly at breaking the confidence of the people in themselves. The reasons given for taking the powers of appointment from the local authorities are that they were open to all kinds of trickery, jobbery and corruption. I believe that we all in this House and in the country are of the same flesh and blood as the men on those local bodies.  They are elected by the people to carry out certain duties, and I believe anything that is done to break the confidence of those people will eventually be detrimental to this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These local bodies are specially selected by the county councils.  I admit that in previous times jobbery and corruption did exist, but then the outlook of the people was not what it is to-day.  Remember there is a better spirit abroad to-day than we have ever had.  We have a certain amount of confidence given to the people, and I believe <Col N="147" /> the Government should make every effort to develop that confidence and give them the opportunity of selecting candidates that are locally fit and who have a thorough knowledge of the districts to which they are to be appointed. Dealing with this Bill, the President spoke of the question of economy.  If this Bill were passed it would be necessary, I suppose, to pay certain officials.  I do not say that that economy or the present economy makes a great deal of difference.  As to the question of efficiency and qualifications, especially with reference to medical men, on paper they may have very high qualifications, but I am sure that as regards the medical profession there is such a thing as confidence in the doctor, and where that exists it goes a long way towards success.  People are accustomed to certain doctors, and they are perhaps accustomed to have local men from their own county appointed, and they believe in these men for reasons of their own.  Now the local bodies are not considered capable of selecting suitable men, but I believe they are.</P>
    <P>After all, these bodies are to be in charge of their staff, and they should have the opportunity of selecting the officials who are to carry out their orders.  As I have said in the beginning, this Bill will help to restore the confidence of those who are elected to the county councils.  The plea to-day is very often made for eligible candidates for the county councils, capable men, men of ability, but they say, &ldquo;What can we do, as we have no control over anything?&rdquo; This Bill is the first step in breaking that lack of confidence.  Why have such a thing as county councils? Why not have the whole local business directed by the central authority here in Dublin?  There must have been some intention when local government was granted to the people, and I believe the intention was to give them a certain amount of training in self-government. Anything that breaks the confidence of the people in themselves is, I believe, detrimental to the future good government of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. HENNESSY Dr. HENNESSY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this question I think it would be of some value to review the type of candidates <Col N="148" /> before the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act was enacted, and the candidates who have come forward since.  Previous to the Act being passed it frequently happened that a medical candidate passed his examination to-day, got his final degree conferred on him, and he went down the day after and got elected.  That was his experience. This may be an accident or it may be an arrangement.  However, he could not get elected if he had not a good number of friends on the local authority.  It mattered very little what the professional experience of his opponents might be.  It would count nothing for them if they had not friends enough on the Board.  I am not going to go into the question of how the man happened to get so many friends on the Board, but there are people old enough in this House, and with experience enough of local authorities, to know that it was a very good provision if you wanted to get a local dispensary at the time the Board was being constituted to see that you paid good attention to it. Since the passing of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, a candidate soon came to realise he had very little chance of being appointed unless he could show a good deal of professional experience.  I am speaking mostly of medical candidates.  If a man could show he had six months' experience in a clinical hospital as a house surgeon and physician, and in addition if he took out a post-graduate degree as Master of Surgery, M.D., or one of the fellowships of the Royal Colleges&mdash;to get these things meant a good deal of time and cost to him&mdash; it meant for a certainty that he was going to be appointed.  I ask&mdash;is not that appointment of greater value to the poor people of the district than the appointment of the candidate who, under the old régime had passed his examination one day, and went down to a district and was appointed the day after?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a good deal about the poor here.  The poor have votes, and for that reason we will hear at times what political parties are ready to do for the poor.  Here you have an opportunity of doing something for the poor.  It has <Col N="149" /> been done for the poor.  Keep it there. I have heard many medical appointments made by the Local Appointments Commissioners criticised.  It was my business, and the business of the association, to keep a very watchful eye on the Appointments Commissioners to see that none but the very best men, those best entitled, would be put in No. 1 place.  We kept an eye on them, and we can say honestly&mdash;I am speaking for the Medical Association&mdash; that none but the best men got the appointments.  I have known a man with first-class honours through all his arts degree, honours through all his medical degree, a post-graduate work of distinction, distinction that was so far-reaching that it was recorded in other countries, to be appointed to first place for a dispensary.  The local authority objected to him.  Why did they object to him?  Because he was a Kerry man.  That was the only objection. In the very same place it happened that there was a local man and he was recommended by the Appointments Commissioners.  He was a distinguished local man, but then there were other local men who had a number of friends on the local authority.</P>
    <P>I have heard something about local experience.  I do not know what that means.  I could understand if you said that the man appointed should speak the language of the people.  I could appreciate that.  I believe that the interpretation of &ldquo;local man&rdquo; is one who knows the shortest cut from Knockna-Skeherooh to Mowamanahan in the Knockmealdown mountains.  I think that is the qualification that would be put on local experience, and I think it is altogether of secondary importance to the fact that that man is better able to diagnose pneumonia, or able to set a fracture, than a candidate who was placed lower on the list.</P>
    <P>The medical profession, as well as other people, were subjected to severe criticism with regard to canvassing and other doubtful means of election to these positions.  As far back as 1911 this matter was brought to the notice of the professional organisation, and the profession has this much to its credit, that over 90 per cent. of them voted in favour of having these <Col N="150" /> appointments made in future by competitive examination, or by some other means, such as have been adopted in the present Act.  I know that the position of the local authorities is a difficult one.  They are subjected to all kinds of influence and I know that decent men, owing to the influences brought on them, have been driven out of public life.  They would not continue to be public representatives owing to the influences that were brought to bear on them.  I am not going to talk about the purchasing of votes, but if a man owed money in a bank, and if it was found out who the sureties were, they were pressed into the canvassing campaign. It was very difficult for that class of men, no matter how well meaning they were, to act straight in the election, and the result was that they frequently voted against their better judgment and inclinations.  We have heard it stated that there was dissatisfaction with the local authorities.  Deputy de Valera dwelt on that and gave a fair indication of the dissatisfaction, but he also more or less triumphantly stated that there is dissatisfaction with the Appointments Commissioners. The Deputy did not tell us why there was dissatisfaction with the Appointments Commissioners.  It has all been the result of the Commissioners having appointed the best men as against the local men.</P>

      <P>Some would suggest that there was reason for an objection to the placing of the candidate by the Appointments Commissioners, or by the Selection Board.  How was it that not one of these candidates ever brought the matter before their medical association?  If there was any corruption in the making of appointments the first body that would take it up for them would be the medical association. No, they kept their whinings for the common people, as they have been called here, the people who did not understand and could not apprehend the nature of their complaints.  They never brought them before the professional body that was competent to deal with them, for the simple reason that they had not a leg to stand on.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> A panel of candidates has been suggested as a reasonable measure.  Well, I think a panel of candidates is very objectionable.  Deputy O'Connell has given a reason why it is objectionable. My main reason for calling it objectionable is that it will lead to canvassing. If you send the names of three candidates down to local authorities, without placing them, or making it incumbent on local authorities to elect them in the order of 1, 2 or 3, or whatever the order may be, that is very objectionable, because you are going back to the old régime.  You will have canvassing and, if you wish, the bribery that went on to secure these appointments in the past.  Moreover, I do not think any Selection Board under these circumstances would act. I cannot conceive how a medical board would agree to select candidates and number them 1, 2 or 3, knowing that No. 1 stood a good chance of being put last by the local authorities, and No. 3 picked out.  If the Selection Board found that out it would not act again. Moreover, I know that if the Appointments Commissioners had in the past interfered with the placing of the candidates by the Selection Board the Selection Board would refuse to act, and a good deal more would be heard about it.  I know that in the case of a medical board which would accept service under such conditions it would be undoubtedly repudiated by the profession, and it would not deserve the confidence of the profession.  Somehow I see all through this Bill what I must describe as a yellow streak of venality.  It is giving an opportunity to the weak and venal.  Moreover, this cannot be lost sight of&mdash;that the Opposition has declared that it means, so far as it is within its political influence, to man the local authorities, and to get all their supporters on these bodies.  To my mind, that is a very awkward thing, and the result will be suspicion.  If you have a majority of one political party it will lead to canvassing on political lines.  I have heard a very distinguished member of the front Opposition Bench, who is a colleague of mine in the representation of Dublin City South, say that the representatives on the local bodies had <Col N="152" /> no inducement to act.  He meant by that that patronage was taken out of their hands.  The man who regards patronage of that kind as an inducement to go on a public board is, I say, potentially corrupt.</P>
    <P>If this Bill be by any chance passed, the whole thing will lead to suspicion. In fact, when a candidate who deserved number one place is not elected, that candidate will possibly think, if the description fits his case, that his misfortune was that his politics were those of President Cosgrave, or his religion that of Robert Emmet or Wolfe Tone.  You might also bear in mind that in sending down a panel of candidates there would be people uncharitable enough, whether it is well-founded or ill-founded, to think that it is to give an opportunity to select a candidate with certain political or religious opinions.  Well, that would be a bad day for the graduate, say, of the National University, 90 per cent. of whom have to seek their living in other countries.</P>
    <P>The one thing that surprised me about this Bill is that the Chancellor of the University should actually sponsor it in such circumstances, and this much I must say, that the fact of his sponsoring such a Bill is not consistent with his being an efficient Chancellor of the University.  I make allowance for his difficulty, but there it is; if that Bill is passed into law the interpretations I have given you will be in vogue in a few days, and it will be a very serious thing for graduates of the National University, because I know a good deal of their difficulties in England and other places where they have to find a living, and the prejudices they have to surmount, and as sure as this Bill becomes law it will mean the end of the chances of a National University graduate finding employment outside this country.  I hope that this Bill will be rejected; I hope, in the interests of decent administration, it will be rejected, and above all, I hope, in the interests of the poor people, that it will be rejected.  These people are not dissatisfied with the candidates selected by the Appointments Commissioners. I have asked some of them, after a time, in certain places what they thought of a person selected.  They <Col N="153" /> spoke very highly of him, and so well they might, because these men were the best we had.  For that reason I will ask you not to touch this Bill at all, but to defeat it by an overwhelming majority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking with some knowledge of the manner in which this Act has operated in the country, I do feel that it is due on my part to say that the Act is not satisfactory.  But the primary objection to it is that the whole power of setting up the examining body lends itself to many of the disadvantages it is claimed that the Act would have remedied, as well as the fact that there are many obscurities in the whole transaction that leave the way open to insinuations that are certainly not favourable to the present administration.  The underlying motive in having Appointments Commissioners at all was the intention that the system would remove the tendency on the part of local councillors to give perhaps an undue preference to local applicants&mdash;that by the removal of localism, or that personal touch, better administration would be secured.  Many people may find it difficult to understand why the Dáil would find it necessary to pass a disqualifying verdict on the responsibilities of local representatives when one bears in mind that the election of county councillors is based on a much more conservative franchise than that employed for the election of representatives in this House.  You must therefore place a certain amount of responsibility upon the people who elect the local representatives, and if you do not mean to be actually discourteous and very unfair to the local representatives, you certainly will not insinuate &mdash;and it is very much insinuated&mdash;that the local representatives are not responsible people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly there has been a strong desire on the part of public bodies for some time back to have a scheme of this sort put into effect, because very often local representatives were at a disadvantage in finding the best candidates. The absence of any test was certainly a disadvantage, and local representatives very often found it an inconvenience.  But they were not prepared <Col N="154" /> to agree to having full power taken out of their hands, and at the same time have the insinuation made against them that they were incompetent, dishonest and open to corruption, and in that way that they were not fit to be public administrators.  But it goes further: If we are to argue that the scheme in the past has been unsuccessful and requires alteration, we must naturally conclude that a great number of appointments made by the various county councils have been unsatisfactory. I wonder if the supporters of the Act here and the representatives of the Local Government Department admit that local officials all over the country are generally unsatisfactory?</P>
    <P>The appointment of the examining body has already been referred to.  Undoubtedly, as I have stated, the whole explanation of the Act is that there has been in the past too much local touch and that public representatives were not enabled to do according to their best intentions.  But I have found that in the setting up of this examining body the Local Appointments Commissioners have, on some occasions at least, selected these examining bodies from the local people.  What I fail to understand is how it can be claimed that the local representatives, selected by the people to act as county councillors, cannot be trusted to act impartially, and that local people in some instances have actually been appointed from the boards who have later to make the appointment, and I cannot understand how these men can be discovered to be honest and fair-minded by a few men up in Dublin.  I think that is inconsistent. What makes the thing very objectionable is that when the examination takes place and the result is sent down by the Local Appointments Commissioners, they give no public announcement of the result of that examination, beyond sending down the name of the selected candidate to the local body.  If they are to remove any doubts in the minds of the people&mdash;why people&mdash;and I assure you there are doubts in the minds of the people&mdash;why not submit the result of the examination in respect of all the candidates. and let the local body see how the position <Col N="155" /> stood?  But it is a matter of closing the desk upon every applicant's position except the one selected, and that gives a good deal of foundation for the belief that there is not fair play and that the best candidate does not get the position.  The Minister for Finance referred to the great results of this system as shown by the fact that the number of applicants for these posts has considerably increased.  I can tell him, from opinions gathered in the country, that the opposite will be the result, because a strong opinion prevails, grounded upon a good deal of fact, that on account of the secrecy that is observed by the Appointments Commissioners, the number of applicants will be very much reduced.</P>
    <P>I referred here on another occasion to the appointment of an assistant matron in the mental hospital and I pointed out that in the opinion of the Sligo and Leitrim Joint Committee the appointment was not carried out in such a manner as would justify them in agreeing to it.  The result was that they turned down the decision.  Notification of the examination was sent out five days before the examination. One of the applicants was at home when she made her application, but subsequently had gone to a position in England.  The letter notifying her of the examination was sent to her home address, and by the time it reached her she could not give notice and be back in time for her examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to answer that, but it seems strange that only five days' notice of the examination should be given. Some allowance should be made for changes of address like that, particularly as the appointment was under consideration for at least two months before the Commissioners fixed the date of the examination.  Cases such as that show conclusively that the Act is not appreciated by the country.  I know of public bodies that approved of the principle of the scheme at the <Col N="156" /> outset, but who from their experience of its administration have definitely set their faces against it.  I say to Ministers that if they want to restore the confidence that local bodies should have in themselves and the self-respect that is necessary, if they are to become honest administrators, this House should have confidence in them and hand them back the authority to make selections for appointments according to their own honest judgment.  The attitude of the present Appointments Commissioners shows entire lack of confidence in these public representatives. If that spirit is encouraged, the result will be that there will be great difficulty in finding honest, self-respecting men to act on local councils, because they are being branded as incompetent persons who are open to corruption.  If these are the kind of men that Deputies opposite are putting forward as their candidates in this election, I shall be surprised if the country does not express its opinion of what it thinks of them, because, after all, the country does not like men who distrust themselves.</P>

      <P>I am fundamentally in agreement with the Minister for Finance in deploring the fact that Deputy O'Connell has drawn this red herring in the shape of an amendment across this Bill.  I agree on principle with the amendment.  I do not consider that the Act in its original form was absolute perfection.  Every Act after it has been working for a certain period of time, can be amended to advantage, but I consider that this Bill, introduced by Deputy de Valera, strikes right at the heart of the Principal Act.  For that reason I think that opportunity should be given to the Dáil to decide on this particular Bill before we deal with the question of Deputy O'Connell's amendment.  I must say that this Bill introduced by Deputy de Valera occasioned me very considerable surprise&mdash;surprise, not so much at the contents of the measure itself, as at the source from which it comes.  In pre-Treaty days, when many Deputies opposite stood with Deputies on these Benches on a common <Col N="157" /> platform, one of the most cherished planks of that platform was the policy of recruiting officers and employees for local authorities, as to the Civil Service, on the principle of open competitive examination.</P>

      <P>I do not wish in this matter to take up a partisan attitude.  I was the one primarily responsible for introducing this Act, and I can assure the House that it was not introduced as a political measure.  It was not a measure from which any political kudos was to be obtained.  It was an unpopular measure at the time and I realised that very well.  It was an Act that was very much criticised, but it is a more popular Act to-day, and its popularity will increase as time goes on and as people realise the good that the Act has conferred upon the public in general.  I was in the position of being required to deal with this difficult situation and I was prepared to face the political consequences of doing it.  Perhaps, to some extent, I may have suffered in consequence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for raising this matter on the Adjournment to-night is that on several occasions I tried to get a satisfactory reply to questions I put on this matter, but could not do so.  In the first place, I asked a question last week under four heads.  The reply I got covered only one head, and not four.  The reply states: &ldquo;A resolution was passed as stated.  It is understood that the inclusive salary referred to operates as from 1st April, 1927.&rdquo;  Then it states further that &ldquo;an agreement is in course of preparation which has, I understand, presented some drastic difficulties. The County Council have been asked to complete the matter without avoidable delay.&rdquo;  That agreement contains about ten clauses.  Clause 6 of that agreement contained a pension clause.  When the agreement was sent up in December, 1926, to the Department they sent down a reply to the County Council objecting to the pension clause of the agreement.  If that agreement had been operative without the sanction of the Local Government Department&mdash;and the Minister's reply does not say it was sanctioned&mdash;if it was in operation without sanction then what is the position as regards the pension clause of that agreement which has been objected to by the Department? As a member of the Special Finance Committee, I definitely objected to the pension clause and I sent that objection up to the Department.  I considered it very unfair.  That clause stated that the Secretary should be paid a pension of £1,033 per annum. and that if necessary for that purpose a number of years were to be added to his years of service so as to entitle him to such a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first actions of that Special Finance Committee was to adopt a resolution that no years should be added to any official's years of service in order to entitle him to an increase of pension more than he would be justly entitled to.  In the second place, I considered it grossly unfair that in the position that this gentleman holds from the ratepayers and <Col N="159" /> which carries a salary of £480 a year, they should be mulcted on his retirement by providing him with a pension of £1,033.  These are the reasons why I raised this matter on the Adjournment. I want to know definitely if that agreement is being brought before the Minister for his sanction, and if so, whether it has been sanctioned or not? If it has not been sanctioned, is it a fact that there is in operation in Cork county a salary under an agreement, a clause of which has been objected to by the Minister?  I want this question definitely answered now.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 13th December, 1926, the Cork County Council notified that they proposed to fix an inclusive salary of £1,550 for the Secretary of the Council.  This salary was in substitution for remuneration composed of a fixed salary as Secretary of the County Council of £450 per annum, plus certain fees of magnitude, but of varying amount, which probably, in gross amount, exceed £2,000 per annum, from which expenses for clerical assistance are deductible.  The proposal of the Cork County Council appeared appropriate, and the action of the Secretary of the County Council in accepting the proposal was generally satisfactory.  My letter of the 31st December, 1926, acquiesced in the Council's proposal.  I understand that effect has been given to the proposal <Col N="160" /> as from the 1st April, 1927.  It was by reason of the fact that the system whereby fees of uncertain amount might accrue to local officials that control was taken of such appointments in the Local Government Act of 1923.</P>
      <P>In every case where vacancies have since been filled inclusive salaries have been fixed, e.g., Donegal, Leitrim, Leix and Offaly County Councils.  I understand an agreement is in preparation dealing with matters additional to that of Mr. Callanan's salary, and with which I am not concerned.  I understand that some delay in perfection of the agreement has arisen.  The agreement deals with future superannuation and other matters.  I have recommended the Cork County Council to complete the formal agreement.</P>
