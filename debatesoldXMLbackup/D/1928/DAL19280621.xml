      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state (a) in what year the last general Poor Law Valuation of agricultural land took place; whether he is aware that many holdings on such land are at present unfairly rated owing to circumstances which did not exist at the time this valuation was made; and whether it is intended to have a general re-valuation of such land in the near future; (b) what steps must be taken at the present time to have a re-assessment made on such land; by whom, and under what Statute.</P>

      <P>The tenement valuation of Ireland, which was commenced in 1852 and completed in 1865, was the last occasion on which a general valuation of agricultural land took place.  I am aware that a case could be made for the revision of the valuation of many holdings, some of which have decreased in value owing to the decline in tillage and the unsuitability of the land for grazing purposes and some of which, on the other hand, have been enhanced in value owing to reclamation, drainage and other improvements.  I could not, at the present time, undertake to initiate legislative proposals for a general valuation, which would be a very costly operation, but consideration will be given to the matter as soon as circumstances permit.  In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, there is no power under existing <Col N="1102" /> legislation to re-open the valuation of a holding of agricultural land.  Section 34 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, purported to provide for a general revaluation of a country at stated periods on the application of the Grand Jury, but in the absence of any provision for meeting the cost of any such general revaluation and for the necessary amendment of the basis of valuation of land, which at the primary valuation was the agricultural prices laid down in Section 11 of the same Act, Section 34 was held to be inoperative, and no applications for a general revaluation were ever made except in respect of county boroughs.  Section 65 of the Local Government Act, 1898, made provision for a general revaluation of a county borough, but did not extend beyond these areas.  Two county boroughs have already been revalued under this section&mdash;viz., Dublin and Waterford&mdash;the necessary application having been made by the county borough council in each case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that the Limerick County Council, in the year 1926-27, struck and collected a rate of one farthing in the pound for the purpose of awarding prizes at the Show Sales of dairy shorthorn cattle in the county, and that his Department has refused sanction for the application of the proceeds of this rate for the purpose for which it was collected; whether his Department has received any complaints from the ratepayers of Co.

      <P>The rate levied in 1926-27 for Agriculture and Technical Instruction purposes by the County Limerick County Council was not increased over the rate struck for such purposes in the preceding year. No special proposals for the utilisation, for the purpose indicated in the question under reply, of the additional money thus placed at the disposal of the County Committee of Agriculture were submitted to the Department by the Committee.  The Committee's general programme for 1927-28 included however, a subsidy of £20 to a show or sale to be held by the County Limerick Branch of the Irish Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Society, which was duly approved.  The Committee, however, proposed on 23rd November, 1927, that a further grant of £50 should be made in respect of this show and sale of cattle which had been held over six months previously.  On a full consideration of the facts the Department of Agriculture were satisfied that they would not be justified in approving of this proposal, but on further representation <Col N="1104" /> by the Committee they ultimately sanctioned an increase of £15 in the subsidy already approved.  No complaints except from those immediately concerned in this matter have been received by the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he can state the total amounts of the grants given to each County Committee of Agriculture in the Saorstát towards the improvement of breeds of live stock for each of the years 1925-26, 1926-27, and 1927-28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The grants made to County Committees of Agriculture, with the exception mentioned hereafter, are in respect of their general agricultural and live stock schemes, which are financed out of funds consisting of such grants and the proceeds of the rate levied for the purposes of agriculture and technical instruction.  No grants are made specifically for live stock improvement beyond certain temporary special grants which have been provided by the Oireachtas since the year 1926-27 with a view to supplementing the number of premiums awarded under the Schemes for the Improvement of Cattle and Swine.  It is, therefore, not practicable to state exactly the total amount of financial assistance accorded by the Department of Agriculture towards local live stock improvement schemes.</P>
      <P>Particulars of the allocation of the special Oireachtas grant between the several County Committees of Agriculture can be supplied to the Deputy if he so desires, but the figures will afford a very incomplete indication of the assistance given from State funds towards the Live Stock Improvement Schemes administered by the Committees.</P>

The Land Commission understand that in executing the decree he seized certain cattle some of which were claimed by a Mr. Healy.  The Land Commission has no knowledge of what stock were seized or on what lands they were found.  So far as the Land Commission is concerned beyond placing the decree in the hands of the Sheriff for execution, no direction was given to the Sheriff to realise anything that he might seize thereunder.</P>

      <P>Before the debate begins, amendments on the Order Paper Nos. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 seek to introduce into the Bill the principle that members of Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann are to be divided up into classes for the purpose of voting for the election for members of the Seanad.  These amendments, it seems to me, are outside the scope of this Bill and cannot be moved to this Bill. All these amendments seek to delimit the words &ldquo;members of Dáil Eireann&rdquo; by classifying the members of the Dáil and Seanad.  I take it that most of the amendments refer to both members of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>

      <P>No. Amendment No. 1 is in order; it removes the Seanad altogether.  Amendment No. 4 is in order, and it seeks to provide that a certain proportion of Senators shall be elected by the Dáil and a certain portion by the Seanad. It is in order doing it by a different method.  The amendments which seek to take members of the Dáil and Seanad and classify these members into particular categories, specifying that members belonging to particular categories may not vote, seem to me to introduce <Col N="1110" /> a principle that ought to be in the Bill on Second Reading.</P>

      <P>With respect to amendment No. 3, surely the question of whether retiring members nominated for re-election should themselves have a vote can hardly be regarded as a separate principle.  The question of whether a Senator who is retiring shall vote or not is a question that very naturally should occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that amendment 3 is an amendment that requires very careful consideration. It seems to me that if all the amendments depended on the same principle, the only argument that could be advanced purporting to be a point of order in favour of amendment 3, is an argument on the merits.  Amendment 3 seems to be in the same category as the other amendments.  The amendment seeks to set up a classification and it could be also applied to the Dáil.  To say that particular members of the Seanad shall not have the ordinary rights of members under this particular Bill is a new principle.  I think this amendment is on all fours with the other amendments from the point of view of the principle involved.  The question might arise in a Bill specifying who may be candidates for the Seanad, but that is a different question altogether; it might, however, be approached from that angle.  In this particular Bill it would appear to be foreign to the principle to introduce an amendment that members of the Dáil and Seanad may be classified and that a particular class may vote while other classes may not vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you rule definitely in this matter, I would like your advice with regard to the position of retiring members.  I am assuming that a retiring member is not entitled to vote.  When a Senator retires he ceases to be a member.  The real difficulty is <Col N="1111" /> in the transition stage.  I ask you to hold that there are no such things as retiring members from the point of view of voting.  Members of the Seanad are either members or they have ceased to be members.  If they are members they cannot vote for a vacancy which does not exist, and if they have ceased to be members they cannot vote at all because they are not members.  I am asking you to rule that there are no such members as retiring members.  The members who are going out are gone.  They can neither vote nor have any recognition within the ambit of this Bill.  I do not know whether it is really a matter for ruling or interpretation.  It is not clear in the Bill itself.  I personally would not be able to form any opinion except in so far as I know that the matter was considered by the Committee.  I presume whoever drafted the Bill drafted it with some knowledge of the circumstances as to whether or not there are such things as retiring members in the sense of people competent to vote.</P>

      <P>The question that the Deputy raises is one that can be raised on Section 2 when that section is being discussed.  The Deputy asks me to decide that there are no such things as retiring members entitled to vote.  I am not prepared to decide whether retiring members of the Seanad are or are not entitled to vote. If I were of the opinion that the amendment could be put in order I would have advised the Deputy beforehand to get it drafted so as to put the idea which I think is in the amendment in order.  I think the idea is out of order. The amendments seek to disqualify certain members.</P>

Why I raise this matter is that it is quite clearly unfair to have a large number of these amendments on the Order <Col N="1112" /> Paper and subsequently to have them ruled out.  They are supposed to cover points which are important ones, and Deputies find in the end that these points will be ruled out of order, and there is no alternative way of bringing them up.  It is unfair from the point of view of Deputies to be so placed and to find that they have no alternative way of again raising the questions set out in their amendments.  If there was any idea in the minds of Deputies who propose amendments that these amendments might be ruled out of order, there might be an alternative way of dealing with the question.  In this case we have had the Second Reading finished before these amendments were put in.  There might, at least, be an opportunity given for dealing with these amendments otherwise if it were known that they might be ruled out of order.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle cannot decide offhand on amendments.  This is a matter of some difficulty, and a decision could be come to only after consideration.  It would be impossible for the Ceann Comhairle to decide, when he receives an amendment, whether it is or is not in order.  Sometimes he has a doubt and sometimes he has not.  Sometimes there is something suggested in the House which would enable him to come to a decision.  In this case the amendments were put into the Paper in accordance with the usual practice, which is that the amendments as received shall be circulated.  Until the Chair is asked to put the question to the House, a point of order may be raised at any time.</P>
      <P>With regard to whether the amendments could be put in order, I do not think any of them could in respect of this particular Bill, because the essence of all these amendments is that they disqualify members of the Dáil and Seanad, and they could not be put in order.  I did give some consideration to whether amendment 3 could in any way be put into a proper form, but I was unable to find any amendment that I could suggest.  I therefore rule that this particular type of amendment which is on the Order Paper cannot be moved at all to the Bill.</P>

      <P>When we speak of the principle of a Bill arising on Second Reading, the question arises, what is the principle exactly?  I can imagine you extending your ruling for various reasons into other categories and saying that the Seanad should not be separated from the Dáil.  To my mind the main principle of the Bill was the abolition of the existing method of election and the proposal to substitute another method in its place.  The other method proposed is clearly open to amendment, and the amendment may consist, in my opinion, of separating the Seanad and saying that the Seanad shall not in any way participate in the election.  Another way would be to take from the Seanad those members who are directly elected by the people and who might, therefore, be regarded as representatives in some sense of the people, and that the election would be by Deputies or by Senators who are directly elected by the people.  The electorate then would be, so to speak, one step removed from the people by the representatives of the people.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the other amendments you propose to rule out of order contain very important principles, and I spoke of these this morning.  They concern themselves with whether we should have as an electorate for this Second Chamber individuals who appear to have special allegiance or to be under special obligations to a foreign Power.  If we look upon the principle that has been decided in the Second Reading in the sense in which I have suggested it, we can see that the amendments proposed here are very natural ones and that they produce no new principle except the principle of deciding what electorate shall replace the existing system.</P>

      <P>The question the Deputy raises as to whether amendment 1 on the Order Paper would be out of order on the same principle, was given some consideration. I am of opinion that amendment 1 is in order and the deletion of the words &ldquo;and the members of Seanad Eireann&rdquo; would leave it also in order to delete the words &ldquo;and the members of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  The Bill as read a Second Time decides <Col N="1114" /> that the electors are to be the members of the Dáil and the Seanad, but the Bill contains no proviso that those who are members of Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann are to be disqualified.</P>
      <P>There is no disqualification of any kind or description in the Bill, and I think that the element of disqualification cannot be introduced into the Bill in Committee.  I am not, of course, obliged to find another method of moving these particular amendments.</P>
      <P>All these questions might be considered on the basis of whether certain types of people ought to be Senators or Deputies under an Electoral Bill for the purpose of finding out who ought to be candidates for the Dáil and Seanad.  But so long as people are members of the Dáil or Seanad, I think this particular Bill cannot be used to disqualify them for this particular purpose. That element, that principle of disqualification being, as I said, new, rules all the amendments of that particular kind out of order.  Amendment No. 1 is on a different basis, and so is amendment No. 4 also, which seeks to take the Dáil and Seanad as an entity. It says that the members of Dáil Eireann shall elect a certain proportion of the members of Seanad Eireann and the members of Seanad Eireann another proportion.  That is an ordinary limitation of the principle of the Bill. It is not a new principle.</P>

      <P>You have indicated that the question of disqualification would naturally enter into an Electoral Bill only, but this is an Electoral Bill, as far as the Seanad is concerned. It seems to me that the question of additional disqualification of any kind is just a type of thing that occurs in the Committee Stage.  But the general principles are there.  The object on a Committee Stage, I understand, would be to add certain limitations of various kinds, precisely of the nature of the disqualification indicated here. Deputies could then decide whether certain principles as they stand in the original Bill could not be limited and defined in a more rigid manner than in the Bill as originally produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that on these two grounds it is an Electoral Bill, and that the question of this disqualification <Col N="1115" /> is a very natural type of amendment to introduce when the Bill has passed the Second Stage, and I submit that your ruling is a harsh one.</P>

      <P>The Bill is not an Electoral Bill.  The Bill is to set up a principle that the electors shall be members of Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann.  These amendments apply equally to members of the Dáil and Seanad, and could be extended to include all kinds of disqualifications. Before the House entered into a discussion of that kind, it must have given a Second Reading to a Bill which involves the principle of setting up disqualification of members of either House to vote.  The amendments are not in order.</P>

      <P>Of course Section 1 is the section that deals with the abolition, I take it, of the previous electorate, and, as far as we are concerned, we indicated on that our attitude already.  I, for one, have my views as to the functions of a Second House. My idea is that if the Second House is to exist at all it ought to be one merely for re-examination of Bills, a House that would have very limited suspensory powers.  It seems to me that it would be unreasonable to expect that the members of such a House with those limited powers should be elected by this process that had been established. There was a sum of £30,000 or £40,000 spent on the last election.  I think it was £40,000.  Consequently I <Col N="1116" /> was of opinion that it was undesirable to continue it if a more satisfactory method could be found.  It appeared to me that the method of election by the Dáil alone should be adopted.  Now instead of that we have an evil of another character introduced.  It is bad to be spending £40,000 every three years on the election of Senators for a Second Chamber, to which it is quite clear there is nobody here going to be satisfied to give very extensive powers, such powers as would justify such an expenditure.</P>
      <P>We have now to choose between two evils, the evil of having a House with sufficient powers at any rate to be a serious obstruction to the majority directly elected by the people, and a House to which this series of Bills is giving an opportunity of reproducing itself.  If we look at the principles involved we will see that there are 60 Senators.  There are 152 voting Deputies here.  That means that we have 212 entirely.  It is supposed to set up an electorate of 212.  Let us say there are 20 Senators who are going to be elected.  That gives you the number that would constitute a quota, say ten or eleven, and, therefore, the Seanad members alone if they were to form a solid block and range themselves for voting purposes could elect no less than six Senators even if the whole Dáil were to make up its mind that it was not going to vote for any of those Senators.</P>

      <P>I can see, for instance, that the members of the Labour Party who are opposing this Bill will find that this is a section to which they are more likely to take strong opposition, and I want to say that we will <Col N="1117" /> vote with them on this as against the other, on account of the method that it is proposed to substitute for the ordinary way.  We do that because we have a choice of two evils&mdash;the evil of having a House with 60 members introduced in here to elect themselves.  That is a very bad principle, a principle so bad that even the question of expense is to be put aside in connection with it.  I hold that the method as it exists is undesirable.  But undesirable is a relative term.  A thing may be undesirable and it may be proposed to substitute for it a thing that is still more undesirable. A thing most undesirable here is to give to any House whatsoever the power of reproducing itself.  That is an undemocratic and unfair principle.  I voted because the question of order came into it.  Some question had to be decided first on the Committee Stage before the question of an alternative to the present system could be decided.  It had to be decided whether the present system was desirable or not before an alternative to that system was decided.  Having undertaken that I myself would propose that the Dáil should be the electors, I voted that the present system is undesirable.  I think it is very undesirable. I stand by that.  The present system is undesirable.  I think the idea even of amending it by a change in the constituencies would be undesirable. Why?  Because of the fact that I believe there would be gerrymandering in the arrangement or regrouping of any such constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now confronted with this: that we have two evils, and we have to choose the lesser of the two.  As far as we are concerned, we will, in order to get the most effective protest we can against having this election by a Second House, which can reproduce itself, vote with the Labour Party on this section, which, to my mind, is the section, from what I understand of their attitude, to which they most object.  I do it fully conscious of the fact that those who will try to make points will say there is inconsistency as far as I am concerned in it.  There is no inconsistency whatever. I believe that the proper electorate is the Dáil.  I believe it is the country in miniature, so to speak, in so far as the country is represented here <Col N="1118" /> is concerned, and therefore it is probable that by Proportional Representation you would get more or less the same type as you would get otherwise. There are other members, I know, who may not agree with me in that particular view.  That is my view, and I would support&mdash;and I think our Party would support&mdash;a change of the present system if there was going to be substituted for it election by the Dáil alone. But, as far as we can see, the Executive is determined to weaken the powers of this House and put the other House into a privileged position.  The argument is now strengthened by the decision of the Chair not to accept an amendment to take out of the category of Senators those who were popularly elected.  Senators popularly elected undoubtedly have a claim to be the people's representatives, and if that amendment were accepted, I, too, from the point of view of having the election of those who are one step removed from the people, might be prepared to accept the change of the old system for the new in that respect.  In order that there should be the greatest possible opposition given to this Bill at every stage, we are deliberately choosing, as the lesser of two evils, to vote against the change, seeing that what is proposed to be substituted is of such a vicious character.  That indicates what our attitude is going to be.  As I said, this is the amendment with which the Labour representatives are most immediately concerned.  We are concerned only from the point of view of choosing between two evils.  Unlike the Labour Party, we do not think the present system desirable.  We think it is an undesirable system, too, because it is costly, and because there is a certain suggestion that it is giving to the Seanad a standing which I do not wish it to have.  I have some hope that the people would select a second House that would not be detrimental to the national interests in general, rather than one which would be selected by the Seanad and the Dáil together. Hence the attitude of our Party.</P>

      <P>You did not know when you got caught.  Apart from that I disagree with Deputy de Valera when he says that this method of election to the Seanad is very undesirable. I cannot see that point of view.  I believe the present method, or a variation of the present method, which might easily be got, is the best method of securing a Seanad&mdash;if you are going to have a Seanad&mdash;that will be in a position to render useful service.  I believe that a body of men and women chosen on a broad franchise, different, perhaps, from that on which members of the Dáil are elected, chosen from a different point of view from that on which members of the Dáil are chosen, would constitute a useful body to review legislation passed in this House, passed sometimes not altogether because of the merits of that particular <Col N="1120" /> legislation, but because of some clashing of party interests in the House.  I believe that a method of that kind, even if it were a little more costly, would be worth it in the long run, and that the expenditure of even £40,000 in getting a body of that kind, which would have some claim to speak in the name of the people, would be money well spent.  That is our point of view. That is where we differ.  What happened in Committee is only a small matter.  We differ vitally in our point of view from the point of view of Deputy de Valera's Party in this matter.  We believe that direct election is the surest way of getting a body of people who will review legislation that is sent to them from this House, and review it in the proper manner.  I do not know of any other way by which you could procure a better body to do such work, if you are going to have a Seanad at all.  Deputy de Valera made the objection that gerrymandering might come into play in the question of selecting the constituencies, assuming that you are going to have a different constituency from the whole State.  Of course that is possible, but it is possible in any scheme of distribution of constituencies, whether for the Seanad or Dáil.  If it is possible in the one case it is possible in the other.  It ought to be the duty of the Oireachtas in laying down the constituencies to see that there is no gerrymandering of that kind.  I say that to this section of the Bill our strongest objection lies.  We have opposed it from the beginning, on the Second Reading, and herein we shall continue to do so by voting against it.</P>

I think the lady is an old political frump.  No one is in any way illuminated by the explanations we have had as to why voting for the election to the Senate by direct vote of the people is undesirable.

It is well known that Deputies on these benches do not want a Senate; but if we must have a Senate to spite us, then we want a Senate that will be as impotent and as innocuous as possible. Deputy O'Connell has said that the present method, or a variation of it, is the best method of getting a Senate which would give useful service.  Deputy O'Connell begs the question.  He takes it for granted that a Senate constituted within the framework of this Constitution can give useful service.  I suggest that Deputy O'Connell is arguing from false premises, that by assuming that <Col N="1122" /> such a Senate can give useful service at any time he is being deceived into taking a wrong attitude in regard to the method of election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point of view I will deal with.  The purpose which Deputies on these benches have, and the purpose which animated them in all discussions on this matter is: What is the speediest way of getting rid of the Senate, and what is the best way of keeping the Senate innocuous while we are engaged in the process of getting rid of it?  Any Deputy who faces the question that election to the Seanad by direct vote of the people is undesirable, would have no difficulty in making up his mind when he knows that a method of election to the Senate is possible which would ultimately facilitate the abolition of the Senate and which would, in the meantime, ensure that the Senate would be in every way subordinate to this assembly and unable to take effective action contrary to the will of this assembly.  If, however, that method of election is not to be put into operation we have got to ask ourselves what is the next best method of election from our point of view.  If we have election by this Dáil, a Dáil consisting of representatives elected by the people, or if we have election by the people, it is possible to ensure that the will of the people in connection with the Senate will be made operative, and I have no doubt whatever that the will of the people is that the Senate should be abolished.  I said before, and I am going to say it again publicly here, that if members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were prepared to say <Col N="1123" /> in this House what they are prepared to say to me in private in connection with the Senate, they would go into the lobby and vote for its abolition.  The best method to ensure that the duration of the Senate will be as short as possible and that the Senate will be as innocuous as possible while it is in existence would undoubtedly be to have an election by the members of the Dáil from a panel of candidates nominated by the Dáil.  But we cannot have that; that proposition was turned down by the Joint Committee, and has not been proposed here.  Therefore, we have got to choose between the methods that are proposed here, the method of popular election, or the method of election by the Dáil and Senate combined.  With a popular election we could provide that the will of the people could be made effective in respect to the Senate.  It is possible to elect Senators who would be prepared to support the idea of the abolition of the Senate, and it is possible to ensure that ultimately there would be a majority in the Senate prepared to support any legislation designed to abolish it.  With the other system the reverse is the case, because you are giving to the existing members of the Senate&mdash;the people with an interest in maintaining it, a number of whom are nominated, a number of whom, as has been pointed out, have interests, and potent interests, outside this State, some of whom are actually members of the Parliament of an alien country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The first section of this Bill is to delete from the Constitution the section which provides that all citizens of the Irish Free State, without distinction of sex, who have reached the age of thirty years and who comply with the provisions of the prevailing electoral laws, shall have the right to vote for members of Seanad Eireann.</P>

      <P>But remember they cannot vote whom they like into the Senate.  They can only elect members from a nominated panel, and although they have the right to vote they have not the right to ensure that the people representing their views will be in the Seanad.  They have got to choose between the lesser of two evils presented to them. We are going to oppose the proposition to take from the people the right to vote.  If we are going to have a popular election we should have it in the full sense, and we should give to the people the power to put into the Seanad men who, for example, would be pledged to abolish the Seanad and who would not be nominated under the existing system.  We think that as between the existing method and the method proposed by the Bill that the existing method is the better one because it gives the opportunity of choosing the lesser of two evils, and not because it is good.</P>

      <P>The cynicism in which Deputy Lemass has indulged in this matter reminds me of a remark made by Deputy Boland the other day when he said something about members of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation being the only non-political people in the country.  He said the reason for that was that they had no heads for real politics.  I suppose what Deputy Lemass has been preaching in this matter is what he thinks to be real politics.  If that is the case, I must say that personally it seems to me that the possession of a head for that brand of real politics is rather a hindrance than a help. Deputy Lemass and his party have seemed to make a virtue of proclaiming as their policy what one of the Labour Senators brought up against them at the Joint Committee as an accusation.  They were accused of wishing to abolish popular election for the Seanad in order that they might weaken the position of the Seanad, and thereby bring about the abolition of the Seanad in time.</P>

      <P>I think it would be better for the Deputy not to enter into the views expressed by a particular Senator.  I think there was only one Labour Senator on the Committee. The matter is not of any great importance here.  It is purely a political question, but I think it would be better if the Deputy would simply give us his own views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">

      <P>I think the accusation has been brought here by Deputy O'Connell.  I only meant to convey that Deputy O'Connell, in the speech he made on this subject, was not giving his own views, but rather the views of the official Labour Party. The accusation was made in any case as a sort of subtle attack on Deputy de Valera and his party.  Deputy de Valera and his party have been practising this brand of real politics, of which Deputy Boland is so proud. Apparently they expect that that will bring them some credit in the country.  It seems to me, looking at the matter personally, that if Deputy de Valera and his party are really anxious for the abolition of the <Col N="1126" /> Seanad, they should join with Deputy O'Connell in his attitude on this Bill. If they wish to bring about the abolition of the Seanad the way to do it is to continue the present system of election. I have been very firm in that belief for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">
      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Labour Party propose to do, but Deputy de Valera's idea is to abolish the present system and substitute for it election by the Dáil.  From the point of view of maintaining the Seanad, I consider that Deputy de Valera's proposal is somewhat of an improvement, but not much of an improvement, on the present system.  I believe that if you really want to abolish the Seanad and make the people all sick of it, the way to do it is to keep this elaborate type of election that we have in which only 25 per cent. of the registered electors vote, in which the candidates are only very slightly known to the electors, and in which an enormous list is presented to the electors for the selection of a small number from it.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of this Bill for that reason.  I believe that some such Bill is necessary in order to secure that the Seanad should continue to be a useful organ in the State.  I believe that if Deputy de Valera and his party had that head for real politics which they pride themselves on, they would be much more anxious to maintain the present system than to vote for a system in which the Seanad will be elected by the Dáil alone I do not believe that even if they were to carry their point, and that it was brought about that the Seanad was elected by the Dáil alone, that they would weaken the position.</P>

      <P>As regards the attitude of the Labour Party on this question, I do not believe that Deputy O'Connell's attitude represents to any <Col N="1127" /> degree the attitude of his constituents in the country.  I believe that there is no public demand for the continuance of the present system of election to the Seanad.  I believe that the people are tired of it, and have never had any interest in it, or any enthusiasm for it, and I believe they would be very glad to get rid of it and see substituted for it a more sensible system. All this talk about democracy seems to imply that there is only one kind of democracy possible, and that in order to be democratic you must have an election for everything, no matter what the functions of the body to be elected are.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the functions which it is proposed to confer upon the Seanad, the functions which the Seanad has exercised up to the present, are functions which do not make it at all necessary or advisable that the Seanad should be a popularly elected body.  It has not any very wide powers in the way of initiating legislation.  Its powers are mainly in the matter of checking, criticising and improving legislation which has already been begun by the more popularly elected Assembly. It seems to me that for a body like the Seanad there is no real reason why you could not have nomination as the principle of selection if you wish.  I do not believe it would be by any means the best system.  I think the system proposed better.  At any rate, it is a compromise which gives you the best elements combined together in one system.  I do not see where democracy enters into this at all. What I believe we should have in the Seanad, in spite of Deputy de Valera's idea of progress, is a sober and critical body which would criticise and improve upon, if necessary, legislation that may be passed in the Dáil in a very heated and unfavourable atmosphere. For that reason I think the system which it is proposed to establish in this Bill is much the best that could be devised for choosing a Seanad. My personal opinion about the attitude of the Labour Party on this is, that hardly any member of the Party really believes in this democratic principle that they talk so much about.</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to discuss this with Deputy O'Connell or the constituents of any rural Deputy in the Labour Party, and I would be prepared to back my views and abide by the decision of any rural constituency in these matters.  I believe the people are not in the slightest degree interested in or in any way enthusiastic about this system.  If it is continued it will be the quickest way of bringing about the end of the Seanad.  Deputy O'Connell, I believe, is talking of this matter from the book. The Labour Party has a set of more rigid official doctrines than any other party in this House, and when the Labour Party talks about democracy and the necessity of maintaining the popular system of election, I believe it is not saying what its members believe, but is simply handling out some ancient doctrine devised for it by some cosmopolitan Socialist.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass has made one thing quite clear&mdash;namely, that he and his party favour the abolition of the Seanad as we know it under the existing Constitution.  Deputy Lemass has on several occasions made quite clear that he does not believe in working under the existing Constitution, and that his party and himself are here in this House against their own will and judgment.  Deputy Lemass and other members of his party who have spoken on this matter say that they favour the abolition of the Seanad, but they do not say that they are definitely opposed to a second Chamber of any kind.  I think they should make their position quite clear on that.  Deputy de Valera, in his speech to-day, said he favoured the <Col N="1129" /> election of Senators by a joint sitting between members of the Seanad and the Dáil, because, in the first place, he wants to save the country the expense of a Seanad election, as it was carried out in the last three or four years.  He definitely stated that he wanted to save the electorate the sum of about £40,000.  Deputy Lemass, on the other hand, says he favours election by the Dáil and Seanad sitting together, because he says he believes that would get a larger number of people into the Seanad than they would otherwise get for the purpose of voting for its abolition.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would look at the amendment on the Order Paper and see what it proposes.  The question before us now is whether there ought or ought not be a popular election apart from the other alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I preferred to listen to Deputy de Valera's speech to find out what he thought rather than make it out from the amendment on the Order Paper.  Deputy de Valera and his party, and on this we have been with him up to a certain point, held up the ordinary business of the House for the last couple of weeks because the Government proposed to remove from the Constitution the right to initiate laws and maintain the principle of a Referendum.  The Referendum Clause, if put into operation, would cost about £85,000.  Deputy de Valera is prepared to make use of that clause on every occasion he would wish, but he is not willing to allow the same people to whom he would appeal to say whether they are willing to elect people to a Second Chamber to carry on under the existing Constitution.  I am in favour of a Second Chamber, but I am not in favour of the Seanad in so far as it is composed of sixty members.  I believe that the majority of the Seanad, by absenting themselves from the meetings of that body, have failed to justify the existence of that institution, so far, at least, as numbers are concerned.  Assuming that the people are anxious to abolish the Seanad, I would suggest to Deputy Lemass&mdash;he seems to indicate in his speech that he <Col N="1130" /> was anxious to get into the Seanad members who would take the earliest opportunity of abolishing that institution&mdash;that there is no better way of doing that than by referring the elections to the people.  Deputy Lemass would favour an election by the people the same as three years ago, because he would get a greater number of people into the Seanad who would vote for its abolition than he would by having Senators elected by a joint meeting of the members of the Seanad and Dáil.</P>

He agreed that the Joint Committee is of opinion that election to Seanad Eireann by direct vote of the people is undesirable and recommended instead there should be substituted for it election by a vote taken together of the members of the Dáil and Seanad on the principle of proportional representation.

There is no more certain way of doing that than by allowing the election to be carried out by the people.  I fail to understand why the Fianna Fáil Party or the representatives of that Party on the Committee should subscribe to an election by a joint meeting of the Dáil and Seanad.  That suggestion is certainly contained in the majority report, and that report has been made possible by the signature to the agreement of Deputy Ruttledge as representing his Party.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words on the question as to whether the electorate should have this vote or not.  It is impossible in this country to have a dual authority.  You cannot have two Houses based on the same electorate deriving the same authority from the people.  Of course I can understand Deputy Davin and people who represent big organisations wanting to have the present system of election, because it is very valuable for them.  If you have a big influence on newspapers and big organisations like trade unions, I could understand that feeling, but the Deputy should not allow himself to be used as a sort of free lance instrument of attack by Cumann na nGaedheal on the Fianna Fáil Party.  It looks like that from the outside.  I can understand the Deputy's hurt feelings.  If I may put it this way, he has, I think, a sort of electoral vested interest in the system.</P>

      <P>His attempt to confuse that attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party by trying to deduce things from the report is obstructing proper discussion of this question.  Deputy Tierney answered himself, because he said that if we were consistent we should stand over the present system, as it was so rotten that the people would get tried of it and would get rid of it, and then he said that the people were tired of it. It seems to be natural and logical that if one believes in one House and one authority based on one electorate, no other House should spring from that as a creation of that sovereign House.</P>

    <P>Article 32 of the Constitution shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion of the words &ldquo;at which the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) shall form one electoral area, and the elections <Col N="1135" /> shall be held on principles of Proportional Representation&rdquo; now contained therein and the insertion in lieu of the words so deleted of the words &ldquo;at which the electors shall be members of Dáil Eireann and the members of Seanad Eireann voting together on principles of Proportional Representation.

      <P>With regard to the amendments, I think that Amendments 1 and 4 might be discussed together.  They involve two questions from the Chair.  One is that the words &ldquo;and members of Seanad Eireann&rdquo; stand part of the section.  I would not put Amendment No. 1 in the form that the words proposed to be deleted stand part of the Bill, as if I did it would be impossible to put the question on Deputy MacEntee's Amendment No. 4. I shall, therefore, first put the question that the words &ldquo;and members of Seanad Eireann&rdquo; stand part of the Bill, and on Amendment 4 that the word &ldquo;together&rdquo; stand part of the Bill.  Under the Order made last night the Chair has no discretion in the matter of these amendments, but there is only one other amendment on the Order Paper after these two, and that is Amendment No. 11.  I suggest that under this procedure some time should be given to the consideration of that amendment, because it must be put under the resolution of the House.  It cannot be put at a later stage, and some discussion should be reserved for that particular amendment, as it raises a wholly different point to that raised under Amendments 1 and 4.</P>

Perhaps it will save time in the long <Col N="1136" /> run if I try to clear up a confusion which was, I think, real on the part of Deputy Davin and assumed on the part of the President&mdash;confusion as to our attitude.  Our attitude on this matter ought to be easily understood.  We are against any Seanad in the present circumstances.  We are not strong enough numerically here to have our way in that matter.  If we were, we would put in very clear form our idea of what is the proper thing to do with the existing Seanad.  A Joint Committee was set up to discuss the matter of the powers and constitution of the Seanad.  I was a member of it, and I raised as one of the first questions there the question whether it would be in order to discuss the abolition of the Seanad as a whole.  It was ruled that that particular question would not be within the Committee's terms of reference. Therefore the questions which the representatives of our party had to discuss there were questions of the changes in the Seanad that might be made within the terms of reference. During the first two or three meetings of the Committee the discussion ranged over the whole field, and it was only when it was necessary to come to the point of taking decisions that the order in which questions would be taken had to be decided, and it was decided, I think, against the opposition of our representatives&mdash;I was in another place on that day&mdash;to take first this question of election.</P>
    <P>We believed that the question of the powers of the Seanad should take precedence in the discussion.  The first question put was whether the present method of election was desirable or not. I think that the present method of election is undesirable.  As I have already stated three or four times, we regarded it as undesirable because it was costly, because it would give to the Seanad a foundation as derived directly from the people which we did not wish it to have and it would set up a Second House that might be a rival to this House in authority, as being derived from the people, and finally popular election could not be used in the sense of destroying the Seanad with very great effect.  In fact, popular election, when a large number of people would not participate in the election at all, was about to be used as <Col N="1137" /> a method of misrepresentation of the people.  Those who would be elected would be elected by a 23 per cent. vote, and would be able to say, &ldquo;We have been elected by the people,&rdquo; though a large section of the people had boycotted the election and did not intend to take part in it at all.  There is no use in saying that the people could stop it. They could only stop it by doing the same thing which we were able to do in 1918, that is by electing by an overwhelming majority a number of people who would not recognise its authority when they were elected.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances that was not likely to be possible, and what was going to happen was, that a number of Senators would be nominated and would be elected on a very small percentage vote.  Therefore, popular election was in the circumstances likely to be misrepresentation of the people, and would not be useful for ultimate purposes. Secondly, we regarded it as undesirable, but it was only relatively undesirable. It is obvious that when you take a thing that is undesirable it is possible to get things that would be more undesirable. That was exactly what was proposed.  We were in a difficulty.  We had either to maintain an undesirable form, or else in the first stage to say that that was undesirable in order that the other question, the more desirable method, might be discussed.  The same difficulty occurs with regard to this Bill. Supposing that the second section of the Bill, instead of providing for election by the Seanad and the Dáil combined, provided for election by the Dáil only, I would have voted in a different way to that in which I voted just now. Why?  Because I would have to vote against popular election in order that the second part might go on for discussion. That was precisely the position in the Committee.  Unfortunately, Deputy Ruttledge is not able to be present. It was he who actually cast the vote referred to.  If I had been there, I would have voted in exactly the same way as Deputy Ruttledge did.  He voted the Party attitude absolutely on this particular question, so that there is no question of Deputy Ruttledge acting in one way and the Party acting in a different manner.</P>

      <P>The report as a whole was not signed by us in the sense that we agreed to its terms.  It was a majority report.  Even though I knew that I was one of a very small minority dissenting, I had repeatedly to dissent from things that I knew were going to be agreed to in the main by the Committee, in order that this very confusion which has been brought about, or attempted to be brought about, might not occur and that our attitude might be clear from the beginning. I believe it is clear to everybody who does not want to blind himself to the obvious and try to make out inconsistencies, and that sort of thing, for purely deceptive purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the amendment itself, what I have said is the introduction to show what our attitude is.  If our amendment were carried, I would be better pleased with it than if, for instance, Section 1 were carried.  If our amendment is carried, and if we have an election by Dáil Eireann alone, I for one will be satisfied with that mode of election, and think that we had saved the country a sum of £30,000 or £40,000 a year, and that we had replaced a cumbrous and costly system by one that was very much better&mdash; better because it was less costly and because you were getting the very same results as you got before.  The objection, of course, that is raised in all these cases is that if the Dáil elects the Second House it will be a replica of itself.  If you have a popular election it will be a replica, pretty much.  How are you going to get a Second House which will not be more or less a reproduction of the popular House? Nomination has been suggested, but the history of nominated assemblies makes it quite clear that nomination as a method of electing a Second House is a very short-lived method.  It has brought dissatisfaction everywhere and would not be tolerated at all by people who have any regard for their rights and liberties.  By the method proposed in this Bill you have the nearest possible thing to nomination. You have got a body which is itself 50 per cent. nominated given the power of <Col N="1139" /> voting for its successors and for reproducing itself.  In the Seanad there are sixty members, of which the only members who could in any sense be regarded as deriving authority directly from the people are those who were voted for popularly at the last election.</P>
    <P>When you remember that a large section of the people boycotted those elections altogether, you will see that even they are not definitely representative of the viewpoint of the people as a whole.  So that it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that 80 per cent.&mdash; in fact, you might make it the whole 100 per cent.&mdash;of that assembly is more or less nominated.  The panel which was submitted to the people was selected by the Senate&mdash;at least, the Senate had to do with the selection of it&mdash;and therefore the people were presented with an election in which they had simply to choose, if they were to choose at all, the least objectionable from the panel presented.  Sixty members elected in that particular way are going to be brought to vote with the members of this House, and, therefore, destroy completely the representative character of the voting.  Sixty added to 152 is a very serious proportion. The total vote would be 212.  If there are to be twenty members elected, eleven would be the quota.  That gives an opportunity to the Senate if they vote in a block&mdash;and thirty of the members are directly nominated without any question or shadow of doubt about it&mdash;the power of electing six or seven members.  That is one of the things that is bad about proportional representation when you apply it with a big number of candidates and a small electorate. There is no doubt that it is unsuitable, that it does not work out well in that particular case.  The number of vacancies would probably be more than twenty, because there will be certain added vacancies, but you will have twenty vacancies normally.  By the method of proportional representation you divide that number into the total electorate, which is 212, and you add one, and that gives you eleven as the quota.  That means that if the Senators could arrange among themselves they could of themselves elect between <Col N="1140" /> five and seven members, according to whether the quota works out in that particular way.  I think that is altogether wrong&mdash;to give the Senate the power of reproducing itself in that particular fashion.  It destroys also the representative character of the election and of the Senate when elected.  It is a very common method to elect a Senate by one step removed, that is by the popularly-elected Chamber.  That is a very common method and can be defended.  I, for one, would agree, as I have said, with it.  But the moment you introduce an outside body into it, you destroy its character completely.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, in talking about the Initiative, said that in his view the Initiative, by a direct appeal to the people like that, had a tendency &mdash;and there is a certain amount of truth in it, of course&mdash;towards weakening the power of the representative assembly.  The question of weakening their power is a question of whether you want to weaken their power or not. I want to weaken their power for doing harm when they are likely to do it. Therefore, I am in favour, at any rate, of the Initiative.</P>
    <P>But how the Minister for Justice, or anybody else, holding views of that kind could hold that they stand for representative government and, at the same time, by means of election to the Second House destroy completely the representative character of the Legislature, is a thing that I cannot understand. There is a real inconsistency there, very different from the apparent inconsistency which was tried to be made out against our party in respect to our attitude on popular election in this particular matter.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I have given the arguments, as they appeal to me, more than once, on this Bill.  I do not propose to continue them any longer.  I repeat them simply in a summary form: That it destroys the representative character; that it gives to that House, which was nominated largely at the start, an opportunity of reproducing itself; that that House is already intended to buttress and to preserve privilege, and that it was originally intended for an entirely different purpose.  The idea at that time, as far as I remember, and as I <Col N="1141" /> understood it, was that if all the forces of Irish nationalism were united this particular section would be swamped as against the unity of the rest of the people.  But no such thing has happened. As I have said, they are already in a position in which they have the balance of power here and are able to dictate to the majority party what their policy is to be; the penalty for refusing to answer to the lash being that the majority would be thrown out of office by their votes. There is no need, therefore, to give them any privileges.  They have attached themselves to the majority party; they are almost indistinguishable from the majority party, and, consequently, the position is that that this Bill gives to the majority party a buttress by which its power is going to be preserved.  The idea is to buttress up the present existing majority party in such a way that it will be able to resist popular change, so that when the people change and withdraw from them the support they have so far given them there will be a long &ldquo;lag,&rdquo; at any rate, in the result appearing in the legislation.  Now, we think that is most unfair.  We did not think that the Executive in any circumstances would be likely ever to introduce a measure of this sort.  We did not think at all that the Executive would vote for depriving this House, apart altogether from any general principles, of its strength in the election of a Second House, and against the will of this House putting up another House which can resist that will fairly effectively if it wants to.  These are the reasons why I propose that we should delete the words &ldquo;Seanad Eireann&rdquo; and make the electoral body that we propose to substitute for the people the nearest body we can get for the people, namely, that of their directly elected representatives here.</P>

      <P>I think the reasons why this Bill is now before us have already been stated.  They are simply purporting to be carrying out the report of the Joint Committee.  I might say that while I quite easily understand the position of Deputy de Valera&mdash;he need not have gone the lengths he did to explain it, because it is to my mind quite clear&mdash;my objection to it is that his action in joining the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in taking the first step, saying that direct election was undesirable, has resulted in the report of the Joint Committee that we have now before us in the form of a Bill.  If Deputy de Valera's Party, instead of standing in with the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and adopting their suggestions, stood in with Labour Senators and Deputies, we would not have this Joint Report on this matter, and, therefore, we would not have this Bill.  Perhaps we might have had it&mdash; we do not know&mdash;but certainly we would not have had the apparent justification for it that is made by the Government when they say they are only putting before us the report of the Joint Committee.  My difficulty in finding out exactly where the Fianna Fáil Party stands is this: we take the view, if there is to be a Seanad it ought to be a good Seanad.  I think that Deputy Lemass, and certainly Deputy Boland, have expressed the view that if there is to be a Senate we ought to have a bad Senate.</P>

      <P>A harmless one, an in effective one.  That is where we differ.  I think it should be a good one, and I take up that point of view, but if Deputy Lemass and Deputy Boland are logical, I cannot see why they should stand for this amendment of Deputy de Valera.  We have no difficulty at all in the matter.  Having been denied the rights of having the Senate elected by the people, we agree with Deputy de Valera that the next best thing is to <Col N="1143" /> have it elected by the Dáil, and the next best thing after that is Deputy MacEntee's amendment.  I certainly shall vote for Deputy de Valera's amendment, and if that is defeated I shall vote for the next best thing, namely, Deputy MacEntee's Amendment No. 4.  If Deputy Lemass speaks upon this matter, as I expect he will, I would like him to explain what he said when speaking to the last section, when he said that the danger he sees is that if the Senate were popularly elected they would have some right to speak for the people.  They would have some claim according to Deputy de Valera to speak, as once removed, from the representatives of the people if this amendment was carried.  I would like to hear from Deputy Lemass how he can logically support Deputy de Valera's amendment if he has that view of the Senate that he seems to have.  At any rate, our point of view is clear and I think it is logical.  It is that having been refused what we think is best we will take the second best.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">
      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera's attitude about this whole matter seems to me to be best described as that of an inverted stepmother. Officially his policy is to destroy the Bill as soon as possible, but he cannot, probably owing to the vein of constitutionalism running through his nature in spite of everything, help feeling a certain affection for the Bill.  While officially he purports to be engaged in its destruction, he cannot help every now and again bringing up secret supplies of nourishment and suggesting things by which its health may be improved. I prefer briefly to look at him in the official aspect in which he seeks the baby's destruction.  And it seems to me that if we do take that view as to the official attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party our only course with this Bill is to vote for it as it stands and against the amendment.  If Deputy de Valera wishes by confining the elections of the Senate to the Dáil alone to hasten the end of the baby I think we have a duty to fulfil to resist his fell design as strongly as possible, and to give every help we can to the Senate to become a strong organ in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> Deputy de Valera and his Party make great play with the statement that the Seanad consists very largely of nominated members.  I would like to point out that the members of the Seanad are nominated, not by some external and hostile authority, but by the President of the Executive Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">
      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>There again we have a certain little inconsistency. Perhaps it is hardly sufficiently serious to describe it as inconsistency on the part of certain Fianna Fáil Deputies. Sometimes they are inclined to pat us on the back, and regard us as very erring brothers, and sometimes they treat us as if we should be forgiven. The fact of the matter is we never know in which aspect they regard us at the moment, whether we are in Purgatory or in a place from which there is no return.  We are now told about the internal and hostile authority.  The fact is that the nominations are made by the President of the Executive Council.  The President is elected by the majority votes of this Dáil, and he is now described as the internal and hostile authority who nominates the members of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, the members of the Seanad are elected by a system which is only one step further removed from popular election than the system Deputy de Valera proposes to set up. They are nominated by an authority who himself was elected by the majority of the members of Dáil Eireann.  The present holder of the post will not, we presume, always be its holder, and future Presidents might take a very different attitude towards nomination from what the present President does. This Bill pre-supposes that system will fall into abeyance after a certain time, and after some years have elapsed there will no longer be any nominated elements in the Seanad.  Even if Deputy de Valera's worst fears were to be realised, you would simply have this dangerous state of affairs in which this terribly evil-minded minority would be likely to dictate to the country&mdash;you would have it continuing only for a <Col N="1145" /> very short term of years.  Ultimately under this Bill a state of affairs will come about by which the whole body of the Seanad will be elected directly by the Dáil and Seanad voting together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">
      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite.  The members of the Dáil will never be members of the Seanad at any future time. We will ultimately have a state of affairs in which the Seanad will gradually come to consist of people who have been elected, partly by the representatives of the people here, and partly by Senators who themselves have been, in their turn, selected by the representatives of the people here.  You will, therefore, get a mixed kind of Seanad. It is in that the excellence of the proposal mainly rests.  If Deputy de Valera's proposal were carried you would have a Seanad which would tend to become more and more a complete replica of the Dáil, a Seanad which would be sharply divided into the very same number of Parties as in the Dáil, and it would be apt, if Party discipline could be got to extend to the Seanad, to react in the same manner towards every Bill brought in as the Dáil would react.  You might easily have a state of affairs in which you would have, not only all-night sittings of the Dáil, but all-night sittings of the Seanad following shortly afterwards.  If Deputy de Valera's party could find nominees of their own loquacity and pertinacity, we might have debates in the Seanad being dragged out to the same ridiculous extent as the debates in the Dáil were for the last few weeks.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal said about the very wide powers it is proposed to confer on the Seanad, which, in turn, is supposed to be elected in such a sinister way.  What are the powers?  A lot of use was made yesterday of the word &ldquo;veto.&rdquo;  There is no veto being given to the Seanad in any of these Bills.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">
      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>This is relevant, because the point has been made that you are proposing to elect Senators <Col N="1146" /> in this way and give them very wide powers.  The Deputy referred to a body not directly elected and which consists partly of nominated people, and he suggested that we were giving them powers to override the rights of the people.  You are not giving them any veto at all.  You are giving them power to hold up legislation for a very short period.  I believe in doing that you are simply making the Seanad into a useful body, by having a mixed system of election which will secure that not only the members of the Dáil but of the existing Seanad will all have a part.  That is the best system of election that could be found for the main reason that it will tend to create in the Seanad something that will cut across the line of Party division that exists in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>One could have some sympathy with Deputy de Valera's fears that for a time the majority of the members of the Seanad would be opposed to his own particular policy.  That is partly his own fault in any case.  If he had taken his ordinary part in the election of the Seanad during the last four or five years he would not have that state of affairs existing now.  Deputy de Valera would be represented in the Seanad by a number of Senators and the danger he is afraid of that some time when he might get a majority of the votes he may be held up by a hostile Seanad, would not be so terrible as it would appear now.  All that danger will disappear as time goes on, and it is quite on the cards that before Deputy de Valera comes into power in this country he may have succeeded in levelling things out sufficiently to secure that no dangerous obstruction will be offered to any measure he proposes to put in force.  I am rather glad to find the Labour Party consistent with their doctrine in this matter.  I had an idea that they intended to be sensible.</P>

He has discovered that by a combination of the Seanad and the Dáil voting at an election to the Seanad his party will secure five members in the Seanad.  He has also discovered that by the Dáil being the only electorate he will secure seven members in the Seanad.  But there is one fact which strikes me as extraordinary for a Party that has so recently gone before the public, because we had a petition here some short time ago signed by 98,000 people for a certain purpose.  This Party has gone to the public after a general election, and Deputy de Valera being a mathematician, I would like to know if he has found out how many seats he would get in the Seanad if it was by a popular vote.</P>

      <P>Nobody knows that better than Deputy de Valera.  I think it was for that reason the Fianna Fáil Party assented to the proposition that the election to the Seanad by popular vote was undesirable.  They have not contradicted that.  Now we come to the Government side.  What is the Government point of view? The Government did not fare well <Col N="1148" /> in the Seanad election the last time.  I think, as Deputy O'Connell very properly pointed out, they were a bit disappointed.  They think under the new arrangement which takes the election away from the popular vote they will do a little better than the last time; they will hold their own and perhaps a little bit more.  They feel certain of doing that.  Incidentally, I dare say this alteration in the method of election to the Seanad has been largely influenced by the Minister for Finance.  He finds that not alone will the Government get their representation in the Seanad, but they can also save something like £80,000.  I do not know whether that figure is correct or not, but it was the estimated figure given here as to what the Seanad elections would cost.  Under the new arrangements we can have as good material in the Seanad as under the old, and it will cost practically nothing.</P>
      <P>That is the Government point of view.  The Opposition point of view is that if the Seanad get powers to vote then the Opposition Party will have five representatives.  If the Seanad do not get the right to vote for Senators, then the Opposition will have seven of their nominees amongst the newly elected.  Further, they know that if they go to the people they will not get as many as five.</P>

      <P>That is the qualification that any member of this Dáil has got, and so far as a great number <Col N="1149" /> of people who voted for Deputy Lemass and for me are concerned, I may say that a certain number of them did not know what qualifications we had for the position at all.  Is not that correct?  But under the terms of the Constitution in which the qualifications of Senators are distinctly laid down we have it clearly set forth what these qualifications are.  The very fact of the qualifications of Senators being laid down must presuppose that somebody must nominate these men who have these qualifications.  I doubt, however, if any of those who had the qualifications that are laid down were nominated.  I doubt that.  Who is going to check it?  I say the people themselves can check it, and there is only one way of checking it, and that is by giving the nominations to the people.  If only 25 per cent. of the electorate voted at the Seanad election three years ago, I say that is not a bad percentage, having regard to the qualifications necessary for Senators.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Deputy one question?  If the voters who elected both the speaker and other Deputies here, on the Deputy's own admission, did not know whether we were qualified or not, how would the same voters estimate the qualification necessary for membership of the Seanad?</P>

      <P>The electors who elected us all were aware that the only qualification necessary was that we were citizens of Saorstát Eireann; is not that quite so?  The Constitution lays down what qualifications are necessary for election to the Seanad.  I will read what these qualifications are. They are contained in Article 30 of the Constitution, which says:&mdash;&ldquo;Seanad Eireann shall be composed of citizens who shall be proposed on the grounds that they have done honour to the nation by reason of useful public service, or that because of special qualifications <Col N="1150" /> or attainments they represent important aspects of the nation's life.&rdquo; Now these are the qualifications, and if I might put it this way, that is the reason why the qualifications for a Seanad vote are higher and more mature, if I may put it that way, than the qualifications necessary for having a vote for the Dáil.  It is necessary that the people who are voting for the Seanad should be able to appreciate who are the people who have these qualifications.  I do not think I am casting any reflections on the electors generally when I say that when we talk of popular representation there are many people in the country who do not know the prominent men of the country.  They do not know the men of outstanding rank in literature, art or in the many other phases of the national life, and that being so, we cannot blame them if only 25 per cent. of the electorate voted on the last occasion.</P>

      <P>We, in the discussion on these proposals which the Government has introduced, are at a considerable disadvantage in that, as on the last occasion, the case for the amendment generally has first of all to be stated from the Opposition Benches. Apparently there is no person, no member of the Government, who is prepared to defend and justify and argue these proposals upon their merits.  The grounds upon which the House is asked to accept the proposals contained in this Bill are, I think, ridiculous almost to the verge of tears.  The one justification that is offered for making these fundamental changes in the Constitution is that they were considered by a Committee, discussed very possibly by that Committee, judging by the number of separate motions which that Committee took in one sitting, lasting from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.  The fundamental principles, the operative machinery of the legislative proposals to amend the Constitution contained in Section 2 of this Bill, were discussed by twelve members, six members of the Dáil and six nominated by the Seanad.  They were discussed for less than two hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was there ever so frivolous, so unsubstantial a reason for changing a Constitution adduced to a serious deliberative assembly before?  I notice that the Minister for Education has left the House.  As he sat there, silent and intense, the very apotheosis of concentrated intellectual effort.  I thought <Col N="1152" /> that out of the matrix of that great brain of his there would evolve some reasoned argument in support of the Bill.  But when he saw that there was some prospect that he would be called upon to justify the proposal which he, as a member of the Executive Council, has set before the House and has assumed personal responsibility for, the Minister, like the Arab in the poem, has folded his tent and silently stolen away, and there has come to take his place in these debates the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>I submit that if a Deputy is putting a proposition before the House he is entitled to examine it pro and con, to state his reasons in support of it, and to examine the reasons and the arguments which he knows can be adduced against it.  The argument that might is always right is the argument of the Government. <Col N="1154" /> That is the line that the Executive Council takes up in a matter of this sort.  I have not heard any justification from the Government, which has assumed responsibility for this measure, for Section 2, but I assume that their sole justification is the one which the President put forward for the Second Reading, which was that this Bill was to give effect to the recommendations of a certain Committee.  I was going to consider what time that Committee and what consideration that Committee could possibly have given to the proposal that is contained here.  We have heard here during the last few days about popular Government, about representative Government, about Parliamentary Government, about Cabinet Government, but the Executive Council in dealing with these Constitutional amendments have adopted a new principle which I will call &ldquo;closet Government.&rdquo; Instead of matters of fundamental public importance being discussed here openly in the Dáil, instead of arguments for and against, instead of a discussion on propositions which are going to alter, to the detriment of the people, the fundamental statute which governs the relations between the Executive Council on the one hand and the people over whom they rule on the other, these important matters are being discussed by a caucus, gathered away and secreted in some room in this building remote from the public, and their decisions are to be set before us without a single reason stated or ground given or argument advanced as to why the changes which they propose should be made.  And the Executive Council accepts that proposition. The Executive Council, which has assumed responsibility for altering this Constitution, sits there, silent and mute, like the three gods upon the mountain, and vouchsafes not one word as to the monumental wisdom which actuated them in proposing these changes.  We are left to depend instead for our guidance upon the Deputy who acknowledged ingenuously in this House that he had no head for politics.  Deputy Tierney is wont to draw his analogies, his arguments and his metaphors from the nursery. Everyone to his metier.  I presume that <Col N="1155" /> the arguments of the nursery are those which appeal to Deputy Tierney. Deputy Tierney, the Deputy who has no head for politics, is the blushing parent of this new Constitutional proposal. He did not attempt indeed to justify or defend this progeny of his, which, like a political Vulcan, has sprung from the brain of the Zeus who has no head for politics.  And we have, I think, to consider with the Deputy in bringing that progeny to birth, Deputy O'Hanlon, who so badly muddled his mathematics in discussing the principle involved in amendment No. 4.</P>

      <P>I think the chief argument adduced by the Deputy with no head for politics in support of this section of the Bill was, that a body elected on those principles would tend to cut across party lines as they exist in the Dáil.  I think, so far as the Seanad is concerned, that party lines are much more rigorously drawn there. You have almost the same sections of opinion, possibly with one exception, represented in the Seanad as you have in the Dáil, with this difference, that so far as the Seanad is concerned the great preponderance of opinion there is that of those represented in this House, calling themselves for the nonce independent members, but who in every single division in this House have shown themselves to be the jackals of <Col N="1156" /> the Government, and it is to the jackals of the Government in the Seanad the Deputy proposes under this proposal of his to confer the powers, rights, and privileges of an ascendency caste.</P>

      <P>In opening I stated that I put down this amendment to elicit the grounds on which the Government proposed that the elections shall be carried out by the two Houses voting together, and the grounds upon which they justify the concession to the Seanad of an equal franchise and qualification to vote with members of this House.  I put down the amendment for that purpose, and I am entitled in discussing that amendment to point out that the Government have not advanced a single argument to justify their proposal.  Under Article 2 of the Constitution &ldquo;All powers of government and all authority&mdash;legislative and executive&mdash;in Ireland are derived from the people of Ireland.&rdquo;  All legislation originating in this House must be in accordance with that principle. In case the Minister for Local Government should interrupt me, I am not proposing to discuss the Constitution, but I am stating, as I am entitled to do, a requirement with which all legislation must comply.  But when we come to consider the method of election proposed by the Government, what do we find?  As a result of that election certain powers, certain authority&mdash;legislative and executive&mdash;will devolve upon certain people.  In so far as a number of those people are concerned who are elected by the single votes of the Dáil, or by the votes of Senators, who themselves sit as a result of a popular election, the requirements of the Constitution will be fulfilled. <Col N="1158" /> Mark what I said.  So far as certain Senators are concerned, not all the Senators who are elected under Section 2 of this Bill, but that particular section, represented by these Senators who are elected by the votes of members of the Dáil and members of the Seanad who are Senators by virtue of their return at the last Seanad election, or some who have been since then elected by the votes of the Senators who were returned at the last Seanad election, the requirements of that Constitutional Article will be fulfilled.</P>
      <P>But so far as the remaining persons purporting to be Senators are concerned, that is those who are elected by the nominated element of the Seanad, the requirements of Article 2 of the Constitution will not be fulfilled, and a proposal originating in this House which does not fulfil the requirements of the Constitution and is not in accordance with it or any Article in it, must be null and void and ineffective.  That is my first argument against Section 2 of the Bill.  My next point is that I suggest to the Government it is their duty to discuss these matters, to deal with them and to answer them, and if they are incapable of dealing with or answering them or of justifying their proposals to the House then they ought to drop the parrot cry that these proposals are to implement or give effect to the recommendations of a certain committee, and to acknowledge that the recommendations of this committee cannot be justified, and therefore to withdraw the measure.  There is no use in the Minister for Local Government popping up like a toy hangman and proposing the closure every five or ten minutes, thereby disclosing to this House that what his colleagues in the Executive Council fear is discussion and criticism of the measure they are proposing. So far as the method of argument adopted by the Government in relation to these Bills is concerned, I submit that a duty devolves upon the Chair under Article 52 to see that these proposals are discussed.</P>

      <P>I do think that we might have some explanation as to what is the intention of the Government.  I frankly admit that while the Minister may state the intention of the Bill, that it may not be legally the intention in the Bill. There are two things there, and we ought really to know what is intended by them.  I frankly cannot make out from the actual wording of this Bill who are going to elect even under this existing unamended section.  It seems to me that it is impossible that you can elect to the Seanad until there is a vacancy, and if there is a vacancy it seems to me to be impossible that those whose departure from that body created those vacancies can be voters.  I would have taken it, reading this clause, that those who are going to vote on the Seanad, I mean the Senators as voters in this election, would have been the residuum, say forty, when the twenty <Col N="1160" /> whose vacancies were declared automatically at some particular time were left.</P>

Against that, unfortunately, you have the report of this Committee.  What the Committee's report says about it is this&mdash;I am not now trying to make debating points at all. If the Minister could tell us what is intended, then I will know whether I am attacking something which does not exist or something which does exist.  If this report, as implemented by the Bill, has in it the things that we say, then it ought to be attacked, but our difficulty is that we cannot get that information. The Government may not have made up their minds as to what it does mean.  The report says, &ldquo;Motion made by Deputy de Valera: That the Joint Committee recommends as a proviso to their recommendation that the members of the Seanad be elected by the members of the Dáil and Seanad voting together on the principles of proportional representation.&rdquo;  That is the clause which is here&mdash;that the outgoing members of the Seanad be not entitled to vote at such election.</P>

      <P>It looks now as if the Minister is not trying to help the House.  I have tried quite honestly to get information from him.  If this clause said that the Seanad for the purpose of this amendment should consist of sixty, whether that was right or wrong, we should understand it, but so far as I can see they cannot vote until there is a vacancy, and when there is a vacancy they cannot vote, but the Minister for Local Government tells us they will vote, and tells us they consist of sixty when the vacancy has been created.  I do not think he has been fair to himself.  He certainly has not been fair to the House.  Does the House believe it can be done, or that it ought to be done?  There are two separate proposals.  Can they vote for these?  Can 60 Seanad representatives vote in an election if there are vacancies, and if there are not vacancies can they vote?  I do think we are entitled to an answer.  If you look at the section&mdash;it <Col N="1162" /> is here for everybody to see if they can find the meaning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I submit the Deputy is only wasting the time of the House.  The Seanad consists of 60 members.  An election to the Seanad has already been held in which the electorate voted, and they voted under the legislation dealing with the matter &mdash;the Seanad Act&mdash;which provides that an election shall be held within a certain period for the purpose of filling vacancies which would arise in the Seanad through outgoing Senators having finished their period of time. The Deputy appears to see a difficulty in taking steps to provide for filling vacancies which will arise at a definite point of time.  There is no such difficulty.</P>

That is my real belief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>The House may have some respect for its dignity and it may be satisfied with the explanation, but I am not, nor do I think that any man who reads that document can be satisfied that that is an explanation which is respectful or decent for a Minister to give the House.  The section says: &ldquo;at which the electors shall be members of Dáil Eireann and the members of Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;  Now, why are one class called &ldquo;the members of Seanad Eireann&rdquo; and the others merely called &ldquo;members&rdquo;?  Is there some intention? <Col N="1163" /> In one case does it mean some of the members and in the other does it mean &ldquo;the members&rdquo;?  It is a question for lawyers to decide.  I tell you frankly that I do not know, and I challenge any man in this House following me to show from the contained words of that clause any means by which a man can discover what that section really means in relation to the retiring members.  My colleague, Deputy MacEntee suggests that it might be helpful to insert &ldquo;the&rdquo; in both places&mdash;&ldquo;shall be the members of Dáil Eireann and the members of Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;  I am quite satisfied that I cannot even then find out what it means.  The thing is either intended to deceive, or it is so badly drawn that there is no meaning in it.  Imagine passing a Bill for which you have to go to a lawyer for interpretation at once. If this means that these retiring Senators, who have not retired, are going to vote for themselves for vacancies which have not been created it is a very sound reason&mdash;I mean in order to clear up the obscurity&mdash;for preventing the Seanad voting at all.  Take the case of people who might be in favour of the Seanad voting and who might think they had, accidentally or by design, particular qualities&mdash;and some of them have&mdash;I do not see how anybody can defend the proposition that those men shall vote for themselves for vacancies which do not exist.  I do not see how anybody can tell you how they can vote for themselves when they have ceased to be members of Seanad Eireann to fill vacancies in the Seanad. That is a type of drafting.</P>
      <P>These things have come to us in a hurry.  I mean we have got them in a bundle and naturally one might think they were hurried, but I did assume that each of these single-clause Bills had been subjected to the examination of a skilled draftsman.  I am perfectly sure that no skilled draftsman who drafted that with the intention of telling the ordinary man in the House what it means could have drafted it in that particular way.  That is a good and sufficient reason for us to vote against it.  What reason has been given for voting for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> What reason has been given to this House for voting that members of Seanad Eireann shall vote as members for themselves?  None whatever.  I will tell you what the argument is. This Bill is going to be passed not by An Dáil, but is going to be passed by Peadar Doyle.  That is the plain meaning of it and nothing else.  They do not presume to pretend that it has any other reason.  &ldquo;We have a majority; we will not agree to reason; we will not draft the Bill in any way you can understand; we will not explain it to you; we will insult you when you ask for information; we have got the majority and be damned to you&rdquo;&mdash;that is the meaning and spirit in which the Dáil is being treated by this Government.</P>

I think that members of this House who have attempted to contribute to an examination of this document so that the country would understand what is being done have been treated with impertinence and insolence and with complete disregard of the rights of private Deputies by the Minister.  If the House is satisfied with that then we know what to make of the House. If that is the sort of conduct which the Government would extend towards the House, then the country ought to understand it because their conduct and attitude of mind towards the House are their conduct and attitude of mind towards the country as well, because we are, so far as they are concerned, for the moment the country. When they treat a private member, or all members, with insolence, they are treating the source of their own power and authority with the same insolence and they ought to receive from this House the same punishment which they, undoubtedly, will receive from the community when the community understand that little men of that kind, puffed up with their own authority, <Col N="1165" /> forgetting their own limitations, have been insolent to the people.  The inspired person who lectured us the other day on our ignorance, our lack of knowledge, and our incapacity to draft Bills, the same man who did that either does not know, or does not intend to tell, or is trying to deceive the House, or sheltering behind the authority of Peadar Doyle, is prepared to spurn the Dáil.

I object to it, thirdly, because you have a hybridised electorate imposed upon the electorate here.  You have half a dozen qualifications in the Seanad.  You have previous nomination under an agreement; you have members who are voluntarily nominated by the President; you have the people who were co-opted; you have the people who were elected; and now you are going to have people elected by a co-opted-elected-nominated diluted nomination, diluted election, diluted election-nomination, added to an elected popular Dáil to produce another conglomeration.</P>

For that reason, if the Dáil has any respect for itself, and has disrespect for that Front Bench and everything it stands for, it ought to have that disrespect which this country will have when it understands the mentality which insulted it, and it will vote against this clause. They ought to take out of the clause the words &ldquo;Seanad Eireann,&rdquo; and take away the interference which that sort of Government attempts to impose upon a hybridised, conglomerate electorate for the sake of producing some thing which, to use a phrase of the President of the Dáil, would be bankrupt of intelligence, bankrupt of initiative, bankrupt of everything which would be of any use to Ireland.</P>

      <P>As you, sir, have pointed out, Deputies seem to forget that they are dealing with the Committee Stage of the Bill and their feelings, developed to a certain extent by wandering from the subject, confused their minds.  The principle and the purpose of this Bill, and the reasons for which it is introduced, were quite adequately dealt with by the President on Second Reading.  The suggestions on the part of Deputy Flinn, about confusion regarding what exactly the electorate is, are rather unreasonable.  The long title of the Bill states that &ldquo;the electorate shall be the members of Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann voting together.&rdquo;  If, by any difference in the words of the text, in the dropping or inserting of an Article, any confusion is caused to the Deputy it is a matter for amendment.  I suggest that it cannot reasonably be stated by any Deputy having heard the discussion on Second Reading, and reading the long title of the Bill, and even the section, that he does not understand it.  It is proposed that the electors, for the filling of vacancies in the Seanad in future, shall be 60 members of Seanad Eireann voting together with 153 members of Dáil Eireann.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the point is clear.  I do not intend to deal with these matters here that were fully dealt with on the Second Stage.  Not only have the reasons been stated, but a Joint Committee set up by the Dáil and Seanad discussed the matter over a period from the 8th March to the 16th May.  It is quite wrong and deliberately misleading on the part of Deputies to suggest that this matter has been discussed in secret because it has been discussed by a Joint Committee of the Dáil and the Seanad.  The main point that I wish to refer to is the type of criticism that has been made of the Seanad as a body.  Deputies on this side have been charged with being responsible for muddled mathematics but of all the haphazard mathematics or of all the haphazard collection of figures, of which I ever heard, I could not beat the figures which Deputy de Valera tried to put up.  According to him 100 per cent. of the present Seanad is nominated and is entirely removed from being in any way representative of the people.  Generally the suggestion is made to the Dáil and to the people that the Seanad was set up for the purpose of giving position and power to what Deputy de Valera calls &ldquo;a particular section.&rdquo;  Various suggestions have been made by Deputies here.  Deputy Flinn wanted to insist that certain members at present in the Seanad were nominated by the King.  A certain number of amendments have been put down here that in my opinion were put down in order deliberately to convey the impression to the people that the Seanad is a body brought together by people and by powers other than the Irish people and Irish powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the future composition of the Seanad is concerned, Deputy de Valera treats us to the suggestion that when the people vote for members of the Dáil the people produce an institution which is a replica of themselves and he tells us that if the Dáil alone elected the Seanad, that the Seanad would be a replica of the Dáil.  I take <Col N="1168" /> it that if the Seanad reproduced itself, even to a certain figure, on his theory that fraction of the Seanad which was reproduced would be a replica of what brought it about, so that if we accept that theory, whether Deputy de Valera meant it or not, we would have under our present system a replica of a replica of a replica and to a very great extent that is so.  There are sixty vacancies in the Seanad, or rather the Seanad consists of sixty members.</P>

      <P>If I said that thirty Senators were to be elected every three years, that was a slip of the tongue.  The fact is that twenty Senators will be elected every three years, but the ultimate position will be that, in so far as <Col N="1169" /> the voting power of the Dáil can create Senators, forty-three Senators will be created by the voting power of the Dáil and seventeen will be created by the voting power of the Seanad.  The influence of the Dáil increases more and more on the Seanad, even though the Seanad is voting with the Dáil.  It is the most reasonable way, in our opinion, in saying how the Seanad should be elected, to suggest that the Dáil and the Seanad voting together can give us a better type of representative body in the Seanad than we could get by any other means we could suggest. With regard to the reflection thrown upon the present Seanad, at the present moment Deputy de Valera said there are thirty nominated members in the Seanad.  There are only 24.  Six of the nominated members of the Seanad have died.  The suggestion is made that all the nominated members of the Seanad were people, in so far as the ordinary people of the country are concerned, who could not be regarded as being worthy of being their representatives, that they were of a select class in this country that could not hope to be put in by a popular vote.  But the nominated section of the Seanad, to speak of those who have died since they were nominated, contained the names of worthy Irishmen, like Doctor Sigerson and Mr. Martin Fitzgerald, so that the suggestion that the nominated section of the Seanad must be regarded as an alien section, or a section that belongs to a class that is not of the people here, is simply a false suggestion.</P>

If the 24 nominated members in the Seanad at the next election combine to do that which has been so often referred to here as reproducing themselves, the 24 could only reproduce two.</P>

      <P>The suggestion that there are unrepresentative elements in the Seanad, and that they are going to reproduce themselves, and reproduce themselves so that we could never rely upon the Seanad being an institution properly representative of the people, is simply nonsense.  It is simply stating what is not a fact and what could hardly be believed to be a fact by the Deputies who stated it.  The proposal is that the Dáil and the Seanad voting together will give us a Seanad, and we challenge any of the Deputies who have spoken on this matter to show how a more representative and a more satisfactory Seanad could be formed.</P>

      <P>The net result of the Minister's defence of this section amounts to an unsubstantiated statement that a better type of representative body cannot be secured by any other means, and a gratuitous challenge to Deputies to produce the means by which a better type of body could be procured.  There was no statement made by him that could be even mistaken for an argument in support of the introduction of this section. Deputy de Valera's amendment has been substantiated by arguments of a substantial nature which, I submit, are conclusive when the effect of this Bill and the other Bills with which it is associated is taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the amendment, there were some points mentioned by the Minister I should like to dispose of. He said that Deputy de Valera had <Col N="1171" /> stated that the Seanad was 100 per cent. nominated.  What Deputy de Valera said was that for all practical purposes we could take them as having been 100 per cent. nominated, because those 18 members who were elected by the people, and who can falsely parade themselves as being elected by the people, were in fact nominated members. There was a nominated panel, and from that panel 23 per cent. of the electorate selected certain individuals and sent them to the Seanad.  Is it seriously contended that in an election where only a certain selected cast could seek election, and where less than one-fourth of the entire electorate decided to record their votes, the people elected are representatives of the people or could claim to represent the people?  I do not think so.  The method of nomination in the case of these 18 members was somewhat different from the case of the others, and that is all.  For all practical purposes, the Seanad is a nominated body.  It is not a representative body.  When the Minister talks about a better type of representative body, I do not know what he means, because in order to know what is meant by the term we have to know what it is intended that body should represent.</P>
    <P>The section of the Constitution which Deputy O'Hanlon referred to is a section more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  In fact, the Seanad has become, whatever it may have been intended to be, representative of a certain section of the community&mdash;the section which is represented by the titled aristocracy and the chambers of commerce. The amendment proposes to ensure that election to the Seanad shall be by the members of Dáil Eireann alone.  It is contended that members of the Seanad should not have the power of saying who their successors are to be.</P>
    <P>With reference to the actual words of the section of the Bill, I submit that the Minister has not cleared away any of the confusion that exists.  Can an election be held for the Seanad if there are no vacancies?  If there are no vacancies, what is an election being held for?  If there are vacancies, are there 60 members? If there are not 60 members, what is the status of those who have ceased to be members and who have become <Col N="1172" /> retiring or outgoing members? Will they be entitled to vote in the election to fill the vacancies created by their own retirement?  There is nothing in the Bill which would make clear the intentions of those who drafted it in that connection.  As Deputy Flinn pointed out, the fact that the Joint Committee definitely turned down the proposal made by Deputy de Valera, definitely to exclude outgoing members of the Seanad from voting at such an election, would imply that they intended that outgoing members should have the right to vote to fill vacancies created by their own retirement after they had technically ceased to be members.  However, apart from whether ordinary or extraordinary or retiring members of the Seanad should vote at an election to fill the vacancies, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that no Senator will be able to exercise that power.</P>
    <P>In the debate on Section 1 of the Bill I made clear the reason why we are introducing this amendment.  Deputy O'Connell asks: could I logically support this amendment having voted against Section 1?  The only answer to that is that I would have voted for Section 1 of the Bill if I thought this amendment was going to be passed, but because I was prepared to recognise the fact that we are not a majority in this House, and that the tame majority which the Government have behind them will probably succeed in rejecting the amendment, I was taking the lesser of the two evils which remained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The probability is it will not.  If it is, well and good.  Section 1 of the Bill is carried in any case so that the position is there that we want to ensure that the Seanad will be abolished as quickly as possible.  We want to create an instrument for its abolition.  Before we can guillotine it we have got to get its neck under the blade, and as far as in our power lies we are endeavouring to induce it nearer to the machine, and to get its neck into the right position for the stroke that is to finish it.  We think it is very difficult to argue an amendment of this kind, having as we <Col N="1173" /> have a particular reason for introducing it, without bringing in the whole question of the advisability of the existence of the Seanad under existing conditions. I know that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would not permit us to discuss that, but I hope that the debate that has taken place here to-day will in itself have convinced some members that the Seanad is only a constant source of disorder <Col N="1174" /> and contention and that the sooner it is terminated the better, not merely for the welfare of the people but also for the stability of the State.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 43, to delete the words &ldquo;secret ballot&rdquo; and to substitute the words &ldquo;open vote which shall be recorded on the official records.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill, as it stands, indicates that the method of election shall be by proportional representation, and that the voting shall be by secret ballot.  My amendment is to the effect that instead of having voting by secret ballot the voting should be open and that the votes be recorded on the official records. There is an Article in the Constitution in reference to the Seanad, to which I referred earlier this morning; it is Article 30&mdash;the first Article, I think, in the Constitution which deals specifically with the Seanad.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Eireann shall be composed of citizens who shall be proposed on the grounds that they have done honour to the nation by reason of useful public service, or that because of special qualifications or attainments they represent important aspects of the nation's life.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it will be remembered that in the discussion on the Joint Committee the futility of that as an effective article was pointed out.  No machinery whatever is provided by which there can be any test as to whether candidates for the Seanad who are proposed do, in fact, come in under that particular Article, or to test whether they have done honour to the nation by reason of useful public service, or that because of special qualifications or attainments they represent important aspects of the nation's life.  The only way, it appears to me, in which that Article could at all be made effective is by focussing public opinion upon the type of candidates that are proposed by different Parties and the manner in which individuals vote for the nominees.  I am sure that anything I say at this stage is not likely to be misunderstood, as my whole attitude has been pointed out more than once.  Fundamental in my objections to the Second House is that I believe, inevitably, it is bound to deteriorate. Even leaving aside the particular aspect of it on which I have laid a good deal of stress&mdash;the aspect that it is likely to be a barrier to progress from the national point of view&mdash;and thinking of it only as a Second Chamber that is to be elected to do political work, I think, inevitably, it will deteriorate, and the idea that its members shall be of the class indicated in that Article is an illusion&mdash;that, in fact, in a Seanad that is supposed to be the purpose of the election, in a Seanad that is even approximate to that ideal, that it is going to be extremely difficult to devise any machinery by which it could approximate to that ideal.  The only machinery that occurs to me is the machinery of compelling the voters, the electorate, to give their votes openly.  After all, there ought to be no objection to it.  We vote here day after day on questions about which a good deal of unpopularity in some cases is bound to arise.  You have to decide the pros and cons every day, and it is unreasonable to think that every decision here does not effect some individuals, making friends or enemies in the country by our votes.  If we give our votes openly on big questions, where it does in one way offend many, I see no reason why we should not take upon ourselves the responsibility of giving offence to individuals if that is necessary in order to provide a proper Second House.  In speaking against the Second House I indicated what a Second House tends to become.  As I said, we have all got an idea&mdash;those of us who favour a Second House have an idea of a certain ideal assembly, something that would correspond, for instance, to the old Roman Senate or something of that kind.  There you had <Col N="1177" /> members who were men who had filled certain public offices, and if you had something of that kind it might itself be a sort of qualification test for entry into the Second House.  But there is no such thing proposed here, and I do not think that it would be possible to propose anything of the kind here. What is proposed, however, is something that is going to give you not these impartial, experienced, wise statesmen who could be depended upon to take an independent view and a wise view of public matters in general; you are going to have in the Seanad the classes I enumerated already.  First of all, you are going to have in it those who make large contributions to Party funds.  You are going to have in it representatives of business, of certain big interests that are able to bring pressure upon the political Party.  You are going to have in it finally a sort of House of Rest, in which those who have given one type or other of service to political Parties may be rewarded for their past services or conveniently got out of the way.  I think it is a very unhappy prospect, the prospect of having a Second House like that, but as I have said once or twice already, I see no way by which you can prevent it from deteriorating into being a House of that kind except by making the political Parties who nominate or the individuals who nominate and vote take full responsibility before the public for their votes and the choice that they make.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is going to be opposed or not by the majority Party here.  I hope it is not going to be opposed by them.  I do not think that any of the arguments that apply, for instance, to making the ballot for the ordinary election secret, should apply here.  I anticipate that the arguments, if there are arguments to be brought against open voting, will be of the type that are generally used with reference to having a secret ballot in ordinary elections when the citizens, as a whole, vote.  But I think there is no analogy whatever between voting here and the voting of an individual citizen.  I think this is very special work which this Bill proposes, and a special obligation and a special duty which this Bill proposes to lay upon the members of the Dáil and, unfortunately, <Col N="1178" /> now upon the members of the Seanad as well.  I do not want to labour the point.  I think that my main purpose in moving this ought to be clear, that most of those who favour a Second House favour it because they have an idea that it will be a useful Chamber for the re-examination of certain measures, for the improvement of certain measures and for a certain amount of delay and all that.  However, while I do not myself believe that, at best, it can become that and exercise useful functions, I appeal to those who have that view that they should at least go so far as to make their ideas effective by supporting this particular motion.  In speaking now I have this difficulty, that I do not know whether it will be opposed from the Government Benches or not.  If it is not to be opposed there is no use in spending time over it, because I dare say our Party will support it, and that the two Parties together will very easily carry the question.  But if it is opposed, then I am confident that, as this is in Committee, I will be given an opportunity to reply, or that some opportunity will be given to some members of our Party who may be able to reply to the objections raised.  I leave it at that.</P>

      <P>The Government will oppose this amendment. Deputy de Valera has not brought forward any argument in favour of it except the general suggestion that if you are doing good work you might as well give offence openly and show exactly where the blow comes from, and not put a person into the Seanad and not let him know how his own particular friends and the people he looked to to put him into the Seanad voted.  Let us look at it from the point of view of the person who is to be elected to the Seanad.  Is it argued that a better type of person will be put into the Seanad by open voting than by secret voting by the members of the Dáil and Seanad?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know on what that argument is based. Is it that in facing our duties of electing suitable Senators, we cannot face them in private in the way in which we would face them in public?  I suggest <Col N="1179" /> that if you are selecting the best type of people to put into the Seanad you are more likely to do it better by a secret vote than by a public vote, as Deputy de Valera plainly suggested. He suggested that very big and very powerful political interests may be pressing on you to vote for a particular type of person.  I suggest that there is nothing in the secret ballot that would prevent members of the Dáil and Seanad from doing their duty in the election of Senators and doing it in the best possible way.  On the other hand, take the elected Senator.  I suggest that the elected Senator is in a much clearer and more satisfactory position to carry out the responsibilities that he takes on himself as a Senator if he is not branded by eleven or twelve labels that would necessarily brand him if it were publicly clear that the eleven first preference votes that put him into the Seanad were the votes of eleven particular people.  The position of the Senator carrying eleven or twelve different tags might not be at all an enviable one, and it might very easily, for one particular reason or another, prejudice him with the people among whom he was supposed to work, the people whose interests he was supposed generally to represent.  So I do not think there is any case at all made for the departure from the general acceptance that there has been in political elections, of having these elections carried out on a secret ballot.</P>

      <P>I just want to say that I am opposing this amendment. I do believe that the object which the mover has in mind will not be specially secured by the fact that the vote would be an open vote. I believe there will be other factors which will come in, and must come in, and they will not, in my opinion, come in to a greater extent&mdash;operate to a greater extent&mdash;under an open vote <Col N="1180" /> than they are likely to do when the voting is to be by ordinary ballot.  I think there is a very great difference indeed between voting as we do here on certain principles, and for certain principles, and where the chief factor will be a personal factor.  It is a very different thing when we come to vote for certain principles and to vote for persons, as the personal factor should be the main factor.  I believe we are generally more likely to get an independent expression of the voter's mind when the vote is by ordinary ballot than when it is an open vote.  I believe the object which the Deputy has in view will not be secured to any greater extent.  In fact, I doubt if it will be secured to as great an extent by the method he proposes as by the method of the secret ballot.  Especially where you have proportional representation, it would create a very dangerous precedent that, I think, might well be avoided.  I will vote against this amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell said that this would be establishing a dangerous precedent.  I think we are going to establish a dangerous precedent.  As Deputy Flinn remarked, our constituents are entitled to know how we vote here on all matters.  As far as I know, up to this there has been no ballot-voting in the Dáil.  The people who sent us here are entitled to know how we vote on every question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> This is, in my opinion, a dangerous precedent, and I can see it very easily extended to other activities.  Deputy O'Connell drew a distinction between various questions to be decided here. The question of setting up ballot voting might very easily be extended if it is allowed now.</P>

      <P>That is not a precedent to some extent.  I suggest the wangling was going on there and certain people were selected.  I do not know exactly how it was done, but it is not the same thing as in this case. It was not then really an election to the Seanad.  Even if there was a precedent, it was a bad one and it should not be followed.  Our constituents are entitled to know how we vote.</P>

      <P>I was listening to the Minister for Local Government, and, as I expected, he is for secrecy. All this stern morality which we heard about in another connection has disappeared and we do not see much of it now.  The Minister likes secrecy. He does not want to have the purifying light of public opinion turned on the doings and the acts of individuals here and Parties can manipulate much better in caucuses, can make their arrangements much better by caucus meetings, than they can by coming here and openly discharging their duties, each man being responsible to the electorate for the vote he casts.  We are told the point of view of the person elected must be considered.  The same <Col N="1182" /> sort of thing turned up in connection with candidates for appointment.  If a man is not prepared to risk not winning a race, why does he go up? If we have it that a person must not stand the criticisms or whatever may result from his not winning a race, not being first, if he thinks he cannot stand that, why go up?</P>
      <P>It is not a reflection upon anybody that, when an election to office of this kind is concerned, he does not get the votes of A., B. and C.  A man goes up publicly for election and enters a certain petition and stands up to be judged by his fellows on his merits for a certain post; he has no grievance whatever if the result of the contest is made plain.  The question is, will it affect his efficiency afterwards?  Why should it?  Why should a man be less efficient in carrying out his duties in the Second House because, for example, he should have got first preferences from some members or some Parties in the House and second preferences from others?  I cannot see in any way how it would be unfair to the candidate to have the results published or how it would interfere in any way with his efficiency afterwards.</P>
      <P>As I have said, it is the question of secrecy that I dislike.  I believe that there is only one protection for the people, if we are to have representative government, and that is to have the acts of their representatives open and above board so that they may be judged, when the time comes, by the people, to whom they will have to give an account of their stewardship. Surely you are performing, on behalf of the people, a very important function if you are going to elect members to a Second House.  It is as their representatives that you will have any right to election.  You will be exercising your own individual judgment on their behalf, but the actual authority for doing this will come from the people, and it is in their name ultimately that you will act.  So that, on the ground of general principle, I see no reason at all why there should not be open action in this matter, and, as I say, the doings of caucuses will be kept very much more pure if the clear light of public opinion is turned upon them.</P>

    <P>I have been challenged by Deputy <Col N="1183" /> O'Hanlon to show how a vote could be recorded.  It is very simple.  Every voter would be supplied with a ballot paper.  He would put down his preferences&mdash;1, 2, 3, 4&mdash;to whatever extent he likes on the paper, indicating the candidates in the order of his choice. He would hand this signed ballot paper up to whoever was the returning officer&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle, for example. Then a table could be made out with the names of the candidates, giving the list of the various electors, and under each one his preferences, No. 1, 2, 3, and so on, so that if you wanted to represent it in the form of a large table you could put down the list of candidates and afterwards, in columns, you could show the vote that was given by each individual voter.  You would then have a complete record of his vote, as it would be transferred from his signed ballot paper on to the official record.  I see no difficulty about doing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do.  If the Deputy would consider the matter again he would find that a separate table would be required for each particular ballot paper, and that he would want 153 separate and distinct tables.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be only one ballot paper served out.  On it would be the names of the various candidates, and we would write down in the column provided, 1, 2, 3, and 4, in our order of preference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>These documents would all be signed.  They would be kept by the House as part of the official documents of the House, and the result could be transferred on to any particular record we wanted.  All that would be necessary, as far as I can see, would be a simple table on which you would have the candidates, and you could write down the names at the top, or, if you wished, put numbers instead of names, or you could put each individual down with his ballot paper indicated. So much money is spent here on printing that we need not worry about a <Col N="1184" /> little extra expense, so that from that point there is no difficulty that I can see.</P>

      <P>We would know who each individual voted for in the order of his preference which is the only thing we are concerned about. How it is summed up is immaterial. The important thing we want to secure is that the vote of each individual person should be open for inspection by his constituents and the whole country to see for whom he is voting first, second, third, fourth or fifth.  That is all that is required.  That is the real material thing and the other thing is a matter of calculation, which follows of necessity.  The final results are given, and anyone interested from the point of view of proportional representation can do the rest.  I am not interested as a secretary, for instance, of a proportional representation society might be, in seeing how the thing summed up.  I am interested in one particular thing, that the vote of the individual elector should be open to anyone for inspection.</P>

      <P>I know that the time table is against me but I can say all that I want to say in a few sentences. I intend to vote against this amendment.  I am rather surprised to see such an amendment standing in the name of Deputy De Valera, because I thought his tendency was towards democracy, and that he was not in any way reactionary.  I think it is admitted that the Ballot Act was considered to be one of the greatest victories that could be secured for the common people.  Time was when the landlords and the possessing classes in this country were able to drive the voters to the polling booths like so many sheep or cattle.  I regret that one who has so long appeared before the Irish public as a leader of thought should put such a motion as this on the Order Paper.  Deputy De Valera suggested that the acts of those who vote in the Seanad election should have the light of day thrown upon them.  If that principle was to be followed to its logical conclusion we should then say that the people who elect Deputies should also have the light of day thrown on their actions.  That is what it really amounts to.  The secrecy of the ballot, I hope, is a thing that we shall never depart from in this country.  I think that it was considered one of the greatest victories for democracy, <Col N="1186" /> and I am rather surprised at Deputy De Valera committing himself to anything so reactionary as to suggest that we should go back to the old days and the old system when the people were driven to the ballot boxes as if they were so many sheep and cattle.  I am opposed to the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>The extreme reactionary views of my young friend from Cork unwillingly bring me to my feet.  The difference which Deputy Anthony apparently does not understand is this: when a man is casting a vote in an ordinary election he is casting his own property and knows what he does with it.  He is entitled to know what he did with it, but nobody else is.  When Deputy Anthony or myself casts a vote in the Dáil it is a case of using the property of somebody else, and those who are responsible for the existence of Deputy Anthony as a Deputy, and those who are responsible for the existence of Deputy Flinn as a Deputy, and only in that way, are entitled to know exactly what Deputy Anthony or Deputy Flinn did with the authority given them. There is nothing undemocratic and nothing to be ashamed of in advocating that principle.  As we are sent here to represent the people we do in the open all things in the face of their knowledge of our acts and are publicly responsible to them for what we do.</P>

    <Title>FINANCE BILL, 1928&mdash;FIFTH STAGE (RESUMED).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion, when the discussion on the Fifth Stage of this Bill was adjourned, I was trying to point out that under this Bill a greater burden of taxation is imposed on the people of the Saorstát than they could bear.  You are not alone imposing this taxation upon the wealthier classes of the community, but, as the Finance Minister tells us, you are basing your calculations for increased revenue on the fact that the business men of the Saorstát are doing well, that their profits are increasing, and in representative firms you have been able to point to increasing profits, so that on that score you also propose to increase the taxation on the farmer and labourer. You are also adding to the cost of telegrams and putting an additional farthing a pound on sugar.  The total effect of that is that you have to gather, in one way or another, a sum of £24,000,000 a year.  That is the standard of expenditure you have set up, and you have to raise money to enable you to meet that standard.  I was trying to show the House that not alone is the nation unable to bear that standard of expenditure and the accompanying burden of taxation, but, as a matter of fact, so long as you impose undue burdens on industry and enterprise, and so long as you maintain taxation at the present high level, you are steadily eating into the capital reserves of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may not appear obvious to the Minister for Finance, who bases his calculation upon the account books of a certain number of business men.  If he were to take the accounts or conditions of farmers and labourers who are a more important section of the community than even business men, he would find that not alone is he, as I have said, imposing further burdens on them and restricting employment and production, but he is actually eating into the capital resources which would otherwise provide employment which is so badly <Col N="1195" /> needed.  A well-known economist.  Sir Robert Giffen, who gave evidence before and rendered valuable service to the Royal Commission which was appointed in 1897 to inquire into the financial relations between Great Britain and Ireland, estimated that the income of a country could be found by taking approximately twice the gross assessment for income tax in any one year.  If we take that as the basis, and take the gross assessment of income tax for the last year for which we have figures available, we will find that the amount from all sources would be £125,000,000.  Out of that we have to make allowance for the subsistence of the people, the amount actually necessary for them to carry on to meet their daily requirements, and to secure the necessities of life.  The basis that has been calculated on is a basis of £32 a year.  That is not a very large sum.  It covers the actual necessities of an individual citizen of the State, and, if you estimate the total amount which would be required in order to allow for the subsistence and maintenance of your population of three million citizens, you get, roughly, one hundred or one hundred and one million pounds.</P>
    <P>You therefore subtract that amount which would be necessary to provide for the subsistence and maintenance of your citizens from the total gross income based on income tax, which is as good a criterion as any other, and you get a margin of £24,000,000, which is not much greater than the present amount of expenditure.  It therefore follows that even if there is a margin it is very small if it is on the right side.  But the margin must be on the wrong side, because, not alone have the people to find £24,000,000 for the expenses of central administration, but they have also to get £5,000,000 to pay for rates and local services.  Consequently I think it is quite clear, and there are no figures to prove the contrary, that year by year you are steadily eating into your capital and steadily taking away from production in agriculture and industry resources that ought to be available, especially in a depressed period such as we have at present.  You are also maintaining expenditure which is on a very high <Col N="1196" /> level if you compare it with the total export trade, which amounts to £45,000,000.  You have to take a high proportion of that to pay for central government expenses.  If you are going to make up the adverse balance of trade and put it on its right side, and wipe out the £16,000,000 which is standing against you, and which Sir Josiah Stamp is so anxious to wipe out by good marketing, I would like to know what schemes could the Minister for Agriculture produce or what wonderful changes he could effect in our agricultural economy, especially in the marketing of our produce, which would enable us, if we did not take other steps, to wipe out that adverse balance. The big way, the way that has been followed in England and other countries, is to endeavour to bring the scale of expenditure down to the scale which ordinary people can bear.  We must remember that a farmer who in 1920 had his agricultural produce represented, say, by a figure of 300, has had that figure now reduced to about 120, almost one-third of what its value was previously.  The farmer, out of that tremendous reduction, still has to pay and maintain in many respects a higher scale of expenditure than he was asked to do at that time.</P>
    <P>It follows, therefore, that in endeavouring to provide for the farmer by means of agricultural schemes, by wiping out the middleman, by trying to bring him into direct touch with markets and with those who will supply him with his requirements, you are forgetting the greatest middleman, the man who extracts more from the farmer than he can produce by his toil, namely, the middleman of State interference. Your only answer to the farmer, who tells you that he cannot bear the extractions of that middleman, who tells you that you are crippling him, that he cannot increase his productivity, is that you are giving the farmer services for the money you are taking from him.  You have heard a great deal from the Minister for Finance regarding these services.  If you go through the Appropriation Accounts you will see that such services are not, in reality, very big.  In arterial drainage, for instance, you have a state of affairs in which you <Col N="1197" /> have not been able to expend for the benefit of the farmers the amount of money available.  I do not know who is to blame for that, but the money has not been spent.  It is not only in that, but in other Departments in which money was available for productive work, that such money remains unexpended, money which you told the farmers was going to be expended for their benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance tells us that money that is raised or estimated for will be spent during the current year.  We expected that something bigger and greater would have been done by the Minister for Finance to show that in spite of the economies he wants us to believe he is trying to make, that he cannot reduce taxation.  We would at least expect him to take some steps to increase production, some such steps as have been taken in England, some steps to reduce freight charges, or some steps to increase the agricultural output&mdash; there are various ways in which it could be done&mdash;some steps, at any rate, which would give the farmer something in exchange for the taxation you are taking from him.  The position is that you have given him nothing.  You have not expended the money you have granted in a great many cases.  As regards the town labourer, on whom you are imposing a fresh burden in the increased cost of sugar, you are not, I submit, holding out any hope to him either that this additional taxation represents, in the long run, something that that will come back again to him in the form of employment.  You are not building houses.  You have had a long period during which to produce your housing policy.  You have raised two loans, and in spite of the fact that that money should have been spent upon reproductive work, what has actually happened is that the Minister for Finance, on finding himself running short, in the squaring up of the Budget Account, because of the abnormal items that still persist, has wilfully put these amounts against those abnormal items which are of no use to the country, which do not benefit the country, and that money which he has set aside for those non-productive services, such as the Army, pensions, and so on, has to <Col N="1198" /> be taken, naturally, from other services, such as housing, in which we expected that the Minister for Finance would do something big.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the general position of taxation in this country. When we were discussing it here on the Report of the Committee on Public Accounts a great many members did not think it worth while to wait.  Ministers themselves seemed to be rather irritated at some of the things that that Committee had said.  The Committee at least represents the House.  It is a Committee appointed by the House.  It is not, as far as I can see, a Party Committee. It is simply a Committee, like the English Committee, to see that when money has to be spent and when the Dáil sanctions money to be spent, that money will be spent wisely, effectively and with economy.  Therefore, we must pay attention to the Report of that Committee just the same as we must pay attention to the eye of the foreign investor.  The Minister for Finance tells us that never before were we so keenly under examination by foreign investors.  I submit to him that foreign investors are pretty well able to look after themselves when it comes to bargains, and that there are other people besides the foreign investor who deserve some attention.  These are the people who are crying out against this burden of taxation.  You are paying a higher rate of taxation than the people in any other country except, perhaps, England, and in that country, with £800,000,000 of taxation, a large percentage goes for the service of the public debt.  You cannot even institute a comparison if you take into consideration the public debt of Great Britain and the tremendous extent of her international resources.  You cannot institute a comparison and say that we are well off if we are not paying as high a bill in taxation as they are paying in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>If you take the figures for Italy, Germany or France, or of any of the countries that have successfully survived the war and that have had to undertake gigantic schemes of reconstruction, much greater than the Free State has to undertake, you will find that all those countries which can give a good account of themselves and <Col N="1199" /> compare favourably with us in the matter of production, have managed to keep taxation at a very much lower figure.  I think if the Minister tells us that the cause of the high taxation is the additional services which have to be provided, that if we look at it from another point of view we come simply to see that what he means is that he is feeding the dog with a piece of his own tail.  That is a process which cannot last indefinitely.  It means that you are dictating to the Irish taxpayer and that you are telling him that you, in effect, are better able to manage his income than he is himself.  The best way to increase prosperity, to give confidence to the taxpayer, is to show him that you are out for economies; that you are doing your best to effect retrenchment; that it is not merely a question of using a few phrases in your annual Budget speech and that you have a definite policy which is not merely to please your foreign investors in whom you are interested, but which is going to secure the co-operation and the support of the producer at home.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything further to add.  I simply wish to say that so far as the Budget statement of the Minister was concerned we were disappointed with it.  It did not lay down any definite lines of the policy which he proposed to pursue in the country in the future.  He did not lay down any large scheme for the relief of agriculture, or of the unemployed of the towns.  It did not make any definite suggestions of what was being done to effect economies in the Government services.  We know that there is wastefulness, that there is bound to be wastefulness, and that it is not altogether on the shoulders of the Minister for Finance, that he has had to grapple with the situation which was handed over to him, and that he is trying to make the most of it.  What we want him to do is to take the House into his confidence.  I submit that in that way he will get co-operation, help and encouragement where otherwise he would only get criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>The note upon which Deputy Derrig ceased is the note upon which I would willingly commence, and <Col N="1200" /> the note upon which I would be very happy, if it were possible, that we in this country could conduct all discussions upon matters of finance.  Deputy Derrig ended with an appreciation of the fact that, bad as is the financial position as exhibited by the statements of the Minister for Finance, bad as is the economic position, as it is known to those of us who do know the business side of Irish life, and who do not need to look at statistics and Government records in order to find out what is actually functioning in the economic life of Ireland&mdash;those of us who have actual opportunity of knowing and keeping our finger upon the actual pulse of Irish economic life&mdash;Deputy Derrig acknowledged, and was glad to acknowledge that, in the depressing results and outlook in which we have fairly envisaged the actual fact of our practical economic life, the responsibility of the producer of the play is not for the play itself.  To some extent the Minister for Finance is a good man facing adversity.  He did not write the play.  He did not individually and separately make himself responsible for building up surrounding conditions which make the actual facts of life to-day so depressing.  He has his own share of responsibility; he has a very definite share of responsibility; but what we want to acknowledge frankly is that that responsibility is not personal, and that, even if he has a very depressing and very sad story to tell&mdash;the story of a Government which is bankrupt, as distinct from a country which is bankrupt&mdash;that responsibility which rests upon him is very largely a responsibility of the teller of the tale, and that it may be rather lack of qualities than the possession of them which constitutes his share of the responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sincerely concerned and disturbed at the larger outlook on Irish economic life as portrayed in this Finance Bill, and in the statement of Governmental bankruptcy which was represented by the Budget speech.  I have no nearer point of view in relation to Irish affairs, and above all, in relation to Irish economic affairs, than the time when my own two little boys are grown up to function in my place.  It is envisaging Ireland from that point <Col N="1201" /> of view, and envisaging the duty of members of the House, and my own duty as a duty and responsibility to the future generation, that I find grave cause for dissatisfaction, grave cause for depression, very real cause to be afraid of the future that is before our children unless we grasp this scheme of things entire and change it deliberately into another avenue of progress.</P>
    <P>Behind that Budget and that Finance Bill there are twenty million acres of land and four million people&mdash;I am speaking now, for the moment, for the whole country&mdash;and the Minister for Finance, who has been responsible for putting them before you, has also been responsible for the courageous and honest statement, whether it is right or wrong, that the land of Ireland can support no more people.  That Budget provides nearly three millions of money for the relief of agriculture in one form or another.  It provides a means of education, a means of relief of rates, a means of agricultural credit, a means of agricultural co-operation, the machinery for building up, as far as the knowledge and ability and the intellect and the outlook of the present Minister for Agriculture will allow, the great basic industry of agriculture in this country.  Yet, that Minister for Finance, who is responsible for coming to this Dáil and telling us that we must continue to provide that two or three millions of money for the relief and maintenance and buttressing up of the agricultural industry in this country, speaking with full knowledge of the facts, not merely the financial facts, but of the facts in relation to the whole of governmental life which is represented by his position and co-operation in the Cabinet of the Free State, tells you that the land can support no more people. The basic industry of Ireland, the one thing from which we were told we should get wealth, the one hope which we had, and the one foundation upon which we were to build for that other generation, can support no more people. That is not a prospect which I envisage with any pleasure or confidence when I look forward to the prospect of my children and of yours being able to live in this country, being able to build up a happy and fruitful and useful social, <Col N="1202" /> spiritual and economic life here.  That represents bankruptcy, as far as the land is concerned, if it is true.  Look abroad in Ireland, estimate the number of people you have, estimate the standard of comfort they have, and compare it with other European countries; recognise that we are pouring into it from the resources of the State three millions of money; and ask yourselves whether that number of people, on that amount of land, on that standard of comfort, does not represent bankruptcy, a static condition, no development from it.  Not another son, not another daughter, not another man; the land can support no more people at the standard of low comfort, at the standard of poverty, the standard which represents emigration, the standard which represents unemployment; on that standard the land of Ireland can support no more people within the four corners of this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the House should very seriously face a statement of that kind. I do not suppose that the Minister for Finance will profess to be an expert agriculturist&mdash;I do not know.  But, at any rate, he has at his disposal the whole of the great Departments of State and a Minister for Agriculture who has been described by the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; as the greatest Minister of Agriculture in Europe.  With that knowledge and with that information, and with the responsibility of his position as Minister for Finance in the Free State, he has told you that there is no hope along any line he knows, by any plan which has been divulged to him or adumbrated to him, within the purview or the knowledge of his Department&mdash;there is no means by which the land can be made to support more people.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister for Finance right, or is the Minister for Finance wrong? Right or wrong, if he is stating what he believes to be true, he has done a service and said a man's word in relation to this matter, and the responsibility rests with us now rigorously to examine, in the light of that responsible statement, the whole of the land question in Ireland, and see whether or not we are, through this Finance Bill, through the Departments which <Col N="1203" /> are financed by this Bill, really getting value from that land.  There are silent members upon the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches whom I would give a great deal to hear.  There are farmers on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches, who do not pretend to call themselves members of the Farmers' Party, who know something of farming. There are farmers, some twenty of them, on those Benches here, and there are farmers scattered in the various Parties in this House.  I have had an opportunity of talking with farmers, members of the various Parties in this House, and they are not satisfied that it is true that the land of Ireland used properly is incapable of maintaining more people.  There are men upon the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches whose opinion upon agriculture is infinitely more valuable than mine, and whose opinion I am quite willing to accept as the opinion of experienced men, and they tell me, as regards the statement made by the Minister for Finance, that the land of Ireland can, within the resources of this State and within the resources provided in this Financial Bill, support more people, and ought and would support more people if a different policy in relation to that land were in adoption, if different men with a different outlook upon Irish life and Irish view were in possession of the means of influencing Irish agricultural prospects.</P>
    <P>We who have to take the responsibility of telling the people in this State under the Finance Bill to pay £24,000,000 for the financing of these twenty-six little counties of poor people have got at the same time a responsibility to them to see that whatever knowledge and whatever wisdom there is in relation to agriculture in this Dáil, whatever knowledge and wisdom there is in relation to agriculture which we can gather outside this Dáil, is hammered together into one common machine operated by one common purpose, to see that upon the land of Ireland there is cast this one responsibility &mdash;the responsibility of maintaining more people in Ireland upon a higher standard of comfort than is available to them under the present administration <Col N="1204" /> of Irish land and under the present finances of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Within this Finance Bill we are providing £24,000,000&mdash;I do not want to take close figures, but rather take the round figures.  I am sure the country outside this House does not realise what that means or they would not tolerate it for an hour.  The advisers of the Minister for Finance say £24,000,000 are required to meet the responsibilities and expenses of the Departments which now exist and they have got to have it because that money is required to keep up these Departments.  Which of you runs your own household upon that line?  Which of you allows somebody to say: &ldquo;That is what the house must cost and you have got to give me the money whether you have got it or not, wherever you get it, whether you earn it, or whether you sell your assets in order to provide income for it?&rdquo; That is the spirit of the spending Departments. They lay down what they require, and in laying down what they require they presume to lay down what we shall provide. Twenty-four millions of money! But you cannot afford housing.  You cannot afford to re-capitalise your land. Your agricultural credit scheme is in ruins already.  You cannot afford social services of one kind or another.  You cannot afford to educate your children. You cannot afford to staunch the open wound of emigration from Queenstown and from Dublin, but in finding twenty-four millions of money for the spending Departments in the State you can afford to tie up £480,000,000.  A poor country this! We cannot afford to house our people; we cannot afford to capitalise our land, but we can afford to tie up £480,000,000 and devote the whole product of that to the mere housekeeping of this State.  We are either a poor country or a mad country.</P>
    <P>It is time we said to the spending Departments of this State that we cannot afford to tie up, for the purpose of providing means for mere housekeeping and expenditure, an amount of money which is more than the whole capital value of the Free State.  The American economic authorities over here, some months ago, in a very excellent survey &mdash;the only one of its kind that exists, I think, in the world&mdash;of the financial, fiscal and economic position of Ireland, <Col N="1205" /> estimated that the capital of the whole of Ireland was only between four hundred and six hundred millions; that is, for the thirty-two counties of Ireland. It is somewhere about £350,000,000 for the twenty-six counties.  And we can afford to tie up for housekeeping expenses alone, for the maintenance of Government, for the permission to live in our country, and for the carrying on of justice and for the carrying on of the law&mdash;we can afford to tie up all this money.  It does not include the rates on roads to any extent because they cannot afford to finance the roads within the four corners of this Bill. That money is all used, more money than the whole capital value of the Irish Free State is tied up in the mere cost of housekeeping.  Do you wonder that you cannot afford to house your people? Do you wonder that you cannot afford to finance your land?  Do you wonder that you cannot afford to stop the bleeding wounds of emigration?  Would it not be a miracle if you could do these things?  If you are so extravagant in that particular only, and it is not the only particular&mdash;but that is the biggest and the most obvious and the most immediately to be tackled responsibility by the Dáil, and by all who are behind the Dáil&mdash;all the leakages of Irish wealth and the cause and the foundations of Irish poverty must continue, because this Government show no sign whatever and no glimmering of recognition of the size of the problem they are up against, and of the size of the responsibility that is theirs, and the depth of the obligation which they have to the people to pull down that expenditure on housekeeping and to release some share of the £480,000,000 of money to be operative in production on your land and to be operative in production on industry.  That is the reason why it is perfectly true at the moment, whatever it may be in the future and under a different dispensation, that the land of Ireland can with £24,000,000 of expenditure maintain no more people.  If you turn to the details of the Finance Bill you will find the explanation quite easily.  There you have the finance of a second-rate speculative company, the management of a concern which, if it were not bankrupt, would be a miracle. <Col N="1206" /> You find great spending departments of State having at their head men declared publicly and openly to be utterly inefficient.  No imagination, no knowledge.  Look along that Front Bench there.  I am not blaming them more than is necessary.  I do not think &mdash;and I want to say this deliberately&mdash;I do not think the Twenty-six Counties of Ireland are entitled to demand that there shall be thrown up in an emergency for it a Bench of statesmen and supermen.  You are not entitled to ask it, but you are entitled to ask for men at least of high general average capacity compared to the ordinary producing units in this State.</P>

      <P>Yes, and men who have succeeded in persuading the Minister for Finance to sacrifice for their selfish interests £11,000 of the revenue this year, and who have not, though challenged time and time again, the courage, the knowledge, the ability the frankness or the honesty to come to this House and to give reasons by which it would know how to estimate whether it is true, that which they say, that the money that is given back to them does come into Irish industry. The Deputy has been good enough to recall to my mind&mdash;there are many things that I try to forget&mdash;that on the plea that the money paid into the revenue of race meetings was directly operative in the breeding of Irish horses, and was from that directly and economically operative in the breeding and maintaining of Irishmen on the land which the Minister says will support no more people, the Deputy has succeeded in persuading the Minister, by some reason that was never given to the Dáil either by the Minister for Finance or by the representatives of racing and betting in this country, to put those race meetings on the pay-roll of the State.  That is the plain meaning of it, because every penny that is being handed back to them has to be found under some other revenue by this State and from some other person in this State and in my opinion from people in much greater need than <Col N="1207" /> the Deputy or the interests he represents.</P>

I asked it with an open mind, and as one prepared to go into figures I asked Deputy Shaw and many other people in Ireland, but I have never got the information.  If I get a statement from somebody else, insurance or shipping, or a flour company or something of that kind, about certain things that they say are true, my experience is that they are prepared to put their books in my hands. They are prepared to give me audited accounts, they are prepared to prove their statements.

      <P>I am going to be quite fair to Deputy Shaw.  You are right up against a problem.  You are up against a problem which is of vital social interest to the whole of the people in this country&mdash;the connection between betting, horse-breeding, horse-racing and man-making.  We intend to get the truth, and I am inviting Deputy Shaw and all the interests behind him, now that he has been brought to a showdown, to put before the House, in some form in which it can be understood by ordinary men, proof, documented proof and financial proof, of the nature of that connection.  What price are we paying, what price in all sorts of things are we paying, for the industry that Deputy Shaw says is so magnificent? I am prepared to concede that it is magnificent; I am prepared to exaggerate the value of every Irish industry; I am prepared to do everything that is humanly possible to develop Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will admit that I have been lead into the idle paths of dalliance by Deputy Byrne, and I have wandered a little down the racing paths with Deputy Shaw.  You have in this Finance Bill no instrumentality of production, none whatever; it is purely a revenue-gathering machine.  You have some direct deterrence to production. You have a tax upon initiative and upon enterprise in a country which is short of industry and capital; you have that in a flat rate of income tax. The problem how to use taxation for the purpose of developing and encouraging production has never even entered, as far as I can understand it, apart from some passing and experimental voyagings into&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;has not entered into the mind of the Minister for Finance.  Unless and until the Minister for Finance wakes up to the fact that you have somewhere about £250,000,000 of Irish money invested outside this country, employing non-Irish people and producing wealth for every country in the world but this, that we are starved for money in our own industries in our own land, until he recognises that he has the responsibility of using this financial means for the purpose of producing a change, there is not going to be much hope from the innocence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I described this Finance Bill on a <Col N="1210" /> former occasion.  Frankly, I would rather not describe it in the terms in which I think it deserves description. I am using the most moderate language I can find, and I say that it represents very poor and secondary finance.  You are in the position of a man who burns the doors of his house in order to make a fire; who sells his motor car to buy petrol; who travels first class and goes without his breakfast to do it.  That is the mentality of the man, and he is doing that knowing that he has no fixity of tenure, knowing that there is a successor to him, and he envisages as that successor his political opponent instead of envisaging as his successor his own son and yours and mine. In the absence of the information which, I have no doubt, on a later occasion, Deputy Shaw will give to this House in some ordered form, we have in combination with relaxations of that character duties upon sugar. We have a tax off entrance to race meetings, and we have a tax on sugar. If that balanced your Budget, well there would be something to be said for it, but you are really using your next year's income for this year's expenditure and yet it is said that you have balanced your Budget.  What about selling the trees off your land?  What about capitating the value, selling the asset, the visible, convertible asset, of a token currency and taking the difference between the actual coin value and its face value and regarding part of that as revenue?  What sort of balancing of a Budget is that, and what sort of a prospect is it leaving for the Minister's successor?  Is that playing the game?  Does the country know, as the country ought to know, that this is what balancing the Budget means&mdash; next year's income this year and selling assets and calling them income?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Another difficulty which we have in accepting a Finance Bill of this kind is that we know from actual experience that there is no knowledge of the psychology of taxation behind those who devise it.  Let me say quite frankly, so that there will be no misunderstanding about it, that I am financially interested in the <Col N="1211" /> matter of which I now will speak.  I am not interested to a very great extent, but I am to an extent at any rate enough to know what I am talking about.  Deputy Hogan of Clare&mdash;and I am very sorry not to see him here at the moment&mdash;succeeded in persuading the Minister for Finance to relieve the poorest people of entertainments duty in entertainment houses.  Now, that was a concession. The Minister for Finance removed the whole illogical bottom of the scale, where there was extravagant taxation upon prices under 4d.  I will tell the Minister for Finance what will happen under that scheme.  I am entirely in favour of it.  A gallery holding roughly speaking, 1,500 people a night, which used to cost the people 6d. will cost them 4d., and it will pay the proprietor to do it.  But in a big pit where the people are charged 1/- they will still be charged 1/-.  What the people behind the Minister for Finance do not know is this, that if you relieved that up to 6d. that 1/- would come down to 6d., and it would pay to do it.  The invisible costs of taxation are enormous; the price that has to be paid to the collector is enormous, and it does not pay the collector to get it.  I will give you a case of which I can speak with full knowledge &mdash;the thing for which the consumer is now paying 1/-, and from which the State gets 3d., the consumer would get for 6d. less if the State decided not to take the 3d.  In other words, 100 per cent. is and has to be added to the amount of the tax revenue of the State in this particular matter for the cost of collection and for the restriction of the market due to the cost of collection.  That sort of thing is not understood.  I take that only as an illustration, because every tax that is exacted out of the community is inflicting the cost of collection, not merely on the State which gets it, but on every intermediary who handles it on the way up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance were to reduce his £24,000,000 to £20,000,000&mdash; and he could do it very easily&mdash;he would not save the State £4,000,000, but he would save the State probably twice or three times as much, either directly in <Col N="1212" /> money or in the withdrawal of the interference with and the friction on commercial exchange and equity.  That is why I want the Minister for Finance to face the problem of taxation and the problem of administration in that light.</P>
    <P>We spend millions of money upon preventive services, upon keeping the law and keeping people peaceful, and we find the money out of that, while at the same time we in the Dáil are sitting up all night, deliberately contriving means to prevent that accord between the people of the country, the Government of the country, and the law system of the country which would reduce the necessity for that expenditure.  Imagine for one moment that we could get a condition in this country in which the people really recognised&mdash;I mean not in words at all but in their hearts&mdash;that this was theirs, that everything in connection with it was theirs, that the law and the power to change the law was intimately theirs, that the control of the spirit in which justice was administered was theirs, how many pages of this thing could we tear out, how many broken-down factories could we get going again, and how much of the outgoing stream of our best could we keep with us?  There is a psychology and there is a philosophy, and there is a much bigger outlook upon finance than the Minister for Finance or any of his colleagues, or apparently and any of his advisers, are capable of envisaging.</P>
    <P>You find another provision in the Bill which is really an anticipation of income&mdash;the drink duties&mdash;and here again the Minister for Finance had at his command a great social activity which he could have touched to help the lives of the people.  He could have done very definite things in the direction of turning the people's mind and the people's taste towards that sort of alcoholic drink that would do them less harm than the drink they are consuming now. If, for instance, he had changed over his taxation from the standard to the bulk barrel, he would have obtained two great results; he would have had decentralised production in the breweries, and he would have encouraged the consumption of light beer as against heavy beer.  What he does is to anticipate next year's income from <Col N="1213" /> drink in this year's revenue, and he will tell his successor that he is very sorry for him.</P>
    <P>So far I have more or less dealt with the Minister's sins of commission, and again let me say quite clearly and distinctly that I am not saying that in any personal sense.  The Department of Finance is a Department that is presided over by a man, but that man very often is, to some extent, the creature of its circumstances and of its history. Not merely are we pouring out money, but we are making no attempt to use in this country the large resources which we have.  There is being collected in this country at present&mdash;and when I speak of this country I mean the Twenty-six Counties&mdash;between four and four and a half millions of premium income.  There is being sent, net, out of this country at least a million of money. There is being wasted in overlapping expenditure in this country probably another half million or more of that four millions.  Where, in this Bill, is there any sign of vision which would induce a Minister for Finance to become active to keep within the country that money?  It can be done.  It could not be done, in my opinion, unless and until there was set up this particular machinery that we call the Dáil.  But with the co-operation of this Dáil, with the co-operation of men on all sides of this Dáil&mdash;and I believe that that will be available&mdash;and with the co-operation of all those who know what is going on in this matter, that million and a half of money could be saved, kept and used within the State, and that would be thirty millions of money capitalised.</P>
    <P>Take another case.  We are poor, but we are not accidentally poor.  We are poor because we have a history.  We are poor because we are foolish, and we are poor because we are not using, in the way we ought to use them, all the means which are at our disposal. Six millions of money! The Department of Finance is, I think, keen, and the Minister himself is probably very keen, upon providing money for housing, but no money is being provided for housing.  It cannot be got at a price which is a commercial price. But we are giving it away.  There was <Col N="1214" /> set up, under the Department of Finance, a Commission the result of which was to leave in the hands of the banks in this country six millions of money at a rate of interest ridiculously lower than anything that the Minister for Finance could possibly attempt to borrow it at, and I do not think I will shock him by telling him what it is. That Commission reported in favour of means being taken to gather in eight or nine millions through two and a half per cent.  Savings Certificates.  I see no sign of it being done.</P>

      <P>I quite understand. Our anxiety is to co-operate with the Minister in finding sound finance, and to take our share of the unpopularity of being responsible for sound finance if he will bring it to this House.  But you have a thing like this, you have motor car taxation in the Bill.  You have a <Col N="1215" /> capital charge of 33? per cent. on a motor car which is going to be used as part of the productive machinery of the State.  You have that money used for revenue.  It is like a man running a factory taking out three machines and selling them for scrap in order to carry on.  Because this Budget does provide an amount of money which this State ought not to provide for the service it gives, because it does not function as an instrument of production in the State, because it has not behind it the mentality for the use of the financial resources of this State, which will, in our generation, build a State such as we would want our sons and daughters to <Col N="1216" /> live in, I ask you to refuse to pass the Fifth Stage of the Finance Bill of 1928.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is very elaborately set out in the title.  A short description of it would be that it proposes to reduce the term of office for Senators from twelve years to nine, and to make arrangements for the triennial election.  In order to achieve that purpose it prescribes that in respect of the election that is due to be held in 1928 five Senators will have a term of nine years to run.  It fills up, in consequence, the places of the twenty Senators to retire in 1937, and it makes provision for twenty Senators being elected in 1934. The balance fall due for election in 1931.  One of the first recommendations made by the Joint Committee in their report was that in which they recommended that the number should be kept as at present, that the age limit should be reduced to thirty years, and that the term of office for members of the Seanad be nine years, and that one-third of the members be elected every three years.  I move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The first matter that this Bill deals with is the amendment of Article 31 of the Constitution. That Article, as it stands, deals with the number in the Seanad, with the minimum age of Senators and the period of office.  The amendment deals only with the period of office, but there are consequential amendments which would be completely altered were we to decide that the number of Senators should be reduced; therefore I have put forward an amendment to the effect that before we give a Second Reading to this Bill we should decide the first matter that is referred to in Article 31, namely, the number of Senators that should constitute the Seanad. At the present moment the Seanad consists of sixty members, and under cover of that a great number of Senators can pretend to do their duty&mdash;if there is a duty attaching to the office at all.  They can pretend to do their duty, and let a handful carry on the work.  The question of the number was discussed at the Joint Committee.  The decision that was taken&mdash;as might be expected from that Committee, of which half the number were Senators, and the representatives of the Dáil divided up, the largest Party being allied, so to speak, with the Senators&mdash;was to keep the number as large as possible so as to increase their own vote when the time came.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the arguments put up to meet the case against the reduction of the numbers of the Seanad was that if we were to have a smaller number&mdash;I proposed 35&mdash;the result would be that there would not be a quorum to carry on.  I think that argument is fallacious.  I believe that if you reduce the number of members, and if by their absence the business could not be carried on for want of a quorum, that would quickly call attention to the fact that the work the Senators were elected to perform was not being done.  No argument I heard in Committee or since has convinced me that we need 60 Senators.  I have looked through the numbers in the Senates of various States, and I found that the number that was originally proposed here for the Senate, namely, 40, was a fair all-round number, and, as far as I am concerned, although the number I put down was 35, and I believe that 36 would be a very good number, I would be satisfied if the number were reduced to 40, that is, if we are going to have a Seanad at all.  I hold that every Senator above the number 40 is an unneces- <Col N="1221" /> sary expense, and is not going to make the Senate a more efficient body, but, in fact, is going to be used as a cover for those who do not do their work.  Every one of these Senators gets an allowance and travelling facilities, which costs money.  Why should we increase the cost of allowances by at least one-half more than is necessary?  I would like for one to see that question debated here, to see are there any reasons whatever for having the number of Senators as high as it is.  I can only see one reason why the majority party of the Seanand itself would wish to have such a number, and that is that they can vote and reproduce themselves.  They will have a vote of 60 instead of 36.  I suggested 36 simply because it would be easier to get down to 36 than to 35 from our present number of 60.  The second reason which I have for thinking that 36 would probably be a better number than 35 is the consideration that I indicated here already, namely, that if you are going to have an election by proportional representation you would want to have something from about 10 to 12 candidates, so that the smaller parties might get their due proportion of representation.  If you have a six-year period, which is the period to which I think the term of office ought to be reduced, and if you have one-third of the Seanad retiring every three years, that would give you twelve Senators to be elected every two years.  I think that the plan of having a period of six years, the number of Senators 36, and the period of election two years, is a far more reasonable proposal than that contained in the Bill.  As I said, I am borne out in that view by an examination of the numbers, the period of office, and so on, in other States.  As it happens, in Australia you have exactly the number of 36, and if my memory serves me right, you have a similar period of office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with the question.  You might as well ask me how many county councillors there are here altogether.  We are talking of a Seanad for twenty-six counties, and the example I am taking is the Federal Parliament in Australia, where you have a Senate of 36, and where you have as the period of office the same period which I suggest, namely, six years.  I do not want to elaborate further the points as to the number 36.  I think the number is a very good one for this reason, that it would provide for unavoidable absence, For instance, members get sick occasionally, and occasionally some things happen which prevent a Senator from being present.  I call these unavoidable absences.  I am leaving six on an average, and it is a high average&mdash;one-sixth of the total to cover unavoidable absences.  That would give you a working House of 30, which is, I believe, bigger than the present average. I had intended&mdash;in fact I am surprised it has not appeared&mdash;putting down on the Order Paper a motion asking for a return showing the average attendance of Senators.  I am confident that it would not be above that figure which could be obtained if you had really a working Seanad.  If we examined the number of hours which they are supposed to attend we would find that it would not be a very heavy tax from the point of view of time.  If they are interested at all, and I take it that the fact that they are going for election indicates that they are willing to make certain sacrifices in the public interest, if they are prepared to do that, it would not be too much to expect that five-sixths of the total number of members would be ordinarily present to do the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirty active members present would give you all the discussion you would require and would probably mean greater dispatch in business than <Col N="1223" /> you are getting at present with sixty members.  You would save expense, and I believe you would get a better House.  If the Seanad is to be of any value we ought to have members of the highest possible standard, and it is easier to get 36 than 60.  When Parties will be nominating candidates later there will be a chance of getting a better and higher standard if you reduce the number of the present Seanad.  I am not going to deal with the question of number further, except to say that I intend pressing this matter to a decision and asking that this Second Reading be not proceeded with until the Dáil has an opportunity of discussing this question of number. Unfortunately it does not come in in any Bill because the present Executive is satisfied to leave it as it is.  It is, therefore, difficult to know where to move an amendment whereby the number would be reduced to 36 or other suitable number.  If there was any place in this series of Bills where I could directly propose that as an amendment I would have done so.  The nearest place which I can get is in connection with this amendment of Article 31.</P>
    <P>The next question is the period of office.  The trouble in all these Bills is that we have had, in the general discussion on them, to talk about various aspects in general, and now when we come to particular Bills for the purpose of getting decisions, we have to cover the ground again, so that there is, of necessity, a certain amount of repetition. I have indicated my view that a six years' period was reasonable and would give you a better Seanad than the Seanad you will get with a nine years' period.  Human nature can be depended on to work out very much in averages.  What we may expect here is, if you have a long period, such as nine or twelve years, you will get active work for a couple of years.  I am talking in general.  You will get, of course, exceptions who will be active all the time, and these will be provided for in the six-year period.  You will get active work for a year or two, and then there will be a long period in which there will be comparatively little attention paid to business when the novelty has <Col N="1224" /> worn off.  You will have a few active individuals who will work hard&mdash;leading spirits who will be constantly at work.  I am talking, however, of the great bulk of members.  What will happen in their case is that they will work hard for a few years and will then become ciphers until the period of reelection returns.</P>
    <P>It is wise, however, apart from the question of the advisability of renewal from another point of view, the point of view of change in attitude, change of policy that might occur from the purely human point of view of getting the best work out of individual Senators, not to have the period too long.  Personally, I would like to cut it down to the shortest period reasonable.  Asking myself what is the shortest period reasonable, I first came to the conclusion that a period of seven years would be such a period. It is a long period comparatively, but not unreasonably long.  I had to change from that, however, for the reason that if you had a seven-year period you would have to have an election every year, which would mean only five or six members being elected every year.  That number would be too small to give the smaller Parties in this House, or in the Seanad now, an opportunity of getting candidates returned.  As I say, seven years was the period I fixed on originally, but, in order that there might be a sufficient number of candidates at each term to give minorities their fair share of representation, I had to get a number that would be divisible by two or by three.  A six-year period, with one-third of the members retiring every two years, will, to my mind, give you a very much better system than that which you have at present.  Thus, I am opposed to the insufficiency of the reduction here.  Nine years is unreasonably long.  It would be unreasonably long at any time.  Six years is sufficiently long to carry over from one Parliament to another.  If there is a change in the electorate, a change of political opinion outside, and if there should be a change of Government, it gives an opportunity to the new Government, or majority Party, to get its fair share of representation.</P>
    <P>Five years is the maximum limit of the Dáil.  It will probably work out at not being more than four.  Therefore <Col N="1225" /> you pass through a Parliament, and half a Parliament, and a longer period is, I think, unwise.  I am dealing with it as I would irrespective of any other consideration with respect to the Seanad, but when the Stanad is composed as it is now, as it has been composed, and will continue to be composed for a considerable time, of the most conservative section we have in the country, I think that it is most unfair to put that conservative clog upon progress.</P>
    <P>The third question is the question of age.  I will not deal with that, because it comes up in another connection, and we can deal with it then.  As far as the consequential changes are concerned they are worked out, apparently, all right, but they are worked again altogether in the interests of the Seanad that exists, in the interests of the section of the community to which this Seanad was originally intended to give a privilege.  I see no reason at all why the nominated element should be preserved in the position which it has got.  I see no reason at all why, if this change is to come about, it should not come about and begin as gradually as possible immediately after this new arrangement for the Seanad is settled. There is no reason at all why we should ever imagine that the Seanad has a certain vested interest of its own, so to speak, that must be very rigidly safeguarded. As I said before, I wonder whether the Executive would be so careful in preserving to the last tittle all those interests if they did not think they had in that Seanad a very faithful ally, if the section that is most completely represented in that Seanad were not, in fact, a wing of the majority Party here.  I hold that what the majority Party are doing by this Bill is that they are trying to consolidate their position and to put reserves of strength against the day when, as they expect, the people will gradually change and take a different view on matters that have been the subject of controversy for the last four or five years.  There is no need for me to elaborate what I have said any further. The consequential changes on reducing the numbers can be very easily got over.  It is a matter for the draftsman and it requires only a little study to see <Col N="1226" /> how best to fit them in.  For my own part, in reducing it, I would start by not returning any members this year Fifteen members will retire.  There is no reason why these fifteen vacancies should be filled at all.  That is the first step.  You can at the next two-year period, at the next biennial elections reduce the number to the 36 limit Similarly, the consequential arrangements would not cost very much.  In this Bill, as in all the others, we have simply the not very carefully-hidden purpose of the Executive in strengthening their position politically, in strengthening the majority Party.  In this case, as in the other cases, it is an attempt to remove from the people the right to change if they want to.  I move formally that a Second Reading be not accorded to this Bill and that the Bill be not further proceeded with until the Dáil has come to a decision on the total number of members that should constitute the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to state very briefly my position with regard to this amendment and the Bill before us.  The amendment suggests that the Bill be not further considered until the Dáil has come to a decision as to the total number that ought to constitute the Seanad.  I think it would be well if the Dáil did get an opportunity of considering the total number that ought to constitute the Seanad for the reason that the Dáil is now differently constituted to what it was when the decision to have sixty members in the Seanad was arrived at.  Without expressing any very definite opinion as to the number that should be in the Seanad, I think it is only right that the Dáil should have an opportunity of discussing now what the number should be.  If, however, this amendment is not carried and the question of the Second Reading comes to be decided, I propose to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill, as the principle of it seems to be a reduction of the present term of office.  As a matter of fact, I do not see how Deputy de Valera can hope to get his idea carried or even put before the House unless the Bill gets a Second Reading.  It will be open to him or to anybody else if he thinks that the term of years should <Col N="1227" /> not be nine, to move to insert six in the Bill, and I think he can do that even if his amendment is defeated.  If the Bill comes up for Second Reading I will vote for the Second Reading, and if an amendment is moved to reduce the term still further I will be in favour of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy O'Connell, I am one of those who have very definite views as to what the period of office of Senators should be.  I do not think it is sufficient merely to say that the period of office should be reduced.  We should be able to indicate that definite specific advantages will accrue to the State in consequence of a particular reduction.  The present period of office is twelve years, and the Bill proposes to reduce that to nine years.  As Deputy de Valera pointed out, even the reduction to nine years does not remove the dangers which exist in making the period of office of members of that House of long duration. There is a general impression abroad that membership of the Seanad does not imply any obligation to take an active interest in the work of legislation; that the section of the Constitution which defines the qualifications of members also implies that election to the Seanad is a reward for services rendered and not the taking of an obligation to do definite work.  This State is suffering very severely financially because the Executive have in the past found themselves obliged to give rewards for services rendered by placing individuals in offices of profit. I do not think that we can afford to keep in existence a body which could be used for the purpose of enabling an Executive to reward services rendered to the political Party from which that Executive comes by nominating individuals for election to the Seanad.  If a Senator, on being elected, is independent of public opinion, and of any change which may occur in public opinion, for a period of nine years, unless he is a man of great strength of character, he will not be able to resist the temptation of looking upon his office as a gratuity and neglecting the duties which that office carries with it. There should be re-elections to the <Col N="1228" /> Seanad at periods sufficiently frequent to keep the members alive to the fact that their continued retention of office will depend upon the ability which they show in discharging their duty.</P>
      <P>The period, of course, should not be so short that members will have no opportunity of acquainting themselves with the working arrangements of the Seanad and the general legislative provisions which all legislators must be acquainted with before they can do useful work.  The Dáil and the Executive should endeavour to ensure that the medium between a period which would be obviously too short and the period suggested in the Bill, which is obviously too long, should be taken. I suggest that a period of five or six years is reasonable.  It would enable members to become sufficiently conversant with their duties to discharge them, while at the same time it is short enough to compel them to keep in the forefront of their minds the fact that they have not a permanent occupancy of the office and must at some particular period be able to justify the work they did.  If it is proposed to amend Article 31, and to reduce the period of office of Senators the reduction should be made to certainly not more than six years.  It is a bad principle to have frequent amendments to the Constitution, and I suggest that the evil which it is hoped to remedy by reducing the period will not be remedied and that if the Executive is serious in the matter they will, after a short time, or their successors will, be introducing other Bills to reduce further the period of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera's amendment raises another matter of great importance. We have had Bills introduced here altering the provisions dealing with the method of election to the Seanad, and also altering the provisions which deal with the powers of the Seanad.  There has been a general review of the status of the Seanad, and it does not appear that proper consideration was given to its size.  We must bear in mind that a very large section of the people, at any rate, are of opinion <Col N="1229" /> that we are not getting anything like value for the money we spend on the Seanad.  It is a costly institution, and its cost increases in direct proportion to its size.  The more Senators, the greater the cost.  If we reduce the number, we reduce the cost.  In round figures the Seanad costs us annually £50,000.  One-third of the people, at any rate, are definitely of opinion that we are not getting £50,000 worth of value. If we must have a Seanad&mdash;and we have been unable to carry our proposal that there should be none&mdash;we should endeavour to get a Seanad that would involve the least possible drain upon the pockets of the taxpayers, and we could effect considerable economy immediately by taking advantage of the opportunity given us by the general revision of the Seanad's powers to reduce the number of Senators by approximately one half&mdash;certainly to the figure of 36 suggested by Deputy de Valera.  The work which the Seanad has to do can be performed by 36 Senators just as effectively as it can be by 60.  It is impossible to conceive what particular advantage accrues to this State by the fact that we have 60 Senators instead of 36.  It may be contended that two heads are better than one, but it does not follow that 60 heads are better than 36.  As a matter of fact, it is probably true that as the number increases the average standard of ability decreases.  The same is, no doubt, true of the Dáil.  We have stated that the number of Deputies could also be reduced with advantage.  Certainly where the House in question is not really the operative part of the Oireachtas, but the part which is merely intended to act as a brake upon the operative part, it is not necessary that we should have an elaborate institution such as that which now exists.  The demand for the abolition of the Seanad, which is growing throughout the country, has very little relation to any constitutional theory as to whether one or two Houses are the best form of Government.  The demand is based very largely upon the fact that the Seanad appears to be of little use and very costly, and if we want to get people to consider it as a constitutional question and not as an economic question, we <Col N="1230" /> should endeavour to provide that their objections to the existing Seanad are reduced.  Their objections would be reduced if the recommendation from these Benches was adopted and the cost reduced by one-half.  I hope we will have from the Government an adequate statement as to the reasons which induced them not to interfere with the existing numbers of the Seanad.  There has been a tendency on their part to give the Dáil as little information as possible as to the reasons which influenced them in introducing this legislation. They have relied upon their majority and the Standing Order which enables them to move the closure occasionally.</P>

They must have considered the matter.  We are sure that when the report of the Joint Committee came before the Cabinet Council the question of the number of Senators came up for discussion, and some reason must have been advanced to convince the majority of the Executive Council that it was best to leave the number as it is and to maintain the Seanad at the existing cost.  The Dáil would like to get that reason.  It is possible that that reason would be as convincing here as it was in the Cabinet Council, though probably not, because there are more sensible men here than in the Cabinet.</P>

But to return to the Bill, and to get back to the argument I was advancing before the President's disorderly interruptions, it seems to us that a very strong case can be made out for reducing the number of Senators and their period of office.  Before a division is taken on this amendment we hope to get from the Government a statement&mdash;it need not be long provided it is clear&mdash;as to the reasons which induced them to effect a reduction of three years only in the period of office and not to interfere with the number of Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>One difficulty that I find myself confronted with in speaking on matters with reference to the Constitution Amendments is the peculiar prejudice that colours practically every speech I heard from the Benches opposite.  If we could get Deputies on the Benches opposite to stand out from themselves, and from their political heresies of the past few years and to look to the State, and consider what are the best means for formulating the institutions that will command respect and confidence, and to promote <Col N="1232" /> a spirit of good will and toleration, and attempt to bring about a great system of national co-operation between all the people, then, they would have a far different prospect before them in considering and criticising these proposals. I do not want to be personal or to hurt susceptibilities.  But a good deal of the discussion that has taken place and which has been contributed to by members of the Party opposite has practically put us in this position, that it would be better to remain silent than to come in and comment upon, or contradict, or deal with the statements from the Benches opposite on these matters.</P>
      <P>I have here the Bill introduced, in this House in 1922, dealing with the Seanad.  The number of members of the Seanad at that time was 60.  I shall just revive the memory of Deputies in connection with the statement that we heard&mdash;I forget exactly the name of the Deputy who made it&mdash;but that Deputy referred to the fact that the late General Collins and President Arthur Griffith brought all the blessings that came with the Initiative and with the Referendum.  Well, if they did I presume they did not keep away their blessings from the members in the Seanad.  We will leave that for the moment.  I want to speak, if possible without hurting, in any way, the political susceptibilities of Deputies opposite.  We will admit that a Treaty was signed by Plenipotentiaries on behalf of this country and on behalf of Great Britain.  Now apart from that Instrument itself there was the understanding that in the Institutions that would be set up, resulting from the Treaty, special attention would be given to associating some of those who had not any connection with the public life of this country, by reason of the political differences there were for a period of 20 or 30 years, with the public life of the country in the Second Chamber if a Second Chamber was considered necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I was suggesting to Deputies on the opposite Benches that it would be well to consider what, in their minds, would be a good Seanad.  As far as I could judge from the speeches that have been made, the Deputies opposite would consider the Seanad a suitable institution in this country if its members were composed of their political supporters solely and entirely. They would have no consideration for anybody else; everybody else in the country as far as they were concerned would be people who had not the best interests of the country at heart.  The rest of the people other than the supporters of their own Party would be people who were not continually making prophecies that they were going to come into power, that they were gradually advancing towards that end and, as their Party grew in numbers, they were appalled by the fact that they did not gain any intellectual advantage from the increase in numbers. That is the sum and substance of what I gather from the speeches of the Deputies opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to the Seanad is that if it is to be of use in the country it ought not to be constituted in exactly the same way or be selected in the same manner as the First Chamber.  It is not usually an institution which marks progress or which is regarded as marking the progress which Deputy De Valera would desire.  It is an institution which considers with much less political heat legislative proposals which are brought before it.  In our experience of the last five or six years it has been of considerable advantage to the country. As far as the numbers of it are concerned, that is a question which might be considered if it were considered without political prejudice.  It is no part of the policy of the Government to establish in the Seanad a strong political support for the Cumann na <Col N="1235" /> nGaedheal Party.  It does not require it.  It never did require it.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party is sufficiently strong of itself to withstand any of the onslaughts which might come from even a combination of other Parties in the State.</P>

We have heard a speech from the President, but I submit we have not heard a single justification for the proposal contained in the Bill.  If we had not been gratified to hear the President expound to us that political wisdom which he carries locked up within himself; if we had not been glad to hear for the first time in the heavy silence of these debates a voice from the Government Benches telling us upon what grounds this House should consider these proposals, I think that some of us would have suggested that the President was not strictly in order in so far as he did not at all consider the principle in this Bill, which is to reduce the period of office of a Senator.

I am suggesting that the President found himself in this position, that he could not tell us why he wanted the term of office reduced to nine years and not to six years or three years, and that therefore he proceeded to discuss something else.  The President is responsible for the Bill, not responsible for the amendment. He has got to justify the Bill as against the amendment and he has got to say why the Bill should not be held up, because there is nothing in the amendment which would compel the House to hold up the Bill until the amendment has been discussed and has been decided on.  He did not do that.  He talked about the number of Senators. He did not talk about the number of years in which the Senators would hold office which is the principle of this Bill. And why not?  What mystical virtue is there in a period of nine years that compels the President to come here and under a threat of the closure, and with the coercion of physical exhaustion to guide him to point his argument?  What justification has he for coming here and saying that the period of office for a Senator in Seanad Eireann is going to be nine years?  In other legislatures, in the American Senate which most people consider to be the one great practical example of a successful second chamber in existence, a Senate which <Col N="1238" /> those who have considered and analysed these matters have lauded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is difficult enough to examine and criticise a proposal that has not been explained to us.  This idea did not originate in our minds.  We do not know the advantages of it.  We are in the dark, asking for information and for an explanation, and in view of the difficulties under which an Opposition labours I think that we are entitled to some consideration. I was now referring to the fact that in the Senate of America, which Viscount Bryce praised as a masterpiece of constitution-making, and which men of great authority on the origin of constitutional law say is the one thoroughly successful institution which has been established since the tide of modern democracy began to run, the term of a Senator is only six years.

      <P>On yesterday I asked the Minister for Justice whether, in view of the statement made by political prisoners recently released from Mountjoy prison in reference to their treatment, he will order a public inquiry into the conditions in the prison.  The Minister in his reply said that &ldquo;the answer is in the negative.  There are no grounds for instituting such an inquiry.&rdquo; Now, that is where I differ from the Minister.  I believe that there are grounds for instituting an inquiry, and I believe that the Minister, being the man that he is, is open to conviction that such an inquiry is necessary. First of all, I would like to take the case of George Gilmore, who has lately been released.  Statements were made in this House from time to time of the treatment which George Gilmore suffered in Mountjoy Prison at the hands of the warders and other officials. They were invariably denied and repudiated by the Minister for Justice.

      <P>He would have seen in it on June 9th an interview with George Gilmore on his release.  When he was shown the statement made in this House and the reply by the Minister he was asked to comment upon it.  He said:</P>
      <P>The statement of the treatment which I suffered is quite true.  I am not saying that Mountjoy is a slaughter-house.  As a matter of fact, it is not.  In many odds and ends of ways I received little kindnesses, but on the occasion of the assaults the warders were veritable demons.  I have heard of men maddened with rum and fear running amok in Flanders. What spirit moved the warders I do not venture to say, but it certainly was not Christian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things we mentioned here before was that George Gilmore was seized, placed upon a table, and that the warders, catching his hair, pounded his head on the table.  That was denied. George Gilmore says that is true, and he says, as a matter of fact, that the beating was so severe that he was sick for several days afterwards and could not take food.  He says that the prison authorities told his mother that he was on hunger strike, which was not so. Some time afterwards his mother applied for the usual visit that she was entitled to under the prison regulations, but the Chairman of the Prisons Board came to Gilmore and told him that he would allow the visit if he, Gilmore, gave his word of honour that he would not tell his mother of the treatment he received.  Gilmore was anxious to see his mother and gave his word, and when his mother came up of course he told her that he was all right.  Some time afterwards, after the second assault, when a visit was due from his mother, the Chairman of the Prisons Board came along with the same offer to allow the visit again if he gave the undertaking.  George Gilmore refused to give the undertaking a second time, and as a result there was no visit.  He lived through it all, and he is alive now to tell the tale.  He is alive, and if the Minister for Justice wishes to hold a public inquiry he can get the facts. Members of this House will remember that George Gilmore was a political <Col N="1242" /> prisoner, sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment for releasing other political prisoners from Mountjoy Jail.  That was the charge against him.  I do not know whether he was guilty or not. He was charged, at any rate, and got 18 months' imprisonment.  No one was hurt on the occasion.  As a matter of fact a number of prisoners were benefited by being set free.  I would like to contrast that sentence with one that I notice in a case reported in the &ldquo;Evening Herald&rdquo; of June 14.  The heading was: &ldquo;A Serious Charge: Inspector Curran&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

Perhaps there are Ministers also who would do so if they were present.  I do not think the Minister for Justice moved in the same circles, but other Ministers might know George Gilmore.  The second case that I wish to deal with is that of Mrs. MacDermott. She was one of the women prisoners who lately went on hunger strike.  She was released from Mountjoy Jail after, I think, a five days hunger strike, and brought to Mercer's Hospital.  She was released after being pronounced to be in rather a serious condition by the prison doctor.  The Minister for Justice will, of course, agree with me when I say, that the prison doctor would not release this woman unless she was seriously ill.  He would be exceeding his duty if he did so.</P>

      <P>Anyway, I saw her in Mercer's Hospital, whether she was released or not.  I heard that she got bad treatment.  She was rather sick as a result of the hunger strike when I saw her, and I did not like to question her too much.  But she did show me marks of violence on her arms and legs. I did not like to question her as to what the cause of them was.  From what I heard since, they were due to her having been dragged into her cell on a couple of occasions.  A certain amount of violence was used, and in all probability the wardresses used more violence than they might have.  At any rate these marks were inflicted on her somewhere about three weeks before I saw them.  There was a number of marks on one of her legs and a number of marks on one of her arms, and they were still black.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that I did not raise this question this morning, because since then Deputy Briscoe, who will speak for himself, had an opportunity of visiting the women prisoners who are still in Mountjoy, and what I have just said about Mrs. McDermott will be more or less verified by him, that is, that they were dragged into their cells on a few occasions.  They say, however, and I want to state this publicly &mdash;that they are quite satisfied with their treatment now.  They are being treated now as they wish to be treated, that is, they have got association and the other things that they fought for. But the question I would like to put to the Minister is this: Why should it be necessary, every time boys and girls are arrested on political charges, that they must put up a fight to get the treatment that is due to them?  Why must they go through the trouble of a hunger strike, or put up some other sort of fight, to get what is due to them as political prisoners, or perhaps the Minister would apply the title of second-class prisoners, or something of <Col N="1244" /> that nature to them?  But at any rate they have got different treatment now and they are satisfied.  I think, in view of what George Gilmore has said, and is prepared to say to anybody who asks him about it, and in view of what I myself saw with my own eyes&mdash;the marks on Mrs. McDermott's body&mdash;that we are perfectly justified in asking for an inquiry.  I have heard since about other prisoners, but I do not want to go into that, because I have not seen them personally.  Other Deputies may be able to say more.  I have also a case here, but I am afraid that it will come under the same ruling, that it does not specifically come under this question, because, unfortunately, it arose in Maryborough Prison.  I do not know if the Minister would object&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At the outset I wish to state that I am in entire agreement with Deputy Ryan in his plea for an inquiry into prison conditions, particularly in relation to those prisoners who were referred to as political prisoners and who are, in fact, political prisoners.  As a result of a deputation of ladies waiting on me, I complained to the Governor that I had heard certain rumours as regards brutal treatment meted out to four prisoners in Mountjoy &mdash; Miss Humphries, Miss McCarthy, Miss McInerney, and Miss Jackson&mdash;and I felt that it was my duty to go to Mountjoy to see them. I was rather pleasantly surprised to find that the Governor of Mountjoy <Col N="1245" /> met me in a very friendly manner and accorded me every facility.</P>
      <P>I think that it is only fair to refer to that, because I might refer also to a previous visit I had to Mountjoy, when another governor was there. This Governor certainly gave me every facility, showed me every courtesy, and enabled me to interview the four ladies in question.  As Deputy Ryan has pointed out, at the present moment they have no complaint whatever.  They had to take certain action, and whether that was recognised by the authorities of Mountjoy or not, the little differences which they wanted were made.</P>

      <P>As far as I could gather from the ladies, they have no grievance against the prison authorities generally, except that they wanted certain regulations which they consider that they now have.  This is a point that, perhaps, the Minister would be surprised about, and I mentioned to the Governor that I intended referring to it here.  He was exceptionally <Col N="1246" /> courteous and fair to me throughout.  I want to make this point, and I would like the Minister to say if it is not a point which would warrant inquiry: On a Sunday morning in that prison the five ladies there at the time got into an office and locked themselves in.  There were not sufficient wardresses on duty to cope with the situation that morning, and as a result ordinary prisoners, who were not political prisoners, were allowed to attempt to get these people out of that room.  They did not complain very much with regard to the attempt; they did not complain very much about having to suffer from the matter, but I would like to know if the Minister considers it good policy or wise to use criminals to help the prison officials to keep order in a prison where they are trying to quell a disturbance, if you like, or to quell grievances of political prisoners.  I will say this, that there is no dispute as regards that particular item on the part of the Governor himself. I looked upon it as very serious and he explained to me&mdash;I presume I am in order in mentioning it here&mdash;that if he had been present he would not have allowed it, and he classed it as an indiscretion on the part of these minor officials.  I do not want to labour the point with regard to what happened to the ladies when they were resisting certain regulations, whether they were pulled too hard or pushed too hard, or whether their clothes were torn off them or not.  But an inquiry into the present system of regulations is necessary to find out if it would not be wise to define, in the first instance, a political prisoner as such when he or she is committed, and if it could be agreed upon that they should have political treatment, that that should be defined. If we got agreement on this I am sure that it would be far easier for the prison officials themselves, far easier for the Minister, and far easier for us on these benches, who cannot sympathise in any way with the prison officials or with the Minister when he is trying to administer order in a prison where he demands from political prisoners the fulfilment of the same regulations as if they were ordinary common-or-garden criminals, serious ones or lesser ones.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Briscoe was outlining the treatment and expressing satisfaction at the treatment that is now being accorded to political prisoners in Mountjoy, the Minister interrupted him to say that these are in the regulations, that the regulations allowed for the treatment that the prisoners are now satisfied with. I want an answer to this question: If the regulations allowed that treatment to be given, why had the political prisoners in Mountjoy to undergo a hunger strike for six days in order to obtain that treatment?  Why were they refused it before they went on hunger strike, and why were they given it after they were six days on hunger strike, and after one of the women prisoners had to be removed to Mercer's Hospital to recover from the effects of that hunger strike?  If the Government are afraid to allow these political prisoners to remain at large, if they think that they are not stable enough to carry on if they allowed these four or five girls to remain at large in Dublin and elsewhere, surely to goodness when they do make them prisoners they should at least give them the treatment that is allowed under the regulations. Certainly they should not be making every prisoner they take on a political charge into Mountjoy go through the agony of a six days hunger strike before giving him or her the treatment that is allowed under the regulations.</P>

      <P>I will deal in the short time left to me with the case of those ladies who went on hunger strike in Mountjoy.  The charge here, and the only charge which is anyway germane to the issue the House is now discussing, is as to whether they were or were not brutally treated in Mountjoy.  I do not think that Deputy Briscoe is quite candid&mdash;possibly he was not intentionally uncandid&mdash;in the statement which he made to the House.  Deputy Briscoe saw those prisoners and spoke to them. What we are discussing is whether in view of the statements made by political prisoners an inquiry should be set up. Deputy Briscoe at no time suggested they were treated with brutality.  Did they ever make that charge themselves <Col N="1248" /> to Deputy Briscoe?  That is a thing which is of importance here.  That is the one matter upon which I would have liked to hear Deputy Briscoe speak.  That is the one thing which is relevant to the issue which we are discussing, and that is the very one thing which Deputy Briscoe has not spoken about.  For my part, I conclude, and I think I am justified in drawing the conclusion, that no such charge was made to him.</P>

      <P>From the reports I have received, and which I am satisfied were correct, no more violence than was necessary was used. Violence of a certain kind was necessary because the ladies refused to obey the prison regulations and locked themselves in a cell.  The <Col N="1249" /> wardresses did not use any more violence than was necessary.  From the information I have received, and I am satisfied that it is perfectly true, the wardresses used no more violence than was necessary.  Deputy Briscoe referred to one instance in which these ladies coming from Mass locked themselves in a cell.  The wardresses went into the room in which they locked themselves up, and the female prisoners joined in the attempt to get them out of the cell.  The facts given to me are these: As soon as the ladies broke away and went into the room the wardresses in charge of the prisoners, bringing them back from Mass, went to the cell and endeavoured to force the door open.  That left the other female prisoners unguarded at the moment.  These ladies were extremely unpopular in Mountjoy Prison, according to what I am told, because in the middle of the night they used to spend a great deal of the time shouting and singing and they interfered with the sleep of all the other female prisoners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to it as quickly as I can, but I am going to finish with these ladies. It was stated these ladies received ill-treatment. That is not so.  Before they went on hunger strike they, that is <Col N="1250" /> three of them, received the ordinary treatment of untried prisoners, that is to say, prisoners who may or may not be guilty of charges.  The others received the ordinary second division treatment.  They are now as far as one set is concerned getting second division treatment, and the others are getting the ordinary untried prisoners treatment.  Coming to the case of Gilmore, the charges made by him rest entirely on his statement.  Deputy Ryan in his statement said he knew Gilmore well and he entirely believed in every word Gilmore said.  As far as Gilmore is concerned, I have had the matter carefully investigated, and I am thoroughly satisfied no more violence was used to him than was necessary in order to carry out the prison regulations in the taking of his photograph and finger prints. The prison warders used no more violence against Gilmore than was necessary in order that the prison regulations should be carried out.  He resisted violently, but the prison regulations were carried out and rightly so.  Gilmore says more violence was used against him than was necessary to carry out the regulations.  I do not accept the accuracy of that statement. I have had the matter investigated and I do not think that any prima facie case has been made out to warrant an inquiry into that case.</P>

Let me quote from a paper <Col N="1252" /> that has been referred to again and again in this House as being as true as gospel in its statements, &ldquo;An Phoblacht.&rdquo; Referring to Gilmore, it says: &ldquo;In appearance Gilmore is as per usual.
