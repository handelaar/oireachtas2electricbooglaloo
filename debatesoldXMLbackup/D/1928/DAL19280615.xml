      <P>This Bill is to amend the Constitution by deleting Articles 47 and 48 and making necessary consequential amendments in other Articles.  The Constitution provides an extensive franchise, and election according to the system of Proportional Representation.  In these provisions are enshrined safeguards for minority representation, and very generous provision is made for the expression of political opinion.  The Referendum and the Initiative are matters upon which there may be varying opinions.  These opinions may still further vary according to the provisions which are made in respect of the use of the Referendum or the Initiative. While there are very generous provisions for the expression of political opinion at the elections which are held, it is a matter of paramount importance that sufficient care be taken to ensure that majorities have rights and that those rights will be secured to them. Having regard to the fact that elections are carried out under the Proportional Representation system, there is, as I have said, very generous provisions for the expression of political opinion by minorities.  The provisions in the Constitution for two-fifths of the members of either House presenting a petition to the President of the Executive Council, and, after certain formalities have been gone through in certain cases, that on a representation from three-fifths of the members of the Seanad legislation can be put to the Referendum, do not commend themselves to the Executive Council.  In the same way the provisions which are in the Constitution in respect to the Initiative might eventuate in creating a situation in which the electors would return a majority representation in favour of a certain line of policy and that that line of policy would be altered by the use or abuse of the Initiative.  Having regard to the extended franchise that there is under the system of election which we have, there is no necessity for and no useful purpose can be served by retaining the Initiative.  The other amendments are simply of a consequential <Col N="695" /> character, and I formally move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the same considerations arise upon the amendments to this Bill as arose on the amendments to the Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Bill yesterday.  I presume it is intended to take the amendments in bulk, as was done yesterday, in which case I suggest that Amendment No. 3 on the Order Paper, in the name of Deputy de Valera, should be taken as the one to be put.</P>

      <P>Amendment 1 is in order.  Amendment No. 2, as I explained yesterday, raises a question which cannot again be raised on this Bill, namely, the question of the amendment of the Constitution as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">

      <P>The purpose of Amendment 3 is simply that Articles 47 and 48 should be retained, and that can be accomplished by voting against the motion for Second Reading. Amendment 4 is a delaying amendment, and a decision of the House upon that can be taken.  I will therefore take Amendment 4, in the name of Deputy de Valera.  Of course, as before, the main question and the amendments may all be argued together, and I am not ruling out arguments on Amendment No. 3.</P>

      <P>With respect to your ruling on Amendment 3, might I point out that it is not at all covered by anything that was done yesterday; neither is it a direct negative.  This Bill proposes to deprive the people of a certain right which the people have imagined that they possess&mdash;the right of having referred to them in certain cases the question as to whether certain laws should pass, or being given powers to initiate legislation under certain conditions.  I think it cannot be regarded as a direct negative if we say that before this is done the question of <Col N="696" /> whether it is the will of the people that it should or should not be done should be referred to them, and I submit that you should not rule that amendment out on that ground.  It is quite clearly not a direct negative, because it is possible that the people would vote for depriving themselves of that power and, therefore, this Bill could come along in the ordinary way then, having been referred in the first place to the people.</P>

      <P>As I say, I think that the question may be argued on the basis that Deputy de Valera has just mentioned, but the amendment simply amounts to not deleting Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not deleting them until the people have expressed their will.  That is a general question which might apply to any Bill, and I do not know how a decision could be implemented on this Bill more than any other.  The point is that the Ceann Comhairle is refusing to accept this as a formal amendment on which he could put a question which would lead to a particular kind of decision.  The matter may be argued generally whether Articles 47 and 48 ought or ought not to be deleted, and the purpose aimed at by Amendment 3 can be accomplished by voting against the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that the purpose would not be accomplished? The purpose is to get a vote of this House first of all whether the rights that touch the people in their sovereign powers most closely should be taken away from them by this Bill, and it would be very important to have for the people a record of those who wish to take these powers from them without giving them a chance of expressing their will in the first place. Articles 47 and 48 are in a very different position from other Articles of the Constitution.  As long as they remain, it is possible to refer any Bill on the representations of two-fifths of the representatives in the Dáil back to the people.  But the moment you take Articles 47 and 48 away that power of <Col N="697" /> reference to the people is taken completely away from them.  They govern the whole Constitution so far as reference to the people is concerned.  Therefore I hold they are in a very different position from any other Articles of the Constitution.  It is not, therefore, in my opinion, correct to say that what I have said in respect of this particular Bill could be applied to any other Bill. Indirectly it could, but directly no. But once these Articles are removed there is no other power in the Constitution of reference to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that Articles 47 and 48 are in a special position.  Will Deputy de Valera say how the people can express their will?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>A motion could be introduced into this House that this question be referred to the people. There is no reason why such a motion could not be brought in or a Bill to that effect, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Then every possible Bill could be brought in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because under the machinery of the Constitution two-fifths of the members of the Dáil have the power of reference to the people. Under Article 47 you can refer any Bill by getting a sufficient number of signatures and a sufficient number of members of this House&mdash;two-fifths&mdash;against it.  The moment that is taken away that power is taken away also.  It hits at three authorities.  It hits at the power of the Dáil; it hits at the power of the Seanad, and it hits at the power of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the question in the amendment is that the machinery provided by Articles 47 and 48 should be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Retained for a time pending the direct decision of the people.  Before the question of giving up their sovereign power, of being the final deciders on national questions on Bills and Constitutional Amendments&mdash;I do not know to what extent it is proposed to do that&mdash;is taken from the people, it ought to be referred directly to the people as to whether they are willing to give it up.  At the present time, under the Constitution, they are supposed to have that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="698" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is somewhat complicated.  The amendment simply is that the machinery provided under Articles 47 and 48 should remain in the Constitution and be worked for a particular purpose. The only way that this amendment could be put into operation is by the machinery provided by Articles 47 and 48, and it is precisely that machinery that the Bill proposes to delete, so that the purpose of the amendment can be obtained by voting against the Second Reading of the Bill.  There may be some doubt in the matter.  My interest in the matter is that if an amendment to the effect that the Second Reading should not be taken until the people give their decision were accepted as an amendment normally on a Second Reading it would be an absurd precedent, and could be moved to any and every Bill as a dilatory amendment, having no relation to the Bill at all.  Having made it clear that that precedent is not being created, I am prepared to allow Deputy de Valera to move amendment No. 3, and to put the question as I put it yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;as it is the opinion of An Dáil that Articles 47 and 48 should be retained until the people by direct vote have expressed their will on the question of deletion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with your ruling now. I think it is a just ruling, in so far as it preserves for members of the House their rights to have this question referred to the people before Articles 47 and 48 are removed.  Before I formally deal with the amendment, I would like to refer in general terms to the Bill itself.  This Bill is not one really of the series of Bills at all.  It is a distinct Bill.  The only link or connection there is between it and the other series of Bills is that in Article 47 there is reference to certain powers the Seanad has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 48 has no reference whatever to any powers of the Seanad.  As I said a moment ago, this Bill really hits at three authorities.  It hits at the Seanad; it hits at the Dáil, and it hits at the power of the people; and it has <Col N="699" /> no purpose whatsoever except to try to give the present majority a continuance of office.  A few days ago the President indicated very clearly what was in his mind.  Some years ago the Irish people took a certain decision, and, of course, that is to be unchangeable. The Irish people have no right whatever to change their minds on that, even though they wakened up to the fact that they were deceived at the time, and that they have been deceived by the majority ever since.</P>
    <P>When that particular issue was before the people one of the planks on which they claimed to be returned to power and authority was that they stood for the rights of the people.  They pointed particularly to this Article 48 and to this Article 47 of the Constitution, and they said, &ldquo;We admit that you (the people) are the sovereign authority.&rdquo;  They took Article 2 of the Constitution, and they read it, cutting off, of course, the tail of it, the part that contained the sting, which said that the power of the people had to be exercised in accordance with the institutions which were set up there. They took good care to hide from the people that they were putting themselves in a prison house, enclosing themselves in a trap, and that under the institutions which were being set up here it was possible for the majority, once they got into power, to close the trap, so that the people should never get out again.  It is the very same principle they have been working on in the Seanad&mdash;the principle of the valve.  The valve offers no resistance whatever to pressure from one side&mdash; no opposition to anything that the majority wants here, to anything that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party wants, whether it is for the general interests or not.  That is let through.  But it is intended to act from the other side the moment the people would change their minds, and put in a Government that held to the national traditions. Then, of course, it was intended to resist. I say that before these powers which are given in the Constitution are to be taken away from the people the people should be consulted.</P>
    <P>Now to return again to the Articles. The first section of this Bill&mdash;they <Col N="700" /> really are principles&mdash;each Article is a principle, so that it is not discussing the Bill in detail section by section&mdash; proposes the deletion of the word &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; where it occurs in Article 14.  Let us refer just for a moment to Article 14.  Perhaps it is better to read the whole; we may find exactly where the Initiative comes in:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All citizens of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann), without distinction of sex, who have reached the age of 21 years and who comply with the provisions of the prevailing electoral laws, shall have the right to vote for members of Dáil Eireann and to take part in the Referendum and Initiative.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a right, and by the simple deletion of the word &ldquo;Initiative&rdquo; there, that right is taken away from the people.  The deletion of the word &ldquo;Initiative&rdquo; in Article 14 is meant to deny to the people the right which is expressly given to them in this Constitution, the right of initiating laws and making constitutional amendments if they choose.  I say deliberately &ldquo;if they choose,&rdquo; because by Article 48 provision was made so that if a substantial section of the people wished to have the provisions for the Initiative made by the Oireachtas they could do so by the simple act of signing a petition. Those who framed it, as I pointed out on a previous occasion, took good care not to give the Oireachtas a simple way out of rejecting that petition by refusing to take it.  There is nothing in Article 48 that would indicate that there was any such discretionary powers resident in any part of the Oireachtas.  Once the petition was signed according to this Constitution, the provisions for the Initiative were bound to be set up.  The majority here ignore that Article, and, of course, this is all mere window-dressing, the changing of these Articles, because tomorrow, if it suited them to make any other changes in it they would do so, even if it were the undoing of the work they are doing to-day.  I say that by the deletion of the word &ldquo;Initiative&rdquo; in Article 14 you are taking away a right which the people were told that they have.  If you were to examine the <Col N="701" /> statements that were made by the majority Party for the last four or five years, you would find that the one note in their speeches was that the people of this country, or this section of the country, were Sovereign.  Of course, if they have to exercise their Sovereignty through an instrument which limits their powers of functioning it is quite obvious that that is an absurdity.  To say that the people are Sovereign, but yet that they must exercise their Sovereign powers within the prison house which has been imposed on them from outside&mdash;to pretend that they are Sovereign&mdash;is ridiculous.  But such powers as they might have of changing that framework and freeing themselves from that prison were contained principally in these Articles which gives them the power of the Initiative; and, therefore, not merely is it proposed to take away the rights of the people to initiate laws within the framework, but, more important still, the right of the people to change the framework, if they want it, is being taken away from them.  The next point in the Bill is that it proposes the deletion of Article 47.  Now, Article 47 is this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses may be suspended for a period of ninety days on the written demand of two-fifths of the members of Dáil Eireann or of a majority of the members of Seanad Eireann presented to the President of the Executive Council not later than seven days from the day on which such Bill shall have been so passed or deemed to have been so passed. Such a Bill shall, in accordance with regulations to be made by the Oireachtas, be submitted by Referendum to the decision of the people if demanded before the expiration of the ninety days either by a resolution of Seanad Eireann, assented to by three-fifths of the members of Seanad Eireann, or by a petition signed by not less than one-twentieth of the voters then on the register of voters, and the decision of the people by a majority of the votes recorded on such Referendum shall be conclusive. These provisions shall not apply to Money Bills or to such Bills <Col N="702" /> as shall be declared by both Houses to be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we examine that Article we find in the first part of it that it gives two-fifths of the members of Dáil Eireann the right to demand the suspension of a Bill for ninety days so as to enable a petition to be signed by not less than one-twentieth of the voters then on the register.  So the Dáil is taking away one of the protections which the minorities in this House would have and which were expressly given to them by the Constitution, the protection being that two-fifths of the members could suspend any Act that it was proposed to pass by majority vote if they were prepared to face the people on that issue.  This Bill, therefore, does very much more than supplement the decisions that were arrived at by the Joint Committee that was set up to consider the powers and mode of election to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It is not merely touching the Seanad, but it touches this Dáil and it touches the privileges that, so far, minorities have had in this Dáil&mdash;namely, the right, when they were sufficiently near to the majority, to insist that before the majority ride roughshod over them on a question in which they feel that the people would not support the majority, that that question should be referred to the people.  I think that a very good principle.  If a House like this that is elected by the people is prepared to face the people on an issue, if they are able to get two-fifths of the members of the House to face the people on an issue of that kind, then I believe there must be some very good reason for it, some very good reason for thinking that the people are opposed to the measure which it is proposed to pass.  No Party would be prepared to go to the people on a frivolous issue, because they would later have to face the electorate on a charge of needlessly wasting public money.</P>
    <P>When you have a House elected for a long period of years, such as nine or twelve years, when you have a nominated House or a House capable of reproducing itself by the method of <Col N="703" /> election, such a House need have no respect for the people and could freely, by use or misuse of the Referendum, put questions to the people which were really frivolous.  Because the people would have no way of paying them back by refusing to elect them again, such a House could afford to abuse the Referendum.  As far as I am concerned, I do not object to the Seanad being deprived of the power of referring Bills or any other matters to the electorate. As I indicated yesterday, I believe in this country, under the conditions in which we are at the moment, that the Seanad serves no useful purpose, and therefore I am not concerned with retaining for that House the power of trying to defeat or delay action by the majority by referring questions to the people.  However, if the people want to repose such an authority in the Second House, it is the right of the people to insist that that authority be not taken from them until they themselves are consulted in the matter.  On that particular point I am interested that any powers of this kind which refer to the fundamental rights of the people should not be affected until the people are consulted.</P>
    <P>The next point is that it strikes at the Dáil, at the rights of minorities here, and it also strikes at the people's rights.  The people have, as a matter of fact, very deliberately and expressly, by the number of voters that were set out as necessary in this Constitution, shown they want to have the Initiative set up or, if it is refused by the Oireachtas, that the question as to whether they want it or not should be referred to themselves.  We know the tactics by which that petition of the people was ignored here.  I hold that if the representatives of the people here want to do their duty by the people they will insist that Articles so vital as these to the people's rights will not be taken away from the people unless the people themselves deliberately choose to hand them up.</P>
    <P>I have here the volume of the debates of the Provisional Parliament, in which this question of the Referendum and the question of the Initiative were debated. I do not propose to read them, but I <Col N="704" /> ask members here before they vote on this particular question to refresh their memories by reading these debates, and see what the persons who are now going to take away the power of the people said when they were passing this Constitution. The Minister who at the time was responsible for dealing with the Constitution made great play of these particular Articles&mdash;how they proved that the majority Party were interested in preserving the sovereign rights of the people; how interested the majority Party were, not in the cry that there should be no politics, not in the cry that the people should mind their business daily and not consider the questions that affected the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>At that time it was a very different cry.  That was the time when every citizen was told that if he were to be a good citizen at all he ought to consider these matters of community interest, and that it would be utter selfishness on his part if he were to confine himself to his own private business and not think of questions that affected his neighbour and the general good of the community.  It was pointed out then that these particular Articles were expressions of faith by the majority in the people, and that they were intended by the majority to link the people more closely up with the Acts of their legislature in order that each individual citizen, when the law was being considered, would take as much interest in it practically as the representatives who were the legislators; that every Act of the legislature would be carefully examined by the people in the belief that the question as to whether this was good or bad for the community might be finally referred to the people themselves to decide.  They were to be taken into partnership in the legislature; they were to be taken in on every possible measure.  It was intended to link them up so closely that the individual in the country would be getting the debates, I suppose, of the assembly in order to be able to follow with intelligent interest the various debates and topics that were being discussed in connection with the general interest. But now, having got the people into the trap, different tacties are necessary in <Col N="705" /> order to prevent the people from ever opening that trap and getting out of it. These are the tactics which are clearly revealed by the Bills which have been brought in by the present Executive. As I say, Article 47 takes away not merely the power which the Senate has of getting measures to which it is opposed, or to which a substantial section of it is opposed, referred to the people for final decision, but it takes away from this House the right that a minority has.  It further takes away the fundamental rights of the people which, as I have said, was the principal note of the present majority when they wanted the people to give them the trust which they abused, and which they really got under false pretences, as these Bills clearly show.</P>
    <P>The next matter is the deletion of Article 48.  Some members have heard something about Article 48 already, but I expect that they will hear very much more of it from the people in the country.  I have read Article 48 once or twice already.  I am going to read it again, because I want each one of the members who is responsible for defying the Constitution&mdash;for tearing it up in so far as these rights of the people are concerned&mdash;to hear it so that it may be impressed on their memory, and so that, if they have a conscience, it might have something to do with getting them to change their views with regard to this particular Article.  Now it is not merely the question on this occasion of whether a certain petition should be received here.  Something very much bigger is in question.  The question that is at issue now is, whether this Article should not be deleted altogether, and, of the two, it is the more honest thing to do than to do the dishonest thing which was done some time ago when the Constitution was ignored.  But again I say we should not do this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I quite see the point the Chair is making, but, at the same time, I think I should be allowed, since this is going to be a final act, so to speak, on this particular matter, to point out that there is a fundamental difference between what the House is asked to do now, and what it was asked to do on a previous occasion, and to stress that difference.</P>

      <P>I say that if their attitude on a former occasion was any criterion of their feelings in the matter they appeared to be very uncomfortable, indeed, and consequently I have a hope&mdash;though perhaps the past ought to show me, if I face the situation really, that it is a meagre one&mdash;that there are still amongst the majority people who were sincere when they talked about these rights of the people, who really meant what they said, and who would object to having these rights taken from the people without, as I have already said, the people themselves deliberately giving up these rights.  The essence of Article 48 is that it indicated that if the people wanted the Initiative they could have it.  Boiled down Article 48 was only to provide the machinery by which, if they wanted it, they could have it.  It was not in the discretion of this House or of the Oireachtas to deny it to them. It was deliberately cut off from the discretion of this House and deliberately cut off from the discretion of the Oireachtas to deny it.  All that was necessary was to get a certain substantial section to sign a petition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And the moment that was signed then it became the duty of the Oireachtas to carry it out.  The real purpose and intention of Article <Col N="707" /> 48 was to give the people the right to have the Initiative if they wanted it. I say that in view of the fundamental meaning of that Article the Oireachtas has no right to deprive the people of that until the people have been consulted. I say it is <i>ultra vires,</i> and that if you do it you are acting contrary to the fundamental intention of the Constitution, so far as Article 48 is concerned. That is why I was so anxious that this particular amendment should be received rather than the one that the Chair was first disposed to consider.  I believe that anyone who has any regard whatever for the provisions of the Constitution which a section of the people&mdash;a majority if you like&mdash;in good faith accepted, and on that understanding returned the majority here, that such persons, apart altogether from their views that the right of all sovereignty ought ultimately to rest in the people, should not, if they have any regard for the Constitution, remove that Article from it until the people have been consulted.  &ldquo;Article 50 of the Constitution shall be amended.&rdquo;  We had better look at Article 50.</P>
      <P>It says:</P>
      <P>Amendments of this Constitution within the terms of the Scheduled Treaty may be made by the Oireachtas, but no such amendment, passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, after the expiration of a period of eight years from the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution, shall become law, unless the same shall, after it has been passed or deemed to have been passed by the said two Houses of the Oireachtas, have been submitted to a Referendum of the people, and unless a majority of the voters on the register shall have recorded their votes on such Referendum, and either the votes of a majority of the voters on the register, or two-thirds of the votes recorded, shall have been cast in favour of such amendment.  Any such amendment may be made within the said period of eight years by way of ordinary legislation&mdash;</P>
      <P>And the significant part is to be omitted&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> and as such shall be subject to the provisions of Article 47 hereof.</P>
    <P>These Bills are amendments of the Constitution.  The Constitution provides that these amendments may be made, during a certain period, by way of ordinary legislation, and of course there should be applied to them the provisions of Article 47.  But now what are we going to have?  We have had it even when Article 47 was there, and when there was a possibility of putting these questions to the people to find out whether the people wanted them or not.  We have had some fifteen or sixteen of them passed, even whilst that power was there, because the majority depended upon the fact that the minority would not be disposed to put the people to the expense of a Referendum under Article 47 or Article 48.  A tyrannical majority has been tearing up and intends to continue tearing up every article of the Constitution which is liberal, and which gives the people a chance of bettering their conditions. When the only power that a minority have of putting a check on that majority is taken away, how many more of these liberal Articles of the Constitution may we not expect to see torn up? Some time ago Deputy Cooper&mdash;I see that he is very busy now&mdash;talked about these being frills that were attached to the Constitution.  When speaking on the Senate yesterday the thought occurred to me that it at least might be regarded very much as a frill, as one of these things that were put in simply for fashion's sake.  But this is a different sort of thing.  This goes back to the question as to whether the people are ultimately to be the sovereign rulers or not.  We never said that the people of this country were never to be the sovereign rulers.</P>

      <P>The whole intention of this, as I said at the start, is to act as a sort of valve.  There will be no pressure exerted against people if they want to give up their independence; there will be no hampering whatever if by chance there are some of the people who do not regard liberty as anything worth having, if they were prepared to give up their liberty; to become absorbed in an empire which has tried to absorb them for 700 years, but which the strength of this people has been able to resist.  But if anybody wants any movement to get the people into that empire there will be no resistance offered by the Constitution. But the moment any effort is made towards freedom by any section of the people, even if that section can hope to get a majority behind it, then that section and that majority is to be deprived of any method of constitutional action.  It is to be blocked by this Constitution, and these people will be told, &ldquo;If you want it you must not hope to get it from this Constitution, whatever way you may get it.  You may get it by force, but we have securely locked the door and have taken very good care that there will be no means, through this Constitution, by which a majority can hope to assert their freedom if they want it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the fundamental purpose of these Bills, and that is why we oppose every one of them.  We have opposed the Senate as a whole.  We do not care what powers are taken away from the Senate.  We do not want them to have any.  We do not think that they should have any power of interfering with the elected House, of referring any questions to the people, because fundamentally they are not the people's House, and are not entitled to be the people's House.  But it is a very different thing if these powers are taken away from the Dáil, a very different thing when the people themselves are going to be compelled, by this instrument, to remain in the prison house which they were induced to enter by those who used powers taken from the people as an inducement to get the people to come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of us have not been disappointed in our view as to what was going to happen when the majority <Col N="710" /> took the step that they did some years ago.  We knew that this was going to be, of necessity, the course that they would take.  We knew that the people would be tied more and more tightly, so that they would be hemmed in and prevented by any constitutional methods from getting their freedom. That was largely the reason why this Party wanted to get in here&mdash;to get inside the valve and by getting in to tear it in pieces.  Please God, the Irish people themselves will say that they are not going to be bound in a prison house by any handful of people who have deceived them and who have continued to deceive them.  The Irish people, please God, will see that this question will be put to them, and they will give no uncertain answer as to whether they want to be really free or whether they want a handful of the new dictators to rule them.  &ldquo;Twenty years of resolute government&rdquo; is the motto, apparently, that they have copied from the British, as they have copied other things from the British. That is what they had at the back of their minds all the time&mdash;twenty years of resolute government&mdash;when they were talking to the people of the rights of the people to freedom, and the rest of it.  They wanted to get into power, and there was no means of getting into power but by means of the bayonet. They knew that they had behind them the support of a foreign Power for anything that they wished to do, and they knew when they got into the seats of the mighty that with these same bayonets they would be able to prevent the people from making the progress that the people wanted to make.  They are every day fearful lest the people should at some time realise what they have done, fearful lest they should be thrown out of those seats.  And the object of getting part of the Seanad elected by a large section of the House is to take this power of deciding from the people.  These acts are simply the acts of people who are trembling in their shoes day by day, trembling in anticipation of the day when the Irish people, recovering their spirit, will say that they will not be bound by any fetters imposed upon them by England.</P>

As I have said before, there is a method of having a calm, dispassionate debate on a decision reached by the Ceann Comhairle, but that decision cannot be argued on this Bill.

If we take steps to expose their deceit or to see that they will not pass anti-democratic laws in this House, if we take steps to see that they will keep enough of their own Deputies in the House or take them away from the bar and keep them here in order to pass these laws, we know that there are limitations imposed on us by the Constitution by Standing Orders and by precedent.

      <P>We maintain that the reason for rushing through these Constitutional Amendment Bills in the way they are being rushed, and seeking to deprive the people of the exercise of the powers contained in the Constitution, is simply doing England's dirty work.  Hitherto the dirty work in Ireland has been left to the British, but a great change has resulted from the policy of the last two years.  Those are not my words, they are the words of Sir L.W. Evans: &ldquo;I for one rejoice that this task&mdash;painful, costly and bloody as it must ultimately prove&mdash;is being undertaken by those to whom it properly belongs.&rdquo;  Birkenhead: &ldquo;I would far rather that they were undertaking that task than we were.  The fact that it should be undertaken by them and not by us will have resulted in an economy of English lives.&rdquo;  For the Lord's sake, is it not time to cease doing England's dirty work and live up to what Michael Collins said, &ldquo;Freedom to achieve freedom,&rdquo; and not put barriers to stop the Irish people going forward to their freedom?  There <Col N="715" /> are some members in the back benches of Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;I shut out the front bench absolutely&mdash;we know them too damned well to make any appeals to them, but behind them on the back benches there are people who were deceived into filling those back benches, in the giving of support to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, in the belief that it meant honestly to do what Michael Collins promised he would do, and to do what they themselves said they would do, to use the powers achieved in the Treaty to win the complete freedom of the people of Ireland. Here we have to-day a deliberate statement made by Deputy de Valera that they are using these powers simply to keep our people in the prison house in which England has put them and locked the door.  We appeal to the people who put the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies in a position to do England's dirty work to make sure at the next election that they will not put them back into a similar position. These Bills are going to go through automatically.  We know that perfectly well.  The &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; has got its henchman here to do the little trick of delaying the Petition.</P>

      <P>I cannot do that under Standing Orders.  Deputy de Valera alluded to the fact that Ministers here boasted in the beginning about Article 2 of the Constitution.  They went around the country saying that under Article 2 of the Constitution they had all the powers of government, and that all authority, legislative, executive, and judicial in Ireland is derived from the people of Ireland.  But, as Deputy de Valera pointed out, they did not read the tail of it, the part of it in which the King is.  That is our grievance against the Executive Council, that they did deceive the people.  If they had come along when the Treaty came along and said: &ldquo;This Treaty abolishes the sovereignty of the people &mdash;not abolishes it, but does away with it for the time being&mdash;and if we accept this Treaty you have got to accept the King of England as your King, and pay £5,000,000 a year to England,&rdquo; if they had said those things we would not have the slightest reason for grumbling. They would then have got the votes of the people on a clear, honest issue, but instead of doing that, instead of telling all these things to the people, they got the support of the people, they got the <Col N="717" /> support of the men who fought for the Constitution on the Free State side, on the plea that the King of England was not going to be our King, that we were to be free to use all the powers and money within this country for the benefit of our own people.  They got the votes of the people, and then they fought for the Constitution without giving that explanation of it to the people and to their own soldiers.  As the President has often said, £35,000,000 was spent in the country for enforcing that Constitution.  I am not grumbling about the money so much as about the lives of the people on both sides that were sacrificed to the treachery practised by these Ministers.</P>

      <P>In Article 47 of the Constitution it is said if the people do not like the law passed by their representatives that they would have the opportunity of voting on it themselves, and in Article 48 they told the people that if their representatives did not initiate and pass the legislation they wanted them to pass, they would have the opportunity of initiating such laws or constitutional amendments as they themselves desired.  They stood for that Constitution.  They said themselves: &ldquo;This is the Constitution we are fighting for.&rdquo;  They justified the execution of Liam Mellows, Joe McKelvey, Erskine Childers, and Dick Barrett, and the other people whom they closured by saying that these were the rules that were going to govern the conduct of this country, and that these were the rules by which the people were asked to guide the Governmental business.  It has been pointed out here to-day that this was all a piece of treachery.  There is going to be no reply, I suppose, from the Ministers, or their reply will be the closure and then they will answer at the street corners.  Yesterday we wanted to discuss the other Article and the Minister, instead of having it discussed and of having some of the truth told, was jumping up every minute shouting for the closure, and, of course, behind this cry for the closure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We recognise the limitations imposed on us by the Constitution and Standing Orders.  We came here with our eyes fully opened, and we are going to do our best to keep within these limitations as long as it suits us to keep within them.  Deputy de Valera made one point which I claim the Dáil should consider very carefully before passing the Bill&mdash; namely, that this Dáil has no right to remove Article 48 until the people are consulted, and that it would be <i>ultra vires</i> for them to do so.  In Article 48 provision is made that if 75,000 voters on the register request the Oireachtas to set up machinery for the Initiative that machinery should be set up forthwith. There is in existence at the present time a petition signed by more than 75,000 voters on the register, not <Col N="719" /> more than 15,000 of whom reside in any one constituency.  Deputies saw that petition being brought into this House and being laid on these benches. It contains the names of 96,000 voters, not more than 15,000 of whom reside in any one constituency.  We went round under Article 48, which it is proposed to abolish here to-day, and asked the people to put their signatures to a petition requesting that Article 48 should be put into effect, that the machinery should be set up whereby the people could initiate legislation of their own, constitutional amendments of their own, so that if the machinery were set up we would be in a position to move constitutional amendments, and one constitutional amendment which we are very anxious to move is an amendment to abolish Article 17, which gives the King of England sovereignty in this country.  As I say, more than 75,000 people&mdash;96,000 in fact&mdash;have signed that petition, not more than 15,000 of whom reside in any one constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is proof that they did sign it. Every sheet of signatures was brought before Peace Commissioners, and the people who witnessed the signatures swore before Peace Commissioners that they had witnessed them, and that the people whose names were signed to the petition did in fact sign it.  We were very careful that illiterates would not be allowed to put their mark to the petition.  Every man who signed it knew exactly what he was doing.  They all knew that under Article 48 they had power to request the Executive Council to proceed with the setting up of machinery for the Initiative and, knowing that they had that power, they requested the Oireachtas to set up machinery so that the people could initiate constitutional amendments, and so that, in particular, one constitutional amendment which we are very desirous to see accepted would be put into law. We maintain that as long as that petition is in existence, and until it is carried into effect, until the machinery is set up as requested by the petition, the Dáil has absolutely no authority to consider the amendment of Article 48. There is at present on the Minutes of the Dáil a resolution passed by this <Col N="720" /> House to the effect that that petition should not be considered until a Select Committee considers the whole question of the inception of the Initiative and of the machinery whereby the petition could be accepted by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the House to-day at any great length.  I said all I wanted to say, I think, before moving the adjournment on the last occasion.  I have already indicated my attitude and the attitude of the Labour Party towards this Bill as set out in the amendment on the Order Paper which has been moved by Deputy O'Connell, and which, as you know, seeks to substitute certain words and asks that the Second Reading of the Bill be deferred until a Select Committee, empowered to send for persons, papers and records, has inquired into and reported upon the working of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926.  I recognise that the setting up of the Local Appointments Commission was an attempt to evolve machinery which would produce the very best results so far as local <Col N="722" /> authorities were concerned.  I agree with much of what Deputy Hennessy said on the last occasion, and at the same time I find myself in agreement with much of what has been said by Deputy Ward.  Perhaps there was too much stress laid on the religious test on the last occasion this Bill was under discussion.  Deputy Ward touched upon a certain aspect of medical appointments which, as we all know, is present in various parts of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone is the aspect to which he referred present in Ireland, but it is present very largely in other countries. As we all know, it is present very largely in England and Wales, where certain religious persuasions predominate. People do not wish, particularly the female members of a family, to be attended by a medical man who is of a different religious persuasion to that which predominates in the district.  I say this as one who has never stressed that feature before.  I think that Deputy Ward has been misunderstood, perhaps wilfully misunderstood, though I have no sympathy with Deputy Ward or his Party, none whatever.  Whilst I agree that the principle underlying the whole Bill is a very useful one, at the same time, in view of certain incidents that have occurred in the country in connection with these appointments where it could be easily proved that the best men have not been appointed, it would be well and in the interests of the Local Appointments Commission itself, that an inquiry should take place or a Commission should be set up to inquire into all that has been done up to the present and see whether, in the light of experience, this machine has produced the results it was intended to produce, because I believe the intentions behind this institution and the intentions in framing this measure were quite good.  In some cases I do know that local opinion has been outraged by some of the appointments&mdash;I do not say violently outraged, but outraged. We cannot get away from the fact that in Ireland, at any rate, local opinion has a great deal to do with the appointment of such people as medical officers or solicitors to a local authority. Whilst that is present, unless we attempt by some other means to revolutionise <Col N="723" /> our whole outlook and our whole psychology, I am afraid this institution of the Local Appointments Commissioners will not meet with that success which I feel sure the promoters had in their minds when they initiated that institution.  As I have already said, I do not want to get into conflict with the medical men.  I prefer to leave those people to fight their professional differences amongst themselves, always having in mind the possibility that I might find myself at some time on the surgeon's table with one of those fierce sawbones trying to get his own back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters which I think we need not stress, but which must be present in the minds of all of us.  There are other qualifications and other qualities desirable in a medical man in addition to having all the academic degrees that this University or any other University can confer upon him or all the postgraduate degrees which universities are able to confer on their graduates.  There are certain other qualifications, and Deputy Ward has perhaps rather bluntly, if not broadly, hinted at some of these qualifications.  I do not want to be embroiled in a discussion with these gentlemen, but I do think that that particular qualification might have been left undefined, and perhaps so much heat would not have been imported into the subsequent discussion.  I am not going to mention&mdash;this may or may not be an innovation&mdash;the poor man's son, nor am I going to talk about the plain common people of this country.  If there is one thing more than another that has been borne in upon me with all the Bills, amendments, and other things we have been discussing for the last couple of days, it is that whilst we hear such an amount of lip sympathy paid to the poor man's son and the plain common people, if the plain common people were consulted to-morrow they would tell you that they are absolutely sick of your legislation.  What the plain common people of this country desire is a rest from legislation, a rest from people who want to alter the Constitution, for the time being at any rate. <Col N="724" /> I am speaking strictly as a Constitutionalist. I was elected as a Constitutionalist, by the best constituency in Ireland.  I want to put a plain question which any plain man in Ireland would ask to-day, and it is this: what is ten, thirty, or fifty years in the life of a nation?  Could we not do some useful work for about five or six, ten or twenty or even fifty years, and give this Constitution a rest, and incidentally our own constitutions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir J. CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to take part in this debate, but I feel that I must give expression to certain opinions which I have formed.  At one time I thought it undemocratic that only one name should be sent forward to the local authorities for appointment, but I quickly changed my mind when it was pointed out to me that if three names, or even two, were sent it would entail three things which I think you, sir, mentioned in your speech&mdash; namely, that it would certainly not end the chance of bribery, it would not end the canvassing that has been going on, and certainly would end the possibility of the best man being appointed. For these three reasons I changed my mind and voted for the Act as it stands, and I intend to vote against this Bill chiefly for these reasons.  One of the reasons I did not intend to speak in this debate was because I have not an intimate knowledge of the working of the Appointments Commission, but I did know from my medical colleagues that were serving on the Selection Boards, and I did know that they were men of the highest character, so far at least as my friends were concerned, who would let no consideration weigh with them except the consideration of <Col N="725" /> merit.  I felt perfectly sure that when these men were doing this unpaid work, this thankless job, they were doing their level best to select the best candidates.</P>
      <P>I want to say, as far as the Appointments Commission is concerned, that certain doubts have arisen in my mind as to the action of the Commission.  One reason was the speech made by Deputy Ward in connection with the appointment of a matron in County Monaghan. The second was in connection with a statement made by Deputy Coburn some time ago.  After listening to these speeches I felt that all was not right with the Appointments Commission, and I feel that it is up to the President to make it quite clear to us that the names that were placed first on the list in the order of merit are sent forward to the local bodies for appointment.  It is just possible that there may be some explanation of the fact that this is not always done.  Deputy Ward has called attention to the fact that the moral character of a person should be considered as well as his other qualifications, and I admit that that is so. Statements were made from the Fianna Fáil Front Bench that unfit men were appointed, and one man in particular was mentioned who, it was said, had never been sober since the day he was appointed.  That is a serious state of affairs.  It strikes me that it is possible, where the first name has not been sent down to a local body for appointment, that the moral character of the person has not been inquired into until after his examination.  If that were so, and it was found that the moral character of the person who stood first on the list would not bear the light of day, then I say that the Appointments Commission were right in not sending forward that name.  Otherwise, I hope the President will tell us that there is no interference with the lists given to the Appointments Commission by the Selection Boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain changes that might readily be made.  I think, as was suggested to me by a Fianna Fáil Deputy, that it is right that the candidate should know what marks are allotted to each part of the examination.  For my own part, I am a very practical person, and <Col N="726" /> therefore I would give more marks to the man who could do things than the man who could write and talk about things.  The man who is only a bookworm I have not much use for.  But the man who is able to use his hands and do things in an emergency, who has practical experience, and some years practice as a house surgeon in a hospital, for instance, would stand in my regard high above any man with mere book qualifications.</P>
    <P>I have possibly greater experience of examinations than anybody in the Dáil. One of the reasons why I thought it would be no harm to send down a short panel was because I had frequently found that it is extremely hard to determine from the first three candidates in an examination who is the best man.  But there is a great difference between a man who can obtain 80 per cent. at an examination, which includes practical work and a man who obtains the minimum that the General Medical Council allow, namely, 50 per cent.  If I thought that a man who had obtained 80 per cent. was not going to get a post, and that a man who only got 50 per cent. was going to get it, I would say that that was absolutely wrong, because I maintain that we should give these positions to the ablest men.  So much was this a fact that I have advocated for years a national medical service to be entered by competitive examination. As I say, examinations are not everything that one could wish.  There are men rejected at examinations who are much better than those who get through.  That very often happens.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about this question of drunkenness.  In the past there has been unquestionably a good deal of that type of thing prevalent among dispensary doctors.  One could not find fault with them.  They were placed in a country district without much society to amuse them, or much encouragement to do any work, because there was no prospect of promotion, as there would be under the scheme that I had in my mind&mdash;namely, the grading of the various districts, so that a man could be promoted from the worst district gradually up to the best, as he gained experience and had improved his knowledge. But in the ordinary course of <Col N="727" /> events a man was sent to a poor place in the country.  He had no society, and the people were accustomed, when he went to a case and was kept up at night, to place some refreshment before him.  That was common, and it lead perhaps to the man taking a little too much drink.  As far as that is concerned, I want to say that we now have an Irish Medical Council, and if there is such a thing as men not attending to their business, or showing a laxity in morals, it is quite possible and right that complaints should be made to that body which would deal with the cases. Therefore I suggest that it is not fair for men to say that they have obtained information in confidence, and therefore are precluded from speaking about it.  It would be much better not to speak at all, or much better still to come out into the open and say that these men must be brought before the Irish Medical Council to have their case judged there.</P>
    <P>These are a few of the things I wanted to say, but I want chiefly to lay stress upon the fact that if I thought the names my colleagues who are serving on the selection boards place upon the list in order of merit were not submitted to the local authorities, I would advise my colleagues no longer to serve on these boards.  I put it as far as that.</P>
    <P>It is said there is huggermugger going on.  I do not say there is.  I heard some complaints, but very few, and I think I would have heard more complaints if they were general, with regard to medical appointments.  It is up to the President to see that, subject to the limits that I have explained, the first name on the list is sent to the local authority for appointment.  I have put a reservation on it, namely, that it is possible that the moral character of the man may have to be inquired into and if his moral character does not bear the light of day, then the second or third name would have to be sent down.  But I would object, entirely, to having, what I have been told has happened, the name of the man placed fifth on the list sent down to the local bodies.  I take that for what it is worth; I do not know whether it is true or not.  If it is true I should object to <Col N="728" /> it most strongly.  I intend to vote against this Bill for the reasons I have given.</P>

      <P>Many charges have been made by Deputies on the opposite benches against this Bill, introduced by the Fianna Fáil Party, to amend the Local Officers and Employees Act, 1926.  There were charges that it is insincere, and that it is an attempt to go back to the old days of corruption in public life in the making of appointments to the various offices under the local authorities.  The record of this Party, and the individuals composing it, many of whom have been, for a considerable time, before the public in various ways, can be examined so far as public appointments are concerned and so far as any suggestion of corruption in public life can be made.  If anybody in the House, on any side, can bring forward any suggestions of corruption, or any item relating to appointments to public offices which would suggest that there was corruption, I would be glad to hear it. I would be glad to hear it because we would hope to clear the air.  I would not be glad to hear a charge of corruption substantiated against anybody in the public life of the country, on this side of the House, or on the other side.  I hope we will not be able to prove definite corruption against anybody here in public life.  I certainly say, so far as my friends are concerned, I defy anybody to suggest that this Bill is brought in for the purpose of enabling anybody in the country to carry on corruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We stand for cleanliness, honesty and straightforwardness in public affairs, and it is because of the grave suspicions that are in our minds. relating to the appointments that have been made under the Act of 1926, that we bring in this Bill and endeavour to have a little light thrown upon the appointments that will be made in the future and a little publicity about them.  There is one safeguard in the public life of any country with regard to public affairs, and that is the light of publicity.  There may have been cases of corruption in the past; we all heard of a few cases, not many, in some parts of Ireland. Our standard of public morality is high. <Col N="729" /> Our standard is not as low as the passing of the Act of 1926 would suggest. I repudiate the suggestion that it was necessary to pass an Act taking from the public men of Ireland, of any party, the right to make appointments, because that was the suggestion, and the suggestion came from the last place and from the last person that it should come, namely, President Cosgrave&mdash; that the public men of Ireland were dishonest and corrupt.  They were not, and he ought not to have made that suggestion.  There are people, like Deputy Hennessy, who know nothing of public life from inside except what they have learned in the last few years since elected here.</P>

      <P>Yes, &ldquo;stern morality,&rdquo; to quote the Minister's words. Where the question of the whole standard of morality in public life is at stake, and where we are lectured from the other side when we bring in this Bill, and told that we are endeavouring to go back to the days when there was no high standard of public morality and honesty in the country, I hold that I am entitled to refer to this matter. I say there was no time in my recollection when there was not a decent standard of morality in the country.  That is my recollection after twenty years in public life.  I do suggest that such a lecture ought not to come from that source.  It is rather a brazen thing coming from the source from which it comes, and I think I am in order in pointing out and giving my reasons for stating that it is rather brazen and rather a piece of effrontery from that individual to lecture us on our morality when that gentleman himself was punished by the Executive Council for want of morality in connection with an important State Department.  He was definitely charged by the late Vice-President, and the charge was evidently agreed to by the majority of the Executive Council at the time and by the Government, that because of want of candour, and want of frankness and want of straight-dealing, and because of <Col N="733" /> the things that were done in the dark by the then Minister for Defence, the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health, he was called on to resign.</P>

      <P>We do not wish to introduce any Bill that would give any licence or liberty to anybody in the <Col N="734" /> country to use improper, immoral, or corrupt methods in making public appointments.  We have some confidence in the public men that will be elected after they have been elected. We, I believe, are as anxious as any individual or Party in this House to see that the standard of morality is improved and that the standard of public appointments and the standards of those who would be selected for public office be high.  We do say that the country elects those people, and these people once elected to these positions, and having the confidence of the country, are entitled to consideration in the making of these public appointments.  They are as entitled as we in Dáil Eireann, and they are more entitled than any selection board that might be nominated at the suggestion of Deputy Hennessy, by the Minister for Local Government, or anybody else to make these appointments. Deputy Hennessy dislikes the old arrangement.  He probably had not as much pull under the old arrangement as he has now.  He is probably now chief medical wangler to the Local Government Department by reason of the fact that he is a Deputy and a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.</P>

      <P>It would be killing work to take the duties of the Local Appointments Commissioners and put them on to the Civil Service Commissioners. That is offered as a serious objection to the Bill&mdash;the putting on to the Civil Service Commission of the work of the Local Appointments Commission. Our idea is that the work of the Local Appointments Commissioners would be decreased with advantage by trusting the people, trusting the elected representatives of the people of all Parties.  We know the Fianna Fáil representatives can be trusted, but we do suggest to you that the Cumann na nGaedheal representatives elected on county councils, the Labour representatives, and the Independent representatives, ratepayers or otherwise, elected on county councils, are deserving of a little trust from this House, and from President Cosgrave and his Party.  It is good enough at general election time, when elections are on for this House, to talk of the will of the people and trust the people, but when it comes to appointing a person to any office of a local authority in the country, then they are all corrupt, they are all full of bribery, they are people without honour, and they are people without honesty.

    <P>I believe you do not get the best type of official by having them nominated by a select secret little clique in Dublin, because that is what is done.  I know nothing about these Selection Committees. I met one gentleman who told me he had acted on one of these committees, and had honestly tried to do his best to select the best person.  I am sure he did.  I take it for granted all the other professional gentlemen or others who act on Selection Committees honestly do the same.  I believe they will all act honestly, but my objection to them is not that they will not honestly try to select the best person, but that all these things are done in the dark, behind backs, and nobody in the country knows whether the person best qualified is appointed or not.  You have <Col N="738" /> to take the word of the Local Appointments Commissioners for them.  I happen to know some of the Local Appointments Commissioners, and I would not take their word for anything.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey has all the good looks.  As I say, we have some belief in the morality of those who had the privilege of making public appointments, and we stand for restoring that privilege to the people, with this condition, that there should be an authority somewhere&mdash;here in Dublin, or in Cork, if it would suit the Corkmen, or any where else within the ambit of the twenty-six counties&mdash;that would examine the technical qualifications that would be required in candidates to fill any office.  We want that.  We want the public bodies safeguarded against <Col N="740" /> incompetent men or women being appointed to public office.  We are satisfied that that is a wise provision, but we are not satisfied&mdash;I for one am not satisfied at any rate&mdash;that that has been the only qualification that has been demanded from candidates for public office inside the twenty-six counties since the Public Appointments Act of 1926 came into operation.  We believe that public criticism and publicity is the corrective which will cure any corruption that may exist, and there is not much of it in Ireland, thanks be to God; there is not much of it on any side. And I say here, in front of President Cosgrave, who was in the Corporation of Dublin and who held various public appointments in Dublin for a long time, that in his public life he saw very little corruption amongst members of public bodies.  It came badly from him&mdash;he was not here when I was speaking on it before&mdash;to suggest that there was corruption rampant in all the public bodies.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the President that the mere fact of passing an Act taking entirely and absolutely out of the hands of the publicly elected representatives of the people any right to make appointments was a grave reflection on the capacity and on the honesty of these elected representatives of the people.  If it was not that, I would like to know what it was.  I read the speeches that were delivered while this Act was under discussion, and I got the impression that there was prevalent in this House, on all sides, at that time, an opinion that the public life of Ireland was full of corruption.  I repudiate that suggestion.  I do not think it ought to have been suggested by any party, whatever party they might be, that the public men of Ireland are corrupt, dishonest and inefficient.  That is a suggestion that ought not to go out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'KELLY Mr. O'KELLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  If my suggestion is wrong I withdraw it, but that was the impression left on my mind.  I will look over the debates again, and will try to give definite quotations, when an occasion offers, with regard to these suggestions of corruption.  But at any rate, from our side of the House we want to suggest&mdash;and I would be glad if the House as a whole would accept the suggestion &mdash;that the public life of Ireland is no worse in its morality than is the public life of any other country.  I repeat that I believe the standard of public life and of public morality is higher here than in most countries that I have visited, and I have visited a good many in Europe and elsewhere.  It is much higher, whether it relates to elected <Col N="743" /> members of the legislature or to elected members of local authorities.  It was a grave reflection, and I say it came badly from one who had such long experience as President Cosgrave had of the public life of the country, that such an Act was passed.  It is to restore the good name of the country, to restore confidence, as Deputy de Valera said earlier, when speaking on this Bill, in the public life of the country, and in the morality of that public life, that we introduced this Bill.  Of course, some may say, and perhaps with some reason, that it was introduced from a Party point of view.  It was, in this respect: I candidly confess that we felt that Republicans were not getting a fair do, were not getting fair play, under the present arrangement.  We know that it is most difficult to prove, because the qualifications are not made public, whether the best person is appointed or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am with President Cosgrave absolutely in wanting the best person appointed.  I do not care what that person's politics or religion is; when it is a question of a public appointment I want to have the best persons who can be got appointed.  But I am not satisfied, because we have not got the details, that that has been done, and there is no proof of it, beyond the words of gentlemen, some of whose words, as I say, I cannot accept. Fianna Fáil certainly gives way to no Party and to no individual in its desire to secure that only a person who will do the best work and give the best service should be appointed to a public office.  I agree that, as President Cosgrave said, after all the central Government have a right to have some voice in these appointments.  A good deal of money is sent down to these public bodies that helps to pay these people from the National Exchequer, and, therefore, from that point of view&mdash; and it is not the highest point of view, which is the public good&mdash;whether we pay directly or not, the central authority has a right to have some say in the matter.  We are satisfied that they shall have a say so that they could see that nobody is appointed but persons who are thoroughly qualified to be appointed <Col N="744" /> to any public office in any part of the area of Ireland over which the Free State rules.  I quite agree with Deputy Anthony that there is, perhaps, a suggestion of hypocrisy for us to be always talking about the poor man's son.  I do not want to go out of my way to drag it in, but I see a reference in a speech of the President to the poor man's son: &ldquo;What about the poor man's son?&rdquo;  Most of us in this House are poor men's sons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>He may not be.  I do not know what his wealth is.  I hope he is well off.  We want to secure, as much as anybody else in the House, that whenever a poor man's son may be qualified by his education to get an appointment no bar shall be put in his way.  But we do not believe that this Act makes it easier for a poor man's son to get an appointment than it would if amended in the way that our Bill suggests.  I cannot see that.  I am quite open to be convinced, if someone will point out to me how this Act makes it easier to give a poor man's son an appointment under a public board than would the Act if amended in the way we suggest.  After all, we have scholarships to the universities offered now under the country councils, and other kinds of scholarships, out of public moneys, to clever boys and girls of the poor and rich alike.  Of course, in most cases they are limited to people of certain means, but we have there an opportunity afforded to the poorer class of people, if they have clever boys and if they can afford to keep them at school long enough&mdash;often a difficulty arises there&mdash;for them to win scholarships. These boys or girls pass through their scholarship and university careers and get their degrees, and those who <Col N="745" /> know best the value of these young people, and those most anxious, as a general rule, in my experience at any rate, to push their own scholars along, are the local authorities.  That has been my experience in the City of Dublin.  I have no personal experience of the public bodies in the rural districts and know nothing about them beyond what I have read.  I know the City of Dublin as well as anyone, and I know public life there after twenty years' experience.  We established scholarships in Dublin seventeen years ago on my suggestion, and we were always keen on shoving forward our own brilliant boys and girls.  We were always keen on giving them a chance in preference to others who were equally qualified.  If there was an appointment open in the public service, as long as I was connected with the municipal life, and if anyone who had won a scholarship under our scheme, who had turned out a brilliant and a satisfactory person, applied, there was always a sentiment in favour of giving him a preference over anybody else, even though another person might be equally well qualified.  I would not say that we would not give a person who was as well qualified the appointment if we had one of our own scholars, but we certainly did have a sentiment in favour of our own scholars, no matter what class they came from, and, of course, they must have been from the poorer class when they got the scholarships. In my opinion, if all appointments were left under the conditions we have agreed about, that headquarters should satisfy themselves that only competent and properly qualified persons should have their names submitted to the local authorities, if appointments were left to the local authorities, in all probability the poor would have, I will not say more, but as good a chance as anyone else.  That is my belief.  In all probability they would have more, but they certainly would have at least as good a chance as any other class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell said that these appointments should be above party. I agree.  There has not been any decision of any kind in our Party on that matter.  I think I can speak for the whole Party, and say that, if we could <Col N="746" /> get agreement and that these appointments would be above party, that no one should be disqualified because of any conviction&mdash;political or religious&mdash; as long as that person was the best qualified, I certainly would work hard to have that agreed to.  In my belief, that has not been the policy.  The policy has been to knife Republicans. Possibly, Labour has come in for a share.  I do not know.  They can speak for themselves, but I know that Republicans have not got a fair do.  We ask for no more from the gentlemen who have been in control during the last five years.  They have been &ldquo;downed&rdquo; at every turn, at every chance, and that will continue to be the policy as long as this is conducted in the dark.  We would be very keen on securing justice for all parties without reference to political convictions; justice for everybody in the country in the making of these appointments. If the committee suggested by Deputy O'Connell was agreed to, an arrangement might be made by which it could be secured that all parties would be represented on the Local Appointments Commission.  If that were so, then, as long as we had our representative there, we would have to be satisfied always.  We have not a representative there.  It is like what you have in America.

      <P>They are.  There they say you are one of the &ldquo;outs&rdquo;; we are the &ldquo;ins.&rdquo;  We have the spoils of war, and will keep them.  That is open and above board.  It is not open and above board with the gentlemen here.  It is not straight.  It is not the stern morality quoted by the Minister for Local Government, who is such an authority on morality.  It is not morality, and, in my opinion, is not straight or fair dealing, and it is not getting the best type of individual into the public offices of the country.  You get people who go in with bias and who conduct their work with bias&mdash;not always, of course.  I will not say that <Col N="747" /> you do not get good men even through the Appointments Commissioners.  You do get men who work in an honest straightforward way, but you do not always get them.  Even Deputy Dr. Hennessy, I think, occasionally might get a person who would not be a 90 per cent.  Cumann na nGaedheal backer when he got in.  Very often such people have proved to be fair and straight in their dealings with the public.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell, in criticising this Bill, said it was a very bad example of legislation by reference.  As a matter of fact, there are only two Acts that had to be referred to, the 1926 Act and the Act establishing the Civil Service Commissioners.  Therefore, I do not think there is much in the Deputy's point.  The Deputy also deprecated the idea of the Fianna Fáil Party introducing this Bill to amend the Act.  Can the Deputy suggest any other way of bringing in a Bill here if it is not to be brought in by a Party or a member of a Party?  I do not know of any other mode of procedure.  If legislation has to be introduced here, in 90 per cent. of the cases it has to be introduced by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or its members, but it need not necessarily be so.  Some very unnecessary legislation has been introduced by that Party. Some Party has to introduce legislation. I wonder would Deputy O'Connell tell us how else legislation is to be introduced if it is not introduced by some Party or an individual member of a Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want to introduce this as a Party measure.  Far from it.  We believe that the Act ought to be amended on the lines outlined in this Bill.  We are not tied to every syllable in our Bill, but we are to the general principle, and we say that the Act ought to be amended on the lines indicated. If we could get agreement on the suggestion contained in Deputy O'Connell's amendment for the setting up of a Committee, we would be very happy to have legislation if it were on those lines.  I trust it would not be Party legislation, but that it would be legislation representing the views of the House as a whole and introduced for the purpose of amending the Act on <Col N="748" /> these principles for the betterment of the people as a whole, and for the purpose of securing better service than we believe is got in the public life of the country under the Act that is in operation.  We do not, as Deputy O'Connell suggests, think that this Bill is perfection.  I know the Minister for Local Government did not think it perfect. Far from it.  I would say to him that he ought not to be so anxious to charge us with bringing in imperfect Bills.  The less that he or anyone in his Department says about that the better. We have had examples recently of legislation that his Department introduced and of the cost that it brought on the country.  What about the Mutual Insurance Act?  That Act is not very long in existence, and we know now what the Courts of Justice think about it.</P>
    <P>What about the Minor Drainage Schemes Bill introduced by the Minister's Department?  That Bill has not yet got far enough to become an Act. It was introduced more than once, because of the incompetence of the Department&mdash;absolute incompetence. And, with all that, the Minister comes along and tells us how imperfect our Bill is.  I would ask him for God's sake to dry up on that score.  He has behind him a number of experts costing the country many thousands a year.  I cannot give the exact figure at the moment. He has as Secretary of his Local Government Department a gentleman who is, of course, President Cosgrave's nomination.  He must be the greatest expert in Ireland on local government.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, and I withdraw.  I say that the official head of the Department is not responsible, but the Minister is.  The Minister must accept the responsibility.  If I have said <Col N="749" /> anything about the official head of the Department, I am sorry and I withdraw it.  The Minister, with all the technical advice available for him, proposed two Bills recently that had to be withdrawn. I do not know how many thousands a year it costs the country for all this technical advice.  The Minister has in his Department technical advisers, engineering officials, inspectors and many others to give him advice.  No doubt he did get good advice from these officials, and perhaps the reason the Bill had to be withdrawn was because he did not accept the advice of the Secretary to his Department. Probably if he had done so he would not have made this blunder, and would not have had to withdraw his Bill.  In view of the fact that the Minister has all this valuable technical advice behind him he ought to be able to draft the Bills for his Department in such a way that the judges in the courts could stand over them, and would not have to sling them back contemptuously in his teeth, as they did in the last few weeks, and tell him that he did not know how to draw up Bills.</P>
      <P>We do not say that of him, but the judges did.  We would not do that.  We leave that to gentlemen who know all about morality and all about the drafting of Bills.  They are very fond of lecturing this House on this subject, but they are not so fond of it when they get a little back.  It was suggested by Deputy O'Connell that if this Bill were passed it would tie the hands of the local authorities to a much greater extent than the Act does.  I agree that it suggests to do that only in one respect, and that is in respect of appointments made under the system of competitive examination.  The Minister for Local Government objects to our suggestion that, when appointments are to be made by competitive examination, only the name of the person who gets first place in a competitive examination should be sent down to the local authorities.</P>

      <P>My belief was that the Minister suggested that.  At any rate, Deputy O'Connell suggested that we have tied the hands of the local authorities more than the Act does. That is so in regard to the appointment by competitive examination.  I would suggest it is only right and proper that the person who comes first in a competitive examination should get the appointment, provided always that there is the condition about health, morality, and things of that kind, that ought to be, and, I am sure, are a condition by the Local Appointments Commissioners before an appointment is made.  I suggest that once the local authorities agree to competitive examination you are certainly not tying their hands more than they want when you insist that once a competitive examination is held only the person who comes first in the list should be appointed. That has not been done in one case I know of.  There was an appointment made to the Town Clerkship in Enniscorthy. I do not know how many sat for the examination, but I am told that the person who was fifth on the list was appointed.  As a Deputy here says, and I believe something of the kind is true, the reason is that he was a member of the I.R.B., and certainly he was a most active C.I.D. and Intelligence officer in the Free State Army.</P>

      <P>We stand for competitive examinations where the local authorities wish them in consultation with the Minister.  We certainly do not want to take any of the powers of the Minister for Local Government from him, where his effort and that of the local authorities jointly are to secure the best possible person for an appointment, except in so far as it is suggested to be limited by the Bill, but we do not want to take from him authority over competitive examinations.  We believe competitive examinations suitable for the making of appointments, when agreed to by the Minister and the local authorities, should be held, and when held only the name of the person who gets first place in the examination should be submitted to the local authority for appointment.  The Minister for Finance, in his criticism of the Bill, said: &ldquo;It is left to the local authority to decide whether or not some method of selection other than competitive examination is to be resorted to.&rdquo;  It is not.  The Minister for Finance is entirely wrong.  It is left to the Local Appointments Commission.  It is left to the local authority in consultation with, and with the consent of the Minister, to decide whether a competitive examination may be dispensed with or may be held. It is the Local Appointments Commissioners who must issue the order.  That is what is in the Bill, and not what the Minister for Finance said the other day.  Evidently a vigorous effort was made last week by the Ministers who spoke on this Bill to throw all the mud and make all the representations possible on and around the Bill.  Section 9 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) When for the purpose of filling any post under a local authority a competitive examination is held the name of the candidate who obtained first place in such examination shall be sent by the Commissioners to such local authority for appointment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> There is a corollary to that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever a local authority or the Minister requests the Commissioners to recommend to them the names of a person or persons qualified for appointment to an office to which this Act applies and the local authority in consultation with and with the concurrence of the Minister is of opinion that having regard to the knowledge and experience necessary for the efficient performance of the duties and qualifications prescribed under this Act for that office, the person or persons to be recommended as qualified for appointment to that office cannot be satisfactorily selected by competitive examination the Commissioners with the sanction of the Minister may dispense with the competitive examination required by this Act and may select the person or persons to be recommended,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and so on.</P>
    <P>That disposes of the statement of the Minister for Finance when he says it is left to the local authority to decide whether or not some method of selection other than a competitive examination is to be resorted to.  It is left to the Local Appointments Commissioners and to the Minister for Local Government in consultation with the local authority.  The Minister for Finance also said: &ldquo;It is provided that there is to be no choice; the local authority is to have no choice if there is to be a competitive examination.&rdquo; Perhaps I was wrong in suggesting that it was the Minister for Local Government who objected to a competitive examination&mdash;who objected to the fact that there was no choice where there was competitive examination.  If so, I am sorry.  But the Minister for Finance certainly did.  The Minister for Finance went on to say: &ldquo;I do not see why there is to be no choice in the case of competitive examination, and there must be choice by the local authority in the case of competitive examination.&rdquo;  I can understand, in view of the past experience, in view of the case in Enniscorthy which I have mentioned, why the Minister for Finance, and, perhaps, his colleagues, <Col N="753" /> do not want the person who gets first past the post in a competitive examination appointed, and do not want an Act amended and passed by this House so rigid that only the best person could be appointed.  In the Enniscorthy case the fifth on the list was appointed and I do not know how many candidates there were.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'KELLY Mr. O'KELLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, there is to be no choice when there is competitive examination.  Competitive selection? That is something new.  We do not know the term.  When there is competitive examination anybody can get a copy of the examination paper, with the marks set out that are allotted to each question on the paper.  Every candidate gets that in the case of competitive examinations, and knows where he is. Have we got that, or has the public got it in this so-called competitive selection? We know nothing about it.  The Minister for Finance says: &ldquo;I have been informed, and I believe it is true, that medical men who have some experience and who contemplate going forward for local vacancies have been taking out post-graduate courses and doing everything towards improving their qualifications, in the knowledge and belief that they would improve their chances of appointment.  This Bill would stop all that work that has been going on.&rdquo;  How, in the name of <Col N="754" /> heaven, would it stop it?  Our object, and the object of the Bill, and I do not think that anyone could suggest that there is any other object, is to get the best person appointed, and, in order to get that, we agree that there should be a bóard to examine the qualifications.</P>
      <P>If anybody wishes to spend a greater amount of time than that spent by the ordinary man who barely qualifies, and spends it in getting additional experience and additional qualifications by means of post-graduate courses or anything else, we take it that all these additional qualifications will be taken into account by the technical heads of the Selection Board and the Local Appointments Commissioners.  They will be taken into account as being additional qualifications, and any body, Selection Board or Local Appointments Commissioners, or even a local authority, would take into consideration in making an appointment any additional qualifications that would be possessed by candidates.  Members of local bodies are not so stupid.  Many members of this House are members of county councils, boards of health, and other bodies.  Do they lose all capacity, all honesty, all idea of selecting good, straight, competent officials when they leave this House and sit on their county councils and boards of health?</P>

      <P>I think you are right. The Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;An official of the Local Appointments Commissioners, their Secretary, is present at the meetings of the Selection Board, and if there was any trickery being done by the Selection Board, the Local Appointments Commissioners have the means of checking and countering that.&rdquo; Does he think that is a safeguard?  Is he so innocent as to offer that as a safeguard against jobbery, corruption, and trickery?  I, for one, am not prepared to accept it.  I say that these things that are being done in the dark by the Local Appointments Commissioners certainly give rise to suspicion.  As the late Minister for Justice said in 1924, in reference to other things done in the dark, they gave rise to grave suspicions. They give rise to suspicion in our minds that may not be always justified.  That is what he said about certain things done in the dark in 1924.  There is grave suspicion abroad in the country, and we would have these suspicions wiped away under this Bill.  I would like for the honour and the good name of the country that there should be no suspicion attached to the making of any appointment.  I do not care who has to make them.  We should get rid of that suspicion that exists.  You may say that it should not exist, but it does exist, and it exists because the Appointments Commissioners are the nominees of a Party and have the partisan in their actions.  Unless you can disabuse the minds of the public of that suspicion and reconstitute that Commission or set up first of all a Committee to examine into the appointments and then re-organise that Commission, suspicion will still continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;The check that Deputy de Valera seems to seek exists already.  It exists in a form which has no harm in it, but which undoubtedly gives confidence.&rdquo;  I wonder to whom it gives confidence?  It gives confidence, if you like, to numbers of those in the country who have implicit confidence in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, but not to anybody else.  It is, I think, not good for the country, and I suggest to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party that it is not good for the country.  I suggest in all seriousness it would be wiser if you <Col N="758" /> had Local Appointments Commissioners who would have the confidence of all parties, Fianna Fáil included, for after all Fianna Fáil represent something in the country.  They represent a fair number of the electorate in the country, and they are entitled to that consideration.  That consideration they have not got in the past, and are not likely to get under the present Constitution of the Local Appointments Commission.</P>

      <P>You will have the Press present to criticise, and the majority of the Press of the country supports the views of Deputy Hennessy. You will have these pressmen present, and if members of Fianna Fáil are guilty of corruption, I hope the Press will rub it in.  I hope the Press will expose them, and I hope it will equally expose the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or any other party who are guilty of nepotism, the same nepotism that Deputy Hennessy's friends and their families were guilty of.  If they are guilty of nepotism at the expense of the country.  I hope all these acts&mdash;acts that are not to the benefit of the country&mdash;will get the full light of day thrown on them.  You <Col N="759" /> would then soon end them, and you would soon end that type of public representative. We intend to try to get our friends elected on the various local bodies throughout the country.  We have announced that fact.  We did not act the hypocrite, and say: &ldquo;No; we are going to keep politics out of the local boards of the country.&rdquo;  You might as well try to keep the blood from flowing through the veins of a live man, through the veins of Deputy Hennessy, and think that he should live, as to prevent politics flowing into the public life of the country and into public boards.  You cannot do it, and why should you try?</P>

      <P>He suggested that it was venal and improper for us to seek to get elected or to get those who are believers in the Fianna Fáil policy elected on public boards&mdash;that it was something improper and that we are getting them elected for venal purposes. That is a suggestion that should be answered, with all respect.  I hope they will get elected, and I would not like, if I had the power to-morrow, to interfere with public boards or to prevent them from discussing politics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'KELLY Mr. O'KELLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it is not for venal purposes.  I suggest that those who seek to get on public boards in the country are people who are fairly well educated politically.  Those of any political party in the country who seek to get elected on public boards, whether they like it or not, would, owing to the publicity that shines upon them there, have to act in the best interests of the <Col N="760" /> public and appoint the best people.  I do not see why all political parties, as long as people do take an interest in politics, should not seek election to public boards.  There is nothing improper about it, and there is no reason why politics should not be discussed there. If I am wandering from the subject, I am sorry.  &ldquo;If this Bill is passed by any chance,&rdquo; Deputy Hennessy said, &ldquo;the whole thing will lead to suspicion. In fact, when a candidate who deserved No. 1 place is not elected, that candidate will possibly think, if the description fits his case, that his misfortune was that his politics were those of President Cosgrave or his religion that of Robert Emmet or Wolfe Tone.&rdquo;  I do not want politics brought into these public appointments.  Neither does our Party, and our suggestion is that, because of the very reason that Deputy Hennessy suggests, suspicion does exist. That suspicion does exist, we believe, in the country.  We have evidence of it. Deputy Hennessy said that this Act when introduced as a Bill was one of the most popular Acts ever passed.  I would refer him to the number of resolutions passed by responsible and important bodies in the country denouncing it.  I have a list of them here. I will not bother reading them, but if he cares to look through the Press, as I have done, and to make a list of all the public bodies who have passed resolutions&mdash;I do not suggest they were unanimous resolutions&mdash;he will find there have been resolutions passed by majorities, sometimes big majorities, denouncing the Act.  If that is so, it cannot be the wonderfully popular measure that Deputy Hennessy suggested it was.</P>

      <P>You have in this case a very definite resolution on one point alone.  You have one issue put before a public Board and they passed a resolution on it.  At an election there <Col N="761" /> are a hundred different questions on the programme.  Here a definite resolution on a particular subject was passed by a long list of public bodies.  There was one resolution passed against one phase of the Act by such an important body as the Co. Council's General Council, and it cannot be suggested that that is a Fianna Fáil or Republican body&mdash;it is a fairly representative body, at any rate.</P>

      <P>You have not read it; read it again.  The Bill itself came in for a good deal of criticism, and that is all to the good&mdash;the more the better. The same, I suppose, applies to any Bill introduced here.  The more honest criticism they get the better the result will be.  I am glad that those who sponsored this Bill have had the privilege of listening to a good deal of criticism, and I hope that we will hear more, provided the result will be an honest effort to do something that will be better for the country; something that will give the country confidence in the men who conduct its affairs locally; something that will improve the standard of public morality&mdash;if it needs improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that Section 3 of the Bill sought to amend a section of the Act that was very explicit, and to amend it to such an effect as to make it ambiguous and not easily understood. Section 2 (1) of the Act states: &ldquo;In this Act the expression `office,' to which this Act applies, means and includes (a) the chief executive office under every local authority.&rdquo;  This Bill seeks to indicate what such offices are.  All the chief executive offices are not set out.  Perhaps it would have been better if they had been, but a number of them are, indicating the offices to which this Bill is meant to apply.  It would have been, perhaps, more thorough if they had all been set out, but the suggestion made that because certain offices are not mentioned in the Bill they are therefore outside the scope of the Act is without foundation, <Col N="762" /> because there still remains in the Act Section 2, paragraphs (b) and (c). Paragraph (c) says: &ldquo;All such other offices and employments under a local authority as the Minister shall from time to time, with the concurrence of the Commissioners, declare to be offices to which this Act applies.&rdquo; We suggest that that covers anything that might be omitted from the Bill. Therefore there is no foundation for the suggestion that the Bill is not as clear as the principal Act.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of discussion about the suggestion that we made that in these appointments such a thing as local knowledge and experience should be taken into account.  The President told us that that was taken into account. I am glad to hear it, but until I heard it from the President I did not know that there was any account taken of local knowledge and experience. There is a demand in the country, whether it be right or wrong, that at any rate, where possible, all things being equal, persons with local knowledge should be appointed, especially where medical officers are concerned. That may be a thing that this House ought not to accede to, but that is a matter for discussion.  My own opinion is that where you can get a doctor highly qualified, and who is passed by the Appointments Commission as thoroughly qualified to occupy the post, and who is known to the people and knows the people, you will get better service from him than from a stranger going amongst them.  They have confidence in their own and they will take, at any rate, such a thing as medical service from a man of their own, and they will have more confidence in him and will give him their minds and their story, medical or otherwise, with greater freedom than to a stranger. That is my belief, and it seems to be an idea that is fairly widespread, because there is a strong demand for men with local knowledge.  If we put in the Bill that account should be taken of the possession of local knowledge and experience by a person going for any office, we did something that the President agreed is right and proper and that ought to be taken into account, <Col N="763" /> but which does not appear in his Act, or at any rate which a great number here did not know existed.  We did not know that the Selection Boards or the Appointments Commission in making selections did take account of local knowledge and experience, and we are <Col N="764" /> glad to know it, but it emphasises the fact that these appointments are made in the dark and under conditions which the majority of the people do not know.</P>
