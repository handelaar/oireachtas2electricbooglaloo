      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state the number of shipping companies engaged in the cross-Channel trade that are registered in the Irish Free State, and the total amount of income tax paid into the Free State Exchequer for the years 1926-27 and 1927-28 by these companies; also the total amount of income tax, if any, paid to the Free State by shipping companies registered in other countries.</P>

      <P>It is understood from the Department of Industry and Commerce that the number of shipping companies engaged in cross-Channel trade that are registered in the Saorstát is seven. The other figures asked for by the Deputy cannot be given without obtaining reports from the various inspectors of taxes throughout the country. These figures would take some time to obtain, and the result would be incommensurate with the labour and expense involved.  It may be taken, however, that the amount of income tax paid directly to the Saorstát Exchequer by the shipping companies generally is trivial. Under the provisions of the 1926 agreement with Great Britain for relief in respect of double income tax a company is deemed to be resident where it is managed and controlled, and pays tax only in that one of the two countries in which it is resident for the purposes of the agreement.  The more important of the shipping companies <Col N="162" /> registered in the Saorstát, and probably all of the cross-Channel shipping companies registered in Great Britain, are managed and controlled in England or Scotland.  We get no income tax directly from these companies, but of course we get income tax in full from all shareholders resident in the Saorstát and not resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland in respect of their dividends from these companies, just as we get full tax on their dividends from all British investments.</P>

      <P>As far as unemployment goes, that is a matter for the making of representations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. So far as relief goes, it is a matter for the Dublin Commissioners.  As far as the Department of Local Government and public Health is concerned I want to say that the last grant from the Road Fund to the City Commissioners was notified in April last.  That was approximately £20,000, and I expect that before the end of this month there will be considerable employment given as a result of the going ahead of work under that grant.</P>

      <P>I move for permission to introduce a Bill entitled &ldquo;an Act to amend the Constitution by deleting the provisions now contained therein as to the persons entitled to <Col N="167" /> vote at elections of members of Seanad Eireann and by providing in lieu thereof that at such elections the electors shall be the members of Dáil Eireann and the members of Seanad Eireann voting together and by making consequential amendments as to the mode of voting at such elections.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>My statement will be very brief.  As you know, it is unusual to oppose the First Readings of Bills, because it is usual to give permission to allow Bills to be introduced and printed.  But this Bill contains in the Title, as set out here, the main principle of the measure, and it is because it proposes to alter the method of voting at Seanad elections, to take from the people the right which they now have, and vest that right in the members of the Dáil and Seanad, that I am proposing to vote against this Bill.  I know it has been founded on a Report of the Joint Committee, a Majority Report of the Joint Committee which sat and went into this question.  I was not surprised to see the Government supporters, the members of the Government Party, objecting to this particular method of electing a Seanad; but I must express surprise that the proposal was supported by members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not wish to go into this matter in detail at this stage.  I simply mention that I will contest at every stage of this Bill the proposal to deprive the people of the right to select members of the Second Chamber by direct vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>We also have decided to contest every one of these Bills from the start to the finish.  We are opposed to the first Bill on grounds slightly different from those which the <Col N="168" /> leader of the Labour Party has put forward. We object to it on the ground that it includes the members of the Seanad with the members of the Dáil in this election, and also because, although we were members of that Committee, we indicated at the start that we think the time has come when the Seanad should be abolished altogether. We see no good purpose served by that body.  We believe it is an expensive body, and we believe also that it was used, and is going to be used, simply to enthrone privilege in this country.  We believe in equal rights, in the same rights being accorded to every citizen; but we are against any attempt to enthrone privilege of any kind here.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from its merits or demerits, this is one of a set containing a proposal to remove Article 48 from the Constitution.  It means, as far as we are concerned anyhow, that a certain accommodation which we were prepared to give to the Executive up to the present will be withdrawn henceforth, and we intend to contest every one of the steps taken in legislation from this on.  We believe this is a disgraceful attempt, particularly in view of Deputy Thrift's motion which was passed here, to deprive the people of a right which they were led to believe by those who supported the Treaty and Constitution was their right and would remain their right.  I do not wish to say anything further at this stage except that we intend opposing as strongly as we can each of these Bills and preventing, in so far as we can, their passage through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Deputy O'Connell objected only to Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Bill, the Bill which is now before the House. The Deputy was at some pains to explain the reasons why he was against the measure.  I observed a reluctance on his part to go into our experiences in connection with the election which took place some three years ago for 19 members of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>There is no similarity between the two.  You have a constituency election in one case and <Col N="170" /> the whole country in the other case, and the principle of having a Second Chamber formed on the basis of a First Chamber would not be in accordance with the regulations governing any Second Chamber almost in any country.  To maintain the present position considerable expense is entailed in making up the register; considerable expense is entailed in the election itself; and the presentation of 50, 60, 70 and, possibly, 200 names in about six years' time, to the electorate for their selection was beyond, I think, the contemplation of the framers of the Constitution.  That is the Deputy's case.  The Deputy is standing for a 23 per cent. vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move for leave to introduce a Bill entitled</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An Act to amend the Constitution by reducing the term of office of members of Seanad Eireann hereafter elected and making consequential alterations in regard to the proportion of the members of Seanad Eireann to be elected every three years and in regard to other matters and making special consequential provision in respect of the proportion of such members to be elected at the election held to fill the places of members of Seanad Eireann who are due to retire in the year 1928 and in respect of the term of office of the members elected at such election.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the Bill.  I notice that it is entitled &ldquo;An Act to amend the Constitution by reducing the term of office of members of Seanad Eireann hereafter elected and making consequential alterations in regard to the proportion of the members of Seanad Eireann to be elected every three years and in regard to other matters and making special consequential provision in respect of the proportion of such members to be elected at the election held to fill the places of members of Seanad Eireann who are due to retire in the year 1928 and in respect of the term of office of the members elected at such election.&rdquo;  It is obvious that the Bill proposes to alter certain sections of the Constitution which deal with the term of office of members of Seanad Eireann and to make other consequential amendments arising therefrom. In order that Deputies may understand the purpose of the Bill and the nature of the objections to it, perhaps it would be no harm if I refer to the sections of the Constitution which it is proposed to amend.  Article 31 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The number of members of Seanad Eireann shall be sixty.  A citizen to be eligible for membership of Seanad Eireann must be a person eligible to become a member of Dáil Eireann, and must have reached the age of 35 years.  Subject to any provision for the constitution of the first Seanad Eireann the term of office of a member of Seanad Eireann shall be twelve years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Constitution (Amendment No. 1) Act, No. 30 of 1925, provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution shall be and is hereby amended by the insertion <Col N="173" /> therein of the following Article immediately after the Article 31 now contained therein, that is to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;31 A.&mdash;The duration of the term of office of a member of the first Seanad Eireann shall be reckoned from the beginning of the day on which this Constitution comes into operation, and the duration of the term of office of a member of Seanad Eireann elected under Article 32 of this Constitution shall be reckoned from the beginning of the appropriate triennial anniversary of that day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Article 32 of the Constitution will also be amended by the passing of this Bill. Article 32 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One-fourth of the members of Seanad Eireann shall be elected every three years from a panel constituted as hereinafter mentioned at an election at which the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) shall form one electoral area and the elections shall be held on principles of proportional representation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Constitution (Amendment No. 1) Act, No. 30 of 1925, provides that:</P>
    <P>The Constitution shall be and is hereby amended by the insertion therein of the following Article, immediately after the Article 32 now contained therein, that is to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;32 A. An election of members of Seanad Eireann under Article 32 of this Constitution may be held at any time not more than three months before nor more than three months after the conclusion of the period of three years mentioned in that Article.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A person who, after the day appointed by law for the completion of the formation of the panel of candidates and before the conclusion of the three years' period running on that day, is chosen under Article 34 of this Constitution to fill a vacancy caused by the death, resignation, or <Col N="174" /> disqualification of a member of Seanad Eireann (other than a member about to retire at the conclusion of the said period) shall hold office until the conclusion of the next three years period and shall then retire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These, I think, are the Articles of the Constitution which it is proposed to amend by this Constitution (Amendment No. 7) Bill of 1928.  The Constitution, of course, has the force of law in this State in consequence of the passing of the Constitution Act.  In order that members might be familiar with the terms of the Act it might be no harm to read it.</P>

      <P Just="Center">PASSING OF BILLS.</P>
      <P Just="Center">FIRST STAGE.</P>
      <P>When a Bill is to be initiated in the Dáil the title of Bill and a short description of its purpose, prepared by the proposer, and accepted by the Ceann Comhairle, shall appear on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>The description of its purpose is contained in the long title now on the Order Paper in this particular case.</P>
      <P>The Deputy giving notice shall move for leave to introduce the Bill. If such motion be opposed, the Ceann Comhairle, after permitting an explanatory statement from the Deputy who moves, and a statement from the Deputy who opposes the motion may, if he thinks fit, put the question thereon.  If leave to introduce the Bill be given an Order shall be made for its Second Reading and the Bill shall be printed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, therefore, on this stage is that the Deputy opposing the motion for leave to introduce the Bill is allowed to make an explanatory statement. <Col N="175" /> I allowed in the last case, in my discretion, a statement from Deputy O'Connell, and another from Deputy de Valera.  In this case I am allowing a statement from Deputy Lemass, but it is an explanatory statement, and I think the reading of the Constitution Act is not necessary to the explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a Bill designed to amend the Constitution which has the force of law in consequence of the passing of the Constitution Act.  I would propose to read the whole Constitution, but I suppose it would be ruled out.  I thought perhaps some Deputies would like to have a last look at it before it is finally consumed.  The Constitution, of course, occupies a very large number of pages in this Book and it would take a long time to read it.  I think, in view of the fact that the sections of the Constitution which are referred to and which will be amended by this Bill have no force in this country except in consequence of the Constitution Act, that I would be quite in order in reading the Act to show the purpose the Dáil had in mind when they enacted it.  The Act states&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill in any case intends, in the first instance, to reduce the term of office of members of the Seanad.  The Government could have taken various courses of action in relation to the term of office of members of the Seanad.  They could have left <Col N="176" /> it as it was; they could have increased it; they could have abolished it; and they could do, as they are now proposing, reduce it.  It is the opinion of Deputies on this side of the House that any Bill to amend the sections of the Constitution which I have just read out, and which, if necessary, I shall read again, should be a Bill to end the Seanad, not by reducing the term of office of the members, but by abolishing the office of the members.  Of course, I can see that a strong case could be made out for making the members of the Seanad life members, letting them get fossilised.  Personally, I think, that the best course the Government could have taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Both.  As regards the first part of the Bill, we on this side of the House intend to oppose it at every Stage because it merely proposes to reduce the term of office of the members and not to abolish the office of members of the Seanad altogether. It then proposes to make certain consequential alterations in regard to the proportion of the members of Seanad Eireann to be elected for three years.  Again, of course, various lines of action were open to the Government in that connection.  They could have, as I suggested already, allowed the Seanad to go on, like the brook, for ever, or decided that the entire membership should be compelled to seek election every three years.  If the entire membership were compelled to seek election every three years, perhaps the competition for membership of that body would not be so keen.  If the competition was not so keen, it is quite possible that the nature of the body would be more quickly revealed to the public, and, therefore, the demand for its abolition and the consequent economy would be much stronger.  But when you elect members for a period of, I think it is. nine years, there is a strong inducement to people who are past their period of utility in public life to seek refuge in the Seanad, where they will be protected from any discontent on <Col N="177" /> the part of their supporters for a period of nine years.  The next portion of the Bill, however,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will remember that the Bill is not before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>No; but the title or the explanatory statement concerning it states:</P>
      <P>and making special consequential provision in respect of the proportion of such members to be elected at the election held to fill the places of members of Seanad Eireann who are due to retire in the year 1928.</P>
      <P>It appears that a number of members of the Seanad are due to retire this year, and the purpose of the Bill is to make special consequential provision in respect of the proportion of members due to retire this year, and in respect of the term of office of the members elected at such election.  Some nineteen or twenty members&mdash;I am not quite sure of the number, as I take no interest in the body&mdash;are due to seek election this year.  The Government propose, in the first part of the Bill, which has just been read a first time, to abolish the principle of popular vote for the Seanad and to embark upon a new principle.  It is, of course, therefore much more likely that the members due to retire this year will be able to recapture their office, because whatever the people of the country might do, they certainly would not, I think, re-elect the majority of them. This Bill is, of course, drafted in consequence of the Report of a Joint Committee on the Constitution of the Seanad which was set up some time ago.  I presume I will be in order in reading that Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The Deputy can read all that on the Second Stage of this Bill, if it is read a first time now.  If it is not read a first time, then there will be no necessity for taking up the time of the House in discussing the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a possibility, as I notice the numbers of the Government followers present are small, that we may prevent the Bill getting a First <Col N="178" /> Reading, even as we might not be successful in preventing it getting a Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy succeeds in preventing the Bill getting its First Reading, the question he is now discussing need not be discussed at all.  The Deputy does not want to give the Bill a First Reading. Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  Would I be in order in explaining to the House why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so far as the Deputy has gone he has had a fair chance of giving an explanation. He has even succeeded in making a certain amount of comment upon Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Bill, which has been introduced, and I think his explanation on Constitution (Amendment No. 7) Bill is due for an early conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee set up by the Dáil against the opposition of the members on this side to consider the powers and constitution of the Seanad carried, I noticed, the majority of their recommendations by small majorities.  Perhaps if we were to suggest to the Government that a course of action which did not apparently occur to the Committee might be taken, they would be prepared at this stage to withdraw this Bill and redraft it.  It is for that purpose I thought it would be desirable to read the Report and indicate exactly the points on which I disagree with the Report in the matters dealt with in this Bill.  In view of the fact that the Ceann Comhairle seems to think otherwise, we would be prepared perhaps to let this Bill go now in the hope that it will be defeated and reserve anything further we have to say in this connection for the other Bills upon the Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, so far as this Bill is concerned, and so far as I can gather from the long title, it proposes to shorten the period of the term of office in the Seanad, and, therefore, I shall vote for the First Reading.  As far as I know, that was agreed upon by the Joint Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the rather uncomplimentary references of Deputy Lemass to the measure, it is really very harmless.  It proposes that in future the term of office for which Senators will be elected will be nine years only.  The other consequential amendments are with a view to ensuring that by reason of the fact that some twenty members are not due to go out, and consequently not due to be returned, <Col N="180" /> provision is made for such a shorter term of office in respect of any number over fifteen that will be elected on this occasion to make in future certain that at each triennial election twenty members of the Seanad will be elected and that their term of office will be nine years.</P>

The rélevant words of the Standing Order, as I see them, are: &ldquo;If such motion be opposed, the Ceann Comhairle, after permitting an explanatory statement from the Deputy who moves, and a statement from a Deputy&rdquo;&mdash;it may be explanatory, contradictory, or otherwise&mdash;&ldquo;who opposes the motion, may, if he thinks fit, put the question thereon.&rdquo;  It would seem to me, as I said before, that under that Standing Order the Deputy who opposes the motion that the Bill be read a First Time is at liberty to address himself to any particular aspect of the motion which appeals to him, to discuss the general principle as to whether the introduction of a measure of that kind at this stage is advisable, and then, if necessary, to discuss the particular principle contained in the measure.</P>

      <P>The use of the word &ldquo;statement&rdquo; in this Standing Order appears to me clearly to indicate that on a motion for leave to introduce a Bill a wide debate upon the merits of the proposal which may be contained in the Bill is not to be allowed, but that there are to be at least two statements, one from the proposer of the Bill and the other from a Deputy opposing the motion.  The word &ldquo;statement&rdquo; is used advisedly in the Standing Order, and has always been construed to preclude a general debate.  The concluding words of the sentence of the Standing Order are: &ldquo;If such motion be opposed, the Ceann Comhairle, after permitting an explanatory statement from the Deputy who moves, and a statement from a Deputy who opposes the motion, may, if he thinks fit, put the question thereon.&rdquo; The Ceann Comhairle is, by the Standing Order, I think, coerced into allowing a statement from the mover of the motion, and a statement&mdash;and there I think it is restrictive in itself&mdash;from a Deputy opposing the motion, and then he has a discretion to put the question immediately, without any further statement. This evening I have exercised my discretion to allow more than one statement in each case, but in reply to Deputy MacEntee's point of order, the Chair is prepared to construe the word &ldquo;statement&rdquo; as being restrictive and as not allowing a debate.</P>

      <P>I submit that the Standing Order does, in fact, do a certain thing, that it limits one man definitely, within restricted and segregatory limits, and apparently deliberately avoids limiting another within these limits, and we must assume that the intentions of those who framed that Standing Order was to do precisely what they did.</P>

A statement may mean a speech, a long speech, a speech extending over hours.  There is no limit as to time in regard to a statement, nor is there any limit in matter in regard to a statement.  I feel that the ruling which you gave in the case of the preceding amendment is one which may have very serious consequences in so far as it sets up a precedent here.</P>

      <P>The precedent has already been set up.  The position about the Standing Orders is that they are construed by the Ceann Comhairle.

      <P>These Standing Orders are here, and the Ceann Comhairle, or the occupant of the Chair, whoever he may be, is here to construe the Standing Orders. Necessarily from time to time the Chair is bound to disagree with the view put forward by a Deputy as to what a particular Standing Order means.  In this particular instance the Standing Order is construed in the way it has been previously construed, and which seems to the Chair to be its only meaning.  The Ceann Comhairle is the sole judge of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I accept your ruling.  The point now is the wisdom of permitting a Bill of this description to be read a First Time. In connection with that I should direct Deputies' attention to the number of Constitutional changes which have taken place, their great rapidity, and, I am sorry to say, altogether in the interests of one particular Party, within the last four or five years.  The Constitution in a normal State is the fundamental Statute which regulates the relations between the Government and the citizens.  Quite obviously it is not a Statute which should be lightly or frequently changed.  In this particular instance I would suggest that the Government should deal very charily with the Constitution.  Their past record forbids them changing it. They fought a war to maintain it. There were considerable sacrifices made to secure a change in the Constitution on the one hand, and to maintain it unchanged, on the other hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that, possibly, I am restricted, but the point I would like the House to consider in dealing with this particular Bill is this: that the Constitution under President Cosgrave's manipulation of it has assumed more of the form of a kaleidescope than a Constitution. From day to day the pattern changes, and now we are going to have a new pattern.  This House, which formerly was urged to choose Senators upon grounds of personal merit and special qualification, is going to be forced to choose between the principles of senility and puerility as a qualification for election.  The particular form in which the Seanad was to be constituted and the particular age of Senators was, I submit, not one lightly decided on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>What about your leader now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>For months a Constitutional Committee sat on this matter and agreed that a certain age limit should be laid down.  I presume that in fixing that age limit they balanced, on the one hand the impetuosity of youth, and on the other hand the experience of age, and they decided that this was a happy mean.  That, of course, was the attitude of the Party on the Government side of the House.  Our attitude is quite a different one.  We do not wish the Seanad to be there.  We are quite prepared to take off the break that age imposes on legislators and to let a Seanad of juveniles, if you like, rush to destruction.  I am appealing not to members on this side, whose opposition to the Seanad is well known and whose desire, if you like, is to destroy it; I am appealing to the members of the Government side of the House, who desire to maintain the Seanad, and I ask them: Is it right to support the First Reading of a Bill which proposes by reducing the age limit for the Seanad, to make it, as I said before, less an object of reverence, wonder, and esteem, less an assembly of reverend grey-beards on the one hand, and more an assembly of schoolboys on the other hand?  As I said, let us remember that this particular clause in the Constitution is one of the few important clauses <Col N="186" /> in it which, up to this, the Government have refrained from altering or amending. This important clause in the Constitution was inserted after a Constitutional Committee, composed, I believe, of some of the most able and astute intellects at the disposal of the Provisional Government of that day, framed it in order to provide certain safeguards for this State.  It is well known that the late President Griffith and the late General Michael Collins took a keen interest in the work of that Constitutional Committee.  I believe that every line in the Constitution was considered and revised by them, and I think it is a very ill-advised thing that those who espoused and followed the policy of Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins should at this day, without any real justification, come along and propose now to tear up their handiwork.  I cannot see what good purpose is going to be served by introducing an amendment of this sort.  The President refers me to Deputy de Valera.  Well, as I said before, our attitude towards the Seanad is not a friendly one.  We are not at all disposed to alter or amend it, because we do not believe that it can be altered or amended to the abiding advantage of this people.  Every attempt to alter or amend the Constitution of the Seanad&mdash;not by any of the amendments on the Order Paper&mdash;but particularly any attempt to extend its powers, or in any way to make it a more active agent in the Government of this country, will be opposed, and should be opposed by us.  I do not propose to detain the House very much longer.  I do not see that it is a fair thing that we should be asked to make this alteration.</P>
      <P>I may draw the President's attention to the fact that this is a Bill entitled &ldquo;An Act to amend the Constitution,&rdquo; by altering the age of eligibility for membership of Seanad Eireann.  On the other hand that may possibly mean that the President in view of his known antipathy to any suggestions which emanated from this side of the House, may be possibly disposed to increase the age.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It may be of <Col N="187" /> course, that he may have a more subtle method of securing more or less the same object, which I believe is virtually to destroy the Constitution.  I think he might have a more subtle way of doing it and that is by reducing the age limit for the Seanad down beyond, if you like, the legal majority.  I feel, of course, that he could possibly do that without very good grounds but, up to this the Seanad has not performed any very useful function in this country.  I think the original purpose of it was to act as a revisory body in ensuring that in all political matters which interfered particularly, I should say, with the liberty of the subject, or with the rights of citizens, it would hold up legislation and by use of the power conferred upon it by Article 47 of the Constitution secure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There were certain occasions when by exercising rights under Article 47 it could have secured a referendum of the people upon certain contentious matters.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move for leave to introduce a Bill &ldquo;entitled an Act to amend the Constitution by deleting the provisions now contained therein as to the formation of a panel for the purpose of the election of members of Seanad Eireann and by providing in lieu thereof that the formation of such panel shall be regulated by law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the Constitution stands, every outgoing Senator and every ex-Senator has the right of nomination on the panel.  The Seanad has the right to nominate one-third of the panel, and the Dáil has the right to nominate two-thirds. The panel consists of three times the number of candidates who are to be elected.  Within a few years' time, if Providence is good to the outgoing Senators and ex-Senators, we might, if the present system continued to operate, have a panel of 200 names on the list.  On the last occasion when an election took place 67 names were on the panel.  This particular constitutional amendment proposes to have a panel regulated according to law.  The intention is that 20 names should be selected by the Seanad and 20 names selected by the Dáil, and that outgoing Senators or ex-Senators will not have the right to put their names on the panel.  Formerly they had that right by acquainting the President of the Executive Council, and their names automatically went on.  The reason it is not considered advisable to apply that principle now is that if the Dáil or the Seanad will not support an outgoing Senator's name it is obviously useless to have his name on the panel for election.  The proposal of the Committee was that a nominating college should be set up.  I gave careful consideration to that matter, and it was also considered by the Executive Council. I am not satisfied that the term &ldquo;nominating college&rdquo; is an attractive one, but the suggestion is practicable, and, therefore, it is proposed to regulate the formation of a panel by law in the way I have indicated.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the word &ldquo;explanatory&rdquo; there leaves in the original proposal an option of defining the ambit of the resolution, and if a speaker in his explanation deliberately restricts himself rigidly to conventional forms, it seems very grievously if that is so, to limit those following. Those who drafted the Standing Orders apparently had something of that kind in view, for in putting adjectival descriptions or limitations in front of the word &ldquo;statement&rdquo; they necessarily to some extent limited that statement.  The word &ldquo;explanatory&rdquo; is not accidental.  The word &ldquo;explanatory&rdquo; apparently is quite wide enough, according to the interpretation <Col N="193" /> of the Chair, to cover as much explanation as the proposer desires to give.  I think it is a well-ascertained principle of law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It means that in selecting an occupant for the Chair we are not required to put into the Chair those who have a knowledge of the law.  I am dealing with a technical point.  The point I am putting to you is this, that within the ordinary knowledge of laymen, as distinct from a legal knowledge, in the interpretation of the clauses of the Bill or anything of that kind, it is commonly known that where the function in one case is limited and in the other case is not limited it must have been the intention <Col N="194" /> of those who did that thing to do what they have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Little has, naturally, more respect for lawyers and the law than I have; he knows them better.  The point I am putting as a point of order is that where the word &ldquo;statement&rdquo; occurs twice in the one sentence and in relation to two different people with two different interests, and where in the one case it is limited by the word &ldquo;explanatory&rdquo; and in the other case it is not limited by the word &ldquo;explanatory,&rdquo; you must assume the intention on the part of those who framed that Standing Order was to give a much wider ambit, apparently an unlimited ambit, to the one which they have not chosen to limit.  I submit as a point of order, that because of the fact that a limiting term is applied to the introducer of the motion, and that in the second case that term is excluded, we must assume it is done deliberately and, therefore, it is the intention to give to the opposer of the motion the power which is claimed by the opposer of the motion&mdash;a very much wider area of travel, investigation and argument than what might be limited to the proposer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the word &ldquo;explanatory&rdquo; will appear to the proposer of a motion, he is apparently allowed to go so long as he does not too violently violate the conscience of the Chair.  We assume the proposer has no conscience at all; that is the natural assumption in a case of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to decide a point of order on that basis.  At any rate, the situation is that Standing Order 82 is clearly intended to limit debate on the First Stage of a Bill, and that is what is <Col N="195" /> being done.  The mover of the motion cannot, by restricting his statement to certain matters, impose thereby any restrictions on the speakers who follow. Those restrictions can only be imposed by the Chair.  I have already decided, on the point raised by Deputy MacEntee, any point of order that there may be in the statement that Deputy Flinn has made.</P>

Is not that the real reason why the word &ldquo;explanatory&rdquo; was inserted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposed to granting leave for the introduction of this Bill.  As I said at the outset, it is the nearest thing to sharp practice, if it is not sharp practice, that I have ever seen, and I have seen a fair amount of it from the gentlemen on the opposite benches.  I brought in a motion a short time ago asking that a certain Petition should be presented to this House.  An amendment was moved to the effect that that question should not be considered until a Joint Committee was set up to frame procedure for the presentation of such Petition. When I was speaking against that amendment and looking at Deputy Thrift, who had moved it, I said that it was, in effect, a trick, or would be used as a trick whether he meant it or not.  I suggested that the policy that was going to be adopted in order to defeat the purpose of the Petition and to avoid the obligation which this House was under under Article 48 of the Constitution meant that the amendment was going to be used as a trick. I remember how deprecatingly Deputy Thrift looked across the House and said &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;  I said that the policy that was going to be adopted was the policy suggested by the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo; I said that we were against the amendment, not because there was anything in it, if honestly carried out, to which we objected, but because we realised that the attitude of members opposite was such that it was going to be abused. Deputies who voted for that amendment on that occasion in good faith have an opportunity now of letting us know whether they were acting in good faith.  If they were, they ought to refuse to become a party now to giving leave to introduce this Bill, which is trying by a side issue to get round Article 48 of the Constitution and to wipe it out.  That Article was there when the Petition was initiated.  It was there the whole time in which people were got to sign that Petition. A good deal of trouble was taken by those responsible for it in getting the Petition signed before Peace Commissioners and others so that the signatures might be verified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything that is in the Article was scrupulously fulfilled and now, when <Col N="204" /> the Petition is presented, and the conditions rigidly and scrupulously carried out, we are going to have the whole thing put aside by the simple process of introducing a Bill to get rid of the whole Article in the Constitution. I said on a former occasion that it was nothing new for us to be faced with tricks of that particular kind.  On a former occasion there was a Constitution, too, and it was put aside in the same manner by the fiat of the Executive of the day.  There was here in this country at that particular period a truce which had been sanctioned by the Dáil Eireann that was in existence at that period.  That Truce was broken by the Executive.  That Executive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is going beyond any possible relevant statement on this stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is necessary for my argument to show very clearly that this is not a new thing, that it is not the first time Deputies who are in the Executive Council to-day have done this sort of thing.  I think if I can show these things that it can be adduced as a reason why the House ought not to give them the opportunity of doing it again.  (Interruptions.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Deputies ought to restrain themselves when a Deputy is speaking.  The only interruption that we should have in an orderly way is on a point of order, and Deputies might leave a point of order to be dealt with by the Chair. This is a Bill for a constitutional amendment, a Bill to delete Article 47 and Article 48 of the Constitution. The position is that when leave is asked to introduce a Bill a statement may be made against the introduction of the Bill.  This is a Constitutional Amendment Bill, and the Deputy is allowed to make a statement against it.  That statement need not be kept within very narrow limits, but examples of the action taken by the Executive Council do not seem to be at all relevant to the question of altering the existing legislation.  It is a question of the House, not of the Executive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been most obedient, A Chinn Comhairle, I think, as far as your rulings have been concerned in this House, but I submit that it is not fair that arguments that are definitely relevant to this particular issue should be ruled out, particularly after the statement made by the President when he was speaking on this subject before.  We have not got his statement now, but he referred to it previously. Let us go back on these previous statements, and let us see whether they can be answered or not. I wish to go over this ground, because I am anxious to convince members that they ought not to allow this Bill to be introduced in this particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever ground the President went over relevantly with regard to the deletion of Article 47 or Article 48 of the Constitution will arise if the Bill goes to a Second Reading.  Before the Bill goes to a Second Reading, and at this particular Stage, it will be impossible to open up all these matters.  In any event, even on the Second Reading of the Bill, I am not prepared to agree that what the Deputy wants to do now, namely, to go back to certain events in 1922, would be relevant.  The debate which took place in another Dáil is not relevant at all to the position now. The President did not choose to make an explanatory statement.  He has the right to make an explanatory statement if he chooses, but he did not choose to do that.  Deputies who speak against the introduction of the Bill are confined to making a statement of the reasons why the House should not allow the Bill to be introduced.  I do not think that that can possibly be construed in such a way as to give the liberty that the Deputy demands.  I am not to be taken as saying that even on Second Reading such a question will arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. Under that Standing Order is not the President bound by obligation to make an explanatory statement?  How is the House to know what he is dealing with if he does not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>If the <Col N="206" /> Deputy means that I have the power to compel the President to make an explanatory statement, I have no such power.  The Ceann Comhairle is compelled by the Standing Orders to permit an explanatory statement, but the Ceann Comhairle is not given any such power as that, nor could he exercise it if he had it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that although you have not power to force him to do it, you have power to rule out of order the bringing in of this Bill at all, if he does not comply with the Standing Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the Bill the President referred to a certain previous statement of his on Articles 47 and 48.  Did he not by that reference make a discussion of his earlier speeches relevant now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>That constituted his explanatory statement.  I submit that the Deputy opposing the Bill is entitled to refute the statements made by the President in his explanatory statement, which included a reference to a previous statement he made in relation to Articles 47 and 48.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a rather important point of order.  I am not prepared to admit in that way: that the mover of a motion for leave to introduce a Bill can, by restricting his own explanatory statement, restrict the debate.  He could not in any way do so.  The rights of a Deputy opposing a Bill are to be determined by the Chair, and must not and cannot be determined by the Deputy who moves the motion.  Similarly, I am not prepared to accept from Deputy MacEntee the reverse case, that because the President referred to his own views on the matter as having been previously given to another Dáil, the Chair is obliged to allow anything that the President said on another occasion to be canvassed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> It is a question solely for the judgment of the Chair.  Neither the brevity of the explanatory statement nor the length of it can be construed so as to give a right to or restrict the right of a following Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct what may be a misapprehension. I understood the President referred to his previous speeches in this Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. COONEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Would a Deputy in introducing a Bill be in order in relating the circumstances which he believed were responsible for its introduction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a hypothetical question which I do not propose to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. COONEY Mr. COONEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COONEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The point we are faced with is, that if that question were answered it would decide the issue as to whether a Deputy opposing a Bill would be entitled to give his view of these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is putting a hypothetical question which I could not answer.  I can decide whether what Deputy de Valera proposes to do is or is not in order, but I cannot decide a hypothetical question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate thing is that the reason the President gave amounted to this: that the reasons for which he asked leave to introduce this Bill were stated by him to the House on a previous occasion.  Is not the Deputy who opposes the Bill placed at a disadvantage if he is not permitted to refer to the grounds stated by the President for introducing the Bill, even though those grounds may not have been stated in the course of this debate, but in a previous debate in the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The grounds the President has for introducing the Bill are not relevant at all. What is relevant at this stage is an explanation <Col N="208" /> of what the Bill is, which the President did not give and which he would be in order in giving, if he desired to do so now.  What is relevant is an explanation of the Bill and a statement that the Bill is not acceptable and is going to be voted against, but the whole intention of the Standing Order is to restrict the discussion at this Stage, and Deputies cannot, by any possible point of order, avoid that fact.  Standing Order 82 was specifically framed for the purpose of restricting the discussion at this Stage, and the debate is restricted by the Standing Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this point because this is a very serious matter. I think that if it is dealt with in a particular way it may probably bring about a change of attitude on all sides. The point is this: There is a very considerable amount in our minds to be said on this question, and I suggest that the Ceann Comhairle should allow the most ample possible statement of our attitude on this question by the Leader of the Party.  This is not by any means in the nature of obstruction. It requires the most ample explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is not accusing Deputy de Valera of obstruction for a moment.  I have already stated that I am prepared to allow a pretty wide statement on this particular First Reading.  That statement, I think, cannot include a recital of the alleged sins of another Executive altogether at an earlier period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was anxious for was to get the House to do the only thing that I consider would be consistent with its dignity, if it has any, and that is to refuse even a First Reading to this Bill.  I say that the circumstances in which this has been introduced merit for it that particular treatment.  Deputies who in good faith brought in an amendment to establish a Joint Committee in order to arrange for the procedure under which petitions <Col N="209" /> should be received, if they were really honest in their attitude, are bound to see that the complete idea which was in their minds, and which was in that amendment, is carried out. There is no need of any explanation as to what is intended by this Bill.  It is before us in black and white.  This Bill is entitled an Act to amend the Constitution by deleting Articles 47 and 48.  Some members may be interested in Article 47.  I am interested in Article 48, and the deletion of that particular Article, as to which we had a discussion recently, and in which by their signatures 96,000 people are interested, is the question to which I am speaking.  Let us see once more what it is that is going to be deleted from the Constitution.  We have had it already, but it is no harm, as somebody said, that you should get your last look at it, for that is what it will mean if the present majority are going to persevere in this course, assisted by those who have been their allies up to the present. The Article is this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas may provide for the initiation by the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments.  Should the Oireachtas fail to make such provision within two years it shall on the petition of not less than seventy-five thousand voters on the register, of whom not more than fifteen thousand shall be voters in any one constituency, either make such provisions or submit the question to the people for decision in accordance with the ordinary regulations governing the Referendum.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have had a petition here presented, and you know it is in existence. You know that in so far as our word goes we are prepared to have any examination which may be deemed proper by this House to test the fact that it is prepared honestly and in accordance with Article 48, but if that Article goes that petition goes, and, in addition to the petition, there is the bigger question of the Initiative, which also goes. Now there are a number of us who would be interested in the Initiative independent altogether of its bearing on the petition presented here or presented in the sense that it was brought to the notice of the House.  We believe <Col N="210" /> that the Initiative is a very good thing. We believe that by the very nature of things at elections a number of questions will mix up and that it is very important that for certain types of questions the people should have an opportunity of giving their judgment upon those questions independent of any other questions likely to be involved at election time.  We do not want to see that power the people have removed because it is simply an inconvenience to the Executive Council to have it there at the present time.  We all know that the Executive succeeded in getting a majority of the people to their side mainly by pretending that they were the section that stood for the rights of the people.  Their whole history during the whole time has been one of pretence that they were democrats in the broadest sense.  It is necessary when this Executive brings forward measures that we should have before our minds their past history in order to judge how they are likely to act in the future and to see what is the purpose of their present actions.</P>
    <P>If a stranger were to come in here and did not know the past history of the present Executive his position in this matter would be very different from the position of those who do know, and I think it is only fair that Deputies who may not have had an opportunity of that intimate knowledge of what was done by that Executive should have it brought home to them.  They can test these things, and see whether what we say is truth or falsehood.  I say, in any case, that everybody knows their cry against us was that we were acting against the will of the people and that they were acting in favour of the will of the people.  Who is in favour of the will of the people now?  These people opposite are afraid that the people should have an opportunity of deciding by Referendum&mdash;which would be the last thing in the Initiative&mdash;any of these questions.  They prefer to have the people confused, as they are at election time, by a host of conflicting issues of different kinds.  They want to deprive the people of their right and opportunity of taking up these individual questions, judging upon them, and giving their verdict.  I say that every member of <Col N="211" /> this House ought to oppose the deletion of that particular Article.  When it was introduced into the Provisional Parliament these are the words&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fahy was prevented from quoting previously. I think we ought not to have quotations under the existing Standing Order except in so far as the Articles of the Constitution may be quoted.  I think we ought not to have quotations from previous debates.  I think that the word &ldquo;statement&rdquo; in the Standing Order excludes quotations from debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit we are in a different position with regard to this particular Bill from any up to the present, and I believe that the only course consistent with the dignity of this assembly would be to kick it out at the very first opportunity, and that is why I think that there ought to be greater latitude allowed in order to make a case for doing that.  As I said when this was introduced&mdash;Am I forbidden to quote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the whole Standing Order, as I said many a time this evening, aims at restricting debate at this Stage.  I am quite in agreement with Deputy de Valera that this is an important matter in which latitude should be allowed. It is a question itself without any latitude being allowed, which raises a number of matters relevant at the proper Stage, but on this particular Stage the question is different.  If Deputy de Valera is precluded from doing certain things now he will have an opportunity of doing them at a later Stage, or in the alternative, he will have succeeded in having the Bill defeated. The whole purpose of the Standing Order and the precedents are to restrict debate at this Stage.  No injustice will be done by that course, because at a later Stage such opportunity will arise, and if it does not it will be because the opponents of the Bill have succeeded in defeating it.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to explain and argue all the things I have to rule upon.  Deputy Little will agree that the Chair is faced with a great variety of problems and asked for a decision upon them without any preparation in a great many instances.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general point. It is a matter that has arisen before, and in all probability will arise again. What is in my mind is this: You say Deputy de Valera cannot now refer to the incidents of 1922.  If he cannot refer to 1922, can he refer to 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927, or 1928, or how recent must the incident be that he can refer to in the discussion on this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kelly is raising a new point not relevant to the point of order.  The point I was deciding was whether Deputy de Valera was in order or whether a Deputy making a statement against the Bill under Standing Order 82 was entitled to quote from the Debates.  I ruled generally that he is not so entitled to quote.  The Deputy is asking another question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not called upon to answer that question, but I propose to answer it.  The present Executive has been in office since the President was elected here last October, and this Government, as far as this Parliament is concerned, is only in office since then, and only their actions since then can be reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that we are reviewing the actions of this Executive, and naturally the Executive can only be reviewed, qua Executive, qua Government, from the time it came into office, but if there are events of importance in recent history that have a bearing on this debate, and if they can be demonstrated to be ad rem, I would like to know if you have made up your mind&mdash;perhaps you have not&mdash;what distance of time from the present moment must elapse <Col N="214" /> before these things might become relevant.</P>

      <P>The situation surely is that the Chair will have to decide every question as it arises.  The Deputy asked me first a general question, which I answered. He has gone into another hypothetical question now.  I have not made up my mind, but as I have already stated here, the situation in this House at this moment, and for some time past, is such that the Chair has no intention of endeavouring to fit that situation and these personalities summarily into all the niceties of Parliamentary procedure. That, I think, was the phrase I used here before.  That being my view I have an open mind on a number of matters, but I have a definite view on certain other matters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that we are interested in this Initiative. We would have been interested in it if the recent Petition was not in question at all.  We would have been interested in it as giving certain powers to the people to deal with matters which they could not very easily deal with at general elections.  I indicated my own view, that I was more in favour of the Initiative for constitutional amendments because the road was easier, because there was less difficulty associated with it than for the initiation of ordinary laws.  I am not going to quarrel with any Deputy who is anxious to use it for the more general purpose of initiating ordinary law. I have no objection to it except that there are certain difficulties in the way, in the case of initiating ordinary laws, which would not be in the way of constitutional amendments.  The body of law as a whole is a large matter; the Constitution generally is a comparatively small document which can be digested and understood by the average <Col N="215" /> person, and he can get legal advice on matters where legal advice seems to him necessary.  It is a very different thing from trying to frame a law and fit it in with the general body of laws.  There are drafting and other difficulties.  But as I indicated, we are not going to quarrel with anyone who wants the Initiative for ordinary laws.  On this side we want it, and as a single individual I am anxious to see the power and the right of the Initiative maintained.  One of the reasons why I am anxious for it is one of the reasons put forward here when it was accepted by the Provisional Parliament.  At that time it was stated that it associated the people with their own laws; it gave them the feeling that they were the ultimate power, the ultimate rulers in the country; it gave them an interest which they would not otherwise have in legislation, and in the laws generally.  It gave the people an opportunity of considering certain questions in a way in which they would not be discussed or considered at general elections at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to wipe that out, and it is clearly indicated here that the Bill to be introduced is not going to provide any substitute.  The result is that there are certain consequential amendments of the Constitution which must follow on the deletion of this particular Article, and the Bill is going to provide for these.  There ought to be no reason why anyone should wait for the Second Reading to understand what is in this Bill.  They ought to be able to make up their minds on the First Reading. They ought to be able to see from what has been said already about the Petition, and the bearing of this right on the general condition of the country, that if this power is removed from the people, and if it is made clear that this Constitution is only intended by the other side as a means of binding their political opponents, while they are free themselves&mdash;that it is something they need not give any respect to, but that they expect their opponents to give respect to&mdash;then I say the result of that policy is going to be that the people will despair of any effort by constitutional methods.  At the present time we see the fruit&mdash;we saw it in the past&mdash;<Col N="216" /> of the contrary policy, the policy of the Executive, that is trying to have its way and its own particular view-point secured by force.  We see it in the position we have at Mountjoy at present, as I am told, where there are five Republican girls on hunger strike, who have been pursued&mdash;for what?  For the very same sort of thing that the gentlemen on the other side supported formerly.  They are standing out for political treatment.  They are doing that in the very same way in which it was done against the British.  This Constitution has been, to their minds anyway&mdash;however Deputies may differ on that matter&mdash;imposed on them, and if the avenue by which they could change it is to be closed, I say it is a bad national policy.</P>
    <P>I think that it is a dangerous policy, and that it is not the policy of people who really believe that the people of this country are the rulers.  What it means is that the particular majority here for the moment think that they are perpetual rulers.  The people have a right to change their minds, and if those opposite are in a majority to-day, is that majority going to be a perpetual one?  Are the people going to be prevented because they took a certain line on a certain occasion, perpetually from changing their minds and from doing something else if they want to?  I always knew, once there was close contact here, that the people would very quickly find out who were the democrats, who really believed in the rights of the people and who did not.  The militarists here, those people who are depending on force, were the people who were standing up for the constitutional rights of the people.  We have a splendid example of it in this. The members of the Labour Party, for a considerable period in the past, were quite consistent in their attitude. Though I did not agree with the attitude they took up, I do admit, and did admit, that they were consistent for a long portion of the time, until they got involved in a certain position here, and I admit that they were trying, during the summer of 1922, to get a proper national policy adopted, with a proper reference to the people.</P>

      <P>Very well.  In any case, I say that in this particular matter the members of the Labour Party are bound to refuse to vote for the First Reading of this Bill.  I say equally that Deputies on the other side who were in good faith when they introduced that amendment the other day are similarly bound to vote against it, because otherwise it would simply mean that that amendment was nothing more or less than a mere trick to get rid of the petition.  You know that such a petition was signed.  If you have any regard for moral obligations of any kind you are bound to honour that petition, to see that you act in accordance with it and that you go further with it.  But if you allow this Bill to be passed, it is quite clear that you are going to make the thing a farce by getting procedure set up for the consideration of the petition, getting the petition examined, and then finding that the Article on which it was based has in the meantime been removed.  As I said, that was clearly the policy that the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; indicated.  When they realised that there was going to be tearing up of the Constitution in this respect they said: &ldquo;Do not do it in the open; do not tear it up openly. Do not give Fianna Fáil and those who support them in the country the opportunity of saying `Very well, then.  The Constitution of which they are talking they have no respect for themselves; they tear it up.' Do not tear it up, but pretend to honour it, pretend to act in <Col N="218" /> accordance with it.  Set up your committees and give the Executive a chance of doing the thing which they have already done.  The Executive have been caught napping.  Get them out of their difficulty.&rdquo;  I hope that those who are Independents in this particular matter will act independently.  Some of us have come in here with open minds as regards what &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; means. We have been watching very carefully to see what it really did mean, and to see whether or not we were going to have people who are Independents acting straightforwardly on their judgment on matters which came before them.  As far as I for one am concerned, I base my judgment on the bona fides of the Independents&mdash;or of some of them&mdash;on their action in this particular case, and I say to them, and to other members of the House, that on the fate of this will largely depend what the course of policy of the country will be for the future.  So far as we are concerned, anyhow, we intend, as long as we are here, if that Article is taken out, to oppose, so far as we can, every single measure that is brought in by that Executive, as long as this particular action is joined up with the other action, that of keeping the Republican prisoners, whose only crime is this, that they have not been able to take the sharp curve and the sharp turn that was taken by the people opposite.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to support the precedent of Second Reading speeches on the introduction of this Bill, but I would ask permission to say a word in explanation.  Deputy de Valera has used the word &ldquo;trick,&rdquo; with which I am not greatly excited, but which I must emphatically repudiate. I hand it back to him.  I ask him whether it could not be better used with reference to the whole procedure in respect of which we are carrying on this very futile discussion.  If Deputy de Valera had followed my argument he would not have found it difficult to understand why I intend to vote for the First Reading and for the Second Reading of this Bill, as I did for a similar Bill very nearly twelve months ago.  I went to very considerable pains to make clear that one point that I was making was that so long as the Article remained in the Constitution, we ought to take what steps were necessary to work it, indicating clearly that when it was an Article we were bound constitutionally to follow it.  Secondly, I went to very considerable pains to make clear that, so far as I could see&mdash;and I think I proved my point&mdash;the Article as it stands would be no use whatever for what Deputy de Valera laid down as his purpose in the Petition which he claims to have presented.  Therefore, I see no reason whatever for not supporting this Bill right through, as I indicated I would do and as I did nearly twelve months ago in the case of the other Bill.</P>

    <P>The words &ldquo;gorse, whins and furze&rdquo; are practically synonymous terms in some parts of the country.  What is known as gorse in one part of the country is known as whins or furze in another.  The object of the amendment <Col N="223" /> is to make the matter clear.  This is purely a drafting amendment.  The Committee agreed that this Bill would be re-committed.</P>

      <P>No.  The understanding was that the Bill should be taken through Committee and that Deputies who had amendments down to it should not push those amendments to a vote, because an amendment defeated on Committee could not be moved again on Report, but that when the Bill was reprinted with the Minister's amendments there would be no objection on the Report Stage in the case of Deputies desiring to move amendments to the taking of those amendments in Committee.  In fact there are no amendments.  Is the Deputy satisfied?</P>

      <P>The Committee Stage of this Bill was taken on Wednesday last.  There were a number of amendments to it in my name, amendments which altered it in a very radical way. On the Committee Stage we discussed how we would deal with my amendments. Deputies from all Parties pointed out that it was difficult to examine the amendments, as they had only been on the Order Paper for a short time.  I think it was the Ceann Comhairle who suggested that we should take the amendments as they stood and insert them in the Bill.  On that, I gave the undertaking&mdash;I think some Deputy suggested that I should give it&mdash;that on the Report Stage the Bill could be re-committed, and that <Col N="224" /> in the meantime Deputies would have the opportunity of examining the Bill with my amendments in it.  Deputies could see for themselves whether the amendments I had inserted met the points that had been put up on Second Reading.  I think the Bill, with my amendments, was reprinted almost immediately. When I saw the Order Paper yesterday, with only one amendment on it, I took it for granted that Deputies generally agreed with the amendments which I had inserted. These amendments met the points Deputies had raised on the Second Reading, and therefore I thought that they had quite deliberately refrained from putting down any amendments for the Report Stage.  That is the position.</P>

      <P>There was undoubtedly a definite undertaking that Deputies would get a chance of looking at the Bill as amended, and for that reason the Report Stage was put off for seven days.  It is obvious there has been some misunderstanding, that the Bill has not been read, and that Deputies who intended putting down amendments have refrained from doing so.  In that state of affairs it would be advisable to postpone the Report Stage for a few days.</P>

      <P>Going into Committee again does not mean that all the sections will be taken in Committee, but that any amendments that are down to the Bill would be considered in Committee.  That would be giving a better opportunity for discussion than could be had on Report when Deputies are restricted to one speech. If the Bill was only circulated yesterday it was impossible for Deputies to put down amendments, so that it is necessary to have this Stage postponed to give them their last chance of putting down amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 49, before Section 6, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The landlord or immediate lessor or the occupier of any property charged or chargeable under Schedule A or Schedule B of the Income Tax Act, 1918, may apply to the inspector of taxes for the district in which such property is situated for a certificate that all income tax charged under the said Schedules for all the years of assessment ending prior to the 6th day of April preceding the date of the application has been paid and that no further income tax under the said Schedules is chargeable for such years, and the inspector of taxes on being satisfied as to the facts shall issue a certificate to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Notwithstanding Section 199 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, where the property charged or chargeable has been sold for valuable consideration, and the certificate referred to in this section has been issued, the tax certified as having been paid or as not being chargeable, shall not be recoverable by distress from the occupier of the property charged or <Col N="226" /> upon the premises in respect of which the assessment is made.</P>
    <P>(3)  A certificate of the inspector of taxes under this section shall not discharge any person or property from income tax in case of fraud or failure to disclose material facts other than a bona-fide purchaser for valuable consideration without notice of such fraud or failure or the property of such purchaser.</P>
    <P>This amendment is put down to meet a point raised by Deputy Little, and I think it substantially does so.  It does not provide for certificates showing the amount of taxes due, but it provides for certificates showing that the tax has been paid.  If the vendor cannot produce that, the purchaser will have to take steps to protect himself.  I think this amendment would prevent such difficulties occurring as Deputy Little referred to.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 33, before Section 19, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3) of Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1924 (No. 27 of 1924), the expression &ldquo;sugar confectionery&rdquo; shall not include ginger preserved in syrup imported into Saorstát Eireann in wooden barrels or casks of a capacity of not less than one hundredweight.</P>
      <P>This was suggested by Deputy Murphy. The real point is that ginger imported in syrup is imported largely for the manufacture of crystallised ginger. The position at present is that the confectionery duty is charged on the ginger and on the syrup.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weight of the whole consignment is very much less than the weight of the crystallised ginger which can be produced from it.  The result is the people at home cannot compete in the sale of crystallised ginger with outside manufacturers.  This amendment is <Col N="227" /> really intended to enable them to compete. The ginger imported in jars is a sweetmeat ready for consumption, and it will continue to be charged with the confectionery duty; but this ginger imported in large quantities in casks is really the raw material of the confectionery trade.</P>

    <P>I do not know that I can say anything about this amendment, beyond what I said previously.  I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not able at this stage to have the examination of the amendment that it was suggested both by Deputy Hogan and Deputy Flinn, might be made.  It will require, if we are to raise the rates at all on the higher priced seats, a great deal of care.  Any question of charging for entertainments like dance halls will require further investigation.  Deputy Flinn made the rather interesting suggestion about charging a percentage of the whole receipts.  That could easily e applied to a house where payments are made on certified returns.  It will present a good deal of difficulty where stamps are used.  I do not know whether it can be applied at all where stamps are used.  There is a possibility that we might recast the duties in such a way that we might allow a percentage payment where certified returns are furnished, and have stamps in other cases, perhaps increase the range of stamps.  But that involves a greater inquiry than would be possible to give it.  What I propose is a concession which will not be costly to the Exchequer while, at any rate, relieving the cheaper seats in the theatre; where the price of admission does not exceed 4d. that no duty will be payable.  That would mean in practice that seats for which the present charges are 6d. will be 4d. in future.  Where the seats are 6d. it means that the proprietor gets 4½d. and the Exchequer 1½d.  If the proprietor will reduce his price to 4d. he will escape the tax, and if he gets nine people in where he got eight in before, he would be as well of.  It seems to me that a 50 per cent. reduction in the price ought to produce even a greater increase than that.  It is impossible to sacrifice any great sum of revenue at the present stage.  The concession I suggest will cost only about £3,000.  It will be helping certain picture houses, and it will allow of a 4d. seat being provided where a 6d. seat is the cheapest rate at the present time.  Consequently, it will benefit the people who can least afford to go to the cinemas.  I have gone as carefully and as sympathetically into the matter as possible in the time available for consideration of it, and I do not think I <Col N="229" /> can give any greater concession than I have indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he can by any means increase that concession to 5d. instead of 4d.  I have been informed that the 4d. concession will apply only to cinemas in the provinces and outside Dublin.  If the 5d. concession is given it will bring in a fair proportion, not a very large number, but a fair proportion of the cinemas in the city.  I do not wish to press the Minister to make the concession up to 6d., for I think that would involve a considerable sum, but I would ask him, if possible, to go a step further than he has gone and to increase the 4d. to 5d. so as to give some benefit to the Dublin people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone into this matter as fully as possible, and I could not give more.  There are surely 6d. seats in the Dublin cinemas, or in some of them, and if there are, those people will be enabled, and with a profit, to reduce the price of their seats to 4d. I have gone into it as carefully as it was possible in the time.  To adopt entirely a new scheme involves a great deal of careful examination, and at the moment I could not give it that examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the concession which the Minister has granted scarcely goes far enough. After all, for all practical purposes, so far as Dublin is concerned, the 6d. seats are not the cheapest seats.  There are many theatres where the lowest price is 9d. or 1s.  You might call those theatres the better class theatres, but at the same time these are the theatres which are very largely patronised by the poorer section of the people.  They give a very good show.  They are very attractive, because they happen to be very comfortable.  The quality of the entertainment provided is a high one. The remission which the Minister for Finance has conceded will not affect those particular places of entertainment at all.  Those places will remain exactly as they were before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister would go further and extend that concession at least to 1s. seats.  There are <Col N="230" /> not a considerable number of places of entertainment which will be affected by the concession.  The amount that will be involved will, I think, be very small.  I would like the Minister if he could see his way to meet us, and to grant the concession at least in respect of seats where the prices of admission do not exceed 1s.  Of course, if he was not prepared to do that, then we on these benches would have to adopt a certain attitude, in view of the fact that he has made very extensive concessions to other places of entertainment, to rececourses and entertainments of that description where the prices of admission are not a shilling or sixpence or ninepence, but 10s. and upwards.  There, though we have been urging upon him to adopt a certain principle of discrimination, he adopts a principle of discrimination which we think is unwarranted.  In so far as he concedes a very large remission to the wealthier classes of the people and the wealthier entertainments and denis it to the poorer classes of the people and the more popular form of entertainment, on those grounds we feel that if a substantial concession is not granted we shall have to oppose the section.</P>

      <P>I know the cinema proprietors throughout the country, and in the city also, hold they have been very unfairly dealt with by the Minister in the present Finance Bill.  They say they find it very hard to make the cinemas pay in many cases, while on the other hand you have entertainments competing with them making big profits. When the Minister was talking about an entertainments tax on dog racing he stated that the revenue which might be derived from that would be very small; in fact, he mentioned £7,000 or £8,000.</P>

      <P>One particular company in this city, according to the balance-sheet for last year&mdash;and it was only working five months&mdash;made a profit of £18,000.  We presume that their profit was not more than 50 per cent. and, therefore, their takings were at the very least £36,000.  According to the scale of entertainments tax here, the takings on that £36,000 should be between <Col N="231" /> £7,000 and £8,000.  I do not know if the Minister is prepared to say that the profits earned by those people are more than 50 per cent. of the takings.  If they are more than 50 per cent., I think they deserve to be taxed, and highly taxed.  Last year you had one company promoting dog racing.  This year you have a second company in the city.  You have others starting in different parts of the country.  The revenue from that particular form of amusement should be much more than £7,000 or £8,000. Against that you have the Minister telling us that he is making a large concession by giving a remission which will amount to more than £3,000 a year in the cinema industry.  The cinema proprietors hold this, and I suppose they have some justification for it, that they do give a considerable amount of employment. They certainly give some employment.</P>
      <P>I do not know if it would have much effect on the vote in this House if I went into the moral side of pictures as compared with the results of going to dog racing.  Certainly the betting evil in this country is becoming very serious, and it is having a very bad moral effect. I do not know whether it will be advanced that there are other evils, other vices, developed by going to the pictures.  I think the Minister should have seriously considered the amendment put in by Deputy Hogan.  Perhaps he has.  That amendment does not, in my opinion, ask for very much.  The amendment would make up to a certain extent in the higher prices for any loss that might be incurred through the lower prices.  I do not know what the losses would be.  I am not sure whether the Minister mentioned on the Committee Stage what the loss would amount to.  It does not appear to be very extensive.  I would like to know, if Deputy Hogan's amendment were accepted and an entertainments tax was put on in connection with dog racing, whether the Minister would be at any loss or not.</P>

      <P>One company interested in dog racing was able to make a clear profit of £18,000.  What must be the receipts from that form of amusement and what would be the receipts to the Exchequer if they were to impose a tax?  Perhaps the Minister could not answer that right off, but it is a question that might have been considered in conjuction with Deputy Hogan's amendment.  I think the cinema proprietors and the public generally would not be very thankful to us to accept the amendment put in by the Minister, and I think the House should insist on having the amendment proposed by Deputy Hogan carried.</P>

      <P>It is disappointing to find on this particular amendment that the Minister for Finance is not taking a more enlightened view of the matter. It is not purely a question of finance or the amount of money to be got in or not got in.  From what Deputy Ryan has stated it is quite clear that a considerable amount of the loss could be made up on dog racing and a considerable amount also could be made up on dance halls.  That matter was also discussed before, and we had some hope that an attempt would be made to adjust the thing from the educational point of view.  In fact, the adjustment of the tax on cinemas could have been used in order to improve the standard of what the cinema shows. There is no doubt the cinema is one of the most educational forces you could have.  There is nothing which impresses itself so much on the minds of the public, especially at the formative age, than the pictures shown in the cinemas. Although there is a certain control and check on the cinema, I submit it is defective in that it is only a negative control.</P>

    <P>Some amendment of the Finance Act could have been moved in order to make sure that the cinemas would show certain types of pictures of an educational kind.  Certain exemptions could be made if they showed a certain percentage of a particular kind of films.  They might be used for advertising Irish industries and encouraging people to start industries, and they might be used for showing certain technical <Col N="233" /> processes which are very interesting. They need not be long films, and films of a certain size could be regulated. Encouragement might be given to the development of films dealing with Irish historical subjects, and so on, and they could be endless from an educational point of view.  It could be done through the Finance Act just as well as in any other way.  A particular amendment here that has been adopted by the Minister for Finance is certainly not satisfactory to us, because we consider that as far as it goes it cannot go far enough from our point of view.  Deputy Hogan's amendment is far more useful than that of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Then I misunderstood the Minister.  If this would cost only £3,000, would he tell us what it would cost if he exempted up to sixpence?  I am sure that he would easily find some way to recompense himself for that.  A few pence is a good deal to people who go to the fivepenny and sevenpenny seats in cinemas and, if the present system is maintained, they would have to deny themselves the few pleasures they have.  There are sources of revenue which the Minister has not tapped.  I do not suggest that he should go to the dogs.  I suggest that he should go to the hoardings at the railway stations and tax the advertisements of foreign goods.  It is one thing to put a tax on foreign goods coming into the country, and another thing to allow these centres to be used as show cases for them.  While the Minister has not, in my opinion, done everything in the matter, I am satisfied that he has made a gesture towards meeting the case of the people in whom I am interested, namely, the very poor.  I think, however, <Col N="235" /> he should have gone the whole way and given us an increased exemption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>That represents a difference of £8,000.  It is in relation to that £8,000 that we are now concerned for the moment.  I want to get back to something that was said here before when the question was raised concerning the direct economic line and connection between horse-racing, horse-breeding and human maintenance.  We are in the extraordinary position that the one big concession of this kind made by the Minister for Finance has been made in relation to the entertainment tax on horse-racing.  Though an appeal has been made, and a very honest inquiry has been made by responsible Deputies from the two principal parties in Opposition, to be told from some authoritative source how that is being translated into the maintenance of an Irish industry, and in what proportion money which goes to the maintenance of that Irish industry is being translated into the maintenance of men, no information of any sort or description has been vouchsafed.  You are going to have exactly the same thing in relation to dog-racing after a while, and it will be exempted on the ground that a great national industry is being hit.  I suggest that it is a responsibility on the Minister for Finance if that responsibility has not been discharged by those in favour of horse-racing.  It is a responsibility of the Minister for Finance direct to give this House information which responsible Deputies in Opposition have asked for as to the connection with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, in fact, it is not true that racing is essential to horse breeding, if, in fact, it is not true that horse breeding <Col N="236" /> and the money which it absorbs to a large extent are transferred into the maintenance of man, there is no justification whatever for the removal of the entertainment tax on racing.  The onus is on certain people in this House who apparently have been able to influence the Minister in this matter to answer that question, but they have not attempted to discharge that onus, and the Minister who has come here to do something on their recommendation has apparently declined to take over the responsibility which they have not discharged.  I have made careful efforts to find out, but I do not know the connection, and I have not the slightest doubt that some percentage of money which is thrown down a grill contributes to the maintenace of horse racing.  I have no doubt that some percentage of money spent in admission fees to race-courses does go to the maintenance of horse-breeding.  But I do not know the percentage, nor has anyone attempted to give to this House the information which ought to be given to enable Deputies to decide whether on the ground put forward by the Minister he is entitled to make this exemption when he refuses to make other exemptions which are more important. If that £11,000 was still to be obtained from horse-racing there would be no difficulty in raising the figure from 4d. to 6d. or perhaps 8d.  Until the Minister has discharged the obligation, or until those behind him who have been able to persuade him whether on financial or electoral grounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

To come back to the point, we cannot relieve certain taxation because certain revenue is required, and because certain concessions have been made in other directions.  The concession which has been made has been made for horse-racing on the pretence or the assumption, that it is a directly operative Irish producing industry; that it maintains men.  I say that the responsibility rests upon the Minister for Finance or upon those behind him, whose testimony has influenced him in this matter, to give us the reasons for believing that assumption.  These <Col N="238" /> reasons have not been given, although they have been asked for in a sincere spirit of inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have suggested to the Minister that he should, instead of this highly-complicated system which is here and for which you cannot find any logical justification&mdash;if you plot this as a graph you will find no logical justification in the existing standards of taxation&mdash;that a flat rate or something approaching a flat rate should be applied.  If, for instance, you were to say to one of these entertainment companies, &ldquo;Twenty per cent. of your total proceeds will be taken,&rdquo; then they could regulate their rates in any way they liked, and my opinion is that they would regulate them at a lower figure.  I got out from figures the other day what the actual experience was of an entertainment house which had high rates for all portions of the house, that is stalls, pit and gallery, and the amount paid in tax roughly then was 23 per cent.  It reduced the rates, and it went up to 25 per cent. They reduced them then to the lowest possible limit, and it went up to 30 per cent.  You have at the present moment an utterly illogical rate, and the difficulty is that people cannot arrange their rates in such a form as to give good commercial management or even a good return to the State.  I am taking a definite case so that it would not be interfered with by the fact that one place might not be the same as another. You could get a case where there would be considerable reduction, where the total takings in the week would actually send up the amount of tax that is paid.  In relation to the bigger houses&mdash;those are the houses which have a sort of good faith arrangement with the Excise, in which they take their figures and pay by cheque at the end of the week&mdash;<Col N="239" /> there would be no difficulty in regard to a flat rate.  I can see that there would be difficulties in regard to sporadic entertainments, but I suggest to the Minister that he should go into that to see whether it could not be arranged.</P>
      <P>I come back to the question of the fourpenny and sixpenny charges.  It is evidently quite hopeless to press him on the question of the shilling charge, but I do think that there is good reason to press him on the difference between fourpence and sixpence.  I have said that there is a certain psychological necessity for entertainment for people under certain conditions, and in that connection I will tell you a remarkable story.  There was a certain place in which there was a strike, and I happened to be in a position to know what had been the receipts of entertainment houses before the strike started.  Immediately the strike started there was a slight falling off, a definite falling off, in the receipts of entertainment houses, and the anticipation was that that was merely the beginning of the falling off, and that the receipts would keep going down.  To our surprise they did not. After a time they actually began to go up, and as the strike continued, though we knew the actual money for necessities would be running out, and we knew there were real hardships, yet the entertainment fund, if I might so term it, still kept up long past our anticipations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There you have a very serious psychological reaction&mdash;people poor, borrowing, selling and pawning their goods&mdash;and yet in the cheaper portions of the house keeping up, almost miraculously, the entertainment expenditure. Then you came to the moment when the strike was settled and immediately the entertainments funds stopped.  That is a very remarkable fact.  I do not pretend to explain it with any degree of accuracy, but during that hardship time, especially in the poorer portions of the house, people apparently did find that they were getting value in entertainment, though when they came to the time when they began to earn money again and began <Col N="240" /> to pay back debts and things of that kind, they immediately cut it off.  I am suggesting that to the Minister as an argument he should consider in relation to the psychological effect of restricting entertainment amongst poorer people.  I would ask the Minister when he is replying to tell us whether he can give to the House a logical and reasonable explanation of the connection between the expenditure by people of this country on the upkeep of horse racing by betting and otherwise, and how that is translated into industrial and material benefit in this country. I would ask him also very seriously to consider whether he could not push that fourpence up to sixpence.  Sixpence is the real hardship limit in my opinion.  When you come to a shilling there may be some luxury in it.  If you take the case of fourpence at present and make it sixpence, three-half-pence is going to the State.  You are getting into another nasty watertight compartment.  I am suggesting seriously on social grounds the consideration by the Minister of a complete exemption from fourpence to sixpence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not anything to add to what I said at the beginning. I think Deputy Flinn was not in then, but I referred to his suggestion with reference to a flat rate, and pointed out that there was a great deal to be said for it, and that the real question was whether the difficulties which exist, not merely in regard to sporadic entertainments, but also in regard to payments by houses which cannot be trusted&mdash;and there are several of these&mdash;could be overcome.  I have said all that I wish to say with reference to horse-racing, and I will not undertake to enter on it again.  With reference to the suggestion that more should be given, it might be possible in another year to give more. It might be possible to find a means of giving certain additional concessions to the lower seats without losing entertainments duty, but in order to do that very great care would have to be given to a revision of the scale and, perhaps, bringing within the scope of the entertainments duty certain entertainments which are exempted at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that not more than the <Col N="241" /> sum I mentioned&mdash;£6,000 or £7,000&mdash; would be obtained from dog-racing.  The Revenue Commissioners had certain returns before them, and had fairly good information on which to base an estimate, and I am satisfied that that estimate is correct.  If new greyhound racecourses were started in a number of centres through the country during the present year perhaps the estimate for next year might be much larger, but for the present year I think the estimate is accurate.  I have already <Col N="242" /> stated that I do not see that it is possible to give any further concession than is proposed by the amendment on the Paper.  That particular amendment will undoubtedly make the cheapest seats cheaper in a good number of picture theatres, and will to that extent give an easement to the poorer section of the community.  I could not undertake to do more in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 47, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;races&rdquo; to the end of line 51.</P>
      <P>With regard to this particular amendment I have adopted the Minister's suggestion as to its form.  I do not know whether there is any need to argue it, as he said he would leave it to a free vote of the House, and I have no doubt what the result will be.  I ask the Minister, in view of the number of divisions we have had. whether it is worth while to have another division on this.  He has said himself that there is no appreciable amount of money involved in the matter, and it is scarcely worth the trouble of collecting.  I appeal to him seriously on the part of a great many towns and village committees who get up race meetings for various purposes in connection with town improvements of one kind or another, and are put to a great deal of trouble and inconvenience in making arrangements in connection with the collection of the tax and fulfilling obligations where there is an entry fee charged, to accept the amendment and save us the trouble of another division.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Davin, I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 12, line 20, before Section <Col N="249" /> 29, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (2) of Section 38 of the Finance Act, 1926, shall be amended by the deletion of the words `less than three pounds and is' from the exemption given by that sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment has relation to the charge for stamps on weekly wages. This matter was raised here on several occasions, and in 1926, I think, the Minister gave way to this extent, that on any sums less than £2 he is not now charging stamp duty, but it is still considered a hardship that those civil servants who get their wages weekly, who are mainly engaged in the Post Office, have to pay for a 2d. stamp each week. Such a deduction is not made in the case of any wage-earners, except those employed by the State, and I would ask the Minister to grant this concession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain concession was given, exempting up to £3, in the Finance Act of 1926, and we felt that that met the cases in which there was any hardship.  The effect of this amendment would not merely be to relieve the weekly wage-earner, but also to relieve people who are paid monthly, or at other intervals.  If this concession were given it would mean a fairly substantial cost, and I do not think that the benefit would really be appreciable or equal.  Post Office stamps are used, and consequently it is very difficult to form an estimate of the exact amount involved, but various methods of calculation have been adopted.  The cost of this would not be less than £7,000 or £8,000, and might easily be as much as £15,000, £16,000, or even £17,000.  It certainly is not less than the lower figure I have mentioned.  Consequently, while, as I said in previous years, I had a good deal of sympathy with the lower wage-earners who had to pay this weekly twopence, I think we met the case of those who felt it most by raising the limit to £3.  So far as weekly wage-earners are concerned, most of them are undoubtedly Government employees, and as Government employees they have certain advantages over the employees of private firms. They have in most cases greater security, <Col N="250" /> constant work, and they have certain other advantages.  As the amendment stands, it would of course extend beyond them to large numbers of people whose wages are paid monthly, fortnightly, or at longer intervals than one week, and the loss would be appreciable.  In the present circumstances I regret that I cannot see my way to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say that we on these benches cannot see our way to support the amendment, because we feel that it would give relief to a very much wider class of people than Deputy Davin anticipated, that it would extend to officials and wage-earners who are in receipt of very large incomes indeed.  In any event, even on the smallest wage-earner the tax which it imposes is not very great. I think the maximum amount is something like 8/8 on an income of £156. On general principles I would be inclined to say that it would be a good thing if some system of direct taxation, if possible an equitable one, were imposed upon the people.  It would also have the advantage that everyone under such a system would feel that he was bearing some portion of the Governmental expenditure.  It would associate him with the cost of Government in a way that no system of indirect taxation would do, and even this, small as it is, is a form of taxation that is a step in the right direction, granted, of course, that direct taxation may be expensive to collect.  It has the very considerable advantage that it makes the ordinary citizen examine very much more closely and very much more keenly the manner in which public moneys are expended by the Government. It makes him feel that he has some direct and personal association with the financial policy of the Government, and it makes him keener to curb wasteful and extravagant expenditure.  It makes him realise in a way that a tax upon tea or sugar, or any other necessary of life&mdash;an indirect tax&mdash;will not, that after all the taxpayer is the man who pays the piper, and consequently he should see that the tune that is being played will be to his liking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the fact that direct taxation is sometimes costly to collect, the expense of collection may be out of proportion to the amount collected, and I am not so certain that it is possible to do that, but I would like to see it done.  The special ground of our opposition in this connection is that we do not think that there is any hardship imposed by this tax of 8s. 8d. upon people who have a minimum income of £156 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a saying that it is not the size of the stage that makes the actor, and it seems that upon rather a small issue, one very narrow peg, Deputy MacEntee has raised a question which is fundamental.  We are accustomed to be taught&mdash;very fallaciously taught&mdash;by publicists in this and in other countries that indirect taxes fall more heavily upon one part of the community, and that direct taxes fall more heavily upon another, and I am not at all sure that that system of education in a complete economic fallacy is accidental. I think it is part of a carefully-thought-out and organised scheme of things by which the machine of Government enables itself to extract from the community the maximum amount of its produce with the least amount of grumbling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an idea that, if the working classes can be persuaded that direct tax, income tax, for instance, is only paid by the rich, by those who roll along in beautiful motor cars, with their sunlit gardens, who own expensive establishments <Col N="252" /> and keep up expensive homes, that there would be so much less opposition to the collecting of such taxes. That propaganda has been very ably and very excellently worked, and has been very effective in its results.  The people, especially the poorer people, have been educated into the belief that the taxes that are paid by the rich do not concern them, except that they benefit.  They have been educated into the belief that income tax, and taxes of that kind, do not concern them.  I mean we have actually reached the stage where working-class people are persuaded by their misguided leaders actually to encourage the imposition of such taxation. The effect is, that the consciousness of public opinion being withdrawn from the fact that all the cost comes out of production in the end, the machine is allowed to get away with a proportion of the total production of the State which, under any intelligent system or with any clear understanding of the facts, it would not be allowed to get away with.  It is clearly to the interest of indirect taxpayers to reduce, as much as possible, the unnecessary imposition of direct taxes upon those who pay direct taxes, and it is directly to the interest of the direct taxpayer to reduce in every possible way the burden of indirect taxation which is imposed upon the indirect taxpayer.  The scheme of driving these two people into opposite camps, into persuading them that the indirect taxpayer has an actual interest almost in the increase of direct taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which Deputy MacEntee raised was, that this was a direct tax, and to that extent deserved a certain amount of passing encouragement.  He took the point that if direct taxation did consciously filter down so that the payment of direct <Col N="253" /> taxation should consciously be ever present in the mind of the ordinary voter, that voter would have a much more direct interest in the Government of the State, in keeping down the expenditure of the State, and in curbing the wastefulness of the expenditure of the State.  I think that point is very soundly taken.  I was over in Germany shortly after the war when people were very, very poor indeed, when wages rates were of a character we do not want to contemplate in this country, and yet they were paying direct taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between this tax and another tax which might be substituted in its place is the difference between the preference a person might have between being boiled in oil or fried in butter.  Our attitude is that we prefer whichever system is the more painful, for it will bring home more quickly to the minds of the people what they have got to do is to get down to the root of the thing and reduce expenditure, and for that reason the more the machine runs with friction, and the more people feel the payment of taxes, the sooner they will come to realise it is in their own hands to change the whole system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>On general grounds our opposition to this Bill remains as we expressed it on the Second Stage. We feel that the burden of taxation which it imposes upon the whole community is still excessive.  As I remarked in the debate on the Second Reading, I think we are the most heavily taxed country in Europe.  I feel that the Government during the progress of this Bill during Committee did nothing that would substantially lighten the burden upon the general taxpayer.  It is true that in relation to the income tax they saw their way to accept certain modifications in principle, modifications which we suggested, and they promised to make them the subject of an investigation by a Departmental Committee.  Unfortunately they have not been able to accept and embody those very useful suggestions in the measure in Committee.  We feel that the present position of the country and the tax-paying community is such that unless some very significant alleviation of the burdens imposed upon them is granted, that industry will be unable to thrive, will be unable, in fact, to survive, and that next year the financial position of the State will be much worse than it is this year, bad and all as it has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel also that the whole question of the incidence and manner of taxation ought to be seriously investigated by the Government.  In discussing the amendment which was moved by Deputy Davin, I suggested that some consideration should be given to the problem of associating the taxpayer more directly with expenditure.  It is true, of course, that the present association, very much to the disadvantage of the taxpayer, is a very close one. But it is an unconscious one.  The person who buys tobacco, the person who buys beer or stout, the person who buys chocolate or sugar buys these things without a full consciousness of the fact that in the price which he pays for a particular commodity, he pays one proportion to the man who produces or manufactures the article, and he pays another moiety of that price to the Government.  He is, in many cases, as I said, not consciously aware of the fact that when purchasing the article he is at the same time paying taxation.  I think this general statement is true&mdash;I have not at the moment at hand the figures with which I could substantiate it&mdash;that the proportion of taxation which is paid directly in this State to the proportion of taxation which is paid indirectly, is the second or third lowest in Europe.  No <Col N="257" /> other State whose financial system approximates at all to ours imposes so little taxation directly upon the people.  As Deputy Flinn pointed out in his speech on amendment 8, that is not advantageous, because it leaves the ordinary indirect payer of taxation under the impression &mdash;or the belief has been fostered and inculcated in the person who pays taxes indirectly&mdash;that the sole moiety of taxation which is paid by the poorer classes who are in the main exempt from direct taxation is that portion which is collected indirectly.  It makes them generally believe that the more taxation that is imposed directly the greater the burden the richer classes in the community have to pay.  I am anxious, and we on these benches are anxious, that the taxpayer should be associated directly with the payment of taxes, because we feel that if it is brought consciously home to him that he is the person who has ultimately to bear the cost of Government he will discharge his duties as a citizen with much more circumspection, and, certainly, with a great deal more attention than at the present moment.  We feel that he will look more carefully after the millions which the custodians of the public purse have at their disposal to expend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just saying that we were in favour of associating the taxpayer more directly with the collection of the taxes&mdash;more directly with the payment of the taxes.  I think I remarked that at the present moment the proportion of taxation which is assessed and collected directly from the taxpayer is less in the Saorstát than it is in practically every other country in Europe.  There are one or two countries&mdash;France and Italy&mdash;where the proportion of the direct to indirect taxation <Col N="259" /> is possibly lower than it is here. But in Germany, Great Britain, Norway, Sweden and, I think, in Spain, the proportion of direct to indirect taxation is higher than here.  I think that that is a good thing.  As I said before, it makes the taxpayer more keenly aware of the fact that the money which is collected from him is taken out of the fruit of his labour, whether he is a worker and employed or whether he is an employer and also a worker.  I do not wish at all to endeavour to propagate the fallacy that an employer cannot be a worker.  An employer necessarily must be a worker.  The only difference between&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>An employer must be a worker.  An employer has great responsibilities, and, because an employer pays direct taxation, he often-times feels that because he pays that taxation directly, any increase in taxation imposed in that manner falls upon him and presses upon him more heavily than upon those who are in his employment. In actual fact, taxation which is imposed directly falls not upon the upper classes, not upon the rich, not upon the wealthy, but ultimately is collected from the poor because ultimately it is collected from those who are the primary producers. When income-tax is imposed upon a whole industrial system, upon every competitor in any industrial system, upon one class of producers as a whole, that class of producers, when it comes to selling the products of its industry and to seek that price for it which will return to it not only the actual cost of production, but also the actual profit which is necessary to enable those producers to live and their industry to expand, naturally fixes the price of the product with some advertence to the over-head charges and the cost of production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring <Col N="260" /> to make the point, to establish the case, that the principle of this Bill is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a case which could be argued on Second Reading.  The Bill is now at a stage where no further amendment, except a verbal amendment, is possible and the debate, of course, is restricted to what is actually in the Bill.  Objection to the Bill may be taken, but not on the ground of what it does not contain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>In that event I presume I shall have to take the Bill as amended in Committee and deal with those particular sections of it which embody the objectionable features that we find in the Bill, or which fail to embody those principles which we consider desirable.  In the discussion in Committee on Section 1 of the Bill we introduced some amendments embodying a principle to which my friend Deputy Flinn has given the title &ldquo;the principle of discrimination,&rdquo; a very useful principle that, when taxation is imposed by our Government, it should be of such a nature as would discriminate in favour of Irish industry and Irish enterprise as compared with external enterprise and external industry. We did not put down any formal amendment relating to that on the Order Paper for the Report Stage of the Bill, but we think we can, with advantage, carry the discussion of that particular principle a stage further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That principle is not embodied in the Bill. The Deputy is simply endeavouring to repeat the arguments used in connection with amendments while in Committee. These arguments failed to convince, and the amendments were not, in fact, embodied in the Bill.  The Deputy cannot traverse the ground covered on the whole Committee Stage again, and he must confine himself to the general principles of the Bill as he finds it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am criticising the Bill on the grounds that it does not embody this very desirable principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That was possible on Second Stage, but not on the Report Stage.  On the Second <Col N="261" /> Reading Deputies can object to the Bill on the grounds that it does not contain certain principles, and they can later put forward amendments which can be considered in Committee, but at this stage no further amendment is possible &mdash;no amendment of any substance&mdash;and the Deputy cannot repeat the kind of speech that could be made on the Second Reading or in Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose exactly to repeat a speech which could be made on the Second Reading or in Committee.  I remember the Minister for Finance, who at the moment is not here, was good enough to say that he would like to consider further certain principles of taxation which we suggested to him.  One of the objections he had to a certain proposal of ours was that there were certain industries which are well-established and which make good progress.  In regard to these there is no difficulty in obtaining further capital if it should be needed for the purposes of extension.  These industrious people do now suffer from the difficulties which this amendment sets out here.</P>

      <P>To the Bill as amended?  Am I entitled, in stating the reasons why I desire this Bill to be rejected, to show that the Bill as a whole, because it does not conform with certain ideas we have in regard to taxation, is not a good Bill, and should not be accepted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that that particular type of argument is late at this stage.  It would be relevant on Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully submit that a Bill which emerges from Committee may be a different Bill to that dealt with in Committee, that it has been so amended that even the <Col N="262" /> principle of the Bill, the operative principle, may have been changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be impossible, that the principle of a Bill would be so altered.  It could not be altered in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, shall I say, the machinery whereby it was sought to make the principle of the Bill operative was altered in Committee?  For instance, you could have the case of a Bill in which a certain Committee was to perform a certain legislative function, that the function might remain, just as in relation to this Bill the purpose of the Bill is to impose and collect taxation in a certain way.  The fundamental principle is the collection of taxation.  The machinery which makes that principle operative is the machinery which we have considered in Committee, and which in certain respects we have altered or amended, possibly for better, possibly for worse. I think what we are entitled to consider at this Stage is whether the Bill, as a whole as amended, not any particular amendment of it, is a good Bill. I agree with the principle of the Bill.  I agree that, as the cost of Government must be defrayed, taxation must be collected, but I feel that the means whereby it is proposed under this Bill to collect taxation are not the best that could be adopted.  I believe that they are not the means by which the least damage, if I may say so, will be done to Irish industries.  I feel that, in fact, there are certain things in this Bill which are disadvantageous to Irish industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, for instance, the fact that under Section 1 of the Bill income tax is being imposed at a rate of 3/- in the £, that is to say, at a rate substantially below that at which a similar tax is imposed in Great Britain.  As I pointed out in the Committee Stage, the effect of that situation has not been seriously considered by the Minister for Finance. It, of course, appeals to people who live in this country and who draw unearned income to be told that they are paying income tax at a rate which is 25 per cent. below that paid in Great Britain, but the reactions of that tax upon the Irish investor have not, I think, been seriously taken into account by the <Col N="263" /> Government.  As I endeavoured to show, the very fact that income tax in Ireland upon unearned income is 25 per cent, below that in England makes investment in English enterprises so much more attractive to the Irish resident who pays income tax than to the English income tax payer resident in England as to entice Irish capital to seek investment in England.  One of the things I should like to see embodied in this Bill was the principle of discrimination to which Deputy Flinn referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot refer to that, as it was not included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am expressing the wish that it had been included in the Bill.  I believe, indeed, that if that principle had been included one of our main objections to the Bill would have disappeared, but I would like to consider the effect of Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4&mdash;every section, in fact, which relates to collection or which imposes income tax or sur-tax.  They are all of the same tendency, as I said before, to encourage Irish capital to seek investment in English enterprise.  One of the economic problems which we as a State have to face is the tendency of industries, profitable, well-established industries, here to pass out of the control of citizens of this country and into the control of those who are not citizens.  That tendency is aggravated in a marked degree by such taxes as are imposed by Sections 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 of this Bill&mdash;in fact, every tax which partakes of the nature of a tariff upon imports, every tax which is imposed as a protective tariff to protect Irish enterprise. We frankly admit all these facts. We have never denied the fact that every tax of that description tends to aggravate that tendency to which I refer, namely, to take the control of profitable, well-managed Irish enterprises out of the control of citizens of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have many examples of that. There was a tax imposed on chocolates and sugar confectionery.  That tax has been productive.  I believe, of a great deal of good.  It has created a con-but <Col N="264" /> one of the effects of it, as of all siderable amount of employment here, protective tariffs, one of the disadvantages of these tariffs which we are anxious to secure the State against, and one of the dangers has been that, particularly in the case of chocolates and sugar - confectionery, manufacturing enterprise in this State has passed out of Irish control.  I may, in fact, say that all the undertakings which we had, Williams and Woods, the Savoy Confectionery Company, N.K.M.&mdash;every one of them with the solitary exception, I believe, of the Urney Company, has been absorbed by greater enterprises across the Channel.  We felt that if the Minister for Finance had accepted the principle which we urged on him, one of the things he would have done would have checked that tendency, because discrimination in favour of the native income tax payer would have ensured that an investment in profitable Irish manufacturing enterprise would always yield a greater return to citizens and residents of this State than to those who are not citizens or residents here.  That is one of the important effects of that proposal of ours to allow a deduction of 20 per cent. from all unearned income derived from investment in Irish enterprise before fixing the assessable income.</P>

      <P>I submit, so far as the more recent portions of my speech are concerned, that I have discussed the disadvantages of imposing income tax upon unearned income which is 25 per cent. lower than income tax imposed in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with that question from the point of view that investment in Great Britain undeniably gives a wider market and greater convertibility because of the greater possibilities of capital appreciation, and offers much greater possibilities of capital appreciation, and offers much greater possibilities to an Irish investor than an Irish investment would.  In order to save time and in order to be strictly relevant, I referred to the fact which I thought I had established in Committee, that because of this difference in the income tax rates, the Irish investor was able to and did draw&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I was saying, <Col N="266" /> on account of there being different rates of income tax ruling here and in Great Britain, there is this fact undeniably, that an investment which would yield the British taxpayer a net return of 3.72 per cent. upon the amount invested would yield the Irish taxpayer, who had invested in the same enterprise 3.92 per cent.  Because of that fact Irish investors would always be able to take up stock in the British market at a price which would seem attractive because it is the demand in the British market which fixes the price of stock there.  I argued from that that the whole conception which underlay Part I of the Bill, instead of being advantageous, as the President seemed to be under the impression it was, to the Irish investor, and instead of being a help to the Irish investor, is actually a handicap in so far as Irish industry might require to secure Irish capital.  I was then proceeding to suggest that certain preferences which we proposed, would have counteracted the ill effects of the difference in income tax rates here and in England.  I was going on then to deal with Part II of the Bill which relates to Customs and Excise and I was considering the Customs duties in so far as the duties are protective tariffs.  I was dealing with what every person knows to be the general disadvantage of protective tariffs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;recognise that strict orderliness is incumbent on everybody in the House.  As far as I understand, we are to discuss the contents of this Bill.  One may discuss the contents of a Bill in that it is good, that it is bad, that it is over-full, or that it is lacking. I am trying to get that view.  It seems, therefore, that what I have to do is to discuss the actual provisions which are here, because they are here; actual provisions which are here, which are bad, because they are bad: and provisions which would fit into the general scheme of such a Bill as this, which are not here, and in their being not here, destroy the integrity and completeness of the measure itself.  For instance, sub-section (1) of Section 1 says that income tax shall be charged for the year beginning on 6th April, <Col N="268" /> 1928, at the rate of 3/- in the £.  That is a flat rate, and I am going to suggest that a flat rate of that kind without limitation&mdash;I will not use the word discrimination&mdash;or without alleviation, on industries of all kinds and characters, on methods of attaining income of all kinds and character, does not fit into the scheme of things which would be designed by one who took a large outlook, not merely upon the present necessities, but upon the future possibilities of the country.</P>
      <P>I, for instance, am very little concerned indeed with what the income tax is upon existing income in this country.  I consider and regard the income tax of 3/- upon existing income in this country purely in relation to the fact of whether that 3/- is a flat rate upon all existing income, is an encouragement or is a discouragement to the production in this country of the income which does not exist, and the income which must exist if we are to maintain in this country a reasonably-sized population upon a reasonable standard of widely distributed frugal comfort.  I object to sub-section (1) of Section 1 on the ground that a flat rate of this kind is a direct discouragement; that it does not recognise the things that ought to be recognised; that it does not deal with the things that ought to be dealt with; and that it does not envisage a Finance Bill as a Finance Bill ought to be envisaged: as an instrument of production, as one of the controlling influences, the determining avenues which decide along which path production shall flow.  I object to sub-section (1) of Section 1 of Part I upon that ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a silly idea abroad and it is incorporated in that section that income tax of 3/- or 4/- or 2/-, or something of that kind is a thing which can be put down in bald language of that kind, and justified without regard to its consequences.  Who pays that income tax in the ultimate? Surely it is a matter which ought to be in a Bill of this kind.  There ought to be in sub-section (1) of Section 1 of Part 1 of this Bill something which would clearly state that 3/- in the £ income tax shall be charged under certain conditions.  It is one of the basic <Col N="269" /> propositions in economics that any cost which is common to all competitors in industry has to be added to the cost of the goods sold by all competitors in that industry before competition begins to operate to cheapen the price of goods. And, in so far as capital is one of the three or four necessary concomitants of production, and in so far as fluid capital is required in this country urgently, and in so far as fluid capital can obtain, whatever we chose to do to prevent it, its living international wage, then if we are going to keep capital flowing into that industry we must pay to it that living wage.  And that living wage is a net wage, a net wage after the deduction of all its disagreeableness in costs, wherever the income accrues.  Therefore we have in this particular section a statement that at the rate of 3/- there shall be added to the cost of production in this country&mdash;in so far as the cost of production in this country is expressed in the position of fluid capital &mdash;3/- in the £.  I object to that.  We have stated in sub-section (1) of Section 1 of Part 1 of this Bill that exactly the same onus and burden is to be put upon capital whether it is functioning in Irish industry, for the purpose of producing wealth out of which the general State shall be maintained or whether it is merely being taken for purely luxurious purposes.  For that reason I object, and that is the first of my objections to sub-section (1) of Section 1 of Part 1 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) states that super-tax shall be charged for the year beginning on the 6th April, 1928, at the same rates as those at which it was charged for the year beginning on the 6th April, 1927.  Why the same rate?  Why the same rate upon all things?  Why no differentiation?  Is there any suggestion in that section that consideration has been given to the idea that a Finance Bill, like every other Bill which is introduced into this State, is to be judged by this test: whether it is one of the functioning machineries of increased production in the State?  Not at all.</P>
    <P>Income tax, like all taxes, filters back, and must be paid out of the total production of a State and, therefore, eventually must be taken from the producers <Col N="270" /> in the State.  But to suggest that all the people in the State and all the producers in the State are in exactly the same position, as this clause does, relative to the State, that without discrimination of person, without discrimination of trade, without discrimination of intelligence, of industry, and energy, without taking into question whether they are adventuring into the difficult task of producing a difficult wealth or whether they are simply lying upon their oars, these two clauses themselves are quite sufficient to condemn this Bill from the point of view of any large constructive effort in relation to wealth.</P>
    <P>I could take this Bill word for word and clause for clause, but at the moment I prefer to pick out, as some &ldquo;queen courtier unbidden that brings her gems to the sun.&rdquo;  I would rather choose here and there from the mass of wealth and riches of the follies of this document than merely trace the sequence of folly on which it has been constructed.  You have in this Bill the amazing proposition that the actual means of production, an actual piece of the functioning machinery of production, shall be taxed and shall be increased in price.  There is no other meaning in the suggestion that the commercial lorry, used for commercial purposes, should, upon its capital costs, be taxed for the purposes of revenue. You might just as well tax coal.  You might just as well tax lubricating oil. You might just as well tax management itself.  I can see a State bankrupt, seavenging in every corner to meet immediate liabilities, with the sheriff in, with the enemy at his door, actually driven to the last limits and to the last expedient to which hard-driven bankrupt men are driven&mdash;I can see them doing things like that. Men sell their cattle to pay their annuities. Hundreds of thousands of cattle were sold in the last few years to pay arrears of income tax, but then the sheriff was in on the men.  This is the philosophy of the man who has the sheriff in the house.  Let us tax the means of production.  Let us drive up the cost of transport.  Let us increase the cost of production in this State, and this from a Government who came <Col N="271" /> here the other night and told us that in relation to a great industry the question whether or not it should have protection would be decided upon the fact that its cost of production must be as low as the cost of production in the most highly developed industrial States in the world.  And this Finance Bill, which I ask Deputies to judge and examine not merely as a financial instrument but as a responsible contribution of a responsible Government to production in this country&mdash;this amazing Bill, actually, deliberately, for the purposes of income, increases the capital cost of a producing instrument in this State.</P>
    <P>Frankly I, personally, as one who has a certain amount of respect for the conventions of economics, could not, if I were to imagine an inditement to offer to a responsible Government in relation to finance, if I were asked to express in a sentence folly that was abysmal, I could not find a sentence more severe than that which accurately describes this clause in this Bill.  And what for?  In order to get part of the twenty-three or twenty-four million pounds which our national housekeeper tells us are necessary for the housekeeping.  You and I as ordinary people know that we have to decide what is available for housekeeping and have to keep our housekeeping within the limits of that which is available.  The purpose of this Bill is to get the amount of money which they say is necessary, not the amount we can afford.  There is no man in this State, at the present moment, who thinks that within the actual existing production which is going on in this State and the probable production which will go on in this State as far as we can predict it on ordinary limits&mdash; there is no sane man in this country who thinks that we can afford to take out of that limited existing mass of production or lack of mass of production the amount we are now taking.</P>
    <P>The capital of the whole of this country has been recently estimated by a representative of the American Government who came over here at <Col N="272" /> between £400,000,000 and £600,000,000 that is for the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The capitalised value of £24,000,000 is £480,000,000.  That is what we are paying for the mere functioning of government in this country, for the housekeeping that is going on.  That is what that Bill is for, to absorb the whole produce and product of £480,000,000. What are you getting for the £480,000,000?  What are you doing without because you are spending the whole product of £480,000,000 inside the pages of this Finance Bill?  What are you getting for it?  &ldquo;Bankrupt of intelligence, bankrupt of initiative, bankrupt of everything of value to Ireland.&rdquo;  Those boomerang words come back on the man who uttered them.  They are true of the Government that framed this Bill; true in every detail&mdash;bankrupt of intelligence, bankrupt of initiative, bankrupt of everything of any value or use to this country.  And when it is all done, what does it amount to?  £800,000 or £900,000 included in the balancing of this Budget made up of non-recurrent revenue.</P>

      <P>Included in the Finance Bill are, I believe, some of these non-recurrent revenues.  I may be wrong, but that is my recollection.  At the end of all these taxes, at the end of all these clauses&mdash;and I have not gone through them all yet&mdash;there is the fact that we cannot even carry on on the basis of this Finance Bill.  It is not a question of judging this in detail, word for word, but does this Finance Bill, which is the statement of your housekeeping for the next year, represent any static condition?  Does it represent something which can go on?  It represents something which has to be torn up, it represents the admission that we cannot carry on upon these taxes, that we are bringing into revenue in this Finance Bill things which will not be available next year, and we will still have the same costs.  It brings into revenue things which are not revenue <Col N="273" /> at all.  It is equivalent to a man who sells his car to buy petrol to drive it.</P>

      <P>Let us take another of the gems from this collection.  A farthing a pound on sugar.  What for? I am objecting to the contents of the Bill.  The basket contains things which ought not be in the basket, and the basket does not contain things that ought to be in the basket.  It contains things which not merely are neutral or negative, but which are actually harmful. We are charging a farthing a pound on sugar in order that we may be able to keep up a rate of expenditure upon existing and inadequate social and governmental services which absorb the whole usufruct of £480,000,000.  We are doing it in order that we may spend so many millions on the Army.  If we were not, we would not require that farthing.  If we had not in governmental and other ways a standard of wasteful and luxurious expenditure which is not reproductive, we would not require these things.  My biggest objection to this Bill is that it does not provide that money. The fact that it is not capable of continuing to provide it is bad enough. That is very shameful from an economic point of view.  It is bad enough that this Budget should have been balanced within this Bill by provisions which would be a despair and a contempt in the mind of any responsible Minister for Finance.  But what is really tragic is that it does provide and does suggest a continuance of extracting from the community a total sum which the community cannot possibly bear and ought not to bear.  The first and best reason for rejecting this Bill is that it does provide for existing services, extravagantly carried on, an amount of money which we cannot afford to spend on these services.  The second reason is that it provides an amount of money, and extracts from production a total amount of money which is a burden upon production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every single penny that is provided for in this Bill must be added to the cost of the production of goods which <Col N="274" /> you try to sell in competition.  Can we afford to burden the cost of continuing production in this country with twenty-four millions of money?  If we cannot we should reject this Bill.  Can we afford to have a Budget that is only balanced by raking and seavenging into every financial corner for the dregs?  Is that the condition we are reduced to?  Is this House going to pass a Budget which contains and uses, as ordinary revenue to meet ordinary expenditure, nearly a million of money which will not exist next year?  Balancing your Budget&mdash;that was one of the ten points of little Willie, but little Willie has told, unfortunately, some of the truth lately.  Twenty million pounds of a debt, and two and a half millions of a debt charge.  Try to reconcile these two statements&mdash;twelve and a half per cent. upon our debt. Something is wrong somewhere.  They have been balancing their Budget up to the present on windfalls and lucky bags&mdash;arrears of income tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, generally an intelligent gentleman is intelligible sometimes, but apparently not in this case both intelligent and intelligible, because I would be very glad indeed to hear all that the Minister for Agriculture has to say; I should be very happy to give way while he has any words of wisdom, while he suggests any train of thought, while he opens up any avenue of argument which I may have forgotten. No hope! I want the House to take three broad lines in relation to rejecting this Budget; one, that it covers a sum which is extravagant; two, that it obtains that sum in a manner which <Col N="275" /> is nationally uneconomic, and the third point I will deal with later.  This Budget is to provide funds for the maintenance of all sorts and kinds of things.  It is because they say they want the money that all these provisions are there; it is not because the money is required.  If, for instance, the Minister for Justice had not said in this House that a Civic Guard who had kept his technical assault within the court valuation of £10 to £40 was a very good servant of the State, if that was not the standard by which good service in that highly expensive avenue of expenditure of this State was governed, what would be the amount of expenditure required upon that service?</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Justice had been prepared to say that the offence of a Civic Guard, which was below the technical valuation of £10, when it was an assault committed upon a subject of this State, was an offence which should meet immediate and condign punishment, what would be the different relations between the ordinary member of this State and the whole judicial system, and what would be the reaction upon the cost of the whole of the preventive service in this country of a widely distributed knowledge to the community that the Minister for Justice stood for a very different atmosphere in relation to the liberty of the subject than that which that statement made by him in this House in answer to a question, represents? If, for instance, the Minister for Agriculture, who pours through this House as through a funnel, laws and regulations of all kinds, had been a good lawyer, what would have been the effect on the efficiency of the law which he administers?</P>

      <P>Is there any machinery by which an ordinary member of this House could have a glass of water?  I do not suppose there is any machinery by which an ordinary member of the House could intermit his duty in the House while waiting for that drink of water.  Let us take another case.  The real beauty in architecture, and the real beauty even in the Finance Bill, is the bringing together, in obviously beauty-producing relations, things which are in harmony.  Now, it was an act of pure, unadulterated genius to bring together in this Finance Bill the relief of entertainments tax on race meetings and the imposition of a farthing a pound on sugar.  I want to be just to my political opponents.  I should be very sorry that that gem should remain unrevealed.  I am quite sure that no man on this side of the House could be capable of rising to those supreme heights of imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing which, in my opinion, is gravely defective from the larger statesmanlike point of view in this country is, that it does not envisage the educative effect which this Budget could have been used to give by the reorganisation of taxation in the direction of making people actively conscious of what they pay.  This House will recall a lesson in economics by a great outstanding and pre-eminent professor of that art.  Starting with a calculation which the reasonable discretion of the authorities excluded from the records of this House, he went on to prove, or at any rate to assert because coming from such an authority assertion is proof, that if the ordinary farmer in the country did not lick stamps, did not smoke tobacco and did not drink, did not write letters and did not buy stocks or shares, that he paid no tax.  One of the tragedies of this State is that a lot of people believe that, and a lot of people act as if it were true and act very definitely to their disadvantage. This Finance Bill, in what it includes and in what it excludes, in what it does and in what it fails to do, means in fact that you pay taxes, though you do not know it, on an infinity of things. If you did know you were paying tax on them all the time, the public opinion of the country would rise as one man <Col N="277" /> organised to refuse to have taken from them their means of livelihood by those taxes.</P>
    <P>A man cannot tie his shoe lace in this country without paying tax, he cannot be born, he cannot be married, and he cannot die without paying tax, he cannot go into a restaurant or into a railway carriage dining room, he cannot bequeath or inherit land, he cannot consume any of the goods carried over the ordinary roads or in a motor car without paying tax.  I went through it with a very careful student the other night who knows a great deal more about these details than I do, and I found that if the statement was true that a farmer did not pay tax, the first thing that would happen is that he could not farm, he could not eat, he could not live, he could not wear clothes he could not do anything because he was so surrounded and meshed in with all sorts of taxes.</P>

      <P>If you will allow me for a moment, it is perfectly obvious that a man who could not do any of the things which I have said he could not do without being taxed, could not breathe for long.  This Finance Bill also provides&mdash; at any rate the statement was made by the Minister in introducing it, in justifying it and in making it fill out to cover with its exiguous garments the broad nakedness of the Irish economic land&mdash;for the artificial and arbitrary collection of arrears of income tax not provided for in the ordinary manner.  Income tax, as those of you who pay it know, is burdensome in the sense that it takes money from you, and that it is almost more burdensome in two other ways, in that it sets upon your conscience the task of deciding how near to the average acceptance of <Col N="278" /> the obligations of income taxpayers you are prepared to go, with all the pains and penalties of the third degree which you go through in the process of income tax authorities explaining to you that your standard is not the same as theirs.  I would like to have seen in sub-section (1) of Section 1 of Part I. of the Bill it stated that 3/- in the £ was the tax, or that it was not the tax, because it is not the tax.  This Bill purports to cover the expenditure of the year, and it is going to cover that expenditure by using the income of may be, five years in advance, and it is going to maintain that standard of expenditure. To conclude, if this State is to develop out of a poor narrow place in which about 3,000,000 of people win an exiguous living from one of the most uncertain trades in the world, in a country in which that trade is utterly uncapitalised, and in which production is directed not to the maintenance or manufacture of men, but to the production of land in exchange, one thing is essential, and it is not provided in this Bill that every unnecessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Cuirim in aghaidh an Bhille seo.  Tá maoin sa tír agus is féidir an tír a dhéanamh níos saibhre ná mar tá.  B'fhéidir ná fuilimíd ró-shaibhir ach tá maoin go leór san tír.  Tá a lán slí chun na tíre do dhéanamh níos saibhre agus tá fir go leór chun san do dhéanamh agus chun saol compórdach do thabhairt do na 3,000,000 daoine atá sa Stát. <Col N="279" /> B'fhéidir go bhfuil go leór maoine ann do dhá oiread daoine.  Ach, in ionad an scéal a bheith mar san, tá gorta agus ganntanas sa tír agus, rud níos measa ná san, tá an imirce ann.  Dá mbeadh againn, mar Aire Airgid, fear eolasach agus a chroidhe san áit cheart, bheadh a mhalairt de sgéal annso.  Thiocfadh leis Bille níos fearr ná an Bille seo do thabhairt isteach.  Ní abraim, agus ní abrann Teachta ar bith ar an dtaobh so den Tigh, gur féidir leis an Aire an sgéal iomlán do leasú i mbliain amháin ach, dá gcuirfeadh an tAire chuige i gceart, thiocfadh leis, i gcionn chúig mblian, crot níos fearr do chur ar an tír.</P>

Tá tuairim £1,000,000 á chaitheamh againn gan aon teacht thar n-ais don tír.  Tá beagnách £2,000,000 á chaitheamh ar an Arm agus tá cuid mhaith den méid sin ag dul amú.  Ní abraim gur cóir gan Arm a bheith ann in aon chor.  Sé mo thuairim gur cóir Arm do bheith againn ach creidim gur féidir Arm níos fearr agus níos líonmhaire bheith againn agus gan ach leath an méid airgid do chaitheamh air.  Deirtear linn go bhfuil fonn ar ógánaigh na tíre suim do chur i rudaí a bhaineas le h-arm agus más mar sin atá an sgéal ba chóir dúinn scéim cheart a bheith ceaptha againn.</P>

Tír bheag isea an tír seo agus níl an méid saibhris againn gur féidir linn £2,000,000 do chaitheamh mar sin.  Ní dó liom gur cóir nó gur ceart é sin. Dá mba rud é gan ach leath den méid sin do chaitheamh, ní bheadh an oiread sin cánach ar an dtír.  Dá dtiocfadh linn an cháin do laghdú bheadh an tír níos sona agus bheadh seans ag déantúisi na tíre dul chun cinn.  Có maith le sin, tá a lán airgid á chaitheamh ar phinnsiún.

Níl aon rud fónta déanta ar son na tíre ag an gcuid <Col N="280" /> is mó de na daoine atá ag fáil an airgid seo.

I mBaile Atha Cliath, tá ganntanas mór mar sin agus tá an sgéal céana ag na bailte móra agus ag na bailte beaga ar fuid na tíre. In gach áit tá easba tithe.  Dá gcaithfeadh an tAire an t-Airgead gur féidir leis a shábháil ar an rud so, bheadh leigheas ar an sgéal so i gcionn cúig mblian.  Ach níl sé sásta an t-airgead go shábháil agus do réir a bharamhail féin agus baramhail na ndaoine atá as taobhadh leis ní shábhálfar é.</P>
    <P>Tá 20,000 líontighe i mBaile Atha Cliath gan tithe maithe acu.  Nílim sásta ná féidir an t-airgead d'fháil chun tithe do thógáil ar son na ndaoine seo.  Níl pioc san mBille seo chun a theasbáint go bhfuil éinní fónta ag an Aire ná ag an Rialtas á dhéanamh chun ceist seo na dtithe do réiteach.  Tá rudaí eile mar sin gur ceart airgead do bheith againn in a geóir.  Acht níl airgead le fáil.  Dá mbeadh an t-airgead le spáráil, ba mhaith an rud congnamh do thabhairt do bhaintreabhaighe an Stáit.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House regard this as a very bad Bill, and we want to say so far as we are concerned at all events that it is not our Bill.  It may go forth from the Dáil as the best product of the different parties, but we on this side of the House disown it, and in short we consider that it is not a Bill that the House should be in any way proud of. We think it is neither helpful nor. stimulating to any Irish enterprise.  We think it is packed full with injustice. We think it is a mean Bill.  The new duties are duties, curiously enough, levied on articles which are not produced in this House&mdash;I mean in this country.  While all the world in imposing customs duties looks to the industry that prevails within the country or that could possibly be built up within the country as a thing to protect, we in this country, in our very superior wisdom, look for articles that we neither produce nor are likely to produce at any time in the present generation.  I think that is a very extraordinary course for a Finance Minister to take.  We have heard no excuse for it, and we think it is absolutely injurious to the country.  As Deputy Flinn has pointed out, one of the things selected for new taxation this year is at the present moment a very important part of production, that is the commercial lorry.  We think that any Finance Minister looking around at the state of the towns in Ireland at the present time and appreciating, as he would necessarily do, the great need for developing means of <Col N="282" /> employment&mdash;we think that no Finance Minister would have resorted to the means that the present Minister for Finance has resorted to for some curious and mysterious motive.  I am not going to speculate as to what his motives are, but the Finance Minister is not ignorant of what is going on in other countries.  He is not ignorant of the tendency even in our nearest neighbour to protect the home industry.  He is not ignorant of the demand from a big and influential section of the Irish people that several of the industries which are at present in need of protection should get protection; he is not ignorant of the demand of a great many people that a substantial protection should be imposed for these industries.</P>
      <P>Yet in putting on new duties he chooses tyres and motor vehicles, neither of which is likely to be produced in this country for a long while, and then he offers by way of encouragement to the coach-building industry that when the chassis is brought in without a body he will allow three months' credit for the duty on that chassis.  I do not think that anybody who knows the system by which that trade is going on here, and knows the big finances that are at the back of it, would consider that that concession is worth a moment's thought.  That concession is not going to stop the importation of bus and lorry bodies&mdash;is not going to stop the importation of these articles for one hour; and the Minister for Finance was merely playing with a very important thing to many hundreds of people, with an industry that could be built up here, and probably be one of our proudest industries.  He is merely playing with it when he offers that as a concession to the builders of motor bodies in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, with regard to the double income tax, we were certainly amazed to find the Minister for Finance confessing there could be no interference with the pension list so long as the double income tax arrangement continues. That is, there could be no attempt to differentiate between pensions enjoyed by people who are living outside the Saorstát and the people who are living <Col N="283" /> at home.  We think that before that arrangement was made there should have been a big effort made to differentiate in that matter.  The other evening I was talking to an Irishman who was home from the Argentine.  He was discussing that matter and he said: &ldquo;I came here intending to settle here, but ever since I arrived in the country I have had nothing but bother about income tax on money I earned in the Argentine.  You do nothing to discourage people leaving your country. In the Argentine if I enjoyed £100 of a pension from the Argentine Government. I dare not live outside the State; yet in this country you seem to keep all your penalties for those who attempt to come back to their native country, who happen to have made good in other countries and who come back to settle down in their native land.&rdquo;  That is another of the curious anomalies that prevail in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to double income tax.  In a discussion on double income tax the Minister for Finance explained that an essential <Col N="284" /> part of the double income tax arrangement was that there could be no differentiation in regard to pensions enjoyed within the State and outside the State. I think that is relevant enough, even for Deputy Cooper.  We consider that the sugar tax and the failure to give any concession with regard to the cinema tax show a meanness that this House should not be guilty of.  We know that the Party opposite have very high opinions with regard to the rewards for service here.  They have utter contempt for £1,000 a year as a reward for a man doing any service for the State.</P>
      <P>Only a third-rater should be asked to accept £1,000 a year, at least so we have been told, in effect, again and again.  The same Ministers, however, and the same parties, in order to collect the very big incomes which they consider necessary, have to admit here that the poor unfortunate wretch who goes to a cinema and pays sixpence so as to escape from the sordidness of slum life and unemployment, must pay a tax.  We cannot afford to abandon the tax on that unfortunate wretch.  If the Ministers have such high notions they certainly can stoop very low, in my opinion, in order to maintain that fine display.  No country that has any self-respect could say to its citizens through its Parliament: &ldquo;We cannot give you houses, we cannot give you decent wages, and we are forcing you into a position where you have to pay higher for everything you buy, where even education is more or less wasted on you.  We are doing all that, and we cannot afford to give you sixpence worth of amusement without tax.  You must contribute to our upkeep while you go to cinema performances.&rdquo; That is a curious contrast in the minds of Ministers and in the minds of members of this House if they pass this Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are satisfied that the sugar tax could have been avoided.  With all the poverty that prevails at present and with the small farmers in a position of despair, we think that any attempt to add to their cost of living should have been avoided, and we are satisfied that it could easily have been avoided.  We <Col N="285" /> think there is much more room for cutting down expenses and that other things could have been taxed with greater advantage and less injustice than sugar.  On the whole, we are not satisfied that this Bill is the best that could have been produced.  We think it is going to hit the under dog much more severely than is necessary.  We think that where there is such a strong defence put up for maintaining a State institution, whose members probably get £5 an hour for every hour they spend in it, and when we can afford such extravagance as that we could, at least, ask these people to be content with less rewards and ask many of those who are enjoying rewards, which are much more than are necessary for the standard of comfort suitable to a country like this, to be satisfied with a little less, so that people living in the slums, in wretched houses all over the country and living unfortunate lives, might at least have sixpence worth of amusement without any tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to point out to members of this House the defects of this Finance Bill.  If they would honestly consider the merits of this Bill I would have no doubt, as Deputy Flinn forecasted, it would be thrown out unanimously.  If we consider Section 2, which contains a promise to the people of salaries of £2,000 and over, as against the section which deals with the imposition of a farthing a pound on sugar, we will get a good indication of the principles which, in general, underlie the Bill.  If the Government were not in a position this year to relieve that privileged class of super-tax payers, what was the necessity of putting in a clause in the Bill telling them that they were going to be relieved next year?  Why did they not leave out that clause, and why, when putting the farthing tax on sugar, did they not follow that by a clause saying that from the year beginning the 6th April, 1929, this tax shall not apply?  They did not, however, do so. They put the farthing a pound on sugar and, so far as we know, it is going to remain there, even though next year we have to take off this super-tax from the big incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out already, this <Col N="286" /> is a bad Bill.  The Bill was introduced in order to provide sufficient money to carry on the services for the year.  The case would be bad enough, very bad, if we were requiring the amount of money raised under this Bill to carry on the services.  It would put us in the position, as already pointed out by Deputy Flinn, of being at a great disadvantage against our competitors for foreign markets, even if we were to live within this income, but the question is, are we, even when we have this money voted, going to live within such income?  I see in the Accounts of 1926-7&mdash;I do not know if this year is going to turn out the same and we have no reason for thinking it will not&mdash;that the normal receipts from normal sources was £25,060,000 and the normal expenditure for that year was £27,024,000, a difference of a little over £2,000,000.  Against that there was £331,000 more in the Exchequer at the end of the year than was there at the commencement.  That makes a deficit of £1,632,000.  When we examine this normal revenue we find under the heading &ldquo;Miscellaneous Receipts&rdquo; one or two particular items which cannot in any circumstances be regarded as normal receipts.</P>

If we find that money was voted under similar circumstances and that the House was left under a similar impression in former years that the money raised by the Finance Bill was sufficient to run the services for the year, and if we find that in previous years it took more than that money to do so, I think we would be entitled to assume that the <Col N="287" /> same thing might happen this year.  On a previous occasion, for instance, a sum of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill we anticipate a certain income to defray the cost of administration for the year, and as I am ruled out of order in drawing attention to what I might call the principal source of some of that income I must leave that point.  The Bill, as has been pointed out&mdash;and I think a matter like this could not be stressed too often&mdash;might be called a rich man's Bill.  Wherever a concession was given it was given to the people with money such as race-goers, who can afford to pay twenty or fifteen shillings for admission to a racecourse; and wherever a concession was refused, it was refused to the poor person who could afford at the most to take a sixpenny seat at a cinema or theatre.  Wherever additional taxation was imposed it was imposed in such a way as to burden the poor person rather than the rich person&mdash;such as in the case of the farthing on the pound of sugar.  We all know that if the housekeeping account of the poor man were taken for a week against that of the rich man, the proportion of sugar used by the poor people would be higher than that used by the rich, because if there are children in a house&mdash;and there are as many in the poor man's as in the rich man's&mdash;sugar is a necessary part of their food.  It is necessary for the life of children in particular, and therefore a poor man is compelled to buy a certain amount of sugar.  This tax, I hold, falls very unfairly on the poor man.  I cannot certainly see any saving feature in this Bill.  There was not one big gesture made that would justify our approval of this Bill, and I think that we would not be doing our duty to the people we represent unless we were to vote against it unanimously.</P>

      <P>I would like to say something against this Bill, too, as regards <Col N="288" /> the taxation on spirits and beer, but when I find there is a new army up against me I say to myself that I am almost a prisoner.  I have only to warn those who are in the trade&mdash; the barley-growers, the brewers and the workers&mdash;that they have a tough time in front of them.  I intended to raise this question on the Report Stage, but, as I pointed out, I find that I have no help from any side of the House. Whatever chance I had before, all my hopes are destroyed now with this new army up against me.  As far as the remainder of the Bill is concerned, I look upon it as taxation that is necessary for the carrying on of the government of the country.  No Government can carry on without taxation, and I believe that this Government has given every consideration to the needs of the people before they imposed the taxation that is necessary for the security of the people of the country, and for that reason I shall vote for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it is only fair to myself to say that what I said was not in the nature of being insulting, but was rather intended to be humorous, in a manner in which I would not object myself to the same kind of thing being used towards me, which I think is a pretty fair test as to what anyone might say.  I think I am entitled to say that, although if the Ceann Comhairle takes the view that it might be regarded as being hurtful, I do not want to press it.</P>

      <P>I see.  I am sorry that I am deprived of the opportunity of saying what I have to say by using an example applied to the situation, showing that by the process of imposing so much taxation a deadly sickness will fall upon the country.  I will leave that alone because I can make my point without it.  Deputies may be weary at our stressing the fact that the terms of this Bill are going to make evil for the country.  They may feel that we are emphasising that too much.  I do not think that the average man outside will disagree with us.  Everybody at present feels the burden of taxation. Everybody feels that the increases of taxation which we find in this Bill are going to fall heavier and heavier upon people.  Although they groan under it, they have been persuaded that this taxation is necessary.  I submit that the first step that we should take would be, not to impose this taxation, <Col N="290" /> but to admit that we are in such a state that under the present conditions we cannot pay our way because, if we go along living in a fool's paradise, at the end of a year or two we are going to be faced with far greater ruin than at present. We are, as it were, in the position of tenants on an estate where the title has been sold and handed over to an alien enemy.  In itself that is an abstract question.  But, as a direct result of that surrender, you find that a rent is being put upon these tenants&mdash; and this Bill is portion of the rent&mdash; and that that rent is such as to eat up all the powers of production of the tenants.  That, in fact, is the condition of 90 per cent. of the producers to-day &mdash;they cannot produce enough to live on and they are simply living on capital from day to day.  It is only a question of time until this Bill, together with other elements, will have worked the ruin of the people, and the greatest desires of Cromwell and Elizabeth will have been carried out through financial means such as these.  Aims and ends will have been achieved through financial means which were not achieved by the Black and Tans.  One of the economists said a very wise thing, that all tyranny expresses itself in finance. I say that our Party is doing the greatest duty to the country and to every individual interested in its prosperity in emphasising again and again that this is part of the machinery for the ruination of the people.</P>

It is all very well to laugh and take the matter in a light manner.  I do not object to taking it in that way.  Sometimes one can bring home truths by a jest rather than by being over-serious, but, at the same time, we cannot get away from the fact that at present the average man is from day to day facing the reality of having to live upon capital, and that at the end of that he sees nothing but emigration and the breakup of his home.  It is in the light of that fact, in the light of that whole atmosphere, that we must consider and decide whether this Bill is making for the prosperity or for the ruination of the country.  I submit that the more we oppose this Bill, because it is making for the ruination of the country, the more we are doing our duty to the country, and no one can charge us with going in for what is called barren obstruction. It is nothing of the sort.  It is the most fruitful thing we can do, and the best thing for the country.</P>

      <P>I have listened very attentively to the discussion, and I have heard the case for big business admirably stated by Deputy Flinn, although I daresay he would not be quite pleased if I said that he advocated the claims of big business as against the claims of the wage or salary earner who has to pay income tax on a relatively small sum.  I am interested in the small wage earner or salaried person who finds it very difficult under present conditions to make both ends meet, and I ask the Minister: Is it worth while, seeing all the expense and trouble it must mean to his Department, to attempt to collect income tax <Col N="292" /> from some of the wage and salary earners to whom I refer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave private notice this morning to the Minister for Justice of the following question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Justice whether it is a fact that the five Republican women prisoners in Mountjoy Jail, Sighle MacInerney, Eva Jackson, Sighle Humphries, Mrs. MacDermott and Florence MacCarthy, have gone on hunger strike; whether the primary cause of this hunger strike has been the refusal by the prison authorities to give those prisoners political treatment; whether in answer to a protest against the refusal of that treatment the prison authorities have ill-treated these women, and whether it is the policy of the Government to treat men and women convicted of political offences as criminals.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister got notice, I take it he has had an opportunity of investigating the facts in this case, and finding out whether it is or not a fact that these women are on hunger strike, and also, whether it is or not a fact that the primary cause of the hunger strike is the refusal by the prison authorities to give these prisoners political treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that one of the prisoners, Sighle MacInerney, was arrested on the 25th January, 1928, and that she was charged with the possession of arms and treasonable documents and sentenced to six months imprisonment. With respect to Sighle Humphries, I understand she was arrested on the 17th May and charged with treason and embracery and that she is on remand; she was arrested in the street near her own house and was not allowed to inform her people of her arrest.  I am informed, also, it is becoming a practice of the detectives to arrest women like that, take them to <Col N="293" /> prison and have them searched for documents and so on.  Florence MacCarthy, I understand, was arrested on the 10th April and she was charged under the Treason Act with assisting and maintaining a military organisation not established by law, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment. I have no details with respect to the other two ladies, but I am sure that the Minister for Justice has.  What I am anxious to know is, as I have said, whether it is or not a fact that these women are on hunger strike, and whether it is or not a fact that the cause of their being on hunger strike is that they have been denied political treatment.  There has been an attempt made, all the time, by the Executive Council to follow on the lines of Dublin Castle here, and to pretend that there is no such thing as political prisoners.</P>
    <P>There were a good many sacrifices made from 1919 to 1921 to compel the British authorities to distinguish between criminals and those who were fighting for a political principle, the principle in this case being the right of the Irish people to be completely free. In every civilised country there is a distinction made between criminal classes and those fighting for this principle; and it shows the position that we have been brought to when we find Ministers giving an excuse for their action precisely the same as given by Ian MacPherson, Short, and Hamar Greenwood. I hope that Deputies, here, who understand what was the basis of the fight that we put up against the British are not going to follow the example of the Executive and pretend now that they do not understand what these women are fighting for or what is the principle that is at stake.</P>
    <P>These women, I understand, have been prevented from associating one with another.  They have been for weeks now in solitary confinement.  Everybody who ever attempted to study the prison system, apart altogether from those who have experience of it, and surely there are a number of Deputies on both sides who know what solitary confinement means, knows what it is likely to mean for women such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> I was looking up, in the Library, the prison reports for some years past and there is one feature of them which is indicative of cruelty.  There are no people who can be more cruel than some of our people, no people that I would trust less with the control of prisons because in the present circumstances they have not got the long tradition that other people have about the necessity of treating human beings as human beings and not treating them as beasts. One of the things I noticed is that there has been a continued increase in the number of people who have been sent from prison to mental hospitals.  In 1923 I could find no case of anybody who was sent to a mental hospital who was not regarded as insane on committal. In 1924 one was sent to a mental hospital who was not insane on committal.  In 1925 the number went up to three and in the last report available it mounted up to five.  Now I suggest that that rapid increase indicates that the people in charge of the prisons now have not the experience that is necessary to give them a proper understanding of what the treatment of prisoners should be.  I hold that that increase of insanity in those not insane on committal points to something very serious, and I think it is the duty of the House, at once, to set up a Commission of inquiry into the whole prison system.  It may be said, perhaps, that there is an increase in the number of prisoners and that this is a mere increase in proportion.  It is not.  The number of prisoners at the end of the year, 1923, was 830, in 1924, 940, in 1925, 1815, and in 1926, 759 so that while the number committed to mental hospitals went up from one to three and then to five the number of prisoners in jail, at the time, were actually diminished so that nobody can say that it was an increase in proportion to the number in prison.  As I say most of us know the brutalities that can be practised in prisons.</P>
    <P>We know that under the English system, even though the regulations themselves were brutal, the people who were in charge and responsible for carrying out the regulations were tied hand and foot, and every care was taken to see that they would not abuse <Col N="295" /> the powers given them over the unfortunate individual who was at their mercy.  But of the Free State prisons the experience of some&mdash;I cannot speak myself in the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I have no complaint to make myself of ill-treatment. Fortunately, I am able to live alone when I want to, but I know people on whose word I can rely who have complained of ill-treatment.  I know that there have been brutalities practised for the last four or five years in these jails&mdash;certainly during the period 1922, 1923 and 1924&mdash;which were a disgrace to human beings, to put it at the least. I, for one, would like to be satisfied that there is not a continuance still of anything of the same kind.  I was once in Arbour Hill and I heard an unfortunate prisoner there screaming as he was being beaten.  He was a Free State soldier.  Some of them tried to communicate with me and tell me of the treatment they were receiving.  At that time if I had been able to give voice to my feelings or get the public to understand it, I would have liked to compel the Free State authorities to send in people to see that their own soldiers in that prison were not being ill-treated, simply because I regarded them as human beings.  Now, these are Republican women, some of whose names are known to us personally.  I know myself that in the home of Sheila Humphreys the Republican Cabinet met when the Black-and-Tan regime was in progress.  With that home I associate many of the acts of that Cabinet, and nothing that this young girl is doing now is different from anything which was preached in that home by members of the Republican Cabinet, some of whom are now persecuting her. I think the time has come for that sort of thing to stop, and that if you are not going to face this question on the basis of a national policy, you ought at least face it on the basis of humanity.  If you are going to deprive these girls of their liberty you ought at least to give them fair conditions under which to live.  The conditions which are being <Col N="296" /> imposed on them are very different from the conditions that the ordinary criminals in America and other civilised countries receive.  I have taken some interest in this whole question of prison treatment.  I think it is one of the general problems that ought to interest anybody who has any idea at all of government, or of social questions of this particular kind.  I have had experience, as most of us had, of the British system, and when I was in America I tried to see what the system there was.  I know it is a difficult problem&mdash; a very difficult problem&mdash;but in the case of these girls I think there ought to be no difficulty.  We ought to give them reasonable conditions if we are going to deprive them of their liberty. Remember that the people who are acting as their gaolers now are not merely depriving them of their liberty, but ill-treating them, if my information is correct. These girls, I am told, after coming from Mass on Sunday, went into one cell and they resisted efforts to separate them until they went away at 9 o'clock to separate cells.  After that they again tried to associate, and they were pulled and dragged about; their clothes were pulled off by the prison officials.  That is my information.  I hope it is not true.</P>

      <P>What I want, and what I think it is the duty of each one of us here to see is that in these prisons Irish citizens of good standing, who are known not to be criminals, will be treated properly as human beings.  It is our duty to see that they are protected, and that a proper inquiry will be held into the whole system to see that the brutalities which did take place from 1922 to 1924 do not continue, and to examine why it is we have this increasing number of people who were not insane being committed to mental hospitals during the course of their terms of imprisonment, in the years I have indicated.  I do not wish to labour it any further.  I say this: it is a serious matter for us to consider whether the policy of the Executive which is being kept in power here by the majority is going to reproduce in <Col N="297" /> the prisons now under its control the same inhumanities which we associated with the British system here, and in the fight against which we had Tom Ashe dying and many other men who died afterwards of hunger strike.  A fight was made by them, not merely against the British, but a fight for the rights of political prisoners in general. Those are the rights these women are fighting for.  I say there is no reason at all why these women should be ill-treated, and I ask Deputies to assist us in compelling the Executive to look after these prisoners properly, if they are going to keep them there, and prevent them from being ill-treated.  If we find that there is still ground for believing that this ill-treatment is continuing we intend moving that there should be a proper inquiry held by a Committee of this House.</P>

      <P>The question which Deputy de Valera put to me to-day was concerned with the five prisoners whose names he has read out.  Two of these prisoners had been duly tried and sentenced by the courts.  They were sentenced to six months imprisonment each in the second division.  The other three prisoners are awaiting trial.  The two prisoners who have been sentenced are receiving the ordinary treatment of prisoners in the second division.  Those who are awaiting trial are receiving the ordinary treatment of prisoners awaiting trial, with all the rights and privileges that prisoners awaiting trial have got.  The Deputy said that these prisoners wished to associate together. I believe they did.  But there is a prison regulation, a very right and proper regulation, in my opinion, that convicted prisoners and persons awaiting trial should not be allowed to associate together.  As a matter of fact, the three awaiting trial were allowed to associate and to take their exercise together, but they were not allowed to take it with the two who had already been convicted. That would be against the prison regulation, which, as I say, is a very sound and sensible regulation.  I am informed that on the 5th instant these five prisoners did cease taking food. The food is there for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I gave in October full particulars of every single prisoner who had been transferred from a prison to an asylum.  I said: &ldquo;During the past twelve months two prisoners were transferred to Dundrum Asylum.  One of these was, however, retransferred to prison, as the Asylum authorities were not satisfied that he was insane.  No prisoner was released during that period owing to mental affection.  Forty-three persons in prisons since the 28th June, 1922, are now inmates of mental institutions, 15 of these being in Dundrum and 28 in other institutions.  Of the 43, 38 were insane on committal, or found incapable of pleading, or found guilty, but insane, by the jury.  There were, therefore, only five persons who apparently developed insanity in prison.&rdquo;</P>
