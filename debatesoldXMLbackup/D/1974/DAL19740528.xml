    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a commitment in every new development in the psychiatric services to maintenance of the psychiatric patient in the community. Health boards are being encouraged to develop plans which will give adequate emphasis to out-patient facilities and, in general, planning for the future assumes a considerable shift from in-patient care to treatment in the community.</P>
      <P>The emphasis on community treatment will be reflected in the future role of the psychiatric nurse.  A report of a working party which was appointed to examine and report on the psychiatric nursing services is being examined by my Department in consultation with the unions concerned.  I am not, therefore, at present in a position to say what detailed changes there my be in regard to future structure of the service.</P>

      <P>Such workers are, however, employed by a number of voluntary agencies such as Comhairle Le Leas Oige and also by the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear on the figures the Parliamentary Secretary gave.  He gave 1.1 odd million in response to this question.

      <P>Under the provisions of the Acts, income from property personally used or enjoyed is assessable as means; such property, of course, includes land beneficially occupied whether it is owned, leased or rented.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be some misunderstanding about the case in question.  The position is that the person was initially a recipient of unemployment benefit, a social insurance payment which was made <Col N="11" /> to her at full rate for the maximum duration of 312 days until exhaustion of that entitlement in February 1973. As she did not requalify for a further spell of that benefit, she became an applicant for unemployment assistance, which has been in payment at a reduced rate because of means assessed against her.  I may add that at her request her means are at present in course of reinvestigation.</P>

The right to appeal was there for anybody who was opposed to the provision of this service station and no one appealed.  Once the decision is made it would not be appropriate for the Minister for Local Government to start on his own an inquiry into a decision taken by either a local authority or a planning authority.  To be fair, when this decision was taken the Roads and Motorways Act was not in operation. It is possible that if the decision were taken subsequent to the passing of that Bill the Department might have taken a different line.

      <P>As I announced in the budget statement of 3rd April, 1974, public service pensions will, in future, be revised each year on 1st July by reference to rates of pay in operation on that date.  Accordingly, on 1st July next, and on the same date in future years, public service pensioners will have pension parity.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have done is to provide complete parity from 1st July every year.  There was a time when several years went by before retired public servants got increases in their pensions.  Now they will have automatic parity from 1st July every year.  Some idea of the significance of this can be gathered from the fact that narrowing the gap as we did this year by a further three months is costing £1.6 million.  Since 1970 the gap has been narrowed at an Exchequer cost of £15 million, so there has been quite a considerable improvement.  I might say that the right to automatic parity from 1st July every year which is now extended to public servants is not available, by and large, in the private sector.</P>

      <P>At their meeting of 17th December, 1973, the Council agreed the text of a resolution on the introduction of a second stage of economic and monetary union which would cover the period 1974-1976, subject to later settlement of paragraphs dealing with regional and certain other socio-economic policies.  The Council also agreed the texts of accompanying instruments as follows:</P>
      <P>Directive on stability, growth, and full employment.  This relates to the availability to Member States of an adequate set of economic policy instruments for the promotion of stability, growth and full employment in the Community;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proportion of Irish official external reserves held in gold at 31st December in the years 1969 to 1973 was: 1969, 5.6 per cent; 1970, 2.3 per cent; 1971, 1.7 per cent; 1972, 1.6 per cent; 1973, 1.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> In the discussions on international monetary reform in the Committee of Twenty of the International Monetary Fund and between the EEC Finance Ministers, in which I have participated, it has been generally agreed that the role of gold in the monetary system should be reduced.  At the same time, it is recognised that gold is at present a significant component of total reserves and that arrangements are needed to enable countries to use gold to finance balance of payments deficits.  I am in favour of such arrangements provided they are in keeping with the objective of reducing the role of gold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be an over-statement of the position. The EEC Finance Ministers considered the position of gold in the international monetary field and decided that in present circumstances it would be desirable to unfreeze those stores of gold which have remained frozen notwithstanding the right of central banks to dispose of gold on the market.  Following the meeting at Zeist, consultations have taken place with non-EEC countries to see if a general pattern of agreement could be obtained to unfreeze the gold.  One simple objective would be&mdash;I think there is general consensus about this&mdash;that the position of gold would be diminished rather than increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has no responsibility for the issue of certificates under section 17 (7) of the Finance Act, 1970.  A subcontractor who wishes to obtain a certificate under section 17 (7) of the Finance Act, 1970, enabling him to receive payments without deduction of tax for work done on a subcontracting basis must satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that he has complied with the statutory requirements, one of which is that he must have an established place of business.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners inform me that the company in question, the principal in which was an individual who carried on the trade of plasterer, commenced trading on April 1st, 1974, and applied for a certificate on April 4th, 1974.  As the company did not show that they had an established place of business a certificate was not issued by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of showing it to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, not to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance.

      <P>That is, that it is an anti-avoidance device.  When this matter was queried in the House before&mdash;as it was in the days of my predecessors, even by Members of their own party&mdash;the Minister of the day, quite rightly, justified this provision because avoidance by some people means that those carrying the load have to pay more.  In each case, it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to assess, on the facts, whether or not a person is in such a position and way of business and has such stability of location and so on as to enable them obtain payment of the tax due.  As I understand it, there is no evidence to indicate that the Revenue Commissioners have been unreasonable in the use of this section. But, if Deputies are aware of any particular cases in which the section has been applied unfairly, I shall be only too happy to refer the matter to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>And one that should be encouraged by all means.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the machines being sought on that occasion were not suitable for heavy or constant work or movement to another area?  They were actually in Donegal and, I understand, are still there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are not there now.  I understand the sentiments of the Deputy very well but, when the conditions were presented to the association, they did not accept them. What then could the Office of Public Works do?  Let me say further that the two excavators which were available for hire in 1971 have been allocated to other works.  There are now no machines of suitable size available for hire to the association.  In fact, with the development of the Boyne works and the starting of the Maigue scheme, it is anticipated that it will be necessary to buy a number of machines of this size in 1976.  It would be possible next autumn to hire one machine but for a period of two months only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary undertake to reconsider this question since he has now partially agreed that a machine would be available for a short time in autumn?  Would he consider making the two machines available under the original arrangement?  The whole scheme depends on the contribution which the Office of Public Works will make to the carrying out of this work. It is an entirely voluntary effort from money raised locally, voluntary labour and contributions from various people, including the county council itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand well and appreciate the efforts made by the association but they lost their chance of seizing the opportunity when the machines were offered in 1971.  Correspondence lapsed in 1972 and nothing <Col N="29" /> has been heard of it since.  I will look it up again.  I will communicate with the Deputy and he can then communicate with the association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that there was also some problem about getting the engineers from the Office of Public Works to co-operate fully with the engineers from the local authority? Would he further agree that they were not of the same mind as to what form the scheme should take and that that was the reason why there was a delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The association had also sought the services of the Office of Public Works engineer for the survey, design and supervision of the work to be done.  These were refused and eventually the county council made an engineer available.  But the information at the disposal of the Office of Public Works&mdash;hydrographic data and so on &mdash; was made available to the association and to the engineer from the county council.  Therefore, it is wrong to say that the Office of Public Works did not co-operate.  They did.</P>

      <P>There are two EEC directives on this subject generally, namely Directives 69/464/ EEC on control of potato wart disease and Directive 69/465/EEC on control of potato root eelworm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive on wart disease, also known as black scab, provides for measures to be taken to prevent the spread of that disease from any land where it is discovered.  These include <Col N="38" /> a prohibition on the growing of potatoes in the contaminated land and a restriction on the growing of potatoes in a surrounding safety area to varieties which are immune to wart disease.</P>
    <P>The directive on potato root eelworm provides that potatoes may not be grown on land where this pest has been found but a special derogation may be granted by a member state under which varieties resistant to eelworm may be grown on such land under conditions which give adequate safeguards against the spread of the pest.</P>
    <P>The provisions of these directives are implemented in Ireland through statutory orders made under the Destructive Insects and Pests Acts under which strict measures are operated to prevent the spread of wart disease and potato root eelworm.  In fact these controls have been in operation in this country for many years before our accession to the EEC.</P>

Under the Treaty of Accession, the provisions of these directives were required to be brought into operation in this country as from 1st July last.  However, similar provisions to control disease have been operating here for many years by statutory order. We were doing this before we got the directives from the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for this Bill arises from the proposal that title to children's allowance under the Children's Allowances Acts should be vested in the mother of the child rather than in the <Col N="48" /> father as at present.  This will be done by amendment of the normal residence rules under the Children's Allowances Acts, but as a result it will be necessary to ensure that there will be no change in the existing position regarding the payment of increases of benefit, pension or assistance in respect of qualified dependent children under the other social welfare schemes which at present is also governed by the children's allowances rules.  I hope that the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill will help Deputies to understand more readily the provisions of the Bill, which are of a somewhat technical nature.</P>
    <P>As I have said, title to children's allowance is at present vested in the child's father and this has been the position since the commencement of the scheme in 1944.  In the great majority&mdash;about 85 per cent&mdash;of cases the fathers have, in fact, nominated the mothers to receive the allowances but convincing representations have been made to me that the mothers should have title to this allowance in their own right.  The report of the Commission on the Status of Women also made recommendations to this effect.  This is the position in many other countries, including Britain, and I am satisfied that we should do likewise.</P>
    <P>The normal residence rules made under the Children's Allowances Acts determine with whom a child is to be regarded as normally resident, and accordingly with whom title to the children's allowance rests.  These rules will be amended to provide that a child shall be regarded as being normally resident with his mother in the first instance thus vesting title to the allowance in her.  The existing rules, however, while specifically made for the purpose of children's allowances have also been applied by statute to the determination of the normal residence of qualified children under the other social insurance and assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to ensure, when the children's allowances rules are amended, that the position regarding the payment of increases of benefit, pension or assistance in respect of <Col N="49" /> such children, where the beneficiary would usually be the father rather than the mother, is not disturbed. Otherwise the father could not be paid the increases in respect of the children.  The amended normal residence rules to be made under the Children's Allowances Acts will, therefore, in future be applied only for the purposes of the children's allowances scheme and new regulations for determining the normal residence of children for the purposes of the social insurance schemes will be made under powers provided in this Bill.</P>
    <P>These regulations will, with some minor amendments, follow the lines of the existing normal residence rules, and in that way the position regarding the payment of increases of benefit in respect of qualified children will remain unchanged.  The Bill provides that these regulations will also apply in determining the normal residence of children for the purposes of the social assistance schemes other than the children's allowances scheme.  As in the case of the benefit schemes, therefore, there will be no change in regard to the payment of increases of assistance in respect of children.</P>
    <P>There are two provisions in the Bill designed to simplify matters so far as existing payments of children's allowances are concerned when the title is vested in the mother.  It would obviously be unreasonable to require the 300,000 or so mothers who have been nominated by the fathers to receive the allowance to make fresh claims for the allowances in their own right.  The Bill proposes to treat them as having made the original claims and thus the allowances can continue to be paid to them without interruption.</P>
    <P>The second provision deals with those existing claims where the father has not nominated the mother and is receiving the allowance himself. Under the amended normal residence rules which it is proposed to make, the allowance would in these cases become payable to the mother.  It is realised, however, that in many cases the mother would prefer that payment to the father should continue <Col N="50" /> and normally she would do this by nominating the father as payee.  To avoid the necessity for such formal nomination in these cases the Bill provides that unless the mother otherwise elects, the father will be regarded as having been nominated to the mother and the allowance will continue to be paid to him.  The mother will, of course, remain the person entitled to the allowance and if she later elects to receive payment it will be made to her as of right.  In the case of future claims, payment of the allowance will automatically be made to the mother unless she nominates the father or some other person to receive it.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in recommending this Bill to Dáil Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Children's Allowances Act was first introduced in 1944.  It was a most progressive measure in its time and, in fact, this was one of the first countries in which a Children's Allowance Act was introduced.  Over the years it has been amended on a number of occasions, each time enlarging on the scope of the original Act for the benefit of the children of this country, improving the amounts paid, bringing more and more age groups within its ambit.  Now another change has been introduced which we all welcome, that is, the granting of title to children's allowances under the Children's Allowances Act, which is presently vested in the father of the child, to the mother.</P>
      <P>In the context of the social thinking throughout the world in 1944, as I have said, the Children's Allowances Act was a very progressive measures.  I doubt whether, in the context of that time, anybody would have thought of giving title to the allowances to the mother, and the changes made in the social welfare structure in recent years show that, even in a very short space of time, there has been very considerable advancement made in social thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was Minister for Education I judged the efficacy of any changes that I contemplated in the educational <Col N="51" /> system by the manner in which these changes improved the system for the benefit of the child.  I recognised that there were many persons and organisations who had a vested interest in education&mdash;and when I speak of vested interest here I speak of it in the very best sense &mdash; such as parents, teachers, managers, religious, and so on.  But, while I recognised their rights and their duties in the field of education, having taken full cognisance of their views, I finally determined how I should proceed on what I believed to be the best interests of the child.  The system was there, in my view, for the benefit of the child and not the child for the benefit of the system.</P>
    <P>Likewise, in dealing with children's allowances the interests of the child must come first and while we can argue, as it were, as to which of the parents should have title to the allowance we must base our decisions on what is best for the child. The children's allowance, as the name implies, was introduced for the benefit of children.  I feel that perhaps this point was not properly understood by the Government when they introduced the claw-back arrangement related to the children's allowance in their first budget and their action in reversing this decision in their most recent budget is a tribute to our effective opposition to it.  Where children's allowances are concerned cognisance must be taken of the best interest of the children.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House agree with and support the change being made in this Bill.  We can all agree that because of her peculiarly close relationship with the child the mother is in the vast majority of cases the person who should have entitlement to the allowance.  The change proposed in this Bill conforms with the social norms which are operating in this country, norms which assign to the mother the general day-to-day responsibility for providing the physiological and psychological needs of the children.  It is, in fact, paying respect to the role of the mother in Irish life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> It is a fact that two-thirds of Irish mothers spend all of their time in child rearing activities for children under school age, while the fathers spend an average of 50 hours a week away from home engaged in employment, mothers are responsible for the general running of the house.  They perform the function of providing food, clothing, and so on, for the family unit.  They are more available in terms of time and location to present the children's allowance coupon at the post office.</P>
    <P>Another very important aspect of this matter is the fact that the mother is the best guarantee that the money will be put to the best use.  The large numbers of the male population who engage in social drinking and the statistical finding that 11 per cent of the total Irish income is spent on alcoholic drink are factors which cannot be ignored.  Statistics prove that the mother is much less frequently responsible than the father for the break-up of the home or for the neglect of the family.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the most important aspects of this Bill is that it is helping to eliminate in some way the second class citizen status assigned to women who are specially engaged in one of the most important social functions, namely, child rearing.  We hear much these days of equality between men and women.  Those who speak of equality sometimes tend to confuse it with similarity.  Instead of simply giving equality to women there are areas where women should have special rights and women should have these rights particularly in relation to the family.  Where the State provides a specific amount of money for the purpose of helping the family, such as the children's allowance, it is only right that the mother should have entitlement to it.</P>
    <P>Of course, we know from the figures given by the Parliamentary Secretary today that the practical effect of this Bill in relation to the actual receipt of the money will be relatively small because, as the Parliamentary Secretary stated in reply to questions to me today, approximately 90 per cent of the mothers are already <Col N="53" /> drawing the children's allowance. This is not, however, the basic consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like to inquire of the Parliamentary Secretary why it is not stated unequivocally in the Bill that the title to the children's allowance is vested in the mother.  I take it that the Minister proposes to make regulations to this effect but could it not be taken from the fact that the title of the mother to the allowance is not provided in the Bill that the Minister could by regulation reverse the intention in the Bill at a later date?</P>
    <P>I wonder if this legislation would have been necessary were it not for the fact that the normal residence of children in respect of increases of benefit, pension or assistance is determined by the Children's Allowance (Amendment) Act, 1946 and the normal residence regulations under that Act.  Nowhere in the Bill is it spelt out that the mother shall be the qualified person under the Act.  It would, therefore, appear that this right could be taken away at the whim of a Minister in the future.</P>
    <P>The point I should like to make here is that when the Minister draws up the new regulations in relation to the Children's Allowance Act he will also be drawing up regulations which will relate to the payment of benefit, assistance, and so on and I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if it should happen that somebody decided at some future date to change the situation, for example, to vest the right in the father, would it be necessary to bring in new legislation before the House?</P>
    <P>Section 3 subsection (3) of the original Act states that the child will be regarded as being maintained &ldquo;by the person mentioned in whichever of the following subparagraphs is applicable&rdquo;, the first being where the child normally resides with his father, the father and where the child normally resides with his stepfather, the stepfather. In other words, there is a priority situation written into the Act.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned with is, when new regulations are made will it be necessary to bring in a Bill in the case of anyone wishing to change <Col N="54" /> that situation?  The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out in his speech that in Britain the mother is entitled at present to draw the children's allowance in her own right. Quite recently proposals were put forward by the British Government in relation to tax changes which would have resulted in the father becoming entitled again to the children's allowance.  All I am really concerned with is that we should ensure that if such proposals were suggested here at least the matter would have to come before the House.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, cases where the mother by reason of mental illness, mental handicap, alcoholism or other disability may be unfit to discharge her duties.  In such circumstances obviously if the best use is to be made of the money in the interests of the children it would be necessary to give title to the children's allowance to the father or some other suitable person.  I should like to know whether provision would be made in the regulations so that somebody other than the mother in such circumstances would have title.  I know that provision was made in the previous regulations in respect of the mother having the title in circumstances somewhat similar to those I have outlined.  There are also cases where the mother is known for her lack of attention to and care of the children and where she is known to have no sense of financial responsibility.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what he proposes to do in such circumstances to ensure that the children benefit from the money paid by the State.  I do not think this has been catered for.  I accept that there would be quite considerable difficulty in relation to it but I should like to know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has any ideas on this aspect.</P>
    <P>In Part III the general regulations of 1946, in respect of payment of children's allowance, section 10 subsection (3) reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, whenever he thinks fit, withdraw his consent to a nomination under the regulations and <Col N="55" /> in such case the person nominated shall on receipt of notice of such withdrawal send the Minister the allowance book issued to him.</P>
    <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary let me know in what circumstances he would consider the withdrawal of the nomination?</P>
    <P>In a situation where the mother might be regarded as unfit to handle the allowance is there any way in which the Parliamentary Secretary can ensure that the money will be made available in such a way as to benefit the child?</P>
    <P>I should like to raise a legal point here and ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether the word &ldquo;him&rdquo; in section 5 subsection (1) of the Children's Allowances (Amendment) Act, 1946 has a legal bearing or can be interpreted in law as &ldquo;her&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out in a speech he made a short time ago that there are 300,000 cases where the father has nominated the mother to receive the allowance.  He pointed out earlier today that approximately 90 per cent of the fathers have nominated the mothers to receive the allowance. This is, of course, the vast majority of cases.  It is a recognition not only by the father but by society in general that the mother is best suited to receive the children's allowance.  Therefore, this Bill, in effect, is recognising legally what is already the norm in practice. We are aware that in quite a number of the cases where the father has not nominated the mother but has retained the entitlement, the money drawn, to put it mildly, is not used in the best interests of the children but is very often spent on drink or gambling.  In such instances the mother cannot get the money from the father nor can she see to it that the money is properly spent.  We need, therefore, to have a care in relation to the nomination of the father by the mother because in such circumstances the father will be most anxious to hold on to the money and will endeavour, through every means in his power, to ensure that he is nominated even to the extent possibly at times of using physical violence.  I should like the Parliamentary <Col N="56" /> Secretary to take note of this in preparing the regulations.</P>
    <P>In view of what I have said here I am somewhat perturbed in relation to subsection (2) of section 9. Section 9 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Where, immediately before the commencement of this Act, the mother or step-mother of a qualified child was in receipt of a children's allowance in respect of that child, having been nominated in accordance with regulations made under the Social Welfare (Children's Allowances) Acts, 1944 to 1973, to receive the allowance, she shall on becoming the qualified person in respect of that child be treated as having made the claim for that allowance.</P>
    <P>She would then become the qualified person.  I am very much in agreement with this but section 9 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>Where, immediately before the commencement of this Act, a person who was qualified for a children's allowance in respect of a qualified child had not so nominated the mother or step-mother of the child to receive the allowance, that person if he ceases to be a qualified person at the commencement of this Act shall be treated as having been so nominated by the qualified person to receive the allowance unless and until the qualified person otherwise elects.</P>
    <P>I feel that the mother has got to opt in rather than opt out.  For administrative purposes I would accept that the proposal in the Bill would be the simplest thing because, obviously, there would be no difficulty in ascertaining the mothers who are nominated but there would be some difficulty in finding out exactly how many mothers were not nominated.  I agree that there would be some difficulty but when I find that only 10 per cent of mothers are not nominated, I think it would be very well worth while finding out the situation in relation to the mothers concerned and to see that they automatically become entitled to the allowance.  I would strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this matter with a view to seeking <Col N="57" /> a solution.  I have already pointed out that quite a number of fathers who retain the entitlement to the allowance squander the money and will endeavour to retain the right to receive the money.  This section is making it much easier for them because the father immediately becomes the nominated person and it will be only with considerable difficulty that the mother will be able, in practice, to assert her rights.  If this happens the whole principle underlying the Bill will be frustrated and we will be left with the shadow rather than the substance.  There will, of course, be other ways in which it will be possible to frustrate the objectives of this Bill. Where a father, who is presently squandering the money, is forced by circumstances to allow his wife to take over her rights in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  He can quite possibly reduce her housekeeping money by an amount similar to the allowance each week.  While he gives the appearance of accepting the principle in this Bill he will, in fact, frustrate its practical application.</P>
    <P>I do not expect what I am about to suggest can be done in this Bill but while we are endeavouring in a relatively small way to grant the mother what is her right and, particularly taking into account her attention to the needs of the children, I wonder if it would be possible to allow her the money in respect of children under the social assistance schemes.  I expect there would be a legal problem in relation to the benefit schemes in that the beneficiary is a contributor but he is not a contributor in the assistance cases, as in the case of children's allowances.  It might be invidious to differentiate between social assistance schemes and social benefit schemes but if we regard it as desirable and right to vest the title to children's allowances under the Children's Allowances Acts in the mother then it would appear to me to be a logical step to vest the title to other forms of children's allowances in the mother, where this is legally possible.  All the arguments we have put forward, social and otherwise, in favour of the present <Col N="58" /> measure are equally applicable in the other cases I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, in perhaps different words, the apparent complexity of this Bill, where the object is simply to vest title to children's allowances under the Children's Allowances Acts in the mother rather than the father, arises from the fact that the normal residence of children, in respect of whom increases of benefit, pension or assistance are paid, is determined by the Children's Allowances (Amendment) Act, 1946, and the normal residence rules made under this Act. It is intended that there should be no change in the existing position in regard to entitlement to increases in respect of these schemes and the various social welfare payments.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated it is intended to leave the regulations stand as they presently exist in respect of the social welfare services except for a few relatively minor changes.</P>
    <P>Rule 3 of the Social Welfare Children's Allowances Normal Residence Rules 1967, states that a qualified child, who is resident with one only of the persons mentioned in rule 2, shall be regarded as normally residing with that person and with no other person provided, where that person is the mother, who is not a widow or a married woman living apart from her husband, that this rule shall not apply in respect of the child unless the mother so elects and in the absence of such election the person with whom the child shall be regarded as normally residing shall be determined according to rule 7.  That means that the child shall be regarded as normally residing with the head of the household.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is drawing up the new rules, that he gives entitlement to children's allowances in this instance to the mother and leaves it open to her to nominate the head of the house if she so wishes.  This is another instance where it is much more desirable that the mother should have the entitlement conferred on her by law with the right to opt out rather than the present position that <Col N="59" /> she must claim the right or otherwise that it automatically devolves on the other person.</P>
    <P>I take it, from my understanding of the Bill, that, even where the contribution towards a child's upkeep in an institution is made by the father, the entitlement to children's allowances will be the mother's.  It is more necessary in these days of everincreasing price rises that the best possible use should be made of children's allowances.  In times of rapid inflation only those who have families appreciate the great financial problems involved.  In such circumstances it is important that the mother should be the qualified person to receive children's allowances.  As I have already pointed out in 90 per cent of cases the mother already receives the allowance.</P>
    <P>The main reason I welcome the Bill, and perhaps the most important aspect of it, is that it is an acknowledgement of the mother's right. There will always be problems in respect of the use made of the money. Where there is harmony in the home it matters little in whom the title is vested but where there is not harmony there are problems and difficulties, no matter which parent is vested with the right.  In this House we can only do our utmost to ensure that in the end the greatest possible benefit will accrue to the child.  I would again like to state that I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I at the outset, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, say how pleased we are to see you back in full harness after your recent illness.  I welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for introducing it.  I sat for three years on the Opposition benches, from 1969 to 1972, and in many parliamentary questions and Estimate debates I sought the introduction of this measure.  It is a particular pleasure to see that the Parliamentary Secretary has this afternoon introduced this socially progressive measure.  The Government in their 14-point programme indicated it was their intention to remove those discriminatory aspects in social legislation which <Col N="60" /> penalised women in society and discriminated against them.  This Bill is a substantial step in that direction.</P>
      <P>I am certain this socially progressive measure will receive widespread public support.  It has been pointed out that for the past 30 years, since 1944, this anomalous position persisted. There has been no social justification whatsoever for it apart from the fact that this is a male-dominated Parliamentary Assembly, and I suppose it can be said, in fairness, we have a male-dominated departmental attitude.  We also have a society which certainly could not even devise a system over 30 years to trust the mother of a child with children's allowances.  We have certainly rectified a grave wrong here.  I do not think we deserve any great commendation, but the Parliamentary Secretary most certainly deserves the thanks of all for taking this step of considerable significance.</P>
      <P>This change lessens in no way, of course, the joint responsibility of parents.  It in no way diminishes their responsibility.  What it does ensure is that the rights of the mother from the point of view of the maintenance of the children are effectively safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are spending at the rate of £43 million a year on children's allowances. The rate has increased substantially in the last two years.  In the last two budgets many additional millions have been added to children's allowances and these allowances now represent a substantial segment of social expenditure.  I would suggest that there should be some research, a social cost/benefit analysis, into the expenditure of this £43 million.  As we know, there is no relativity with income because, by and large, these allowances are paid unrelated to income. This may sound odd coming from a socialist, but I believe selectivity might be more sharply analysed from the point of view of these allowances.  In making that approach we could achieve a more egalitarian system and this £43 million could possibly be more equitably spread if we had a different system.  I do not say this in criticism of the Parliamentary <Col N="61" /> Secretary.  He has acted with commendable speed in introducing this change.  When I was on the Opposition benches I thought that this matter would require just a simple change.  I now appreciate that it is a fairly complex matter and I commend the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials for dealing so effectively with the matter in such a short space of time.</P>
    <P>Not alone do I believe that there should be some selectivity but I also believe that there should be a special study made of these allowances relative to large families.  Families with more than three children should have matters like these weighted in their favour.  There should be positive discrimination in the case of such families as there should be positive discrimination in the case of single parent families.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that some of my comments may be outside the scope of a Second Reading debate.  I believe, however, that they are well within the scope of the social perspective of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The fact that he is a colleague of mine in no way inhibits me from making these comments. I have had numerous approaches made to me in this particular matter and I am pleased that we, in the National Coalition Government, have now introduced this particular measure.  I certainly welcome this Bill.</P>

      <P>Before making my very brief contribution I should like to say how happy I am to see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle occupying the Chair once more and I hope he will continue to enjoy the best of health.</P>
      <P>I share with other Deputies a certain happiness at the appearance of this measure.  Unlike Deputy Desmond, I do not regard it as an exceptionally revolutionary measure.  I understand the difference is merely a matter of some 10 per cent.  However, that does not take away from the need there was for this measure or from the welcome the House has accorded to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children's allowances has always&mdash; shall I say&mdash;fascinated me.  I have given a good deal of thought to the whole concept of children's allowances.  Today these allowances are taken as an indicator <Col N="62" /> of the respect society generally has for the mother and the housewife, but my personal opinion is that we have not gone any way near the limit to which children's allowances should go.  Discussion on that will be for another day.  In the matter of regulations governing the payment of children's allowances I trust the Chair will accept from me the relevance of a reference to the manner in which these are paid.  I know that a fair number of mothers would not be waiting on children's allowances.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, in my area the history of children's allowance payments to mothers is one of moving to the nearest post office on a certain day at the end of the month.  If we are concerned here about a mother's right to have the allowances paid to her, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary would consider my submission that we should also be concerned about the manner in which the payments are made.</P>
    <P>In the city of Dublin, especially on the perimeter, we know that on children's allowances day there is a situation in which nothing is added to the dignity of the unfortunate lady who in the winter months particularly has to queue up for one and a half hours before the money is paid to her.  It can be said that this is one of the problems attached to the administration of the scheme.  On this occasion I am commenting on what this measure presumably would do&mdash;recognise the position and the dignity of the mother in question. However, anybody who travels through my constituency&mdash;indeed, I would add parts of the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency&mdash;on children's allowances day will be convinced that the manner of payment offends very much in that respect.  I am wondering what will happen in my constituency, a fast developing area with hundreds of families from the Parliamentary Secretary's and Deputy O'Brien's constituencies moving in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not suggesting that the problem has only recently arisen.  If Deputy Coogan or anyone else wants to have a look at the records, he will see that I addressed a question on this to the Minister for Social Welfare to have it rectified.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure some representions were made to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on whether a system of payment could be introduced which would relieve the ladies in question of the hardships attending the collection of benefits which are their statutory right.  I do not think there is any other area where people exercising their rights are forced to suffer the same hardship. I hope that all sides of the House will accept the position as I have indicated it.  I am not saying it is one which manifests itself in Taylor's Hill in Galway or in Foxrock in Dublin.  I can speak only of the areas I am familiar with.  The position of those ladies on what we call children's allowances day is utterly degrading.  I <Col N="64" /> hope the Parliamentary Secretary will accept this as a commentary which warrants his consideration.</P>

      <P>The last speaker referred to what he called &ldquo;those ladies&rdquo;.  There seemed to be a touch of sarcasm &mdash; that it is only the socially deprived who qualify for children's allowances.  I see them driving up in their Mercedes to collect them.  It is good to know that in future the applicant will be the mother. Incidentally, this may ease the situation of the unmarried mother.  There is one type of applicant I see throughout the length and breadth of the country who qualify in a big way.  I speak of the travelling people, the itinerant class. We see great abuses in the different towns and villages once a month when they come in to collect.  In the evening one sees the conduct brought on by the money they have collected for their children.  I feel that instead of money the benefits should be given in kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks will be very brief indeed.  Before putting these forward I want to join with others in saying how delighted I am to see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle looking so well here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which is a step forward in social thinking.  I am a very cautious man but, being a <Col N="66" /> socialist, I welcome it, as I welcome all anti-discriminatory measures.  I feel, however, we need to be very careful in having clauses which will safeguard the persons for whom the allowances were intended.  In this case the allowances were intended for the benefit of the children.  Up to recent years the parent more likely to be wrong or act wrongly was the father, but there will be the exceptional case and it is about this that I am worried. I am concerned that there is not some clause in the Bill to safeguard the children if either parent is remiss. From now on the mother will be the person entitled to draw the allowances. At one time very few of the opposite sex could be found to be under the influence of drink but, unfortunately, we have to admit that there are cases to be found in the country today.  Families break up and while fathers are responsible for this in a good many cases, the mothers are responsible in others. Whoever is responsible, I hold there should be a safeguarding clause in this Bill that the money which should be given to the children is drawn by whichever parent appears to be the more responsible.  Generally speaking the mother is responsible but, if she should fall down in her job, I should like to see a clause inserted that a father could withdraw that money and ensure that it is spent for the benefit of the children.</P>
    <P>There should be some type of arbitration in exceptional cases.  This is the only reservation I have about the Bill. There should be some clause inserted to ensure that an impartial adjudicator be appointed in cases where it is known that the money is not being spent for the benefit of the children.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to insert some type of clause to ensure that, in the event of a mother not being competent of making proper use of her children's allowances, the father be in a position to withdraw the money and see that it is spent on the children.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what Deputy Tunney said.  Some system should be devised, in largely populated areas, to eliminate people having to queue up for long periods for their children's <Col N="67" /> allowances.  The fact that it may have been an arrangement in existence for years is no excuse.  We are moving forward every day; we have more respect for human beings and, when people have to obtain allowances of any kind, they should not be inconvenienced in the process.  It might be an idea to have more days on which such allowances could be collected and devise a system under which people could come in alphabetical order.  Of course, I am talking about the larger populated areas.  It does not affect the country at all.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Chair that it is not entirely relevant to the Bill.  The Bill refers to the person who is to collect the allowance.  The Bill gives authority to the mother whom I think is the correct person.  I shall conclude by asking the Parliamentary Secretary to consider inserting a clause in the Bill to the effect that where a mother might not be responsible, the authority to collect be transferred because, if that is not done, one is on dangerous ground.  Were I bringing in a Bill certainly I would give the mother first preference but I would guard against the ten per cent, or perhaps five per cent, of cases where she might not be so responsible.  There should be some clause inserted as a safeguard against that contingency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of welcoming back the Leas-Cheann Comhairle after his illness.  Like other speakers, I endorse this Bill.  One wonders why it has taken this length of time to make such a change.  It was drafted originally in the Children's Allowances Bill, 1944.  I presume that reflected the thinking of the time when women definitely were regarded as second class citizens and as not worthy or responsible to collect the princely half-crowns being paid at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the many changes he has made in his Department during his short time in office.  As a result of the increases granted by the Government over the last 15 months, the children's allowances have become <Col N="68" /> a real income.  Because of this I welcome this Bill even more so.  As backbench Deputies of this Government, we are committed to looking at all social welfare benefits with a view to making increases wherever necessary.  The children's allowance scheme has a major priority, particularly in the times in which we live. The mother is the person who has the tremendous responsibility of rearing the family and it is right that the allowance be paid to her.  No matter what legislation is introduced, there will always be some anomaly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney said this legislation was not revolutionary and I agree with him.  His party should have taken these steps long ago.  This legislation highlights the difference between this side of the House and the Opposition. The Government are aware of the anomalies that exist and they have taken steps to rectify some of these matters in the Anti-Discrimination Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the numbers of people who queue for payment of these benefits.  Perhaps they should be cashed at banks and the Department might investigate this aspect.  It is a problem in built-up areas on the first Tuesday of each month.  People should be facilitated so that the benefits may be cashed without delay.</P>
    <P>The increase in the allowance has made it all the more necessary that the mother should be the person who receives it.  Where there is a breakdown in the family arrangements some system should be devised to ensure that the money is spent for the benefit of the child.  With regard to the rights of women, in future legislation the married woman who stays at home to care for her family should have an allowance in her own right so that she will have greater independence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Even a male Chauvinist would not oppose the Bill and the fact that 90 per cent of children's allowances have been paid to the mother shows what a magnanimous being is the Irish father.  More than 30 years ago we established the principle of children's allowances and each successive Government increased the amount.  It is right that the allowances should be paid to the mothers because they will use them in the interests of the children.</P>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us if many of these allowances are not being claimed?  Is some money left in a fund which could be distributed to more needy cases?  Children's allowances are paid through the local post office.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to arrange that all other social welfare benefits be paid through the post office for the duration of the Dublin bus strike.  Many people cannot get to the employment exchanges to draw their social welfare allowances and if children's allowances were paid through the employment exchanges many families would have to go without.</P>
      <P>I can recall many years ago a man in the city who campaigned almost in the days of Parnell for children's allowances.  Unfortunately he did not live to see the day in 1944 when Fianna Fáil introduced the scheme. We can claim credit that we led the way in these islands in this matter. Other welfare states followed, but we are glad we set the good example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to improve all aspects of the scheme.  He may have some information, not known to Members of this House or to the general public, of certain very large families who deserve more than the ordinary benefits in the general social welfare code. Perhaps on Committee Stage he could widen the Bill by amendment to include these people?  More than ever, we recognise the great importance of <Col N="70" /> the family as the basic unit in the State and the nation has a duty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This Bill is short.  I do not know if it is necessary as only 10 per cent of the people will be covered but we accept it if the Government think it is necessary. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the points I have mentioned, especially regarding the payment of social welfare benefits through post offices for the duration of the Dublin bus strike.</P>

However, I sincerely regret that this Bill was used as a vehicle by Deputy Coogan to attack a class of person because of the possible misbehaviour of a small group in that class.  There are other people in our society whose behaviour leaves much to be desired and who have not the justification of the conditions in which they live, and the socially deprived way in which they have been forced to live, as have the itinerants.

      <P>Deputy Faulkner stated that social thinking has changed very considerably between 1944, when the children's allowances scheme was first introduced, and 1974.  That is undoubtedly true.  I accept the point Deputy Faulkner made, that in 1944 it would not have been widely accepted <Col N="71" /> that the mother should have been the person to receive the children's allowances. However, he went on to say that the claw-back which was introduced in last year's budget in relation to children's allowances may have been a mistake.  I must agree with the Deputy when he says that.  That is the difference between the Fianna Fáil administration and the present one.  We learned our mistake in a year.  Deputy Faulkner had 29 years to learn his and did not even get around to it at the end of the 29 years.  However unacceptable it might have been and against the tide of social thinking in 1944 that the mother was not the rightful recipient of children's allowances, it definitely did not prevail up to the end of the 1960s and the early 1970s.  It is not too bad making mistakes if you have both the wisdom and the courage to acknowledge them and to rectify them and I think that is the significant difference between the two administrations.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies mentioned the fact that 85 per cent of fathers had already signed over to their wives the right to draw the children's allowances. In reply to a question today by Deputy Faulkner I said the actual figure of mothers receiving children's allowances is 90 per cent, because apart from the 85 per cent of husbands who have signed over, there are widows, deserted wives and unmarried mothers.  Therefore, we are really dealing with 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An impression has been created in some quarters that all the fathers in Ireland are villains, that they are all out whooping it up and drinking the children's allowances while the poor unfortunate mother sitting at home does not get a halfpenny.  That is very unfair to the fathers in so far as the figures show there is only 10 per cent of mothers who do not receive the children's allowances even in present circumstances and that out of the 10 per cent of fathers who retain the right to draw the children's allowances there is a very considerable percentage who do so purely for convenience and it is a mutually acceptable thing.  It is not <Col N="72" /> that he wants the money but the wife might be in bad health, or in rural areas it might not be convenient for the wife to go in to collect the children's allowances.  The husband might of necessity, in connection with other matters, be a frequent visitor to the vicinity of the post office.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of Irish fathers in this respect live up to their responsibilities but, unfortunately, there is the minority who do not live up to their responsibilities and who will not hand it over to the mother and the child or children do not derive any benefit from children's allowances.  It is to rectify that situation that this measures is being introduced. In fairness also it should be said that organised bodies such as AIM who have been advocating this change readily acknowledge that the vast majority of fathers do live up to their responsibilities, but a fairly significant proportion of the 10 per cent do not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner asked what happens if the mother does not live up to her responsibilities.  Like everything else, it is not all black and white and, unfortunately, there are mothers who if they receive the children's allowances will not live up to their responsibilities and it might be better in these cases if the father was paid the children's allowances.  I can assure Deputies that in the event of that situation arising, the Minister can at his discretion, pay the money not only to the father but to any person who, in his opinion, is most suited to receive it for the benefit of the child.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of issues were raised and Deputy Tunney and Deputy Moore referred to the very large queues in certain areas on children's allowance days.  As a Dublin Deputy, I know this occurs and that it causes some inconvenience to the recipients. Deputy Faulkner is one of the few Deputies on that side of the House who has a social conscience and possibly there are other Fianna Fáil Deputies who have exercised their social conscience over the last 17 or 18 years, but the collective social conscience of Fianna Fáil has been in a <Col N="73" /> very deep coma over the last 15 or 16 years.  I am very glad that the Holy Ghost has now descended on them collectively and opened their eyes to all the social ills that exist and have existed over all those years.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for one moment that this is a revolutionary step.  It is something that has been accepted in several countries in Europe over the last number of years.  It is not the be all and end all of the rights of mothers or, indeed, of the rights of women, but it is a step, and it is a step that was there to be taken all through those years, and a very obvious step that could have been taken by Fianna Fáil at least during the 1960s and early 1970s.</P>
    <P>The queues at post offices and all the other social ills that have now been revealed were all there during those years.  Not only were they there but in order to give Fianna Fáil some assistance in the matter we brought them to their attention time and time again.  We got no action on them but if there is one thing that the change in administration has done it has brought a wider and greater awareness of the many social ills and social injustices that exist.</P>
    <P>Deputies were kind enough to say that a considerable amount had been done in the field of social welfare over the past 16 or 17 months.  A reasonable amount has been done, but the Tánaiste would be the first to acknowledge that a tremendous amount more needs to be done and it will not be possible for us to do it all over-night.  There is an accumulation of things that are obvious and the investigation, examination and implementation of some of the things that need to be done that are not so obvious will take some considerable time.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this Bill has now come to the House.  I personally was not aware that it would present as many complications in getting it before the House as it did.  It appeared to me in my ignorance to be quite a straightforward matter but it did present some serious difficult drafting problems.  I wish to acknowledge my thanks to the staff of the Department <Col N="74" /> of Social Welfare and to the Parliamentary draftsmen.  Now that we have the Bill this far, while it will not eliminate all the problems of some of these poor unfortunate women, I hope it will go some of the way towards alleviating some of the difficulties they find themselves in.  As Deputy Faulkner so rightly pointed out, with all the legislation in the world, unless there is agreement and harmony between a couple, it is very difficult if not impossible through legislation fully to safeguard the the interests and welfare of the children of our society.</P>

I shall not go into that now until I deal with it on Committee Stage.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section on which I can again raise the matter which the Parliamentary Secretary has referred to, that is, that there should be an unequivocal statement in the Bill that the title to the children's allowance is vested in the mother.  As I have said, I realise that this will be done by regulation but as I have pointed out, the father is specified in the original Act as having the principal right.  The circumstances in which others would have entitlement are also stated in that Act.  We are making here what could be termed a fundamental change in that we are giving not only recognition to the woman's right but priority to women in this sphere and I would have thought that this should be written into the Bill.  As the Bill stands, the change made here can be revoked at the whim of a Minister.</P>
      <P>The complexity of this Bill has resulted from the fact that the regulations in relation to normal residence referred to much more than to the children's allowance but one set of regulations to be made under this Bill will refer only to the children's allowance.  Because of the fact that the existing regulations refer to other social welfare benefits, the Bill had to be introduced.  New regulations will apply only to children's allowance. Therefore, could a Minister make a change without further reference to the Dáil?  I pointed to the position in Britain where certain changes in the taxation code would result in the father once again having the right to the children's allowance. Can a change be made by the Minister without reference to the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer to that is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but I would like to point out that grave difficulties arose. I thought that to change the entitlement to the children's allowance from <Col N="76" /> the father to the mother was a very simple operation and would involve coming to the House with a very simple amendment to existing legislation that would not be controversial and that it would not take much time to get it through.  After the decision was made to transfer the entitlement to the mother and the matter was gone into by the officials it proved to be an exceptionally difficult operation because of the way the original legislation had been added to and because it involved all other social welfare payments in benefit and assistance.  To divorce the children's allowance from that was a matter that caused legal and drafting difficulties.</P>
      <P>I should just like to make this point: in principle I am not in any way reluctant to do what the Deputy suggests should be done but I would point out that it is the normal residence rule made under the Children's Allowance Acts which determines with whom the child is normally resident and it is the normal residence which confers the title to the payment and in the regulations to be made it will be recognised that the child is normally resident with the mother and that will make her totally and legally entitled to payment of the children's allowance.  Nonetheless, the answer to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, it would not be necessary for any future Minister to come before the Dáil to reverse that position.  That is the factual situation but I think the Deputy would agree with me that he would be an extremely foolish and extremely courageous Minister who would come into the Dáil and suggest that the position should be reversed and that payment should be made to the father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy quoted the new British proposals for a tax credit but they specifically provide for payment of the credit in relation to the children's allowance to the mother.  While in theory the Deputy is making a valid point, that it would not be necessary for a future Minister to come before the House to reverse the decision to give the allowance to the mother, in practice that would never happen.  If the Deputy persists with the point, as I <Col N="77" /> have said, I have no objection in the world to that being included in the Bill if it is possible to do so and if it does not delay the passage of the Bill through the House so as to prevent the regulations being made before the new budgetary proposals are implemented, in July.  If the Deputy cares to leave it with me that assurance I will have the matter examined further and if it is feasible it will be done in the Seanad.  Would that be acceptable?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that. The Parliamentary Secretary does not have to tell me that the matter is complex because I have been going around for the past week with about ten volumes under my arm trying to follow the changes that were being made.  The Parliamentary Secretary will recognise that there is a problem here.  He has pointed out that in Britain in relation to the tax credit situation they have specified that the mother must be the recipient of children's allowances. Nevertheless, I am informed that there was a considerable outcry from the mothers.  Possibly they did not understand it either.  I will accept what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already pointed out, I am somewhat concerned about the situation in relation to section 9 (2).  It reads:</P>
      <P>Where, immediately before the commencement of this Act, a person who was qualified for a children's allowance in respect of a qualified child had not so nominated the mother or step-mother of the child to receive the allowance, that person if he ceases to be a qualified person at the commencement of this Act shall be treated as having been so nominated by the qualified person to receive the allowance unless and until the qualified person otherwise elects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has <Col N="78" /> agreed with me that there are a certain number of that 10 per cent of fathers who do not make proper use of the children's allowance.  They will be immediately regarded as being the nominated persons entitled to draw the allowance when this measure comes into operation.  In those circumstances it will be very difficult for the mother to assert her rights because if the father is already misusing the money he will be anxious to continue to control the money and the mother, to get her rights, will have to make application.  I can visualise that type of person trying to prevent the mother making application.  I suggest that as only 10 per cent are involved it would be well worthwhile, though administratively awkward, to try to find out exactly who those mothers are and to decide that the mother would be the person who would be entitled to the money and the father would then have to make an effort to have himself nominated. This would mean that the mother would have some advantage, whereas the present position makes it easier for the father to retain the nomination because he is automatically nominated when the Act comes into operation.  Because of the type of person we are dealing with here it would be worth considering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full sympathy with most of what the Deputy has said.  In fact, it is the one part of the Bill to which I gave a great deal of thought because I saw the difficulties that could arise.  After considering all aspects of the problem, it was decided that in the interests of the mother this was the best way to go about ensuring that these difficulties would not be presented to her.  Of that 10 per cent of cases we do not know the circumstances or why the father is drawing it. In many cases it is purely by mutual agreement and there is no friction or tension in the home whatever.  Also in that 10 per cent are cases where the mothers are dead and have been dead for some years.  We have no details in the Department because the entitlement has always been the father's.  We do not know whether the mother is alive or, if she is, whether she is living with <Col N="79" /> the father and the children.  We do not even know her name.  We have absolutely no details about the mothers.  We could acquire those details but it would necessitate writing to the father and if the father comes within the category Deputy Faulkner has described, and, unfortunately, some of them do, the repercussions of a query from the Department along those lines in that household would not be in the best interests of the mother.  As soon as we initiate an investigation to find out the mother's name, whether she is resident with him, whether she is alive or not, if he is the type of man against whom we are trying to guard the mother very severe domestic repercussions could ensue.  If we write to the father he can do all sorts of things.  He can destroy the letter or he can confront his wife and accuse her of having initiated the thing.</P>
      <P>We felt, after looking at all the circumstances, that this was possibly the best way we could deal with that. All future applications will automatically be made in the name of the mother but in the possible circumstances of some of those unfortunate women we felt this would be the best way.  A short note from the mother to the Department will have that changed. All we need is very basic information. We must know the lady's name, we must know that she still exists and that she is at least resident with the children. She can take the initiative but she can take the initiative unknown to the husband.  There is no need for the husband to be consulted one way or the other.  She can look for it and it is hers by right.  If&mdash;I mean this sincerely&mdash;any better way can be found of doing this, I would be only too glad to hear of such a way because I have examined it very closely.  I am not tremendously happy with the solution we have come up with but with all the difficulties it is the best solution I have been able to come up with so far.  I have every sympathy with the point the Deputy has made.</P>

I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he will have under the regulations power to withdraw a nomination and, therefore, if a valid reason is given to him in any particular case that the person who is nominated under this Bill is not carrying out his duties properly in relation to the money received, he will see to it that justice is done.</P>

The same thing will apply when the mother has the right and she misuses the money.

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 33, after &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and in addition the Court may by order direct the employer to pay the woman appropriate compensation for wrongful dismissal, if reinstatement in her former position is not considered possible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We believe it is both necessary and desirable that this amendment should be accepted.  The Minister undertook to have a look at the situation where a female employee applies for equal pay, the court finds her claim valid, she is dismissed from her employment and she has no redress.  We feel very strongly about this.  There are no safeguards in the Bill to protect such an employee.  We believe she should be reinstated.  It is discrimination against a female employee to have legislation under which there is no possibility of her being reinstated in her former position if she succeeds in her claim for equal pay.  This is a very real difficulty in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The aim of the Bill is to encourage women to seek equal pay for work of equal value but, if in the process of seeking equal pay, women who successfully pursue such a claim before the courts are dismissed from their employment there is no means by which they can compel the employer to reinstate them.  Surely that is an undesirable situation.  Surely it is a situation that should be covered by this Bill.  The Minister indicated that he was prepared to write in such protection in some other legislation he intends to introduce.  What guarantee is there that such legislation will ever come before this House?  It is in this measure the protection must be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made our views clear on this on Committee Stage.  We were told that our amendment on Committee Stage could be in conflict with the Constitution.  We have modified our amendment to ensure that there will be no such conflict.  We took advice on this.  Why will the Minister not write in this very vital protection into this measure?  It is a basic right to be <Col N="85" /> reinstated if a person is wrongfully dismissed.  The equal pay involved might be quite small and a relatively unimportant factor as compared with retention of employment.  Because of the fear of losing their employment women may be reluctant to make a claim for equal pay.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept our amendment.  Even with this amendment I believe women may still be treated shabbily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister asked what employee would like to go back into some employment having successfully prosecuted her employer.  In rural areas the job is No. 1 because there are not in these areas the same employment opportunities as obtain in more densely populated areas.  That is the problem.  Therefore, those people entitled to equal pay may be deterred from looking for it because of the fear of losing their employment. That is a grave defect in this Bill.  Employers could, of course, co-operate and pay a few fines and the employees would be dismissed without any possibility of reinstatement. The biggest worry for most people is the fear of losing their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this amendment is essential.  We have put forward the case that we should give a guarantee to any woman who applies for the salary appropriate to her work <i>vis-á-vis</i> her male counterpart that her position will not be worsened if her application is successful.  The Minister said a moment ago that a woman could sue in the ordinary courts.  A woman would want to be of pretty strong character to claim equal pay with the possibility that she might be dismissed as a result of her claim. That is why we must insist on this amendment.  The danger here should be put on record and I submit it is greater for women employed outside the cities than in the cities.  In rural areas there is the problem of job scarcity to be contended with as well as competition with males.  In such a situation either the woman would have to accept the pay offered to her <Col N="86" /> by the employer or face dismissal. Her prospects of employment in the locality would be negligible and she would either have to migrate or emigrate.</P>
      <P>I have been reading some stuff on this and my impression is that any firm can beat the provisions in this Bill if they set out to do so.  They can impose a system under which there will be minimum educational requirements for recruitment, for instance, like the position of junior executive in the Civil Service.  Such a situation would result in women being employed only in the most junior clerical jobs, whereas men would occupy the senior and supervisory positions.  In this way men would be inclined to entrench themselves more than ever.  The position then would be that although we would have established that women are entitled to equal pay for equal work, women will find that equal work is merely at the bottom of the clerical scale.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we press the Minister to accept this amendment, to remove the fear many women will have that they will be dismissed if they claim equal pay.  With that danger gone, they can claim equality, and a big headache will be removed not only from semi-State employers but from firms in outside employment, because as the situation is it could result in industrial strife&mdash;I can see the present provision as an incitement to unofficial strikes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I must make it clear that at the moment there is no protection against unfair dismissal under the law as it stands.  Any employee in Irish industry may be dismissed by his employer and there is nothing the law may do to defend him.  His union may have something to say about it but the law as it stands offers him no protection.  As I indicated at the start of the debate, I propose shortly to introduce an Unfair Dismissals Bill which will rectify this situation and gives the employee some protection in law against unfair dismissal, whether he is in a union or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as is almost conceded <Col N="87" /> here in Deputy Dowling's amendment, the situation is not substantially changed.  The amendment does not provide for compulsory reinstatement. It merely provides if the employer is willing to take the employee back, then he can do so.  There is nothing in this legislation to prevent that.  On Committee Stage Deputy Dowling moved an amendment to make provision for a Labour Court order directing reinstatement if a woman's claim for equal pay was judged to be well founded.  That has been withdrawn and Deputy Dowling has also withdrawn his insistence on compulsory reinstatement.  Presumably he came up against the same difficulty that faces anybody in this matter, that there are certain constitutional matters involved.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's latest amendment proposes that the Labour Court should have the power to direct an employer to pay compensation to a woman who is dismissed for having sought equal pay.  This is already provided for in section 10 (1) (d).  It ensures that a form of compensation be made payable to a woman who has been dismissed by her employer, the amount of which would be related to the arrears of remuneration up to 104 weeks from the time she was dismissed. I would emphasise again that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent an employer from reinstating an employee. The fact is, however, that compulsory reinstatement in our present law situation appears to present certain difficulties.</P>
    <P>To answer Deputy Moore's points, particularly in regard to new classifications of employment being introduced, I have announced my intention to introduce legislation concerning the recruitment, training and promotion of women.  In the whole area of how we defend the employee in Irish industry from unfair dismissal, how we statutorily give him a right of property in his job, all these matters I intend to look into in drafting this legislation dealing with unfair dismissals. This legislation we are now discussing is simply about equal pay for work of equal value.</P>
    <Col N="88" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We felt the original amendment was much better and we thought the Minister would accept it. The Minister said that his legal advisers had told him it would be unconstitutional to press for compulsory reinstatement.  We had the matter examined and this does not seem to arise to the degree indicated by the Minister.  At any rate, why not let the employer test it in court?  Surely the woman has a basic right to be employed, and in this amendment there is provision for compensation for unlawful dismissal.  We know there is provision for compensation in the Bill but the 104 weeks may have elapsed before her case comes up and by then the job she occupied may have been filled or it may have been rendered redundant by modernisation or machinery.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we ask the Minister to consider this amendment seriously.  A woman must be given protection against dismissal but as the Bill stands a woman will be reluctant to seek equal pay in certain circumstances because it might put her position at risk, there being no provision in the Bill which would indicate that she must be re-employed.  The legislation is directed generally against a small number of unscrupulous employers who will avail of every opportunity to misuse these provisions.  If the Minister feels he will have power under another Bill, why not embody it in this one and make sure that this Bill will stand on its own merits?  Piecemeal legislation is of no value whatsoever to this House.  The Bill must be a comprehensive measure able to stand on its own merits.  If we introduce legislation which cannot stand on its own merits unless buttressed up by a variety of additional Acts, then we are weak in Parliament.  I believe the Bill must have enshrined in it some indication that a woman can apply freely for equal pay without the risk of losing her job or being adequately compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We framed this amendment when we felt that the Minister would resist, on constitutional grounds, the previous type of phraseology.  We phrased it in such a way that a woman would <Col N="89" /> be compensated if wrongfully dismissed and if reinstatement in her former position was not considered possible; only if reinstatement is not considered possible must she be compensated. That implies that reinstatement in her former position is the factor about which we are concerned. It is unreasonable to ask us to accept this piece of legislation, to so deprive women of an opportunity of applying for their rights.  Many women will feel &mdash;if there is no covering clause to ensure continuity of employment&mdash; they may well allow the situation pass and no claim will be made for equal pay.  The whole basis of the Bill is that women would receive that to which they are justly entitled.  In this Bill there is no cover whatsoever and an unfortunate woman making a claim will be at the mercy of her employer.  If he is a reasonable employer, probably he will concede the claim.  If he is unreasonable, probably he will dismiss her and that will be the end of it.  He will pay the compensation to which she is rightly entitled under the Bill &mdash; that is, equal pay for the period in question but that is a poor substitute for one's job.</P>
    <P>We can foresee many ways in which employers can and will change the situation as they see equal pay claims being implemented.  It may well happen, although I hope it will not, that when the application for equal pay is made some employers will say: &ldquo;It is a new ball game, we require a new agreement for women&rdquo; and make this agreement so objectionable that the claim itself would not be of any great comfort to the women concerned. As we have seen, on the Continent and elsewhere, every type of gimmick and argument has been used by employers in the drawing up of new agreements when the equal pay claims were made.  We want to protect the disorganised workers in the same way as those who are organised.  Whatever chance organised workers have of forcing the issue, because of the availability of union backing and the possibility of other militant action, unfortunates who are disorganised&mdash; and there are many such people in this country&mdash;will be at the mercy <Col N="90" /> of their employers.  I was reading only today that a new agreement was drawn up on the Continent which precluded women from carrying out a variety of functions they had prior to the equal pay claim.  They wrote all sorts of nonsense into the new agreements, particularly in relation to women's clothing.  They could not wear mini skirts, hot pants.  They could not have the bra-less look as if these things affected a woman's ability to carry out her job correctly. If we are going to leave it to employers to impose these irritations on women in agreements, apart altogether from reinstatement in their positions, then the Bill will be doing a grave disservice to them and will open the way for employers to treat women as they think fit.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment seriously.  It is not good enough to say it will be enshrined in future legislation.  We do not accept that because from what the Minister told us on the previous occasion it was unconstitutional to insist on reinstatement. I would call it &ldquo;continuity&rdquo; of employment rather than reinstatement because that is what it is.  There would have to be some safeguard built into the Bill to ensure that those who make a claim will not be discriminated against.  If this amendment is not carried, then it will certainly be a Discrimination Pay Bill and will discriminate against women who endeavour to claim their rights under it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 23 and 24, to delete all words after &ldquo;as the&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Certain Terms and Conditions of Employment (Pay) Act, 1974.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am convinced now more than ever that this Bill is not an anti-descrimination Bill because it discriminates against women seeking equal pay.  The words we seek to have inserted are embodied in the long title of the Bill: &ldquo;Certain terms and conditions of employment between men and women employed on like work&rdquo;.  We have indicated that quite an amount of discrimination appears in the Bill against people who seek assistance under the measure for the purpose of obtaining equal pay.  Therefore the term &ldquo;anti-discrimination&rdquo; in the title of the Bill is inappropriate.  This is probably the worst piece of legislation that has come to this House for some time.  It could well discriminate against a breadwinner, because another section of the Bill indicates that men can apply for pay equal with that of women.  It means, in effect, that men and women who make a claim under the Bill for equal pay and are dismissed on account of that have no redress whatever.  They must lose their employment if the employer likes to keep them out and they will get the small amount of compensation assessed by the court to which they are justly entitled in relation to their claim.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to eliminate the term &ldquo;anti-discrimination&rdquo; from the title of the Bill, seeing that it is a Bill that contains discrimination against men and women who wish to avail of the equal pay opportunities the Minister had in mind when he first introduced the Bill.</P>

      <P>From the very introduction of this Bill it was defective in as much as the necessary cover is not provided to protect people applying for equal pay under the Bill. There is no guarantee that they will retain their employment.  We felt from its introduction that this was a defect in the Bill.  Every Bill must stand on its own feet.  It is bad in principle to say that one has to bring in further legislation in order to bolster up the legislation that has gone through the House.  This is defective legislation, not fully thought out, not fully comprehensive. The Minister had adequate time to ensure that he would bring in effective legislation.  He introduced the Conditions of Employment (Equal Pay) Bill as far back as July, 1973, and after a lapse of eight months this concoction was brought before the House.  It took eight months to change the Title of a Bill and to produce defective legislation of this nature.  Eight months is a fairly considerable period.  We assumed that the Minister would be making substantial progress and would ensure that the legislation he would introduce would be comprehensive.  The Bill leaves the way open for many problems to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the question of discrimination which is written into the Bill. We must guard now against employers downgrading personnel.  This has been applicable in many countries where equal pay legislation has been presented. This is not the be all and end all of equal pay.  Women will be discriminated against in the course of application.  It is bad enough to have people outside this House endeavouring <Col N="97" /> to discriminate against personnel but when it comes to the House itself discriminating against workers then the position is very bad indeed.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is the question of the downgrading of women.  I hope the Minister will ensure that every opportunity is taken to see that women are not downgraded in the period between now and 31st December, 1975, when the Bill comes into operation because it has been the practice in many countries to downgrade women.  If we read the various EEC reports on equal pay legislation we find that the Commission found that the problem in the EEC countries was not that member states lacked legislation on the subject of equal pay but that it had not been fully enforced and in particular considered discriminatory job classification as a major obstacle.  In most countries the inequality in the average hourly wage was most marked amongst skilled workers.  It was found also that a much lower proportion of women than men gained skilled worker status.</P>
    <P>It has been fairly clear to the Minister and to those who have examined the equal pay situation throughout Europe and, indeed, throughout the world that legislation in itself is not the end of the line.  If a Bill is introduced just to give the appearance of work being done or to give hope to people that they can obtain benefits under it and if that proves not to be the case then the people will lose faith in this House and in our ability to introduce perfect legislation.</P>
    <P>The report of the European Community, January/February, 1974 on <i>Britain in Europe</i> 1973 refers to the point the Minister has made, that this Bill is part of a trilogy.  Apparently it will take three Bills in future to do the work of one.  This will throw an extra burden on the House.  There is much useful legislation that the House could be processing rather than have three Bills to do the work of one.  We are concerned about the time factor.  In some cases the House has not had time to discuss in depth and detail Estimates and Bills which sometimes go through the House in a <Col N="98" /> slipshod manner.  This measure, that should be one on which we could look back with pride, has major defects.</P>
    <P>I quote from the EEC report to which I have just referred:</P>
    <P>Britain's proposed anti-discrimination law, which will be the first of its kind in the EEC, will not go far enough.  Firstly, it is restricted only to most employment and some areas of education.  So it may lead to the addition of a maximum quota for girls admitted to medical training, but it specifically stops women from being miners and men from being midwives.  Why should not women be miners if they choose, or men midwives....  But the examples given in this article&mdash;and the list is far from being exhaustive&mdash;show why Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome on equal pay and even the first anti-discrimination bill in an EEC country do not do enough. Inequality is not just found on the shop floor, it is a way of life.</P>
    <P>All the articles that have been written indicate that much more is required than a Bill.  There must be vigilance on the part of the Minister and of the equal pay officer.  This piecemeal legislation will not help equal pay officers in their difficult task.  If one man is to determine what is equal pay, he will judge the matter on a particular basis.  We have expressed the view that there should be a consensus of the views of trade unions and employers or an appeal board in the event of dispute.  This is very essential to the equal pay officers.  Their job is difficult and will be more difficult after the passing of this Bill because of its defective nature.  There are many shortcomings in this particular section of the Bill.  We would ask the Minister to be more than vigilant in his efforts to ensure that some justice is done with this defective piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>Dáil Éireann will have heard of the resignation of some Members of the power-sharing Executive in Belfast today.  Members of the Dáil will join with me, I am sure, in expressing our deep regret at what has happened.</P>
      <P>The establishment of this Executive on 1st January last was seen by all of us as an historic attempt to bridge the deep differences between sections of the community in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Those in the North who joined in this attempt deserve the respect of all of us for their courage and dedication in the face of great pressures from the more extreme elements in both sections of the Northern Ireland community. Few democratic politicians anywhere have ever faced such odds, so bravely, and with so little regard for their own personal position and, indeed, personal safety.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil on 22nd November, 1973, I said that the formation of this power-sharing Executive was &ldquo;an important and necessary first step in the working out of political institutions providing the basis for a settlement that can bring co-operation and peace in this island&rdquo;.  For the first time in the history of Northern Ireland representatives of the communities there agreed, notwithstanding the fundamental difference in their basic aspirations, to work together for the common good.  The Executive represented an attempt to provide a form of Government widely accepted throughout the community in Northern Ireland.  This great experiment in co-operation has been wrecked by deliberate misrepresentation of its purpose on the one hand and by the continuance of violence on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we warned it would, the campaign of the IRA has provoked a massive sectarian backlash.  This has undermined the only kind of solution that can bring peace to Northern <Col N="101" /> Ireland and security to the minority in that area.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances it is vitally important that all should remain calm. There just is no point at this stage in our entering into recriminations as to what might have happened if events had been handled differently.  We must go forward from here.  The principles of partnership and co-operation with democratically elected representatives in this island &mdash; upon which we have worked for so long &mdash; remain as true and genuine a basis for progress as they have ever been.</P>
    <P>We have in the past worked towards this goal.  We shall continue to do so, recognising that our most pressing concern must be &mdash; as it has been for all of us throughout these tragic years &mdash; the safeguarding of lives in Northern Ireland and, indeed, in the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the power-sharing Executive in the North has fallen in the face of Loyalist intimidation. I, too, wish to pay tribute to those who participated in and supported the Executive during the past five months.  I fully realise the sacrifices, both personal and political, that they had to make and have made.  I especially commend the Members of the SDLP and of the Alliance Party who still hold out to the last in order to sustain the power-sharing Executive, to sustain the concept of power-sharing, a concept which we believe would have ultimately established peace with justice in the North.  Unless the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland can re-establish the Executive on the basis of continued power-sharing, through contact with all the elected Members of the Assembly, then there seems to be no alternative, no immediate alternative to direct rule.  As of now we have no information what decision was made but when in Government we in Fianna Fáil proposed and advocated power-sharing; in Opposition we have supported it and, therefore, will continue to do so as long as there is any prospect of its being restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever decision will be made there remains the responsibility of the <Col N="102" /> British Government to safeguard the basic rights of all the people in the North and to face up fully to this campaign of intimidation and violence and to see that it will not succeed.  We of Fianna Fáil, because of our concern for the welfare of all the people of Ireland, will, of course, hold ourselves available to help in finding any just solution to this crisis.  That is all I have to say at this stage in the absence of any decision being conveyed to this House.  I know the Taoiseach has not had conveyed to him what actually the decision is in relation to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the problems which will arise and the responsibilities placed on the shoulders of the equal pay officer, we would like the Minister to say if there will be any form of appeal board or will the decision of the equal pay officer be final?  We did argue on Second Stage <Col N="104" /> that there should be an appeal board constituted of trade union officials and employers' representatives.  An individual examination of the situation could be fairly subjective and we believe a wider approach should be available.  Job evaluation is something that requires an objective approach. Clearly defined guidelines will have to be laid down.  Difficulties are bound to arise in determining what precisely constitutes work of equal value or &ldquo;like work&rdquo; to use the term employed in the Bill.  The determination of job evaluation will depend on the guidelines laid down.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to be vigilant in ensuring that there is no downgrading of women.  He will have to ensure also that equal pay will not bring with it a new agreement for the women seeking equal pay.  It was pointed out in the course of debate here that some employers in countries which had acceded to the equal pay principle decided there was a new ball game and a new agreements was necessary.  In those agreements many undesirable irritants were written in. Equal pay must be on the basis of the work previously done and existing agreements in relation to that equal pay must be maintained.  If new agreements evolved the legislation before the House at the moment could be nullified.  I hope the Minister will safeguard the position of women against this kind of tactic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the debate examples were given to the Minister of the various ways in which employers might downgrade women.  There are other factors, apart from equal pay, which enter into the picture and I trust that in the trinity of legislation the Minister has indicated he will be bringing before the House he will take into consideration those other factors. I pointed out one such factor in the journal from which I quoted before business was suspended.  There is discrimination right through social welfare payments; there is discrimination in taxation and in the adjustment of incomes.  There is discrimination in downgrading.  In this Bill we have created discrimination that was not there before and it is regrettable that <Col N="105" /> the House would pass such defective legislation.</P>
    <P>One matter I should like the Minister to comment on is that some trade unions have indicated that where men are available for posts they should get preference.  I take it such trade union attitudes will be nullified by this Bill and that this type of discrimination will no longer exist.  The Minister has had discussions with trade unions whose voices have been loud about giving preference to men if they are available, and I should like to hear from him that he is satisfied there would be none of this in the future.</P>
    <P>Equal pay in the public service was introduced by Fianna Fáil and when we get back to office we will ensure that this legislation will be strengthened to eradicate the problems that we see in this legislation so that with the passage of time people's difficulties will be remedied and their jobs protected.  We have had a long discussion on all aspects of this Bill and I do not intend to delay the House further.  I am sorry to see this type of discriminatory legislation going through which does not give full and adequate protection to people who should be benefiting by it.  If problems arise because of the Bill, the Minister must bear full responsibility.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate when the promised legislation on wrongful dismissal will be before us. He can be assured of our full co-operation in the passage of any legislation for the good of employees but we emphasise again that it should not be necessary to have further legislation to bolster the Bill now going through the House.  We hope many people will benefit by this Bill and that no woman will lose here job because of making a claim for equal pay.  However, there are some unscrupulous employers, not many, who would avail of every opportunity to dismiss people, to downgrade them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The passage of this Bill will confer solid advantages on women throughout Irish industry.  The Bill deals with an important area of discrimination <Col N="106" /> in employment, that of pay.  The Bill is adequate to deal with that type of discrimination wherever it applies and involves women doing work equal with that of men in industry.  This Bill will eliminate that type of discrimination.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Dowling that staff involved under the Bill will be properly trained and will be diligent in checking any departure from the terms of the legislation.  He raised a point about appeals.  There would be an appeal from any decision of an equal pay officer to the Labour Court. I made it clear from the start that accompanying legislation would be necessary if this enactment was to confer full advantage on the people whom it sets out to help.  I have announced my intention of introducing to the House legislation under the heading of &ldquo;Unfair Dismissal&rdquo; and also legislation that would cater for the area of promotion, recruitment and training of women.  These other pieces of legislation will be necessary.  While the items to be covered by such legislation would not be appropriate to this Bill, it would certainly be untrue to suggest that this Bill will not be more advantageous when those other pieces of legislation are enacted.  In the current session, I would hope that one at least of these measures could be introduced to the House.  Certainly, I would be confident that in the latter portion of this year I would be in a position to bring both pieces of legislation before the House. Either way, I have made it quite clear that those other pieces of legislation will be fully operational by the time this piece of legislation becomes part of our fundamental law in 1975.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I commend this legislation to the House.  It goes the road originally mapped out for this Legislature by the Commission on the Status of Women Report, that report which was first, in interim form, available in 1971.  I do not exaggerate.  I do not make too great claims for this legislation but I do say it will prove an efficient instrument for removing injustice perpetrated against women in Irish industry in matters of pay.</P>

      <P>I would say so.  They would take a personal interest in their farms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always the grouse about it being put out on good land.  The Parliamentary Secretary's Department say: one has to weigh up whether or not he is benefiting more by the drainage or whether one has done more harm to him.  One has to make this distinction and it is very difficult to obtain satisfaction in such matters.  On account of that, I feel it would be better if the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries were to give grants.  The Department are accepting no more grant applications under the land project at the moment except those already lodged.  Quite a large number of applications are held up pending completion of the drainage of the Boyne or of the drainage in particular areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will they come under the old scheme, then, or will they come under the farm modernisation scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>No, under the old scheme.  They would be grant applications deferred until the Boyne was drained.  They would be still in the pipeline until such time as the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries said that those are finished with now. But it will take quite a while for the farm modernisation scheme to get off the ground.  It is some what complicated because they have to plan a programme ahead for five years.  It may take some time to sell this to farmers, particularly the smaller farmer who may be working as well as running his farm.  Quite a number of them are employed by the Parliamentary Secretary's Department on the Boyne. Those people would not qualify and it would mean that some of their farms would be losing out on it.  As a <Col N="109" /> result of their jobs, they now have the money to help develop their farms and, if the spoil were spread, one could possibly have more production on the farm than if those people were working fulltime on the land.  The job would keep the house going and whatever they made on the farm would be reinvested in it.</P>
      <P>This has been the experience in southern Germany where there are part-time farmers in Bavaria.  They found that the actual production on the farm increased when the men went out to work.  I saw something of that myself in the Clongorey area of County Kildare where most of the farmers there were working in industry in Newbridge. One observed the production on the farms there increasing as a result of the farmers' employment. The potential in Meath would be much greater.  It would be no harm if the Parliamentary Secretary were to take up this matter again with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
      <P>When I reported progress the last evening I was saying that we should do something to preserve our old buildings. Those are buildings being lived in at the moment of historic value or of value in relation to the period in which they were built.  I was making the claim that the State could contribute something towards the repair of those houses.  The occupants themselves could contribute but the work of restoration would be done by the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a typical example in this city of the Georgian houses quite a number of which have fallen down. Had some scheme like this been implemented years ago those houses could have been preserved.  In the country there are quite a number of really historic houses&mdash;I am not talking about big manors&mdash;some of which were built of stone and some thatched. Thatched houses are fast disappearing and the art of thatching has gone. Thatched houses are something we should preserve because the Irish thatched house is known the world over.  If something is not done in the very near future to preserve what is left of these, they will disappear altogether.  When the occupants themselves <Col N="110" /> come to repair them under normal grants they will go for the normal conventional type roof.  They would be a tourist attraction.  Bord Fáilte have carried out this work in a number of cases.  They gave special grants where the thatched house was a publichouse in a tourist area.  I know of one case where a person who got this assistance arranged to have the roof thatched; the publichouse concerned is known as &ldquo;The Thatch&rdquo;. The Department might consider arranging to have this kind of work carried out, with the person concerned paying a share of the cost.  There is a scheme somewhat similar to this in Holland but some owners are worried about the cost of renovation, even allowing for the amount of assistance given by the State.  The suggestion I have made is worth considering and I commend it to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>The work being done on the Boyne and the employment created is much appreciated in County Meath.  The Parliamentary Secretary is setting a good headline for employers throughout the county.  The employees are well satisfied with the bonus system because they know they will be paid according to the work they do.  I do not want to give the idea that they are slaves or are forced to reach a certain target but they know they will be paid honest wages for an honest day's work.  I should like to compliment the Office of Public Works for the service and the example they have given in County Meath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the good work he has done in his office and on the Estimate now before us. In paying that tribute to him, I wish to include every member of his most efficient staff.  The Estimate covers many matters; it involves many Departments, as well as Aras an Uachtaráin and the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of our civil servants have been asked to work in substandard accommodation for many years.  I have had occasion to visit many Government Departments, the offices of the Revenue Commissioners, the Land Registry and many courts and I know <Col N="111" /> that in many cases the accommodation being provided for civil servants, those who carry out the work of the State, is not up to the required standard. They work in overcrowded conditions, in unsuitable premises where the furniture and fittings leave a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £180,000 for new Revenue offices in Dublin. During the years I visited the offices of the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin Castle frequently and I was always amazed that people were not seriously injured in a fall down the stairs, or even through the stairs. The excellent staff were forced to work in very poor conditions; the stairs was in a bad condition, the offices were too small and, generally, the whole place needed a drastic overhaul.  The Revenue Commissioners have much work to do in dealing with the stamping of deeds, documents and transfers, as well as other work, and I hope that they will have more suitable accommodation as a result of the provision now being made.  A sum of £8,000 is being allocated to the offices of the Revenue Commissioners in O'Connell Street to improve the existing accommodation and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of money has been set aside for the improvement of certain buildings in the Department of Justice.  The Technical Bureau at Garda Headquarters is being provided with £10,000 this year. In the current issue of the <i>Garda Review</i> there is mention of the necessity of providing improved facilities for the special detective units.  It is important that people in such units, in the Phoenix Park and in Dublin Castle, should be provided with up-to-date, modern offices.  They should be given proper offices and equipment to enable them to carry out their work in accommodation comparable with any other Department.  Much of the accommodation being used by these people is not up to the required standard and they are not given all the facilities needed in their work.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will <Col N="112" /> give special consideration to this matter. I also understand that there is not sufficient parking accommodation for Garda motor vehicles at Dublin Castle.  This is a matter that should also be considered.</P>
    <P>Apart from the provision of accommodation so that the Garda Síochána can work in a proper atmosphere, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is also taking into account the provision of the most modern and up-to-date equipment and for its utilisation to the best possible effect. Accommodation would want to be set aside for this equipment, and there should be proper offices for interviewing and so on.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Bridewell, which comes under the heading of the courts, the situation leaves a lot to be desired.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will ensure that the best accommodation possible will be provided for the Gardaí at the Bridewell.</P>
    <P>To come to the constituency I represent, as the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, on last year's Estimate I raised the question of the new Garda station to be provided in Portlaoise.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is examining as a matter of urgency the possibility of improving the existing Garda station.  However, as one of our biggest prisions is in County Laois and as there are very strong security arrangements outside this prison, a great deal of importance should be attached to Garda facilities there.  I have met a number of gardaí attached to the Portlaoise station and have been in the station myself.  The conditions there are most unsatisfactory.  The gardaí there are excellent men, highly disciplined and discharge their duties most efficiently.</P>
    <P>There are an exceptionally large number of gardaí attached to Portlaoise. It is the divisional headquarters. There are a chief superintendent, a superintendent, inspectors, a number of Garda sergeants and a huge number of gardaí who are brought in from the two counties around.  I understand that in Portlaoise Garda Station in the mornings when the station is busy, in one room there are eight or nine different groups of gardaí discussing various matters, endeavouring to make <Col N="113" /> arrangements for the allotment of work for the day, phone calls coming in and so on.  This certainly does not provide the proper atmosphere for work.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply will make a specific reference to the question of providing adequate accommodation for the gardaí in this area.  In complimenting the Parliamentary Secretary on providing the sum of £200,000 for the erection of Garda stations for the period from 1st April, 1974, to 31st December, 1974, I would hope that a sizeable portion of this £200,000 would be devoted to the provision of a Garda station at Portlaoise.  A large number of our stations need to be overhauled and in many instances overhauling is not sufficient and new stations will have to be provided.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that further adaptations are taking place at the Garda training centre at Templemore.  Of late there has been an increase in the number of recruits, and, therefore, extra and improved accommodation is required.</P>
    <P>I would very briefly touch on the provision of houses for married members of the Garda Síochána.  It is desirable that in every medium-sized town a certain number of houses should be provided by the Board of Works for the Garda Síochána.  Over the past few years arrangements have been made whereby gardaí have been allowed to purchase the house in which they have been living when they appeared to be more or less permanent in an area.  However, in the difficult circumstances the country is in at the moment there is quite an amount of movement of Garda personnel from one area to another.  This movement involves considerable hardship at times.  Therefore, I would recommend that a number of houses be provided in every town of medium size for the use of married members of the Garda Síochána.  The price of houses is increasing and members of the force on transfer from one town to another have difficulty in raising loans for house purchase.  This is an important matter and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will consider it.</P>
    <P>I am pleased about the improvement <Col N="114" /> in the lighting in the National Museum.  The National Library also comes under the Office of Public Works as distinct from the Department of Education.  The foyer of the National Library is cluttered with boxes and all types of materials. There are items there that should not be there.  These should be removed. The library is one of our most important heritages and there is great need for improvement there as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see the provision of £264,000 for new offices for the Department of Lands in Castlebar.  As a Deputy from Laois-Offaly I hope that the Office of Public Works will erect new offices there.  We would be able to arrange for suitable sites if the office were to plan the erection of Government offices in Laois-Offaly. New Government offices are being provided in Athlone and Castlebar.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has a say in this matter he should recommend the erection of such accommodation in Laois-Offaly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I warmly welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's statement about the amount of money being provided for work on the river Shannon.  A general study has been carried out in regard to Shannon navigation.  The Shannon is one of our greatest tourist attractions.  At Shannon Harbour, Shannonbridge, Banagher, the Shannon is a most important tourist attraction. A boating and cruising holiday on the Shannon can be quite economical. There has been an increase in the number of boats on the river and in the number of people taking boating holidays.  I hope this development will continue.  If improvements <Col N="115" /> continue to be made along the Shannon people who have not been involved in boating will get involved. This should help to promote holidays in Ireland and holidays on the Shannon and on our lakes.  Such holidays would be as reasonably priced as any holiday abroad.  Every effort should be made to improve the amenities on the river Shannon.  I am glad to hear of the study being carried out at present.</P>
    <P>The question of the drainage of the river Shannon is very important. There are parts of Laois-Offaly which continue to be seriously affected by flooding of the river Shannon.  Farmers find that they are unable to utilise their lands properly.  This position could be vastly improved by drainage of the Shannon.  Large portions of south Offaly/west Offaly are badly flooded every year.  This year the flooding was the worst for years. Thousands of acres of lands were involved. The flooding does not recede until well into the spring.  Because of waterlogging the land is not healthy for grazing.  Land which could be utilised is not available for the farmers. A major study of the drainage of the river Shannon should be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is a man of ability and of vision.  The drainage of the Shannon has been regarded as a vision.  The vision should become a reality.  A definite plan should be made for the drainage of this most important river.  The benefits that would accure would be enormous. Thousands of small farmers along the Shannon would benefit. Many of them have to pay rates for land that is waterlogged for six to eight months of the year.  If the Shannon were drained the land, instead of being a burden to the local farmers, would become a national asset.</P>
    <P>The question of the drainage of the Shannon is of such magnitude that many Parliamentary Secretaries have been frightened off.  The question crops up at election times and is then shelved.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not been in office for very long.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> I hope he will have a long stay in the Office of Public Works and that he will be able to say that he was the man who started the drainage of the entire River Shannon.</P>
    <P>Land has become very dear in this country and throughout the world. Many people are anxious to engage in farming.  It is imperative that every effort be made immediately to have the great task of the drainage of the Shannon started immediately.  Benefits would accrue within a short time. There are large amounts of land along the Shannon that cannot be utilised. We have in the Office of Public Works the engineers, the architects and all the expertise necessary to carry out the drainage work.  It will cost a lot of money but this country needs to utilise all available land to the fullest possible extent.  It is important that the drainage of our major river should start immediately and I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this.</P>
    <P>Shannonbridge in County Offaly has a bridge over the Shannon which is situated at one end of the village. There are rumours that this bridge is to be moved upriver away from the village and there is widespread disapproval of this idea among the local people.  I understand that Offaly County Council are carrying out investigations into this matter but I hope the Office of Public Works will look into it also.  This is an historic village, well known throughout the county and the country.  I believe the new bridge should be constructed on the site of the old one.  If it is moved upriver it will be to the detriment of the village.  The Office of Public Works should point out to the county council that the bridge should be constructed on the old site.</P>
    <P>St. Conleth's Reformatory in Daingean was closed some time ago.  I understand the Office of Public Works are at present in charge of the building and have let part of the lands on the 11 months' system.  The residents of the village of Daingean are anxious that some of the playing facilities attached to this building should be made available to the local people. They include an excellent ball alley, <Col N="117" /> a badminton court, tennis courts and so on.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider allowing the local people to avail of the playing facilities there.  The residents would look after the building for the Office of Public Works.  The local boys and girls would then have recreation facilities. I would also recommend that the lands attached to St. Conleth's should be sold to the Land Commission for division among local small farmers.  The people in the area are anxious for this.  This would be of great benefit to the village.  I believe the IDA are making every effort to supply an industry for the building. I hope they will be successful in their efforts but in the meantime the local people should be allowed to use the sporting facilities there.</P>
    <P>The matter of the national school at Shinrone, County Offaly has been going on for some time.  I understand that the stage has arrived where the Office of Public Works are waiting for the contribution to be paid by the manager of the school.  For a number of years there was a difficulty in regard to the title and in regard to an adjoining plot of land, which was not properly marked on some of the maps, for the proposed site for the new school.  I fully appreciate that there can be legal difficulties and technicalities which can delay the commencement of work but nevertheless I have no hesitation in saying that this school is an absolute scandal.  I say without fear of contradiction that there are few schools in the country in such a shocking condition. I have been pressing consistently since I entered this House to have a new school built at Shinrone and my patience is slowly wearing out. On my last visit to this school I was appalled at its condition.  The toilets are very bad and there are holes in the roof.  There were formerly two rooms but now each room has been divided into two.  The building is in a shocking condition.  I would request the Parliamentary Secretary to have this matter looked into.  If the Parliamentary Secretary visited this school he would regard it as a matter of urgency because I believe there are <Col N="118" /> very few schools in such a shocking condition.  I do not know where the blame for the delay lies but I believe that now is the time to commence work on this school.  I was under the impression that the furnishing of estimates by builders for this school was taking place and that the Board of Works were awaiting tenders.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to let me know if a successful tender has been accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am a native of the village and I attended that school. I believe this is a very important Estimate. When discussing this matter one is conscious of the situation in our country at the present time.  Some people might believe that we should not discuss the Estimate for the Board of Works when there are so many other important things to be discussed. Some political correspondents have commented on this.  There was a comment in a newspaper recently about the House discussing a matter like the Board of Works Estimate. The commentator felt the Dáil were out of touch in dealing with a matter such as this when matters of major importance were taking place.</P>
      <P>I believe it is important that it should go on record that the rules of this House are such that one is confined to a particular item of business at a particular time.  Business is pre-arranged and debate has to be carried out in accordance with the rules of the House. In dealing with a matter like the Estimate for the Board of Works one can be conscious of events throughout the country.  However, important everyday work has to be done.  It is important that Deputies on all sides of the House contribute to Estimate debates.  I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his help in regard to Shinrone National School and to congratulate him for bringing in such an excellent Estimate.  I should also like to congratulate his staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will be glad when <Col N="119" /> I tell him that as I did not expect to contribute to the debate on his Estimate until Thursday I may not detain him as long as I would otherwise do.  As I occupied his office until some time ago his Estimate is of great interest to me.  He is aware, from my persistent questioning of him from time to time, that I am anxious to find out what progress he is making.  I said last year that I believed the Parliamentary Secretary was an excellent choice in charge of the Board of Works.  I would like to assure him that any persistent questioning by me from time to time is no reflection on himself but is an effort to ensure that the things I was hoping to achieve during my time in charge of the Board of Works would be achieved by him.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that at last he has made an announcement, which I hoped to make, about the Glenveagh estate, County Donegal.  Everybody should fully appreciate the value of this contribution to the nation.  We are all indebted to Mr. McIlhenny for his generous gift to the nation.  I understand there is a forest on this vast estate which is probably one of the last remaining natural forests in Europe.  It is not a man-made forest but natural and is worthy of being a national park. I believe it touches on the sea coast which makes it a sea park, a national park and a mountain park.  There are possibilities elsewhere in relation to this estate.  I am aware I must not refer to them because it might lessen the chance of the Parliamentary Secretary bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate to read a small quotation from Pádraig Pearse here. This little quotation will give us an appreciation of what our Irish patriots were about when trying to establish the independence of this country.  This quotation was published in the English journal, <i>The Observer</i>, on the 10th April, 1966, the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  The quotation is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the poems of Pearse were full of blood and futile heroism they also spoke of reeds, rushes, the <Col N="120" /> permanence of the form which the hare leaves in the grass of the mountain.  Their enthusiasm was for the perishable, renewable forms of present art, tales, songs, weaving and pottery.</P>
    <P>I suggest if we are genuinely anxious to pursue the ideas of Pearse we can best do so through the national parks which the nation controls, the wildlife, the flora and fauna.  We are in great debt to Mr. McIlhenny for giving us the Glenveagh estate, a total of 25,000 acres of great natural beauty and I believe with a garden area&mdash;I am not sure if that comes to the State immediately&mdash;which is one of the finest in the country.</P>
    <P>I often spend my holidays in County Donegal.  I have seen this estate on maps but I am not sure of its actual location from the point of view of an ordinary tourist.  As soon as it is made available as a national park, some directions should be provided so that people can get to it easily.  I believe that once you arrive at the park you will need several days to appreciate its natural beauty.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind a parking area or a tourist amenity area where people can stay for some days and go off on nature trails.  I believe that will take a lot of work and detail.  Perhaps he could give us just the broad outline of the thinking behind making this great area accessible.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the commissioners have no compulsory powers to acquire land for national park areas.  This was a matter of serious concern to me when I had responsibility and I discussed with senior officials the possibility of amending legislation in order to take these compulsory powers.  As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, any such legislation must have the sanction of the Minister for Finance and of the Government. In my time we did not get very far with this idea but I hope the general concept of such amending legislation will be pursued.  Perhaps in the next session, or the one after, some amending legislation will be introduced here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> Conservation, national parks and the quality of life are matters that need examination.  They have needed examination for quite some years past. Appointing me as spokesman on environmental and physical planning is, I hope, an indication that my party have recognised this great need.  I also hope that I shall be able to live up to the expectations placed in me from the point of view of getting public acceptance of greater national expenditure on national parks, on the environment and on the quality of life generally.</P>
    <P>In his introductory speech, the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>I know from the interest which Deputies and the general public have shown in the subject of national parks in recent times that they regard expenditure on such amenities as money well spent. There has been a growing appreciation of the important contribution which national parks can make to the cultural, educational, social and economic well-being of a people. The creation of national parks has been assuming a new urgency in the face of social changes and industrial developments which threaten even the most unspoiled areas which hitherto appeared inviolable.</P>
    <P>I should have liked very much indeed to have said those words myself.  I agree with them absolutely and completely. We must expand national park areas especially in the light of my original quotation, when it is realised that the men who brought the 1916 rebellion to fruition were those engaged in a nationalist, peasant revolt, men from rural Ireland and, when one considers that quotation from the <i>Observer</i>, one appreciates its relevance.  They were the men from Kerry, west Cork, Donegal and other areas whose names have gone down in history, the men who helped to win our independence, the men from the small towns and villages without whose determination we would have no Government here today.  The important thing then to remember in the context of the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks in relation not only to national parks as such but <Col N="122" /> also in relation to the acquisition of a new magnificent national park is that the Parliamentary Secretary is here following in the tradition of men who were loyal to their fatherland and to their faith.  Unless we have such men to continue in leadership of government from now on we will have no nation.</P>
    <P>Conservation and planning are absolutely essential for our survival as a nation.  The Parliamentary Secretary will, no doubt, have seen some submissions by me to the Government and I am sure he has been advised about some of the difficulties and the discussions the previous Administration had in getting a solution.  In matters relating to conservation we have a maze of Departments and agencies.  Sooner or later &mdash; I would prefer sooner than later &mdash; one person must take the responsibility at Government level in relation to all matters concerning conservation.</P>
    <P>I was, I think, the first person to read into the Official Report here in either my first or second year as Parliamentary Secretary a list of the maze of agencies and Government Departments involved, illustrating the great difficulty that can arise.  Indeed, my predecessor and the Minister for Land of the day were in serious disarray as to how certain developments in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park should evolve, fortunately these difficulties were resolved.  But this is a thing that could happen again because of this division of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I do not care whether it is to be the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Lands&mdash;in my opinion it should be the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance&mdash;who takes responsibility for conservation.  I have no reason to change my view in this just because there has been a change of Government. I always tried to impress that view during my period in office. Initially I think I was classified as a complete Philistine when I was first appointed.  However, when one starts to work with people who are devoted to and absolutely sincere about the development of our national parks one cannot but have some of that <Col N="123" /> rub off on one and one cannot but become interested and, when one becomes interested, one begins to understand and, when one begins to understand, one goes on acquiring knowledge which will be of benefit to the people.</P>
    <P>As I was saying, it does not matter whether it is a new Ministry, but one person must be put in a position to co-ordinate all matters relating to conservation. Our park service at the moment is probably geared to the management of parks.  This outlook must be broadened.  The national parks service should be a national, social institution concerned with human as well as scenic and wildlife values.  National parks, like life, are meant to be lived and in such parks we can better understand and perceive our place in the universe. The ultimate test of the national park idea is its ability to respond to the urgent needs of society.  The future of our national parks will naturally depend on the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government he serves.  It will also depend on the attitude of the ordinary people in relation to the environment and whether they care or do not care. It depends entirely on the leadership we must get from the Parliamentary Secretary and from the Government. The people must care because if they do not care&mdash;I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is quite aware of this&mdash;they can destroy and devastate quite beautiful areas just by going out for a weekend.</P>
    <P>I had the good fortune, thank heavens before the change of Government, to attend the centenary celebrations of the First National Park in Yellowstone in the US in 1972.  I read there a quotation from John Gardner which I should like to put on record.  I made a note of it at the time, the quotation may not be exact but with your permission I shall give it: &ldquo;In touch with the land and living things, reverent, healing and renewing, committed to preserve, to enhance, to enjoy&rdquo;.  Surely that is a lovely quotation to help to get people to appreciate the value of what they <Col N="124" /> are being offered in our national parks?</P>
    <P>This nation is now being faced with its greatest challenge.  We have seen the effects of giving in too easily to challenges and it is the politicians who must decide the balance.  Each of us has a responsibility to try to see that there is a good and decent livelihood for our people, to try to ensure it will not be necessary, for economic reasons, for our people to emigrate. At the same time, each of us is aware that just now there is a tremendous attraction for major worldwide industrialists to come to this country since we joined the EEC.</P>
    <P>The great challenge that faces this nation as we industrialise is the maintenance of a truly liveable society, one which places human values above all others.  The responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary is not only that of park-tending and of serving as a steward of land, scenery and wilderness, but also of managing our parks in a way that expresses compassion for human life.  I am afraid something has gone wrong with man and his natural world.  We need now a national policy on the environment. If it is ethical for a man to value his chances of survival, to hope for a decent life for his descendants, to respect the value other men place on their lives and to want to obtain the best life has to offer, then it is essential the Government should have an environment policy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can tell me in his reply the nature of the people who call now to our national parks.  Perhaps this could be better put by way of Parliamentary questions and replied to by way of tabular statements, but I am curious to know how many park visitors would be families taking a weekend out; how many would be campers looking for sites, tourist groups going on organised tours; how many would be back-packers wandering around the world hoping for a lift from here to there; and how many would be retired couples who find solace and happiness in an evening in the park?  Of course, I imagine we have some of those wayout groups who cause the Parliamentary <Col N="125" /> Secretary some worry in case they take away bits of monuments every time they call.  It would be interesting to have a breakdown because it would help to influence State policy in this respect.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary does not confine himself to national parks.  He also has to concern himself with national monuments and so forth. At this point I should like to say that I hope to see the Grand Canal turned into a parkway.  We should also embark on a policy of scenic trails and other recreational amenities so that our park system would evolve into something greater than we have today.  I know where the proposals of the Office of Public Works to take over the Grand Canal broke down.  The difficulty started as to the use of the Royal Canal.  There were all sorts of difficulties. I sat on it for a long time and hoped to get the matter resolved.  I am not casting any reflections on my successor.  When I thought we had succeeded in getting the thing wrapped up, something else happened.  If we can take over the canal, I would look on it as a national parkway from Dublin to Limerick.  It could be developed in that way, not overnight but over a period of years.  There are other areas which I should love to see the Parliamentary Secretary having power, not to acquire compulsorily, but to regard as amenities&mdash;to be regarded as something that would justify State expenditure. As I have said, that is another day's work which cannot be done immediately.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, all this started in Yellowstone, USA, in 1872.  Now we see the developing countries of Africa going one better than the US and it is a very good thing to see.  We must somehow withdraw some public land for preservation as a public amenity. That is the task I am placing on the Parliamentary Secretary.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that I have a great interest in these matters. Therefore, it is the first item in his opening statement that I have tackled.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that the national park idea was one of the most important <Col N="126" /> social inventions in the last 100 years.</P>
    <P>I come now to the various subheads. I see, under subhead E, that provision is made for additional accommodation for the Houses and staff of the Oireachtas and that this is being considered.  I understand the proposal is that, when the Kildare Place offices are open, that portion at the back of the old Government Buildings will be available, that it may be possible to link this House with Government Buildings and the area left vacant for accommodation for both members and staff of the Houses.  I have been told there is a difficulty because the levels of the windows are not exactly the same and provision will have to be made for steps.  I am quite sure the architect will overcome this.  I am also very pleased that this passageway will be concealed behind the main structures of the building and, therefore, will not upset the National Trust or people like that who would be concerned were we to put up something considered ugly from an aesthetic point of view.</P>
    <P>Rumour has been prevalent here for some time that the Parliamentary Secretary's office were toying with the idea of allowing this very necessary expansion to take place out to the College of Art.  I should like a strong assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that this idea will not be entertained by him.  Regardless of what arrangements may be made <i>vis-à-vis</i> the new office block on the other side of Kildare Street, as the previous Fine Gael speaker pointed out, when you go into the National Library, you have to climb over books and packages.  During my term of office we put up a couple of nissen huts in an effort to provide a small amount of accommodation to relieve the congestion.  I am aware this was completely inadequate.  I am aware also that, prior to my time in the Office of Public Works, the officials did seek out alternative accommodation. However, whenever they found any place that might be considered suitable &mdash; I think one such place is <Col N="127" /> now to be the new concert hall&mdash; the committee in charge of the National Library&mdash;and that is the way it should be, it should be a nonpolitical, voluntary body &mdash; raised some objection.  I know my mind was made up that the National Library should expand into the College of Art when the new building was provided.  That will take another two or three years but even a waiting period of that length would be worthwhile because it would be an identifiable centre. It is attached to our Parliament, our Museum, Art Gallery and so on. It is a first-class complex and that should be its location.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to resist any suggestion that it should be taken over for Deputies' or officials' offices. Let us move the other way where it can be done unobtrusively and cause no offence to anybody.  If we were to go the other way offence would be caused.</P>
    <P>I have one other thing to say which is actually a funny story when I think of its history.  In the Administration before the last one, when the new office blocks were being built and new rooms being provided, I was a member of the Joint Committee of both Houses who used adjudicate matters concerning the restaurant, bar and so on.  Indeed, from the Parliamentary Secretary's side, we had a very prominent publican who was vice-chairman at the time.  When it came to the construction of the members' and visitors' bars, an architect and an engineer came to the committee to advise us on certain aspects of the development.  The architect said to us: &ldquo;Do you know we have a magnificent carpet?  It was made specially for the World Fair in Montreal.  If we were to move this wall a little we could put that carpet down in the members' bar.&rdquo;  So he moved the wall a little, made the members' bar 50 per cent bigger and the visitor's bar 50 per cent smaller.</P>

      <P>To fit the carpet. The result is that if the Visitors' <Col N="128" /> Gallery is fully, when people want to be in on some exciting debate which may be of great importance to the nation&mdash;I am not suggesting that this Estimate is not of importance, but it is an Estimate we have each year, but sometimes matters arise which attract more public into the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Budget Day is one example.  There have been others.  On such occasions we have found that the bar made available for visitors is completely inadequate.  If Members bring their friends and relations to the restaurant, it is packed and inadequate also.  I think the original idea was that visitors would not come into the restaurant but would have light meals served in the bar.  The bar is so small now that that idea is impractical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Tea and coffee is available there also.  The Press Gallery, however, agreed that in situations of absolute overcrowding, of people being out in the corridors, that once the Press members had finished their evening meal their room could be made an extension of the visitors' bar.  I expressed my appreciation of that at the time and I repeat it again.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should examine some way of improving that facility.  I made one suggestion which I think was shot down on the grounds of cost.  The Parliamentary Secretary has the file now, I do not.  The corridor leading up to what is, I think, the 1935 extension&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;could be incorporated, I believe, in the visitors' bar and a new corridor made outside, in between that building and the National Gallery next door.  That might solve the problem, I do not know, but the Parliamentary Secretary will be aware of the inadequacy there.  Although I voted for it, I think it was a mistake to remove that wall. I think also the Joint Restaurant <Col N="129" /> Committee were mistaken when I suggested that perhaps Members and visitors could exchange areas to make a larger area available for visitors, with a promise of putting in better carpets and so on.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine that matter.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which worries me but I do not know how the Parliamentary Secretary is going to overcome it.  Perhaps he will be cleverer than me when he takes up this matter.  The Department of Lands, in Merrion Street, has a nice Georgian facade but, if one is going to see somebody there one would want to bring a ball of string, tie it to the halldoor as one goes in and play it out in the hope that one would find one's way out again.  It is not only inadequate for the people who work there and inconvenient for the people who have to use it in the course of their business but is is unfair to the general operatives who have to carry buckets of coal up from the basement without an elevator or other means of assistance.  That is one Department that requires reconstruction very soon.  I am quite sure it is not outside the realm of the genius of many of the architects attached to the Office of Public Works to do it, perhaps like those buildings beside No. 51 which have turned out beautifully.  Now that I have seen the final result, I think the students' protests were worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About four years ago I became concerned about large increases in rented offices.  I asked the now chairman of the commissioners to examine this question for me.  It took a year or 18 months but the chairman presented a case that was irrefutable.  It was submitted to the then Minister for Finance for his consideration, and subsequently for the Government's consideration and they decided it was time they provided money for constructing offices.  I should like to convey my thanks to the chairman of the commissioners for the tremendous co-operation he gave me at that time. It took a considerable time for the Department of Finance to assess completely that from the point of view <Col N="130" /> of the taxpayers the balance was in favour of constructing offices.</P>
    <P>On looking at the Estimate, there does not seem to be an increase; rather there is a balance out when one takes inflation into account.  I am aware that some sites are available to the Office of Public Works, that the Dublin Corporation are prepared to negotiate about them, and that the Department of Lands needs to be reconstructed or rebuilt.  The Parliamentary Secretary may persuade his Minister to give him some more money during the year, or perhaps it may take a little longer for the plans to be drawn up to enable building to commence.</P>
    <P>The decision to spend more money on building was made by the then Government.  A five-year programme was envisaged with a certain amount of money allocated each year.  The amount of money is not necessarily the most important factor; what is important is that the policy decision was made.  I tried to change the direction and I think I succeeded.  I should like an assurance that that change of direction will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the children's court in Dublin Castle.  I have had occasion, unfortunately, to plead for a child who found himself in some difficulty. I know that if the court is to be rebuilt it will not be the decision of the Parliamentary Secretary because he will be acting as agent for the Minister for Justice.  However, in the meantime, could the Parliamentary Secretary arrange to have the building painted and better lighting installed?  He should not just hang on until the final decision is taken, when the whole wing will be rebuilt.  This may happen when the new stamping branch is open.  Is the old, Victorian policy being continued, of trying to frighten the children before they go before the magistrate?  The magistrate, whether it is a man or a lady, will frighten them in any event, no matter how genial he or she may be.  Until the Department of Justice or the Department of Finance make up their minds, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would try to make the building a little more pleasant for those who have to use it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> I think the new building at Dublin Castle will be taken over fairly soon. This will mean that the basement area under the State Apartments will be free.  I do not know if there is a memorandum on this matter on the Parliamentary Secretary's files but I discussed the matter with some of the officials.  Some repair work is necessary and this may take some time.  I have been down to see the pillars holding up the State Apartments.  If some people saw them they would not venture into the building, especially to some of the big receptions.  The State Apartments are being held up by poles, with bits of wood hammered in at the top and the bottom.  I understand that since the redecoration of the State Apartments they can build down and make the building safe.</P>
    <P>I asked the officials to make an inquiry for me whether this area under the State Apartments might be set aside to commemorate people on both sides in the Civil War &mdash; a period that may be regarded as tragic by some and triumphant by others.  I thought a small room might be set aside in honour of those who made the supreme sacrifice.  Perhaps Fine Gael might consider something else more appropriate for Michael Collins, but I am sure they can think of people who have not been commemorated properly, as I can, and consider setting aside a room where scholars, interested Irish people and visitors might read the private letters, papers and memoranda prepared by those commemorated.  Dublin Castle would be a fitting location.  It has a long association with our history; we demonstrated our maturity as a people when we decided to maintain and improve the church where our overlords during the centuries are commemorated and where we now honour those who died in our struggle for independence.  The Parliamentary Secretary might look into this matter because some work may have been done on it.  It was merely an idea that appealed to me at the time.  There may be valid reasons why it should not be done but perhaps he might consider the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> The general policies in which I believed are being continued in Items 3-44 as set out in the Estimate and, therefore, I see no objection to them. I have merely thrown out the extra idea as an item to which the Parliamentary Secretary might give some thought because there might be something in it.  I also have some ideas about the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham.</P>
    <P>There are certain controversial monuments &mdash; I do not know whether they have all been repaired or not&mdash; such as the Phoenix Park Gough Monument and Queen Victoria from the front of this building.  These were all put away in cellars or dungeons. Since the statue of Queen Victoria was taken away various offers to buy her for scrap have been resisted.  I think we all agree it is one of the most ugly statues of that royal lady, but what we can do with these various statues of controversy is to put them into the beautiful grounds of the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham as part of an historical exhibition.  I believe we could get revenue from this exhibition, as people would come to see these statues.  The part they play in our history could be explained to the visitors in a suitable brochure or handout.</P>
    <P>In regard to Kilmainham hospital, I understand that, while there is provision this year for the building, when the work that is proposed has been completed it will not necessarily make the building safe for access by the public to all the buildings.  If parts of the gardens could be opened forthwith, with or without these statues, this would be desirable.  It is a shame to have nice gardens in an amenity area like this closed to the public, partly because of the delay by the previous administration in going ahead with the restoration of the buildings and the building of the folk park which, I understand has still to be done; at least there is no indication from the Parliamentary Secretary that there is any change in policy here.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why part of these gardens are not made available to the public.  My advice was that the buildings were dangerous.  The <Col N="133" /> second stage of the three stage restoration is going ahead, though it may take a little time, because I gather there is dry rot and so on to worry about.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make part of these gardens available to the public as soon as possible, and when the stage is reached when the whole place is available, I hope he will consider my idea of putting these controversial statues on exhibition, because they are all part of our history.</P>
    <P>What can I say on Scoil Éanna? I was probably as proud when we were opening Scoil Éanna as the Parliamentary Secretary will be when he publicly opens the Glenveagh estate. As a Dublin man I felt it was well worthwhile and I was honoured that the President of the day should perform the ceremony of opening this school.  I know there are problems of dry rot, that some outdoor buildings had to be taken down, but I would like to think that the fountain and the gardens themselves can be restored. They had been let grow wild, but having seen the work which is done in the People's Gardens in the Phoenix Park, in the gardens of Muckross House, and in the gardens in St. Stephen's Green, I know we have competent people to restore these gardens in Scoil Éanna.</P>
    <P>The important thing is I suppose to get the house itself in proper repair, to have it a lived-in place again with the memories that are attached to it, to have the sports fields developed for children to play and exercise themselves there, to restore the walks.  I believe it is possible to provide a short but complete nature trail. I want to see these things done as quickly as possible and I would impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary not to delay any of these developments through negligence.  I do not think he will, but I would impress this point upon him.</P>
    <P>The computer building in Inchicore is completed.  It is not a very beautiful edifice and I would like to hear if there are any plans to screen it and screen it in such a way that it will not attract children to play in <Col N="134" /> it, because there is a dual-carriageway on one side of it and heavy traffic on the other side, which would endanger them.  There should be some way to make it look more beautiful. It is located in the really old part of Dublin, the first extension of the Liberties, the first bit of industry, CIE yards and so on.  They are all big old stone buildings, and if I may say so the new building looks out of place. On the other side of the dual carriageway there is the memorial park.  Some people think people of republican traditions should not talk about it, but the memorial park was erected to the memory of people who went and fought in the English army because they believed that was the thing to do. With all these things of beauty in that area &mdash; some people may not think old houses are beautiful, but if they studied them they would see they are a lot better than some of the buildings we are erecting today&mdash;I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see if this particular building could be improved visually.</P>
    <P>Item No. 9 refers to the building of a new customs station in Monaghan. This is well advanced and it is expected that work on its erection will be started this year.  Again the Parliamentary Secretary is simply carrying out the direction of another Minister, acting as his agent, but he should suggest to the Minister concerned that the time has surely come, regardless of today's developments, when we should eliminate all tariffs against Northern Ireland and make it unnecessary, on this side of the Border at any rate, to build customs stations. They can build as many as they like on the other side; they do not last very long anyway.  If the Minister examines this very carefully&mdash;I imagine it is the Parliamentary Secretary's own Minister who is mostly concerned with this&mdash;he will find that the loss to the revenue in allowing these goods in duty free will not be much different from the cost of building all these custom stations.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to note the commencement of a new printing building for the Ordnance Survey.  This is greatly needed, but as against that <Col N="135" /> there are houses that accommodate people who work in the Ordnance Survey.  I understand that certain alterations are taking place which will, in fact, reduce this accommodation and the people who have the accommodation tell me that it is inadequate and that better facilities should be provided.  The Parliamentary Secretary might inquire into this matter.  I had some complaints some time ago and do not know how the problems are being resolved.  I will be pleased if the Parliamentary Secretary will give me the information when he is replying.</P>
    <P>The building of the Institute of Public Administration should be proceeded with as quickly as possible. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will expedite the erection of the building in Clonskeagh.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that concerns me.  When I was in office it was my decision to take the plots away from the plot holders in Inchicore.  I did that on the advice that the plots would be required for the construction of the amenities that I had proposed in the Phoenix Park extension. I visited the area last Sunday.  There is no reason that I can see why those plot holders could not be facilitated for another season.  It would seem that the Office of Public Works is proceeding more slowly than was envisaged. I do not know who is at fault. Some of these plot holders could be accommodated in the Kilmainham grounds.  There are some grounds owned by the Office of Public Works, between James's Street and Kilmainham. These grounds could be used for sports pitches or as plots.  I met one plot holder on Sunday whose hobby is growing vegetables.  He is completely frustrated because of the fact that he has only a small back garden. He told me that if he could grow enough vegetables to supply his own household he would be satisfied.</P>
    <P>It must be clear to the Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers what progress is being made in the development of the Phoenix Park extension. If it would be possible to give these plot holders another season, even at <Col N="136" /> this late stage, will he do it?  If that would interfere with the amenity development, then I would not suggest that.  I say that straight because I had to make that decision.  In 1955 I made representations for the first time on behalf of this group of people who are interested in growing vegetables on this land.  It is a sore thing when one has been defending their interests to find that you are the one in office who will put them off that bit of land.</P>

    <P>I, too, started the inquiries into getting a standby generator in this House during some ESB strike a couple of years ago.  The matter had to go to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and then to the Minister for Finance who said it would be too dear.  The matter was going backwards and forwards for a while.  As I recollect&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="137" /> may correct me if I am wrong &mdash;my directions shortly before the change of Government as to the way I was to proceed was to put in a generator which would be able to cater for the entire house, not one that would cater only for parts of the house.  It was to be a generator that would be able to take over automatically and if the centre power goes at least the areas in which we are compelled to work would be immediately given light.  It was going to be quite an expensive generator and we had to fight a bit in Finance about it.  As I recollect it, this was the way the Government were going at the time.  The records are there and if I am wrong the Parliamentary Secretary has only to pick up the file and see what my last entry was on it. If we are going to put in a standby generator we should go the whole hog and not allow the business of this House to be interrupted by a failure of that sort.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is on the same floor as I am, four storeys up.  It is not quite as bad as the fifth floor where we were before but it is a good climb when the power failure affects the elevators. That is not the most important point. Light must be available to people who are studying Bills, preparing contributions to debates, for people who are speaking in the House.  I know that tonight we are not talking to the press because there will be no press tomorrow.  Tonight we are talking because we are trying to improve the system for which the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible.  We may not <Col N="138" /> agree on everything but we will never fall out about anything.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to the East Pier in Dún Laoghaire.  I am glad to see that the next stage of the restoration of the East Pier is going ahead.  I am glad of this for several reasons.  One is that I have been close to Dún Laoghaire for a long time.  The then Minister for Transport and Power now the President of Ireland gave a firm undertaking to this House that the East Pier would be restored.  I remember, when I wrote my first memo to say that I wanted to proceed with this, it looked as if I was putting a bomb under Leinster House.  The advice I got was hostile.  I think one of the remarks on the file is: &ldquo;This is like doing away with the Bray railway line.  It is there now.  Let us keep it there because sometime we might expand.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We had to find out how many boats the existing ferry pier would take.  It can take something like 32 boats in 24 hours which I think will keep us going for quite a while.  Although the decision was made during my term of office I regret very much seeing Dún Laoghaire being turned into a commercial harbour for multi-purpose container ships.  I think this was a bad decision and I am on record as having said so.  I was directed to act against my own feelings on this matter.  I expect it is too late to do anything about it now so it is probably a pity to be holding up the Parliamentary Secretary.  It was a regrettable step.  To my mind Dún Laoghaire has always been an amenity area.  I made some inquiries into whether we could extend behind the west pier the berthing facilities for sailing boats because there is a waiting list going back over many years.  There is a school for teaching young boys about dinghies down behind the west pier and some of that land belongs to the Office of Public Works.  Perhaps it would be possible to put up marinas, floating docks or something which would help to accommodate additional sailing boats.  Sailing was once considered a rich man's sport but it certainly is not that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in the newspaper over the <Col N="139" /> week-end that the committee in charge of Muckross House are apparently putting pressure on the Parliamentary Secretary as they put on me.  I met a deputation from them and I discussed frankly and freely with them the purpose of a national park and, indeed, of Muckross House.  One or two of them had a drink and one or two had a cup of tea here and I was absolutely convinced that when they left they were satisfied that the arguments I had put forward, many of them uninvited, were correct.  I felt that the committee, flushed with their first success, had got some sort of commercial type approach.  I am not saying they were commercial, they were non-profit, but they had this commercial approach to the development of Muchross House.  There were little suggestions such as boating on the lake which I hope is completely out of the question.</P>
    <P>There is a very important principle that the Parliamentary Secretary will have to bear in mind when he is dealing with those people and from the newspaper reports I have seen he will have to deal with them.  A national park is something different from an amenity area.  I attended a world conference with Deputy Gilhawley in Nairobi not so long ago.  They had had a drought there and as the deer and other animals fell from starvation their carcases were left there to decay on the top because that was the way nature intended it to happen.  That is something different from building folk parks and museums.  That is nature.  There are lions in the national parks there and they have to eat other animals to survive though those animals may eat nothing more offensive than grass. The whole concept of national parks could be destroyed if Muckross is over-commercialised.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to know my views on that.  I think many of his advisers share them.  I hope he will be able to continue to uphold the concept which I think Bourn and Vincent had in mind when they gave this park to the State.  I am aware also that the park has been extended recently <Col N="140" /> and I do not know whether the extension which was arranged in my time has yet been finalised.  When will this extension be opened to the public? Will it include nature trails or extensions of existing ones?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary some time ago said that septic tanks would be installed at Muckross House.  This is very important because the Killarney Lakes are polluted and the Parliamentary Secretary cannot say a thing about it if he is allowing it himself.  I should like to know when this treatment of the sewage is likely to take place.</P>
    <P>I think I referred to the Grand Canal in my general statement on national parkways.  I think Bord Fáilte are doing some work for the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to Barrow navigation.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his first year of office. I have no reason to believe he is not doing an energetic and good job.  I am satisfied that during his short indisposition he was still caught up in his work and is on top of everything before him.  There are many little things which I can bring up with the Parliamentary Secretary from time to time.  For instance, if we can be sure of proper lighting at the Rock of Cashel perhaps we can extend the season.  Sometimes tour buses arrive there a month before or a month after the season and people are not allowed in because it is dangerous.  I think the matter of the Guinness plaque has been resolved.  For some time we were trying to show appreciation to Guinnesses for putting in the flood lighting by putting up a plaque for them.</P>
    <P>Regarding court accommodation, I have referred only to the Children's Court in Dublin but I believe that a programme, like the arterial drainage programme, should be drawn up.  I know the decision would have to be made by the Minister for Justice but, perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary would have a look at it.  It would be more economic to draw up a detailed programme than to replace <Col N="141" /> one here and one there in a haphazard way.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Phoenix Park extension, during my term of office we got the idea of putting in a national golf course.  We had a problem because the vocational education committee owned a section in the middle of the development area.  After discussion with Mr. Sheehan, who was then head of the vocational education committee, agreement was reached between that committee and the Office of Public Works for an exchange of lands.  A vocational school was to be built near St. John of God's to cater for the people of Ballyfermot and Inchicore.  I now have word that that scheme is not being proceeded with.  Although this is not the Parliamentary Secretary's concern I want to know what will happen to the land the Office of Public Works turned over to the vocational education committee of Dublin.  Does that come back in to be developed as an amenity area or will the VEC sit on it until such time as they have another change of plans and decide to build a vocational school in this most desirable place?  I attended a function at St. John of God's a couple of weeks ago and I heard that the scheme for building the school has been scrapped. I accept what the Minister said in reply to a question of mine as confirmation that my information is correct.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of our overseas missions.  The embassy in Bonn is located in a place which is inconvenient for many Irish tourists who find themselves in trouble.  It is so far from the centre of the city that if somebody lost money and wanted to get some assistance from the embassy he would not be able to afford the fare from the centre of Bonn to where the embassy was located.  An examination of this matter began before the change of Government. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can tell me if any progress has been made.  My view was that the embassy should be relocated.  The lease for the ambassador's residence was near expiration before I left office.  There were several choices open to the Office of Public Works.  One of them was <Col N="142" /> that we could buy the house, which was in need of some repair, demolish it and reconstruct on the site.  The other was that we could take a new lease at a greatly increased rent but the landlord was reluctant to do some repairs.  It is a beautifully located house but it is too small especially for St. Patrick's Day functions.</P>

      <P>I think I started to. I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary what progress has been made since then.  There is also a problem in Lagos.  The embassy building is in an office block downtown but the residential area is a completely different story.  The Government of Nigeria allocated a site to the Irish Government to build an embassy residence and to several other Governments in the same general locality.  It seems we had a legal adviser out there, an expatriate, who informed us when some other Governments were reluctant to build, that we should sell the site as quickly as possible as it would not be an embassy area.  We apparently accepted that advice.  Soon after we sold it the Nigerian Government said that unless we built our embassy on the site given to us we would get no more sites from them.  This site was <Col N="143" /> sold and there is a little block of flats there much to the annoyance of the other ambassadors.</P>
      <P>Another house was bought not too far away but there are open drains outside it.  It is not as good a location as the other site.  The Government of Nigeria, while I was investigating this matter, made a decision that no nonnational could buy land in Nigeria unless it reverted to the State in ten years.  You could build your embassy on it but in ten years the Government of Nigeria would take over the land and the house.  You would be left with nothing.  We owned the land on which the residence in Lagos is situated.  It is inadequate for the purpose of entertainment and there is only air conditioning in one room, which is pretty poor.  The Parliamentary Secretary should examine the demolition and reconstruction of this building because it seems to be the only way we can get out of the <i>impasse.</i></P>
      <P>I believe we will have this problem coming up within the next two years in Nairobi.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated he intends to establish full diplomatic relations with Nairobi and I understand arrangements are being made to have package tours put on by Aer Lingus.  The Parliamentary Secretary should send his officials to examine the situation or the problems we have experienced in other places will arise there.</P>
      <P>Another problem has arisen in Stockholm, where the residence and embassy are in the same place, an apartment building.  The lease is coming to an end there.  Do we buy the site or do we pay increased rent? My recommendation was to buy but I do not know what the decision ultimately was.  There are alterations needed in most of our embassies abroad.  The ambassador to Belgium has problems in relation to his residence in Brussels.  Even in Washington the residence is inadequate as diplomatic contacts between the various countries increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were residences which were put aside by a new emerging State, which is not considered even a <Col N="144" /> developing State, but a lesser developed State.  We must be able to display our embassies abroad and present this country as a place to which people can come to invest money and hold their property in safety.  That is the reason why the Parliamentary Secretary should ensure that these buildings are in a proper state of repair.</P>
    <P>I have been asking the Parliamentary Secretary a series of questions in connection with the Phoenix Park. I have here the book on which those questions were based and I assure the Parliamentary Secretary I will continue to ask him questions because I want to see progress on this very wonderful report.</P>
    <P>I want now to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary a matter that should have his very serious consideration. For many years now, long before my time, there has been active co-operation between the Parliamentary Secretary and his counterpart in Northern Ireland.  It was felt that we should keep this co-operation quiet and that there should be no publicity in case someone might become a bomb victim.  It was not so much that the progress of the work might be interrupted; it was a matter of the safety of the lives of the workers, many of whom are from Northern Ireland and most of whom are engaged on arterial drainage.  In view of developments today I would like the Parliamentary Secretary now to think very carefully about this co-operation and the giving to it of all the publicity he can.  Had I let that co-operation be published the suggested Council of Ministers might have looked like a mere extension of the existing co-operation and the trouble that eventuated today might never have arisen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the amount of work he has done in the last 12 months and I thank him for his courtesy at all times, either when we call on him personally or when we bring deputations to meet him. He has a pretty tough job.  He is concerned with the provision of new buildings and the maintenance of <Col N="145" /> existing buildings.  In provincial towns there are a great number of offices, county council offices, agricultural offices, labour exchange offices, income tax offices, Land Commission offices, Agricultural Credit Corporation offices, Board of Works offices, Garda barracks, courthouses and so on.  Most of these offices are in different streets; some may be at one end of a town, others in the centre, and others still at the other end of the town.  It would be much better if all these offices were sited in one large building.</P>
      <P>The existing accommodation in most cases leaves much to be desired. The staffs in these offices work long hours and they are entitled to consideration. The present offices are mostly unkempt and none too clean. Where courthouses are concerned, there have been cases in which district justices have refused to sit in them unless the weather is really good; mostly they are cold, damp, unheated and neglected buildings.</P>
      <P>The county council offices in both Sligo and Carrick-on-Shannon are calling out for a new building.  The Parliamentary Secretary should bear these things in mind.  I am convinced that Deputies on the opposite benches will make the same request.  The Parliamentary Secretary should definitely consider siting a labour exchange office in Drumshanbo.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal particularly with Garda stations many of which are crying out for replacement.  Nowadays it is a pleasure to go into some new stations and see the living quarters and the areas provided for official duties.  In Manorhamilton the Garda station has served since 1922 and it is past time that it was replaced by the Board of Works who should be making an all out effort to get rid of the stone stairs and the flagged floors.  Many of those buildings have served for 50 or 60 years and do not lend themselves to improvement. Indeed, it would be a waste of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda station in Sligo has been in use since the foundation of the force.  Now that there is progress everywhere, this job of providing <Col N="146" /> new Garda stations should be tackled with energy.  The stations in Border towns like Sligo and Manorhamilton are overtaxed.  The strength of the force has had to be increased and more facilities are needed to deal with the longer hours of duty and so on.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned about this matter and that he will do his utmost in this respect.  I fully appreciate that the economy has suffered a setback and that in the past few months we could not afford the finance but with an improvement in our economy I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to do everything in his power to provide more Garda stations.</P>
    <P>In Sligo town some time ago a number of fine Garda homes were provided and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to continue this good work in towns such as Manorhamilton. People are getting married earlier these days and therefore there is need to provide more homes for our gardaí.  Indeed, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should now be planning to acquire sites near towns for the provision of future housing.  Later on, even if there is plenty of money, the sites may not be available.  Therefore, I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to plan ahead in this respect in the vicinity of provincial towns.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of arterial drainage.  In my constituency farmers have suffered terribly from flood destruction.  I live very convenient to the farmers who have suffered and during the years very little has been done to relieve them. It is all right to talk about arterial drainage but it takes a considerable time to bring a scheme to finality. We have the local improvements scheme introduced but the minor improvements scheme and the special employment scheme were dropped. That was a great loss to farmers in the west.  Now there is only arterial drainage and the local improvements scheme.  The latter takes care of small streams and accommodation roads. The other two schemes dealt with medium sized rivers and their absence <Col N="147" /> is a great loss.  In former days under the minor employment schemes, a certain amount of money was allocated about September or October. They money would be allocated in the course of the Estimates and the notices were issued about September telling local county councillors of the various schemes to be carried out and the amount of money to be spent on them.  It was of help to local farmers, first of all, from the point of view of drainage and then from the point of view of employment.  That has been dropped and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department to examine it carefully and ascertain if he could initiate some scheme which would cover a certain amount of work not covered by the two schemes I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Again, in former days, we used to have controversy in this House over local authority and LAW schemes. That was another scheme similar to the minor employment scheme.  Under it various work was carried out.  It was administered by the county council.  The money was allocated from the Parliamentary Secretary's office.  Both of those have been dropped.  That is why there is such a need for drainage schemes.  Today with so much employment being provided in growth centres and large towns, people are not prepared to come together and pay their contribution towards a local improvement scheme.  They did do so when there was a bigger population and when young boys did not get away so quickly and the help was there.  But they will not do it today.  Only the father is at home.  He has enough to do to run the show and there is nobody available to do the work.  The result is that this scheme is not as easily dealt with as formerly.  It has to be undertaken now in a more expensive way because material has to be acquired from the local authority.  Transport has to be undertaken by CIE, whereas in former days it was the responsibility of local effort.  This is where the £130,000 in County Leitrim and also a very substantial grant in County Sligo went last year.  It dwindled very <Col N="148" /> quickly because of the very expensive means of carrying out even a small scheme.</P>
    <P>I mentioned another aspect of this drainage business to the Parliamentary Secretary when he met a deputation from the Ballymote part of County Sligo in connection with the Owenmore River.  Deputy MacSharry, Deputy Gilhawley and I attended a meeting in Ballymote one evening in connection with this scheme.  The people met us there, gave us all the facts.  That river stretches for miles. It has been talked about for 25 or 30 year but we are glad to say it is now coming to the stage where we can say it will be dealt with in four or five years We mentioned this to the Parliamentary Secretary when we met him in his office in Government Buildings.  Small obstructions in some of those rivers have done a lot of harm.  When a tree or block becomes an obstruction one year, it becomes a bigger obstruction the following year and the year after an even greater one.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that something be done to have those obstructions removed from rivers in good time instead of letting them drift for five, six or seven years.  I know of a smallish river in the Dromahair area where timber was allowed fall into it which did untold damage simply because it was never taken out.  The blockages were there and are still there.  I think it would be well worthwhile if the Parliamentary Secretary's Department could provide small sums of money to release those blockages.  It can happen at a bridge, at a bend and we all know from experience the length of time a heavy log of timber can remain in water.  Many people come to us and ask: why not relieve the flooding around the bend or get something done wih it?  They feel the county council should do it.  County councils have no power to undertake such schemes.  I think small sums of money should be granted from some source to have those rivers cleaned up even in a small way until such time as the arterial drainage scheme is carried out.</P>
    <P>In my part of the country when we have a severe spell of weather it is well known that cattle are lost <Col N="149" /> because of severe flooding.  As I have mentioned, we have the Owenmore on the County Sligo side.  We have the Borris river stretching from Sligo town to Glenade or from Dromahair to Glenade Lake.  This is a river of about 14 miles.  It is flooded all the way through and hundreds of acres of land are rendered useless.  If severe flooding occurs before the hay is gathered, it may mean that a man will lose his whole harvest.  Some two or three years ago when we had a very heavy rainfall meetings were held all over the place.  Protests were made to the Department.  We came here with deputations but the river Borris was never cleaned.  The river Shannon is still uncleaned.  The Owenmore is still uncleaned and there is another river in north Sligo in the same condition the name of which I cannot recollect at present.  I must remind the Parliamentary Secretary particularly of the smaller rivers doing untold damage throughout the constituency. In many cases flooding is so bad that often people cannot get to town.  Very often children cannot <Col N="150" /> go to school and wellingtons have to be used by many people going about their business.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying to the Parliamentary Secretary that drainage in this agricultural country of ours is of vital importance.  Drainage for our small farming community is certainly of prime importance because they depend entirely on their small holdings.  If those drainage schemes were carried out land would be rendered more productive and it would also provide considerable employment. With modern methods many young fellows would be anxious to avail of employment.  Those schemes could be carried out very successfully, suitable employment provided and it would mean more people would remain on the land.</P>

      <P>The total number of persons engaged in the ship and boat building and repairing industry in mid-December 1973, the nearest relevant date for which the information required by the Deputy is available, has been estimated at 2,000.  The total number of ship building yards registered in the offices of the Revenue Commissioners under section 37 of the Finance Act, 1932, in the State on 1st January, 1974, was 46.  The total value of the output of the ship and boat building and repairing industry as covered in the Census of Industrial Production for 1972, which is the latest year for which this information <Col N="46" /> is at present available, amounted to £13.5 million.  Total exports of ships and boats were valued at £7.3 million in 1972 and £10.2 million in 1973.  These exports are not all necessarily the output of Irish shipyards in those years as they would include sales of Irish registered ships abroad in addition to newly built vessels.</P>
