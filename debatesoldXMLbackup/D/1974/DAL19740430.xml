    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that the Western Health Board are sending all hospital laundry to a Dublin city establishment; and if he will take steps to ensure that this work is done in the western region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that the Western Health Board are sending all hospital laundry to Dublin.  In fact, they send only about half the laundry requirements of two of the board's hospitals, that is to say, Galway Regional and Merlin Park Hospitals, to the Central Laundry at Rathfarnham, Dublin.  This is a recent arrangement and was entered into at the board's request because the laundries in the two hospitals mentioned were unable to cope with the laundry needs of the hospitals.  It is not intended that this should be a permanent arrangement.  The question of laundry services for this and other areas is at present being actively reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that all the flat work from those two hospitals is being sent to a laundry in Dublin?  Flat work, in laundry terms, I understand, means sheets and things like that.  Would the Minister not consider this a retrograde step?  This work could have been done in Galway city where there are two fully equipped laundries. Would the Minister be concerned at this trend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I think the Deputy must be aware of the functions of the Hospitals Joint Services Board who are charged with providing such a service initially for Dublin and, if necessary, for the whole country.  There are discussions going on at present with regard to the possibility of the establishment of laundries similar to that in Rathfarnham in Cork and in Galway.  There is no finality as yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that this action on the <Col N="327" /> part of the Western Health Board completely contradicts the whole spirit and aim of decentralisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But this was done at the request of the Western Health Board who said that they could not do all the laundry themselves.  They do not intend to continue this and consideration is being given to the establishment of a similar type of service in Cork and in Galway.  I presume the Deputy's point is that he would prefer that any laundry to be done would be done in the local laundries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly not within the spirit of the Act which provided for the establishment of the joint hospitals services board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a retrograde step and I am surprised that the Minister is showing such little concern in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Minister should express some concern at the way it is being operated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he considers that the award of 26p per week disablement pension or a lump sum of £126.00 to a person (details supplied) in Castletownroche, County Cork, who has five dependent children and is unable to secure employment because of his disablement, is realistic by any form of assessment; and if he will take suitable action in the matter.</P>

      <P>The award of disablement benefit made to the person referred to by the Deputy is the maximum which may be granted in his case under the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966, having regard to the extent of his disablement resulting from his occupational accident on the 23rd December, 1969. The award, which is a final one, was made following his examination on the 20th November, 1973, by a medical referee who assessed the degree of disablement resulting from the accident at 3 per cent.  The award was confirmed by an appeals officer following an oral hearing of the claimant's appeal on the 14th March, 1974.  The appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and I have no power to alter it.</P>

      <P>This is not something on which a decision can be made very quickly.  The original arrangement for grants was introduced in 1972 in respect of work started after 1st February, 1972, which is a relatively short time ago, and until I have all the details of this and other types of grants, which I am having considered, I would not be in a position to give any further details.</P>

      <P>A design for the scheme was submitted to the Department in December, 1972, and it was found on examination to require substantial revision and a copy of the revised design was submitted in April, 1973. After the revised design was checked by the Department inspectors it was referred to Galway County Council for approval in June, 1973, and on 30th February, 1974, a letter was received from the promoter suggesting the rerouting of certain sections of the group design and the council were asked for their observations.  These are awaited.</P>

      <P>The matter of construction of a bridge at this location and a road connecting the Headford Road with Newcastle Road is of long standing.  It was supported in the 1969 Buchanan model plan for Galway as a link in a northern ring road system. A soil survey was carried out by Galway County Council and on 30th June, 1970, the council adopted a resolution formally approving in principle the construction of the bridge and authorising detailed studies.  In December, 1972, the council estimated the cost at £430,000&mdash;incidentally, the 1974 price would be about £500,000.  On 1st April, 1973, the Galway Corporation became responsible for the project when they resumed the exercise of road functions which previously had been exercised by the county council.  No formal proposal regarding this project has been submitted to the Department <Col N="345" /> either by Galway County Council or Galway Corporation.</P>

      <P>Dublin and Meath County Councils have carried out an aerial survey to assist in establishing a line for a new road from Dublin to Kilcock.  I hope to issue a circular to road authorities within the next few weeks outlining the provisions of the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974.

      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is not right and proper that the people living in the area which was serviced by this person have to suffer because no engineer is willing to take up the work in that area?  Therefore, the Minister has a responsibility to do something to rectify the position.</P>

In view of the fact that money was left over because of the engineers' strike we asked the Minister to include it in this year's grant but we did not get it.

      <P>I am aware that a number of steel workers in the Cobh, County Cork, area have obtained bridging loans to finance the purchase of their houses in anticipation of loan funds for house purchase being made available to them by the European Coal and Steel Community.</P>
      <P>As some further time may elapse before the detailed arrangements for the payment of these loans can be finalised with the Commission of the European Communities, I have asked the National Building Agency to consider urgently the possibility of making house purchase loans available now to the workers concerned at an interest rate of 9½ per cent, adjustable in due course to take account of the interest rate on the EEC funds.  I have no funds available for the recoupment of amounts already paid in interest on bridging loans.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, arrangements are in hand for the transfer from Dublin of selected sections of the Department of Education to Athlone and of the Department of Lands to Castlebar.  In July, 1973, a contract was placed for the Castlebar offices. In February last a contract was placed for the Athlone offices.  Work is in progress on the erection of the new offices at both centres.  Further, there have been discussions with the two Departments and with staff interests about the staffing of the offices.

Representations have also been made to me by a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges about further improvements in this scheme, and these are under consideration.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the high valuation on land in the Shannon Valley from Shannonbridge to Banagher, County Offaly and that some of this land, which is flooded for six months of the year, is valued as high as £2 per statute acre; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The liability of certain land holdings to periodic flooding is normally reflected in the original valuation of those holdings.  Land subject to flooding remains legally rateable unless and until it has been struck out of the valuation list as being permanently and completely flooded and-having ceased to exist as land.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in the town of Banagher there is some land, in gardens, valued as high as £2 per statute acre; this land was not described as being subject to periodic flooding.

I am pointing out the unfairness of this valuation basis.  I want to highlight the type of valuation we have.  The Minister should be aware that this land is flooded for six months of the year. Further, some of the flooded land is valued higher than land that is not flooded.  This shows the injustice of taxing on a valuation basis.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that where land is subject to flooding it invariably has a note to that effect recorded in the valuation records and the Commissioners of Valuation take these matters into account in determining what is the appropriate valuation of the land.  It is open to any owner of property to apply to have his land revalued.  The Commissioners of Valuation, who are independent in the exercise of their functions, have no records which would appear to support what the Deputy says but, as I said in my original reply, if the Deputy will give me the particulars I shall certainly have the matter examined.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Enright, this is what I said to Deputy Callanan in the first place, that if he gives me information on the matter I shall certainly pass it on to the Commissioners of Valuation.  The valuation <Col N="360" /> books do show along the banks of the Shannon considerable tracts which are subject to seasonal flooding and in such cases I understand an allowance was made in fixing the valuation for such seasonal flooding.  If it has happened that some piece of land has been omitted or that there is a piece of land now subject to flooding which was not subject to flooding when the valuations were last made, obviously, in equity, these matters should be examined.</P>

      <P>In view of my extensive personal knowledge of this matter, could I ask the Minister to look into the mechanism by which appeals can be made to the valuation commissioners for revaluation?  In my own case, for the last 25 years I have been appealing to the commissioners whose procedure is so esoteric as to be totally incomprehensible, to revalue land of my own, 15 acres of which have been totally destroyed by flooding, land which is of the highest quality.  I ask the Minister to look into the procedures and see if he could ensure that farmers such as those mentioned by Deputy Callanan and Deputy Enright could get quick results in the matter of revaluation.</P>

      <P>Payment of the temporary EEC subsidy on eligible clean pigs was originally confined to pigs delivered to bacon factories and registered pork export premises.  I have since arranged to extend payments, where feasible, to certain premises at which large numbers of pigs are slaughtered for sale on the home market.  These are premises at which slaughtering of all pigs is already <Col N="364" /> being inspected ante and post mortem by a local authority veterinary officer, which are suitably equipped for weighing the pig carcases and at which other relevant requirements can be fulfilled.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that at the present time it is not possible to produce a bacon pig profitably?  In fact the usual experience of farmers is that they lose from £2 to £5 in the production of a bacon pig.  Is he further aware of a recent study done by Keele University into the prospects of the Irish bacon industry in the next five years which anticipates a drop in production to 25 per cent of its present level?  If he is so aware, has he any comment to make?  Can the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary at this late stage give some guidance, advice and encouragement to the small pig producers who are being pressed out of business?</P>

    <Title>Dublin Gas Order, 1974: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Dublin Gas Order, 1974, proposed to be made by the Minister for Transport and Power and <Col N="372" /> laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 9th day of April, 1974, under Subsection 4 of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>
    <P>Gas undertakings generally operate under special Acts which authorise them to manufacture and distribute gas in certain specified areas.  Such modifications to these Acts, as may be required by the gas undertakings from time to time, are made under section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which enables me to make by order the required modifications. Before an order of this kind is made it has to be laid in draft form before both Houses of the Oireachtas who may, by resolution, approve the draft order either in the form submitted, or with modifications and additions. When such approval has been given I may then make the order in the form which has been approved.</P>
    <P>In 1954, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce made an order under the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which gave the Alliance and Dublin Consumers Gas Company&mdash; more usually known as the Dublin Gas Company&mdash;power to appoint as a director of the company one of the following&mdash;the general manager, the chief engineer or the secretary of the company.  In 1969, the then Minister for Transport and Power made an amending order which gave the company power to appoint all three persons mentioned above as directors. Under this order, the chief engineer and the secretary were appointed directors, the general manager having already been appointed a director under the 1954 Order.</P>
    <P>Directors appointed by virtue of the positions they hold in the company are, for convenience, referred to as executive directors; the directors who do not hold executive positions in the Company, are for convenience, referred to as non-executive directors.</P>
    <P>Under the Alliance and Dublin Gas Act, 1866, the number of directors of the Gas Company is limited to nine. The board is at present at full strength.  The former general manager retired recently and, accordingly, ceased to be an executive director by <Col N="373" /> virtue of his position as general manager.  He has, however, been reappointed to the board as a non-executive director.  The new general manager was formerly the chief engineer and as such was an executive director; he has now been appointed an executive director in his capacity as general manager.  The board of the Gas Company, accordingly, consists at present of seven non-executive directors and two executive directors i.e. the general manager and the secretary.</P>
    <P>The Gas Company have applied to me for an order which would give them power to increase the total number of directors from nine to ten and to appoint not more than four directors from the following executive staff&mdash;the general manager, the chief engineer, the secretary, the financial controller or personnel manager.  It is not the company's intention to appoint more than three executive directors at present but they wish to have the power to appoint a fourth executive director at a later stage if such a course seems desirable when a vacancy arises.</P>
    <P>All appointments as directors are subject to approval at the annual general meeting of the company.</P>
    <P>The company have also asked me to include in the order an authorisation for the use of certain lands owned by the company at Sir John Rogerson's Quay for the manufacture of gas.  The company propose to erect a new plant on these lands to meet increased demand for gas.  The provisions of the Planning Acts will, of course, attach to the company's proposals for new buildings on the site in question and the making of the proposed order will in no way prejudice the application of the Planning Acts to the gas company's proposals.</P>
    <P>I see no objection to the company's proposals and, following consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I intimated my agreement to having the necessary arrangements made for introducing the draft form. Thus, the order now laid in draft form before the House will, if approved, <Col N="374" /> give the company the necessary authority to:&mdash;(a) increase the total number of directors of the company from nine to ten; (b) permit an increase from three to four in the total number of executive directors that may be appointed; (c) use additional land for the manufacture and storage of gas.</P>
    <P>Notice of the proposed order was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in a daily newspaper.  No objection to the order was received.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied as to the company's need for this order and satisfied also that there is nothing in it which is repugnant to the public interest.  I, therefore, recommend the order for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The order has already been approved by Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have no objection to the order but can the Minister give us any information as to the location of these lands on which the gas company are seeking permission to erect a new gas works plant at Sir John Rogerson's Quay?  I understand that this is also the location for the construction of a bridge which will attach to a major motorway for which the Minister for Local Government has proposals.

      <P>I do not agree.  This is land owned by the Dublin Gas Company.  They at present have to come to me for permission to build on it, purely to lay a draft order before the House.  This order merely gives the Minister's permission to build on the land.  They still have to get planning permission from Dublin Corporation.  They cannot go to Dublin Corporation without permission from me.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is seeing more in this order than is actually in it.  This is merely an order giving them the Minister's permission to go ahead and build if they get the normal planning permission.  Indeed, there is a lot to be said for amending all the Gas Acts so that orders do not have to come before this House every six months to give them permission for small things like an increase in the number of directors.  If I did not enter into this at all, they would still have to go to Dublin Corporation.  They own this land.  If they apply for planning permission to build on it, Dublin Corporation will refuse it if it is in line with the proposed road or bridge.</P>

In this order I am also giving them permission to increase the number of directors from nine to ten.  That does not mean that they may do it.  They must go to their own annual general meeting.  Similarly, as regards the land <Col N="377" /> at Sir John Rogerson's Quay.

Whether the roadway is to be there or not they still have to apply for planning permission. It it is to be there the corporation will refuse planning permission and that is the end of the matter.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the following regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Local Elections (Postal Voting) Regulations, 1974</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> a copy of which regulations in draft form was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 24th day of April, 1974.</P>
    <P>The Local Elections (Postal Voting) Regulations, 1974, and the Local Elections (Amendment) Regulations, 1974, are closely related.  Therefore, I am glad the House has agreed to discuss both sets of regulations together.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations are laid before the House in accordance with section 82 (5) of the Electoral Act, 1963, which provides that, where regulations under that section are proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal first with the postal voting regulations.  There has been a demand for the provision of extended postal voting facilities for many years.  Representations seeking such facilities have been submitted from time to time in respect of such groups as commercial travellers, sailors, fishermen, invalids, persons who are abroad on business at election time, airline staffs, hospital patients, persons who have changed their address, persons who are away on holidays at the time an election is held, and old people and others who are unable to leave their homes because of illness or disability.</P>
    <P>In response to these representations, the extension of postal voting facilities, which are at present confined to members of the Garda Síochána and of the Defence Forces, was considered on a number of occasions by my predecessors as Minister for Local Government and by former Governments. It was also considered in 1960-61 by the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law.  However, on each occasion, the view was taken that the risk of abuse would be too great and that there would be administrative difficulties arising from the large numbers of electors likely to be involved.</P>
    <P>A risk of abuse and administrative difficulties are inherent in the operation of a system of postal voting for categories of electors other than <Col N="379" /> members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  However, these must be balanced against the fact that the lack of such a system has the effect of preventing some electors from exercising their right to vote. In my view, the case for extending postal voting facilities is strong enough to outweigh the risk of abuse and the administrative difficulties. Accordingly, I propose to make regulations, subject to the approval of each House of the Oireachtas, under which such facilities would be available at local elections, commencing with the local elections next June.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated explains the provisions of the proposed regulations. Basically, what is proposed is that a right to apply to vote by post at local elections should be granted to every elector who is unable, or is likely to be unable, to vote in person at his polling station by reason of the circumstances of his occupation, service or employment, absence from the address where he is registered, illness or physical disability or his employment by a returning officer in connection with an election.  The application procedure has been designed to facilitate electors as far as possible while, at the same time, maintaining safeguards against abuse. Some Deputies may well take the view that the procedure is not strict enough to eliminate all possible forms of abuse.</P>
    <P>The problem is, however, that if further stringent checks were provided for, the whole system might become so complicated and so troublesome that it would deter people from availing of the new facilities.  I trust that the system provided for in the regulations will work well.  The operation of the system in relation to the forthcoming local elections will be kept under review with a view to establishing whether any changes may be necessary or desirable at future elections.  I will welcome the views of Deputies and Senators on the operation of the system at the elections in June and any suggestions they may have for improvements at future elections <Col N="380" /> will be carefully considered. After the local elections, I propose to introduce legislation to provide postal voting facilities at Dáil and Presidential elections and at referenda.</P>
    <P>The approval of the House is also sought to the draft of the Local Elections (Amendment) Regulations, 1974.  An explanatory memorandum on these draft regulations has also been circulated and I do not, therefore, think it necessary to detain the House by elaborating on the details. The draft regulations propose to amend the Local Elections Regulations, 1965, by making the changes required as a result of the reduction of the minimum voting age from 21 to 18 years; by increasing the safeguards to the secrecy of the ballot at local elections arising from the Supreme Court ruling in 1971 and by making some minor technical and procedural changes arising from experience at the local elections held in 1967.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party welcome the extension of the postal vote.  At our recent Ard-Fheis a motion to this effect was passed unanimously and as I am aware that the Minister was an avid listener on the radio to the happenings at the Ard-Fheis, I am glad to see he has been influenced in his decision by the wishes of the delegates present at that conference.  There is no conflict between both sides of the House as to the principle of extending postal voting.  I note the Minister's cautious words in relation to the posibility of abuse.  Both sides of the House, I am sure, hope there will not be any abuse of this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of the postal voting is being done to meet the needs and the circumstances of a fairly substantial proportion of our citizens.  We hope there will not be those in the community who will seek to avail of this new facility to introduce abuses into elections.  The Minister is right, and I expressed this view at the Ard-Fheis, that it is not beyond our capacity to devise a system which would extend the postal vote and at the same time minimise the possibility of abuse. <Col N="381" /> The number of persons invalided and those away from their homes, due to work or other circumstances, who have not been able to cast their votes, has, from reports, been quite large.  The Irish Wheelchair Association have been among one of the leading associations campaigning for an extension of the postal vote.  They will be pleased this is being done.  The Irish Commercial Travellers Association have been for some time advocating the extension of the postal vote.  Many other groups of people, who have only been able to vote from time to time because of temporary illness, who find themselves in hospital or other places, will also be pleased that this is being done.</P>
    <P>It is surprising that a joint committee on electoral law, comprised of Members of this House, which sat in the period 1960-61, took the view against further extension of postal voting.  The House has achieved a certain amount of maturity now in changing that view of elected representatives and in agreeing to this extension.  All sides of the House were represented on the Joint Committee on Electoral Law and supported the view at that time that it should not be extended.  As the Minister said, the view was taken by them that the risk of abuse would be too great and that there would be administrative difficulties.  Whatever administrative difficulties they foresaw the ease with which our neighbours in the Six County area extended the postal vote to all the citizens residing there dispelled this great myth of the massive administrative difficulties.  It seemed to operate there quite successfully on a very extensive scale and I am not aware of any great outcry afterwards of serious abuse.  I am sure we will be able to avail of this facility, operate it in a mature way and be satisfied after this election that it was a wise thing to extend postal voting to the people.</P>
    <P>While we are on the matter of postal voting and elections generally, I should like to express some surprise that the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to provide free postage for the political parties contesting the local elections.  I do not know if this is something <Col N="382" /> he considered but I think it is something in Opposition that he would have subscribed to.  A large number of people would subscribe to the idea that free postage should be available to those standing for election to the various authorities.  I am throwing this out here to see what the Minister's reaction to it would be.  He has indicated by shaking his head in a particular manner that he does not agree so I take it the answer is negative.</P>
    <P>I think what is contained in section 12 (3) of the regulations is that a person who presents himself at a polling station and is informed by the presiding officer that his vote has already been cast by way of postal vote, and who claims before the presiding officer that he is, in fact, the person who appears on the voting register, that he did not vote by post and is prepared to take an oath or affirm under Article 46, that person is then entitled to receive a ballot paper from the presiding officer.  Is that so?  And, if such a person, having taken an oath or made an affirmation, receives a ballot paper from the presiding officer will that vote have equal value with all the other votes cast?  I have it in the back of my mind that such persons are issued with a special ballot paper, a pink paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted to clear the air on that.  There could, of course, be a certain duplication in such circumstances.  There is just one other point on which I should like some clarification.  It is sometimes difficult to work out the chronological order of events.  At least 28 days before polling day the returning officer must publish a notice of those persons who are qualified persons.  He must also publish an indication of the time limit during which such applications must be received and give the times at which forms will be available.  I understand application forms must also be available 28 days before polling day.  In other words, the forms will be available on the day the notice is published.  The application must be received by the presiding officer by <Col N="383" /> 12 a.m. on the seventh day after publication of the notice.  It is not clear what procedure the returning officer will follow in relation to the posting out to the applicant of the actual ballot paper and how many days there will be for the applicant to fill in the ballot paper and when the ballot paper will have to be returned.  I presume the date will coincide with that fixed for the Army and the Garda. Will the Minister tell us, because this would seem to indicate that each returning officer will do this himself.  I am sure there will be a direction from the Department.</P>
      <P>We welcome the proposal to extend postal voting and, like the Minister's side of the House, we will keep a careful eye on its operation during the course of the local elections.  I am glad the Minister is prepared to keep this under review.  If any abuses arise or any anomalies appear I presume the Minister will not delay in eradicating or correcting these.</P>
      <P>Most of the other regulations the Minister is asking us to accept are consequential on the reduction of the voting age and the change following the Supreme Court decision.  I introduced legislation into the House on this.  I accept this has to be done.</P>
      <P>It is stated that where a poll is taken on an island in advance of the ordinary polling day the presiding officer may close the polling station after four hours, if that is necessary, in order to ensure the ballot papers reach the mainland in time.  Under Article 12 of the draft regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is it&mdash;at present provision is made for everything except the ordinary polling day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me that in this technological age there should be no need for a regulation like this.  Helicopters are not inhibited by sea or high winds. The difficulty that existed in the past in relation to the delivery of ballot <Col N="384" /> boxes from islands no longer exists and the regulation is, therefore, antiquated.  I would ask the Minister to drop this provision.  It gives an extraordinary power to a presiding officer.  He could deprive people of the opportunity of voting.  Indeed, I am sure the constitutionality of this could be tested if a person were deprived of his right to exercise the franchise. It seems to me there is discrimination here.  I have been on islands on numerous occasions on polling days and I have never known of any justification for such a provision.  It is excessive and, while we have the opportunity now, we should delete it. If the Minister does that he will have our full support for everything else in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this extension of the postal vote.  It is long overdue.  Some concern has been expressed about possible irregularities. Such a possibility should not inhibit us from progressing.  I certainly cannot visualise any great possibility of irregularity.  The sick and invalided will now have an opportunity of casting their votes.  We have known of people in the past being brought to polling stations under great stress and strain.  This will be eliminated in future.</P>
      <P>I think Sunday would be an excellent day on which to hold elections. If Sunday is not thought desirable, surely we could have a national holiday.  We do not have elections all that often.  The idea is to ensure that as many people as possible vote.  This could be achieved by holding elections on Sunday.  That is done in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is one more measure highlighting the Minister's progressive approach.  Deputy Molloy referred to a resolution passed at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  Fianna Fáil had ample time to do what is being done now but they were slow to do it.  Although the Minister has been in office for only 15 months he has taken the first opportunity to do something about this matter.  I am glad he is leaving it open for further consideration after the local elections to see whether he <Col N="385" /> will amend or extend the regulations. There may be some anomalies we cannot see at the moment but which will show themselves in the period of six or eight weeks when the local elections are over and we will have an opportunity then of carrying out any necessary amendments.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure.  It will lead to greater involvement in the democratic election process.  When we have general elections in the future I hope they take place on a day when everybody is free.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With our spokesman on Local Government, I should like to welcome the extension of the postal voting regulations.  On the Committee Stage of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill some time ago, I made a plea to the Minister to extend these facilities and he assured me he had the matter under active consideration. I welcome the range of extensions the Minister has included in the new regulations.  In particular, I am glad that commercial travellers, sailors, fishermen and invalids have been included. We all know of cases where people in hospitals, who had not been outside for many months previously, were taken out to cast their votes but this will no longer happen.  I am glad the Minister has bowed to the inevitable and has introduced this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one question I should like to ask the Minister and that is in regard to where a postal vote request is denied.  Who is to determine whether such a request is to be granted or refused?  Is there a time limit within which this can be decided?  I understand the voter must apply to the returning officer for a postal vote within seven days.  If the returning officer refuses the application and says that the applicant could get to the polls on the election day, for the information of Members of this House and the public, will the Minister clarify the question of denial of such a request? I am in favour of what the Minister has done in the regulations and I am extremely glad he has taken this action.  He made a wise decision when he said he will see how it operates on this occasion and after the local <Col N="386" /> elections will bring in an amendment for the Dáil and Presidential elections.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed regarding the question of extension of free postage for election literature at local elections. This facility is available in general elections and I had hoped the Minister would allow it for local elections. Perhaps he would reconsider the matter and if he has not made a firm decision perhaps he would introduce this measure before the local elections.  For many years we have been anxious that ordinary citizens, irrespective of political affiliations, would become involved in local affairs and problems.  An Independent candidate who has not the backing of a political organisation finds it impossible to canvass every voter.  His only real opportunity to do this is by postal communication but the free postage is not available at local elections.  The Minister should extend this concession to local elections so that any citizen who wants to may be able to stand at local elections and communicate with every voter on the register. Without a political organisation and structure it is physically impossible for a candidate to do this.  An Independent candidate may be able to canvass 20 per cent or 25 per cent of the electorate but he cannot get in touch with many more.  If the facility of free postage is available at general elections, equally it should be available at local elections.  In the last decade local politics have taken on a new importance.  People have become much more conscious of community affairs and problems.  This is desirable and it should be encouraged and fostered. A major encouragement would be the extension of free postage.</P>
    <P>I have a certain interest in this because I shall be standing in the local elections and I should like to have the free postage concession in my own area but I am speaking against myself when I say it should be extended to Independent candidates. From my point of view it would be better if they were not able to canvass people in the area but from a democratic point of view it would be better for them to be able to do so. <Col N="387" /> It would be an encouragement to any citizen who wishes to put his name forward and I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  It is the democratic right of every citizen to communicate freely his views to the electorate during an election campaign. I am sure that on reconsidering the matter the Minister will agree with the views expressed by Deputy Molloy and myself.</P>
    <P>Later I shall speak about the council staffs.  I would ask the Minister if our embassy staff abroad will be able to vote in local elections under these regulations and, when the new regulations are introduced, if they will be able to vote in general elections.  I am glad that the regulations include the airline staffs and the crews on our shipping fleet.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the few points I have raised and make some comment on the extension of free postage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on extending the postal voting regulations.  Under the present postal voting regulations the Army and the Garda were entitled to vote but our seafaring personnel and our airline staff were discriminated against and were not included.  I cannot understand why these regulations were not extended long ago.</P>
      <P>There are a few points on which I should like clarification.  Deputy Burke mentioned people who are ill or aged or invalided and people in institutions. All parties are guilty at election times of going into institutions and hospitals and putting the medical staff in the difficult position of having to say who they would recommend as being in a fit condition to travel to the polling booths and cast their votes.  I am glad this is being done away with and that such people will be entitled to vote without leaving the institution, or without leaving their beds in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The postal vote can be extended only to people who are on the register of electors.  Who will be responsible for making application for a postal vote for people in institutions?  Will election candidates and election <Col N="388" /> workers be campaigning and visiting hospitals and making applications for the postal vote?  Do they have to make application or what is the position?  A number of people who are invalided or in institutions, and who are unfit mentally or physically to take an interest in an election, will have no interest in applying for a postal vote.</P>
    <P>At some polling booths there were stone stairs which old people found it very difficult to climb and this prevented them from going to the polling booths.  I am glad that is being done away with.  I am concerned that people in institutions should be able to avail of this facility which is being provided by the Minister.  Who will be responsible for seeing to it that they have a ballot paper?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Molloy and other Deputies, I welcome the proposal to expand postal voting.  A great injustice is being removed from people who spend many years in hospital.  In my own area we had a polling station in one hospital, but it was only the mobile patients who could vote.  While the election atmosphere permeated the hospital wards I always felt that a grave injustice was done to people who were not mobile but who were quite capable of voting if they could be brought to the polling station.  This proposal will remove that injustice and they will now be able to vote.</P>
      <P>I fear that this facility may be abused.  We must strive to make the regulations as watertight as possible so that this innovation will not be abused.  To the extent that it could be abused we might well have second thoughts about it.  It is a fundamental right of a person to be able to vote despite the state of his health but we must seek to ensure that there will be no abuse of this new facility.</P>

    <P>I support the plea for free postal voting in the municipal and local elections.  We should not be so niggardly as to refuse postal facilities for local elections.  We should show the people that we value the status of the local authorities.  We should ensure that the best people are returned and that no man will be deprived of the <Col N="389" /> opportunity to seek public office because he is not wealthy.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago the Dublin City Commission unanimously agreed to ask the Minister to review the city areas.  The Minister has nine five-seat areas, whereas the commission felt that there should be ten fours and one five.  We have not had a meeting since.  I think the Minister is saying no.</P>

I support the idea of giving postal votes to airline personnel, commercial travellers and especially patients who are immobilised in institutions and cannot cast their votes.  This may have a good psychological effect on them and even improve their health by showing them that they are part of our society and that they are taking an active part in it by casting their votes in elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's proposals.  It is pleasant, for a change, to see such unanimity in this House relating to such a matter.  It is necessary to introduce certain amendments because of the reduction in the voting age from 21 to 18 years.  I support that completely because of the earlier maturity of our people and because of the higher educational standards.  It is entirely democratic that this should be the case.</P>
      <P>If we look to the complexion of the forthcoming local elections in June, in the sense that local elections have not taken place for seven years and, in addition to the lapse of seven years, the voting age has come down from 21 to 18 years, it is interesting to see that a full decade of people will be voting for the first time in the local authority elections this year, that is, those people in the age group from 18 to 21 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a point relating to 18-yearolds and the desirability of the postal vote which I do not think has been mentioned specifically.  Many students who are 18 years plus would not be in a position to vote in certain elections <Col N="390" /> and it is particularly desirable that they should have the postal vote. The Minister referred to the desirability for greater secrecy of the ballot.  I should like to refer to this point very briefly.  It seems to me that there is a lack of secrecy, to a degree, in many of the very small booths in the sense that through the tallying system at the various counts when you are tallying what seems to be the trend in booths where they are as few as 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 votes, if there are slight shifts in political opinion or allegiance to particular candidates this is much too obvious under the present system. This is something that should be considered with a view to reducing what I think is a certain lack of secrecy in that regard in very small booths.</P>
    <P>The Minister is wise in introducing his regulations and amendments in connection with local elections rather than general elections, because local elections, while important, are not as important as general elections.  This can be used as a trial run and it will be possible in the light of experience in the forthcoming elections to provide for possible amendments if these are considered necessary.  I do not entirely understand the necessity for the change in regard to the islands.  It is stated that in the case of a poll taken on an island in advance of the ordinary polling day, the presiding officer may close the poll after four hours' voting if this is necessary to ensure that the ballot boxes will reach the mainland in time.  I think, if the island poll is taking place before the normal polling day there should be no problem in allowing for the voting to continue for the normal time but if the Minister considers the present regulation necessary it would be very important to advise islanders, by publicity from his Department, of the change in the position so that they do not lose their franchise in this or later elections because of this regulation. In fairness, they should have adequate notice of the change.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad postal voting is being introduced.  It was unfair to the categories mentioned by the Minister and other speakers that for many <Col N="391" /> years they did not have the option to vote&mdash;commercial travellers, airline workers, and those working abroad&mdash; and the change was overdue.  There is considerable merit in Deputy O'Brien's suggestion about having Sunday as a voting day because this would reduce the necessity for and the numbers involved in postal voting to a large degree.  This is done in many countries and would, I think, be acceptable to quite a number in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not think there has been specific mention of one section of our people in parts of the country where I live where due to the economic situation a large proportion of people from the west are working in Britain for long spells each year.  In a great many cases unless they have been abroad for a number of years their names are on the register.  In areas of high emigration our experience of the actual poll on election day is that it has been substantially less than in areas where those on the register are actually living within the constituency.  The reason is that a great many of them are legitimately on the register but are migratory workers in Scotland, Wales or England.  I am particularly glad, more than in the case of any other section of the population, that these people will have the opportunity to vote in elections.  Although living outside the country they are citizens and in forthcoming elections this will be a significant factor.  Were one to analyse the number affected by the Minister's regulation and the new postal voting, it would seem that those people temporarily domiciled in Britain will probably constitute the largest proportion of those voting by post.  This is healthy in a democratic sense because they are away from the political divisions&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get down to nitty-gritty matters.  The last speaker mentioned one of them.  Is the Minister correct when he says migratory workers or workers who are on the register here and who are temporarily abroad are not entitled to vote?  The Minister's statement gives one of the categories mentioned by the Minister which will have the facility of postal voting as persons who are abroad on business at election time.  I fully back Deputy Staunton's case for migratory workers. They are temporarily abroad at election time and, therefore, are as much entitled to a postal vote as a businessman who is temporarily abroad at election time.  It is a serious statement by the Minister when he says that migratory workers from the west who are temporarily abroad at election time, for a month or a week, cannot vote.  They may have left the day before the election.  A businessman may be abroad for three months. For part of that time, perhaps one week, he will be on business and the remainder he will be on a yachting trip around the world.  He will have the luxury of voting in the local elections.</P>
      <P>Will the Donegal or Mayo migratory worker who may leave the day or week before the election to do seasonal work in Britain, and is genuinely abroad on business at election time, have a postal vote?  Will the Minister allow this particular phraseology to cover the migratory worker as well as the businessman?  As far as I am concerned there is no difference between the migratory labourer who goes to Britain and the businessman who goes on a sales promotion tour behind the Iron Curtain or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fishermen will have the facility of the postal vote.  Many trawlers are more than 100 feet and, therefore, travel outside Irish territorial waters. Fishermen on these trawlers will have <Col N="394" /> postal votes.  If they are hundreds of miles away and a storm breaks they often put into the nearest port.  Therefore, they may be in England, Scotland or Wales on election day.  Having made provision for this, they will and can get the facility of a postal vote.  I am sure the Minister will clarify the incongruity which exists in this statement and the actual working of the postal vote so far as business people abroad are concerned.</P>
    <P>From the time he receives it until it is dropped into the letterbox, if that is the procedure to be used, is there anyone to whom he must present his credentials, or to whom he must refer, who will witness that he has voted and who will be in a position to certify this?  If this does not happen, I can see wholesale abuses of the system. When making an application for a declaration form for the postal vote, must a person apply in person?  Can his solicitor or anybody else&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is set out on the back of the form of the draft statutory instrument which has been circulated to all Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the voter has to identify himself as the person who will actually use the postal vote, put it in the envelope and return it.  Will this system work in the same way as, say, the system under which the university students vote in the Seanad elections? They must get a witness who will identify them as the persons who are entitled to use those particular postal votes.  If this is not done, there could be serious abuses.  We must ensure that the person with the postal vote is the person who uses it.  Is there any loophole where a number of postal votes would go to certain addresses and that the people for whom they are intended will be the people who will physically use and mark those ballot papers.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the House for the way in which they have dealt with this matter.  I am aware that all Deputies are as anxious as I am to ensure that this <Col N="395" /> will work properly.  We are all in politics and it is in all our interests to see that there are no abuses.</P>
      <P>We have all heard and probably witnessed abuses of the present system.  There may be abuses under the new system and I will be grateful for any information on abuses which may occur and which Deputies can certify and report to me.  Then I will be glad to try to ensure that they do not happen when legislation is introduced for other elections.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Molloy, postal ballot papers will be sent out as soon as practicable after 24th May.  This is the wording which is used in the regulations in regard to the Garda and the Army.  It is impossible to say how soon papers will be sent out in the new situation because we do not know how many applications we will have. Voters will have until the close of the poll on 18th June to get their papers back by post to the returning officer.  That will give them roughly three weeks, which should be reasonable enough.  Deputy Molloy also spoke about free postage.  There is no such thing as free postage because the post office has to be paid by someone for every service.</P>

The only change in this respect is that until now it was provided that the poll can be closed early on any day but that that cannot be done on polling day.  This probably was an omission in the previous regulations. I think it is more important to have this provision on polling day than on any other day.  We either have to accept or reject this because of the shortage of time.  I agree that possibly we have reached the stage where we might leave it out altogether.

      <P>We will still have to send a ballot box whether or not there is postal voting because the original regulations are there.  I am trying to introduce something which would facilitate them in such a way that everybody could exercise the right to vote.  I want to see everybody who has the right to vote being able to do so.  Could we leave it at that?  I want to refer to another group who have not been mentioned at all, for instance, lorry drivers and builders' labourers who leave home at 6.30 in the morning and may not be back home until 10 o'clock at night, which often happens in the month of June, people working on a double shift, which occasionally happens.  Those people, because of their employment are covered although they are not specifically mentioned.  As I mentioned earlier, there is no special provision relating to people living on an island.  There is an arrangement already there in relation to advance polling.  The box is sent earlier and this should still facilitate them.  I wonder if everybody on an island would welcome postal voting.</P>

I believe those who are fishing, for instance, and who are unable to vote or cannot take the time to vote would be eligible.  Possibly some of their wives might also be unable to vote.  We would still have to have the polling booth on the island.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke spoke about the procedure for dealing with applications. This is set out in article 8.  If a returning officer gets an application from somebody the application must be certified.  This is where Deputy Cunningham's question comes in about the person working in England.  I am not picking out businessmen in particular and saying that they can apply but migratory workers cannot.  The person who is making the application must have his application certified by certain types of people, a garda, a clergyman, a local authority official or a health board official.  The application must be filled in in his presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me come to the second part, that is, that the ballot paper will then be sent to the address which has been set out on the application form and with it there will be a receipt which must be signed to prove it has been accepted by the person who is mentioned as having made the application. The person must sign the receipt and return it with the ballot paper.  Ballot papers cannot be sent to an address outside the country.  The returning officer cannot send the ballot papers to an address outside the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply stating what the qualification is.  The person must (1) be on the register and (2) he must make an application which must be certified by a clergyman, a member of the garda&mdash;a member of the RUC does not do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It covers anybody who makes an application to vote and is on the register.  These people qualify by having their applications certified. People who are commuting have a fortnight to do it.  These people have ample time to apply.  I believe there will be certain people who will, perhaps, bend the rules a bit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not suggest that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not suggest that at all but I am quite sure that Deputy Molloy is as well aware as I am that there will be efforts made to bend it a bit.  I want to warn that, particularly with regard to hospitals, old folks' homes and mental hospitals, there are very strict penalties laid down.  One Deputy asked if the person had to sign the form himself or if there could be group applications made.  The question whether an application could be made by a solicitor.  There are no group applications to be made.  The applications <Col N="403" /> must be made by the people concerned, they must sign them and they must be certified.  If it comes to light that there are cases where people break that regulation, and where there is an attempt made by somebody to vote for people who are unable to vote, that is a breach of the law and will be dealt with pretty severely.  We all heard stories about what happened in some of the mental hospitals and in old folks' homes some years ago where people were wheeled out to vote and some of them were not wheeled back again.  They had to go back under their own steam.  As a result of that, one of my predecessors made a rule that mental hospital patients could only be registered in their home areas.  This was an excellent idea.  Voting from mental hospitals will be spread over a very wide area if such voting takes place.  Some mental hospital patients are able to vote and are entitled to vote, but those who are not able to make application should not have it made for them by someone else and, if it were made for them, that would be a breach of the regulations.  We are all agreed this sort of abuse, when it does occur, does not do politicians any good.</P>

      <P>There was some comment by Deputy Burke about embassy staff. If they are on the register of electors they will be entitled to vote. Later on, when legislation is being prepared we can consider whether there should be a change in the registration law in order to give all embassy staff votes and to include all those staff outside the country.</P>

      <P>They can vote.  The millions who left this country over the years and who are living abroad cannot vote and I do not think Deputy Cunningham would expect us to include them.  If migratory workers are on the register&mdash;and they are entitled to be if they are coming back within 18 months of leaving the country; Deputy Molloy knows that is <Col N="405" /> the regulation&mdash;and they apply to vote and the ballot paper is sent to their home address and is certified as having been received by the person who made the application and the ballot paper comes back in time, then they can vote in that way.</P>

Again, we did not want people to have to pay for the right to vote.  I have said the system is not perfect but we must make an effort to widen it.  I would ask the House to accept that this is being done in good faith.  It is the job of all of us, and of representatives outside the House, to see that it is as foolproof as far as possible.</P>

If a postal vote is applied for and if the person concerned comes to the booth and says he did not apply for it, even though a postal vote application may have come in for him from somebody else, he is entitled to claim a vote if he is prepared to swear he did not apply for the vote originally.  He will get the same kind of ballot paper as everyone; the 1963 Act removed the provision regarding the different coloured ballot papers.</P>
      <P>A list will be given to each candidate of the people entitled to a postal vote.  The registers in the ballot boxes will have the names of those who have been given postal votes marked off in green ink.</P>

      <P>I made many efforts to do things that could have been done but were not.  If I made an occasional mistake I cannot be blamed.  Those who did nothing also made their share of mistakes.  I should like to thank the House for the comments that have been made.  While there has been some cross-talk, as there has not been a Committee Stage perhaps this is the best way of dealing with this matter.  We have succeeded in ironing out many points and it is all right if we do not agree on everything. Apparently all of us are in favour of postal voting and we want to see it work properly.  If it does not work properly it is not our fault.  It is up to us to ensure that when legislation is introduced in the future we will be able to include in it remedies for the mistakes that may occur this time.  I believe it will make little or no difference to the outcome of elections.  I should like to see many more people voting but I think the proportion of people who will vote will be roughly the same as hitherto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Someone mentioned the question of where polling stations are sited.  If there is a polling station upstairs in a premises, it is right that a person who may not be able to go upstairs should get a postal vote.  There would be a health reason in this case.  These measures are inserted for the purpose of increasing the opportunities of people to vote.  With regard to Sunday voting, I think if this happened we would have many more people voting.  However, there has been no pressure from any group, except on a very small scale, for Sunday voting.  In fact, the last joint committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas that considered this <Col N="410" /> matter recommended against week-end voting; they were opposed to voting on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The House will recall that I indicated on 4th April that I proposed bringing in legislation which would allow certain categories of local authority employees to become members of local authorities without forfeiting their employment.  I indicated that I hoped the Oireachtas would see fit to pass the measure in time to enable its provisions to apply in relation to the forthcoming local elections.  These provisions are contained in sections 23 and 24 of the present Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill falls into two parts: sections 1 to 22 deal with election petitions and the remaining sections with the removal of membership disqualifications and related matters.  The individual provisions of the Bill are dealt with in the explanatory memorandum circulated with it.</P>
      <P>The former procedure for dealing with local election petitions was contained mainly in two 19th century British enactments.  Under this law the court for the trial of a local election petition consisted of a barrister appointed by the judges on the rota for the trial of parliamentary election petitions.  In February, 1961, the High Court ruled that this election court was unconstitutional on the grounds that it purported to exercise judicial powers in criminal matters and that this is a function the exercise of which by authorities other than the courts is expressly prohibited by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes that local election petitions will be tried by the Circuit Court.  The system generally will be similar to that which existed under the former law but outdated and non-essential procedures have been modernised or removed.  In particular, the petition procedure has been tailored to suit the system of proportional representation while the previous procedure was related to the straight vote system.  This Bill does not deal with petitions relating to parliamentary elections.  Unlike the law <Col N="413" /> dealing with local election petitions the parliamentary petitions law has not been found to be unconstitutional and appears to work relatively satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Deputies will probably attach greater importance to the sections of the Bill dealing with the removal of barriers to local authority membership.  The disqualification of aliens is contained in the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898.  At that time the expression &ldquo;alien&rdquo; apparently meant &ldquo;a subject of a foreign state who was not born within the allegiance of the Crown&rdquo;; it is now taken to mean anybody who is not an Irish citizen.  Non-citizens have the right to vote at local elections and it is only logical that they should also have the right to become a member of a local authority if they enjoy sufficient popular support in their area.</P>
    <P>The disqualification for membership of local authorities on persons in holy orders and ministers of religion goes back to 1840.  This disqualification would appear to contravene the provision in the Constitution which states that: &ldquo;The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status&rdquo;.  At present there is a double barrier which prevents a local authority employee becoming a member of the local authority.  First, a person is disqualified for membership if he holds any paid office or place of profit under or in the gift of the authority, other than the office of mayor.  This applies also to committees of agriculture and vocational education committees.  Secondly, the Local Government Act, 1955, provides that no person may hold any office of profit under or be employed for remuneration by or under a local authority while he is a member of that authority.  If a person resigns his membership of the local authority the restriction on employment continues for a year or until his ordinary term of office would have expired.  Similar provisions apply to committees of agriculture and vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, the electoral disqualification will be removed altogether and provision is made <Col N="414" /> whereby the restriction on employment of members may be lifted in relation to particular classes of employees. Orders will be made by the appropriate Ministers specifying the classes of employees which will be so exempted. This will provide a flexible arrangement under which each category can be considered on its merits.  The intention is that generally the restriction would be lifted for all employees except those holding fairly senior posts and others involved in policy matters.</P>
    <P>My intention would be to remove the restriction on employment in relation to all employees who are not officers&mdash;these are in the main manual workers&mdash;and in relation to all officers other than certain categories whose duties are such that it would be inappropriate to remove the restriction in their case.  The offices in relation to which the restriction would still apply would in general be all administrative staff down to but not including the rank of clerical officer, all professional staff, library staff from the level of assistant librarian upwards, certain officers of fire brigades, certain outdoor offices of clerk-of-works, inspector and assistant inspector and the grades of rate collector, rent collector, rate inspector, housing welfare officer, social worker, and, where employed under county councils and county borough councils, assistance officer and superintendent assistance officer.  These are the categories of office on which the restriction would remain.</P>
    <P>The principal classes of offices from which the restriction would be lifted are the grades of clerical officer, library assistant, branch librarian, storekeeper and draughtsman.  As already mentioned, it would be lifted also from all employees who are not officers.  To reduce the matter to figures it is estimated that of the 30,000 persons employed by local authorities, only about 3,000 will remain subject to the restriction on employment under the 1955 Act.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies will welcome this opening up of the field of eligibility for local authority membership. In bringing forward this measure the Government were guided by the <Col N="415" /> principle enunciated by the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law 14 years ago.  Dealing with membership of the Oireachtas, the committee stated in its final report: &ldquo;It is of the utmost importance that the Legislature should be able to draw for its members from as wide a field as possible and only for the gravest and most compelling reasons for public policy should any individual be prevented from putting himself forward for election.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that this view is also valid in relation to membership of local authorities.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to be giving the Minister a very easy run today because there is very little in this Bill which we want to question.  The updating of the law relating to petitions is to be welcomed and we have no objection to it as such.</P>
      <P>I want to raise one point in relation to section 19(2) which deals with the calling of witnesses.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>The court shall be entitled of its own volition, at any time during the trial of petition, to direct that a particular person shall be brought before the court and shall give evidence at the trial...</P>
      <P>It goes on then to deal with costs. Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection (3) of this section, a person who is called as a witness at the trial of a petition shall not be excused from answering any question relating to any offence at or connected with the relevant local election on the ground that the answer thereto may incriminate or tend to incriminate him or on grounds of privilege...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that this may be introducing a new concept into Irish law.  I should like the Minister to confirm whether this is so.  Our law states that where a man is brought as a witness in this fashion he is not obliged to incriminate himself and he need not give evidence if he considers that such evidence will, in <Col N="416" /> fact incriminate him.  In America citizens are entitled to claim some kind of similar exemption under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. There is a provision which we have often seen operating in court cases over there.  The same principle applies here but it does not seem to be recognised in this subsection in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that this is a repetition of a previous enactment&mdash;granted it was a long time ago&mdash;but it is not a new provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is merely a repetition of that very old Act of 1840&mdash; is it?&mdash;I would ask the Minister before we come to Committee Stage to examine this and consult the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman and see if we should not apply the principle which generally applies in common law in this instance.  If the Minister comes back to us on that on Committee Stage I shall be satisfied but there is room for improvement there.</P>
      <P>As the Minister states in his explanatory memorandum the principle sections other than the tidying-up job in relation to petitions, deal with the removal of the disqualification on certain categories of employees from standing for election to local authorities. We have no objection to section 23 in which the disqualification from membership of local authorities is removed as it applied up to now against aliens or persons in holy orders or a minister of any religious denomination.  I suppose there will be no great rush on the part of the clergy to present themselves as candidates but I agree that disqualification would seem to deny them part of their constitutional rights and I commend the Minister for updating the legislation and removing anomalies as he is doing here, and that is all it is.  I suggest he should consider doing the same thing in relation to section 19 where I think that could now be deemed to be antiquated, the principle having been long established under common law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even after reading the explanatory memorandum, I am not too clear on <Col N="417" /> the categories of employees which the Minister for Education would allow to stand for election and the categories on which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will remove the ban against standing for local elections. This is to be done by order, following the passing of the Bill in the Dáil.  We are not now in a position to study these orders but I presume in view of the great haste with which the Minister has introduced the Bill he must already have his mind made up as to the categories involved.  He himself has gone into some detail in elaborating on the various categories that will be included and excluded in relation to his own Department of Local Government but we have no similar information from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or the Minister for Education.  When the Minister is replying will he be in a position to tell us what the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries proposes to do by order?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, we are all in favour of that but we want to avoid having our hands tied behind our backs.  I am a little concerned about section 24 which authorises the various Ministers to make orders which will debar certain categories of employees from standing for local elections. I should have hoped the Minister would have included a provision that any orders made under this Bill would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  One would have thought this would be common practice. It is extraordinary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not extraordinary because in the Health Act, 1970, there is a similar provision.  There is no provision made to have orders laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be extra-extraordinary but it is a little extraordinary, I suggest.  I submit to the Minister that when he was in Opposition this was a principle which his side of the House would uphold, that they would oppose orders being made which did not come before the House. I think he would have gone as far as to say they should be made statutory instruments requiring a period of at least 21 sitting days before being adopted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not now.  I have always supported it.  I was not involved in the Health Act.  I do not know what orders under the Health Act the Minister refers to but one must remember that these orders could, in fact, by devious means be operated to the detriment of certain candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to shorten the proceedings, may I say to Deputy Molloy that this refers to categories, not individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>But there could be an individual in one category.  The Minister may throw his eyes up to heaven but we must try to perfect the legislation here.  This is the only chance we get on this side of the House to influence it.  It is quite possible that a person would be nominated as a candidate for a local election by a political party, that such a person is an employee of the Departments of Education or Agriculture and Fisheries, or Local Government and he could have been in a category from which no other candidate had been nominated by any other political party.  A Minister by order could debar that category, thereby debarring that person from standing for election.</P>
      <P>The Minister may not have seen this; I concede that it was not done intentionally but because of the power that can be wielded under these orders I think they should be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas and we should have an opportunity of debating them here if we feel that is necessary. I appeal to the Minister before we take Committee Stage tomorrow to have an amendment to these various orders in section 24 and any other relevant orders under this Bill to provide that they be placed before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Generally, we welcome the expansion of eligibility for local election to the various categories of employees. Many people will be anxious to know the categories.  If a staff officer in a local authority had been allowed to stand it could prove very embarrassing for an elected member that a colleague beside him would be, in fact, the person deciding on housing allocations.</P>

      <P>It is clear in the case of Local Government that staff officers will not be eligible to stand and the Minister has listed fairly clearly the categories still excluded.  It is mostly manual workers and junior clerical officers who will make up the bulk of those eligible in these Departments. There will be people who would say that a person working in the housing section, even as a clerical officer, is in a position of certain influence, and certainly in a position to come by information which members of the authority would be anxious to have and would have to apply for.  It could rightly be claimed that such a person, if a member of an authority, had information available to him which was not readily available to the other elected members.  Being placed in such an advantageous position, he could curry favour with the electorate in his area.  A situation could arise where the electorate could decide that it was a waste of time approaching any of the councillors about matters pertaining to the local authority other than the man who worked in the local authority office.  That would be introducing a change of the environment in which local councillors have been operating.  This change would be to the detriment of the standing of the local councillors in the community. Therefore, it should not be encouraged.</P>
      <P>Manual workers are not involved in office work generally.  Therefore, they cannot obtain valuable information on local authority proposals. There is still a danger when one councillor is in a more advantageous position of getting information than the others.  That could be to the detriment of all.</P>

    <P>We will not oppose this Bill.  We do not feel, because we have fears <Col N="422" /> about the abuse of this system, that that is sufficient reason for us to oppose it at this stage.  This matter should be kept under review.  I am glad to see the Minister nodding his head.  He seems to agree that there might be reason to review that level of employee, especially staff, of local authorities working in their offices.  I am not suggesting that those positions should be excluded at this stage. We are prepared to let the Bill pass and keep an eye on how it is operating. If we feel there are certain categories which should have been excluded and were not, we can then bring it to the notice of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is important that as many people as possible should be eligible for election not alone to the county councils but to this House.  I welcome also the statements made earlier by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Finance giving post office officials, <i>et cetera</i> an opportunity of becoming involved in active politics.</P>
      <P>Section 24 of this Bill is, perhaps, the most important section because it widens the scope of those who will be eligible for entry to local authorities. It is wise, good and healthy to see so many people, approximately 27,000, according to the Minister's statement, who will now be eligible to become involved in local politics.  This will ensure that these people will be able, at a later stage, to become involved in politics for entry to the Dáil and the Seanad.  This Bill will enable a number of sitting councillors to be eligible for employment in local authorities. I am sure Deputy Molloy and the Minister will recognise the fact that because people were county councillors they were not able to become employees of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a back bencher in this House for the last five years.  I have been a member of a local authority since 1967.  It is important that local authority elections should be held every five years.  Local elections were held in 1960 and the next local election did not take place until 1967. The next election will be held in 1974. Local elections could not be held last year because we had the general and <Col N="423" /> the Presidential elections.  It would have been very difficult to have held three elections in such a short time. It is not a good thing for a local election to be postponed for six, seven, eight or even nine years.  This is not a criticism of the Minister because this has been going on for a number of years.  It is important to have elections as regularly as possible, because of deaths, resignations and other changes.  It is very important that more people be given an opportunity of using local elections as a launching platform for entry to this House.</P>
    <P>I will make one personal observation. I believe the best Deputies in this House are people who have served an apprenticeship on local authorities. The Press say that some people are smothered by local matters.  I do not believe this criticism is valid or fair.  One can become involved in matters of national importance but for keeping in touch there is no better place than a local authority.  At present there are many different groups putting forward points of view.  They feel they are not in a position to get anywhere.  One of the best ways for such a group to test the soundness of their ideas and the strength of their support is to put their ideas before the people at local elections.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 24.  Agricultural instructors in particular and vocational teachers were reluctant to become actively involved in politics because they felt it might be used against them.  In this age of worker participation it is desirable that a person in a vocational school or an agricultural adviser should have a say in the running of his county.  This would be healthy.  Deputy Molloy pointed out some difficulties.  There are difficulties in all legislation but difficulties can be surmounted.  I agree that some people may manage to obtain a very marginal advantage over a competitor even in his own political party but that is a small thing and the beneficial effects of this Bill will far exceed the minor disadvantages that may arise. I notice there are some exemptions. Rate collectors are to be excluded. I do not see why.</P>

I will also consider the question of whether or not they should be put before the House in some subsequent debate.  I think he agrees that the important thing at present is to get this legislation through because those who will be dealing with it and prospective candidates should know where they stand immediately. For that reason I should like to have it concluded as quickly as possible. I had hoped that it would be possible to get it through today but I accept that Deputy Molloy would like to have another look at it so if we can have it tomorrow I will try to get the information he requires and have it here in good time so that he can have a look at it before the House meets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to deal with the recent decision by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government on a planning appeal in which he revoked an imposition of something over £100,000 in lieu of car-parking facilities on a centre city office block developer.  I took it as a very unusual and uncalled for decision.  Such a levy was actually a watering down of a previous practice where the developer had to provide car parks on the premises. It was felt, in view of the development of traffic in the city, this should not be done.  Therefore, a sum of money had to be paid to the corporation. They received quite a lot of <Col N="426" /> money in this way and funds did not have to be provided from the budget to deal with parking problems in this city.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated that this was a change of policy by the corporation.  This is a retrograde step.</P>
      <P>The Donegal County Council asked the Minister to receive a deputation to discuss the fuel problem and especially the remedy for it in that county and in other counties as well. The Government should have provided money in the budget for local authorities to enable them to develop roads into bogs so that people in the counties on the western seaboard could cut their own turf.  This would satisfy their own fuel needs and they could sell the surplus to people in nearby towns.  It is not enough for the Minister for Transport and Power to say that he is encouraging Bord na Móna to increase their hand-won turf production.  He should also encourage small farmers to obtain plots in local bogs and provide their own fuel.</P>
      <P>It is a pity, immediately the fuel crisis developed, that the Government did not take immediate steps to encourage people to cut turf to satisfy their own fuel needs.  During the last war nearly every small farmer had his own plot in the local bogs and was able to supply his own fuel needs.  At that time they had to work under very great difficulties because there were no roads to those bogs and transport was very uncertain.  I appeal to the Government to take steps, even at this late stage, to encourage people to cut turf.  As far as I know the Minister for Local Government has not yet agreed to meet the deputation from Donegal County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked, and so were others, to make representations to the Minister to receive the deputation.  I wrote and others wrote.  It is three or four weeks since I wrote and I have not yet received a reply.  I have not got a decision from the Minister for Local Government.  So much for the picture of an energetic Minister the Government are trying to portray to the country.  This does not show any serious worry about our power and <Col N="427" /> fuel resources.  It does not show that the Government, as they try to pretend, really care for the people.  If they cared they would provide the money to enable people to provide their own fuel needs and a surplus for sale as a commercial proposition.</P>
    <P>There is a gross lack of progress in the field of farm-modernisation.  Since 1st February a full stop has been put to the grants for development, such as land reclamation, drainage and so on. The fact that the farm modernisation scheme is not in operation means that someone is saving money.  Who is saving money?  The Government, because no grants have been paid and neither will they be paid for a long time to come.  We have tried to raise this matter by way of question here. I have tabled questions on Directive 159 to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and on Directive 160 to the Minister for Lands.  That is the directive under which the older farmers can give up their holdings and draw pensions. There are people who want to avail of the financial provisions set out, but I have failed, despite all my efforts, to get details about either of these two schemes.</P>
    <P>The farmers are completely at sea as far as the farm modernisation scheme is concerned.  Would the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries get cracking and get this scheme off the ground?  I know he is in dispute with the officials who will operate the scheme. He has not even clarified the position for them.  Some of the work they will have to undertake will be over and above their ordinary duties under existing schemes.  It is time the Minister sat down around the table with his officials and straightened matters out.  This is the time of year when farmers are busiest on reclamation, drainage, liming, fertilising, scrub removing and other farm improvements.</P>
    <P>We should have made a better case to the European Community.  I admit the directive was issued when the previous Government were in office, but some alterations should be sought now.  Why is there a full stop to farm <Col N="428" /> improvements?  If the new scheme does not dovetail into the old scheme who is to blame?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking to have the moneys provided in the budget used by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I am not talking about details.  I want to ensure that the deadlock will not continue and that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will sit down with his officials and iron out whatever difficulties exist. One difficulty is the keeping of farm accounts.  Eighty per cent of our farmers are small farmers and keeping accounts is a stumbling block where they are concerned.  If that is not removed the deadlock will continue. The Minister for Finance, who is providing the moneys, should ensure that these moneys are spent by his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
      <P>With regard to the income tax concessions, these are like the rating position.  Many people are under the impression that they will only pay £6 instead of £8 to the £ valuation and they overlook the fact that this extends only over a nine-month period.  In the same way in the budget, the personal allowance was increased to £500 for certain categories but the earned income allowance was discontinued.  It is not a question of a net gain of £300. In one of the newspapers today there is a good article setting out the actual gains; it is about £59 for some categories and £79 for other higher categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a net gain for someone who has no commitment in regard to housing loans.  When I was speaking last week I said that any benefits had been eaten up in the increases for electricity and other items.  The people had a feast for a month but they will have to wait for another eight months until the new financial year which starts on 1st <Col N="429" /> January.  They will have to starve for the eight months; if there is a supplementary budget in the autumn its only purpose will be to increase taxation.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the case of a person who has a net gain of £59 because of income tax concessions and the fact that he is paying only 26p in the £ instead of 35p.  It must me remembered that the man who had an SDA loan was allowed all interest repayments at 35 per cent, whereas now he will be allowed only 26 per cent and, as a result, he will lose.  The same situation applies with regard to insurance premiums; the allowance he got last year will be much less this year.</P>
    <P>One of the papers that commented on the budget was quite accurate. The roses appeared on the top and looked quite good but when you dug down the thorns were more numerous and more prickly than usual.  This describes the budget quite perfectly. It was well thought out; it appeared to give a lot but on a second look it was obvious it did not give much and, in fact, it took a lot.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy Tunney made a fine contribution with regard to children's allowances.  He referred to the claw-back that took place, when people earning over £2,500 per year found that the children's allowance payments were included in income tax liability.  People could not believe that any Government would ask the civil servants to send out new children's allowance books, to tot up what each family was entitled to get, that the recipient would have the books cashed at the post office, while in another set of offices officials would calculate the husband's income tax, would verify from the Department of Social Welfare how much children's allowances had been paid and then add that sum to the man's income tax liability.  This was an exercise carried out by civil servants on the instructions of the Government&mdash;a useless, wasteful, frustrating exercise for any civil servants, and especially frustrating for the families who did not get the benefit of the allowances. In fact, in many cases when the husband got his income tax bill he could not understand the additional tax <Col N="430" /> liability.  It was only then he discovered the Government were fiddling him, as well as the finances of the country by instructing the civil servants to carry out this useless exercise.</P>

      <P>If the Governwent want to cut their throats a good way is to use a razor.  There is no other way.  This year the Government admitted the folly of their ways; they did away with the claw-back. Having listened well and wisely to the advice we gave them they said to themselves: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil were right.  This is a lunatic effort.  We will do away with it&rdquo;.  They gave the ordinary person with under £2,500 a year 30p a month or 7½p a week for each child.</P>
      <P>Having felt that they were justified last year in paying no children's allowances to people on £2,500, £3,500, £10,500, £20,000 a year and upwards, they decided this year that they were entitled to the same amount of children's allowances as everybody else.  Where they gave 7½p per week to the ordinary person under £2,500 a year, they gave the full amount, 180p, and so on, in respect of each child to those on the higher income levels.  People regard this as sharp practice and they do not like it.  I would urge on the Government that things like that should not happen.</P>
      <P>The same thing is happening in the case of the Department of Health. That Department have a scheme which we are providing for in this budget to give hospital treatment to all-comers irrespective of income.  The sky is the limit.  I would advocate that some of the money provided in this year's budget should be provided for existing medical card holders who have problems when their children are not getting proper school dental, aural and ophthalmic treatment, and who have problems when their children have to have tonsils operations, and very many other problems as well.  I would urge that some of the money provided in the budget should go to the lower income group, the medical card holders, and to the middle income group to improve their health services.  We should have a very good health service for people with up to £2,500 a year and then we can decide to include other people.</P>

      <Col N="432" /> That is all I want to say about the budget.  There are many other items in it which could be attacked.  The lack of effort to use the budget to deal with the problems of fuel, food and the everyday needs of our people is a glaring example of the lack of concern on the part of the Government for the people who are faced with price increases.  The Prices Commission who issue their monthly list or litany of price increases are now deciding that, since last Saturday week it took three-quarters of a page of a newspaper to carry the full list of price increases, this is expensive and this practice is to be abolished I gather.  The public who have not got access to the reports of the Prices Commission will be in the dark and will not be able to compare high controlled prices with other prices which are charged and which are not the controlled prices at all.</P>

      <P>The Minister deserves the greatest possible congratulations on the fact that he was able to bring in a budget without increasing existing taxation in a year in which we had major difficulties due to the energy crisis, inflation and other outside influences.  Many people expected increases in taxation.  It was widely rumoured that the prices of the old reliables, tobacco, beer, spirits and even petrol would be raised.  We were so conditioned to the fact that this was on, that since it did not happen people are now saying he was foolish not to have put on an additional few pence here and there on these items. This would have brought in quite an amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's action was really a masterstroke because, with the possible exception of petrol, it leaves us in a reasonably competitive position <Col N="433" /> for the tourist trade.  If he could devise some means by which tourists could get cheaper petrol here we would be on a pretty good winner. The tourist trade which had been building up to a very satisfactory figure has had to face heavy going since the troubles in the North became so critical.  Yet, we have managed to keep it going at a reasonable pace.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous potential there.  We hope that peace will soon be restored in the North and that the flow of tourists will build up to what it was before the troubles started.  We now have an opportunity to extend the tourist business further than ever before. I would hope that whatever funds have been allocated to the Department of Transport and Power for tourism will be used to the best advantage.  We may not be using those funds to the greatest advantage in regard to the extension of hotel accommodation. Rather than extending hotels we appear to have been closing them. Especially here in Dublin quite a number of hotels have closed down due to the difficulties they were experiencing.  This is a tragedy.  They should be kept available for potential customers.</P>
    <P>On the social welfare side I doubt that the Minister could have done more.  He made a very fair division of the cake and all recipients are extremely grateful.</P>
    <P>One section of the community overlooked every year by every Minister for Finance and really hard hit are the women who through no fault of their own remain at home to look after a father or mother.  By the time the parent dies these women are too old or more frequently are not qualified to take up positions and earn a living. When it comes to that stage they are typical examples of the saying: &ldquo;To dig I am not able; to beg, I am ashamed&rdquo;.  Every member will know many people in that category.  It is very sad to find them.  Most of us who know them try to help and one must do it very carefully because they may be offended if they think you are giving charity.  If they were to be recognised by the State I am sure they would be most grateful and the Minister <Col N="434" /> would relieve a burden which weighs very heavily on those people before they reach pensionable age. Possibly some of them would not accept State help if they have other means and can carry on, but many of them have no private means because when the old folks go to their reward what is left scarcely pays the funeral expenses.  The daughter is left to fend for herself.  I ask the Minister to bear this in mind in future budgets and if anything can be done in the meantime I am sure he will do it.</P>
    <P>The Government deserve tremendous congratulation on their housing achievements but I would ask the Minister to point out to his colleague in Local Government that housing is just one aspect of a very big problem because unless amenities are available for young and old in housing estates housing can eventually be a negative operation.  Time and again we have seen, as I have in my own constituency, large housing areas with no facilities for recreation for young people. I have pointed out here before that the regulation governing the allocation of 10 per cent of a building site as an amenity area is not sufficient.  In most cases it is only suitable for toddlers and prams and when children get beyond that stage they have nowhere to go and the end result is delinquency and its consequences.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be doing a great job&mdash;and I am sure he has it in mind &mdash;if, when the housing problem is solved, he could make some provision in this regard.  Housing must come first.  We have had agitation for years for swimming pools in my constituency. This is very laudable and those pools that have been provided have been used fully except during the energy crisis when we had to close them.  At present if we had houses instead of swimming pools.  I think we would be better off.  Both developments should go hand in hand and I hope this will be the future trend and that the extension in each case will continue.</P>
    <P>The same applies to money provided for security.  Today security conjures up protection along the Border or along the sea coast but it extends <Col N="435" /> much further than that.  It extends to everybody's home because it is rapidly becoming a fact that nowhere is safe. I am not referring to the £8 million or £10 million paintings stolen over the week-end quite near me but to people in their own homes, particularly old people who are raided and who are sometimes accosted by thugs on the street and robbed of their meagre savings.  When the offenders are caught they are treated far too leniently.  Some of the money provided in the budget for security could well be spent in dealing more severely with them&mdash;and I have my own ideas on how best to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair but I was dealing with money devoted to defence and security that, I imagine, would come under that heading.  However, I shall move on from that point.  The only other item to which I wanted to refer was the proposed income tax on a section of the farming community, those with a poor law valuation of over £100.  I have never met anybody who welcomes taxation but if the Minister had decided to increase the tax on tobacco, beer and spirits, I would say: &ldquo;More luck to him&rdquo;. We are not compelled to drink or smoke but we are more sensitive in the case of other items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency of Kildare some time ago the major farm organisation, the IFA in the constituency, incurred the wrath of their superiors by announcing that they would welcome income tax provided rates were done away with.  The rates were relieved each year since the Government took office.  A very major contribution is being made by the Government to the entire community in the savings on rates which would otherwise have been borne by the ratepayers to provide for the health services.  I believe that the Minister, when the health charges are removed altogether from <Col N="436" /> the rates, will be able to extend the removal of rates over a given period. I know that the costs will be enormous. The farming community in paying income tax and rates are in a difficult position <i>vis-á-vis</i> our friends in the North who do not have to pay rates but pay income tax.  If the Government announced that they intended to phase out the rates, especially on agricultural land, then that would be a tremendous incentive to the farming community and would make income tax acceptable to all.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister touched on the subject of farmers with a PLV of over £100 paying income tax.  Stud farms should get special treatment.  There is nobody in this House more anxious than I that the bloodstock industry be preserved, extended and not hindered in any way.  When the wealth tax proposals are being finally formulated, I hope they will be given special treatment. It would be disastrous for that industry if they were to be evaluated in a similar way to the other categories in the farming world.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of income tax I do not think that there is a greater risk between the stud farm or the farmer who keeps a couple of brood mares and the man next door who has a herd of cows which can contract brucellosis overnight.  The value of the brood mares can be very high, indeed, but if the owners have no income from them they do not have to pay income tax.  Similarly, if the herd of cows get brucellosis the farmer is in dire trouble.  As I have said before, when the wealth tax proposals are being finally formulated, I hope that the bloodstock industry will get extra special treatment because of the fantastic amount of money involved and because a brood mare or a very costly sire could become valueless in a short space of time.</P>
    <P>I wish to extend to the Minister my congratulations on a wonderful job well done.  I hope that the reliefs and other benefits which he provided this year will continue in the years to come and for as long as he is Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I would describe this budget as a placatory one because it does not show any indications of long-term economic thinking.  It is not inappropriate for a member of the Opposition to mention the points which are welcome.  There was an improvement in the social welfare payments which were badly needed. There were also changes and improvements in the categories of social welfare. The Minister indicated his intention to deal with the tax evasion. Those who pay tax will go all the way with the Minister in this.  He says that one of the reasons our rates of taxation are so high is that so many people who ought to pay tax pay little or none at all.  If the Minister can, in the coming 12 months, improve that situation, he will be making a great contribution to our economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated in the early part of his speech that while inflation continued to be a matter of major concern there was a welcome rise of 6,000 in the total numbers employed in contrast to a drop of 9,000 in the previous year and that the services sector rose by 6,000 in each case.  Perhaps at that time the Minister was merely able to quote these figures. The figures published today indicate that the difference between the level of unemployment last year and this year is now down to about 800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I regard this as a placatory budget.  The Minister has taken, to a considerable extent, the easy road in order to please his Labour colleagues and their followers.  The objecttive seems to be political in the short-term. I approve of the increases in social welfare in so far as they will not encourage inflation.  I refer to this because of the very large current deficit upon which the Minister is relying.  This suits the Minister's Labour colleagues because the social welfare increases look spectacular, especially when taken out of the context of inflation.  There were percentage increases from 20 to 28 per cent for social welfare improvements.  But if one takes the rate of inflation for 1973 and adds to it the rate of inflation for 1974, as estimated by the Minister himself, one arrives at a <Col N="438" /> figure of 28 to 29 per cent.  While Social Welfare increases are welcome they are only meeting the situation for those classes.  I would argue that the level of expenditure envisaged in the budget will ensure that the value of those social welfare increases will not be retained because they will be followed by inflation which is being encouraged by the Minister's fiscal policy.  The sort of policy being followed is one which, perhaps, suits an atmosphere of increasing social welfare payments and increasing wages but it does not suit those on fixed incomes or those who cannot get increases on their pensions.</P>
    <P>The budget appeared to give income tax reliefs but does not do so on any sort of worthwhile scale except for the £300 to £500 single person.  By encouraging spending, which is where the emphasis lies in this budget, the inflationary effect serves to increase the tax yield itself.  The previous speaker said there were no increased taxes in the budget.  You could not very well have many increased taxes because the number and rate of increased taxes in last year's budget was so great that nobody could visualise any addition.  The inflationary effect of the VAT increase in itself works out in a very interesting way.  The estimated cost of the removal of VAT from food last year worked out at around £17 million but the increased yield on the increased VAT over all the range of goods led to an increase of 50 per cent or £45 million yield, that is, approximately a two-and-a-half times increase in tax on VAT over and above the amount that was deducted for the VAT on food.</P>
    <P>The present deficit budgeted for of £66 million amounts to somewhere around £100 per worker of the working population of the State and since it is on current budget and not on capital this means that each worker will have to earn that additional £100 or the taxpayer will have to pay the interest on it indefinitely.  This sort of over-expenditure leads to inflation which creates other problems such as overspending and import deficit which can place a Government in the position of having to introduce control <Col N="439" /> which itself dislocates trade and leads to unemployment.</P>
    <P>That is the picture that is coming from this budget.  Last year some of us criticised the budget on the grounds that it had a tendency to inflate, that the deficit being aimed at seemed rather high although in the event it did not work out so high because of the increased yield on VAT.  Nevertheless by November 1st, before the oil crisis hit us, there was an inflationary rate of 7 per cent.  I would argue that a considerable amount of that 7 per cent arose from Government policy, the budget policy of last year.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister states that in addition to the £66 million deficit on the budget he anticipates a trade deficit of £140 million.  A reasonable calculation in relation to Britain would be that a comparable trade deficit for Britain would be £2,500 million.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance realises where this sort of policy will lead him and his Government. If one takes the recent economic history of Britain, the conservatives tried deficit budgeting, they tried to increase spending so as to increase the growth rate, but the increased spending led to a trade problem and to a wage problem and this policy had to be changed.  Last autumn the British had two choices.  One was to reduce Government spending, the other was to keep down wages.  This is the sort of problem every Government comes up against if its budgetary policy is foolish.  The British Government went for wages and that Government fell apart.  The Minister should be aware that when a Government increases spending over and above what the economy can provide a situation is created where it is virtually impossible to slow down on that spending. Eventually, the social welfare sector, the ordinary working people, people on salaries, have to pay through inflation.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the tax position.  People were expecting an improvement in the earned income situation, particularly workers.  At first glance the yellow paper produced by the Minister seemed to indicate <Col N="440" /> an advance but when one came to examine it one found that there was very little.  A few weeks ago I checked a wage card to see what would happen in the case of a single person with a wage of £29.80 per week.  The tax at 1st April at £29.80 for a single person was £5.51 less some welfare allowances.  The reduction under the Minister's proposals works out at approximately £2 per week but then one has to add back £1.50 earned income relief bringing it back to a benefit of 50p per week.  Then you have to include a pay-related stamp at 29½p per week leaving a single worker earning £29.80 a week with an advantage of 20½p.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the effect of inflation on other salaries but the same picture is reflected all the way up.  It is a curious thing that the person with a salary of £2,500, who is married, does somewhat better than the single person at the lower level.  I believe we need a substantial improvement in the earned income level and the Minister has not provided this.  After the first few days people realised they were not getting much from the budget. I am afraid it is the old story that in an inflationary situation the sufferers are not the wealthy but the social welfare section and the less well-off people.</P>
    <P>The budget does not indicate fundamental thinking or planning.  I believe it is on a day-to-day basis because the Government have not got long-term plans.  The Minister and his colleagues fail to realise that the object of a budget in a developing economy should be, as the Leader of the Opposition said, when he spoke on this debate, to signpost future development and expansion.  In 1973 we warned the Minister against overheating the economy and against the price spiral which would follow the increase in VAT and the increase in a dozen other taxes.  These price increases would have come about even if we did not have the oil crisis.  They might not have been as large but we certainly would have had them because that is the type of budgetary policy the Government are following.</P>
    <P>The fiscal policy of the Government <Col N="441" /> this year is the same as that enunciated last year when the Minister in the budget abolished the £70 tax-free deposit with the major banking system.  We regarded this as a major blunder.  Although it might not have been known at that time, the building societies were feeling the shortage of money and the effect of this pronouncement by the Minister was to cause money to leave the country.  By the time the Minister brought in his Finance Bill he had withdrawn the abolition of the £70 tax-free deposit system but the damage was done.</P>
    <P>The 1974 budget is following along the same lines.  There is a deliberate stimulation of expenditure which will cause further inflation and an increase in the trade deficit following the increased purchasing power on the part of the public.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke in the budget debate some weeks ago he said the advice on the deficit came from the Department of Finance.  He sounds rather like the Minister for Justice who blames the staff in Mountjoy. When things go wrong you blame your advisers.  It is the Government who have to take the decisions and they are responsible for their decisions on the budget.</P>
    <P>The next mistake made by the Government in relation to tax policy was the sudden announcement of the tax on mining.  I would not oppose tax on mining because I believe they should make their just contribution to the economy.  However, unilateral announcements of this kind, when one has the personnel of the IDA overseas trying to encourage firms to come in, is not a responsible way to behave.  This was followed earlier this year by the introduction of a White Paper, a badly put together document and one which encourages people to believe there will be great increases in taxation on property. One member of the Government says it is only a discussion document but another says it is a firm commitment by the Government.</P>
    <P>I believe this White Paper was introduced by people who are totally ignorant of the facts of life of a small <Col N="442" /> economy and one which is still developing. The Government seem to be obsessed with the idea that our economy is at the level of highly-industrialised countries with the benefit of full employment and all the other things these countries enjoy.  They are blind to an intelligent understanding of the principle that the creation of wealth can be a good thing for all and to discourage it or drive it away is to reduce the economy to economic stagnation and cause emigration. To tax speculative profit, share manipulation, land and property speculation and easy money is necessary and wise and I am sure everybody on the Opposition side will welcome any steps the Minister may take in that area because the easy money that has been made in this economy in recent years through these means is the sort of thing which creates unease and jealousy but there is no sanity in a policy of taxing energy, enterprise, endeavour and honest thrift.</P>
    <P>The way the White Paper reads to people is that the result of years of effort may be taxed.  This discourages the will to survive in an economy and is against the interests of our economy at the present time because it is an expanding one&mdash;we are trying to arrive at full employment&mdash;and I believe it is also contrary to the beliefs of most intelligent Fine Gael supporters. I do not believe the trade unions in this country want anything like the sort of policy set out in the Government White Paper.  I believe it has already done damage to our economy at a time when we badly need capital.</P>
    <P>I believe this budget is not a long-term, well thought out document but is mainly a window dressing operation designed to pay lip service to socialist lobbies.  The result is that our economy will get the worst of both worlds in order to hold the present Government together.  I am afraid the Minister's eye is on the electorate and not on his duty to our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to three ex-Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Party talking about this budget&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, Deputy Colley and Deputy Haughey. <Col N="443" /> One of the three will in due course be able to turn around and say: &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; because all three spoke with different tongues.  Some of their arguments bore some semblance of similarity, but others were completely divergent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brugha said we should not have gone for deficit budgeting.  Deputy Haughey agrees that we should. Deputy Colley described the budget as a fraudulent budget.  Deputy Haughey appreciates that prices have risen throughout Europe and in this country also as a result of our entry into the European Community.  As well as that, we have to meet prices in countries outside the European Community.  As the debate progressed, the tone changed somewhat.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this budget.  I congratulate the Minister on what he has done since he came into office.  He has certainly got guts.  He is not afraid of change.  There has been practically no change in the pattern of taxation since 1908.  Deputy Burke used to say in this House: &ldquo;Great things have happened in our time.&rdquo;  I believe that quotation is very apposite at this moment.  Year after year the old reliables were taxed&mdash;petrol, beer, whiskey, cigarettes and tobacco.  Where drink is concerned we are one of the highest taxed countries in Europe. Fianna Fáil were always afraid to do what the country wanted.  The Minister has now introduced a tax on very wealthy farmers.  Most farmers admit that, if they make money, they should be taxed.  Most people object to paying taxes or rates when they do not make money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister introduced a White Paper on capital taxation for discussion. Fianna Fáil are trying to persuade the people that this is the law already.  There has been a great deal of talk about prices.  Deputy Haughey did not dwell on these because he understands this is a worldwide pattern. However, those who followed him could not refrain from flogging this dead horse.  Would the position not have been much worse had VAT not been removed from food?  We took VAT off food.  In our first year in <Col N="444" /> Government we had a growth rate of 7 per cent and this budget is designed to ensure a growth rate of 3½ to 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>Over eight years Fianna Fáil gave an average of about £7 million a year to social welfare.  In our first year we gave £52.5 million, a very big difference. Total expenditure has amounted to £132.4 million, an increase of 43 per cent.  We have given an increase of £44 million per year in the two budgets for which we have been responsible so far.  We reduced the qualifying age for pension to 69 last year and we reduced it by another year to 68 years this year.  It had not been reduced since the State was founded. Social welfare benefits have been provided for unmarried mothers and handicapped children.  There have been improvements in home care and other welfare services.  We have abolished the limit for social insurance and introduced a scheme for pay-related benefits.</P>
    <P>In 1974, increased social welfare benefits will amount to £50.14 million: £37.62 million to March 1975 and £25.13 million to the end of 1974.  The Exchequer will take up 75 per cent of that.  Deputy Brugha spoke about the burden on employers and employees but, as I said, 75 per cent will be taken up by the Exchequer.  A married couple over 68 years will now get £15 per week as against £12.35 prior to this budget.  A window with three children will get £15.45 as against £13.05.  A deserted wife with three children will get £14.50 as against £12.15.  Children's allowances have increased by 30p and State pensioners will get parity as from 1st July.  These are worthwhile improvements and are to be commended.</P>
    <P>Wives of long-term prisoners have been brought into social welfare for the first time.  The prisoners get three square meals a day.  They are probably fed as well as they would be if they were at home and their wives and children suffer and struggle.  This situation will not be allowed to continue as a result of this budget.  The Minister is giving £100,000 for an investigation into poverty.  During the election I canvassed a new corporation area and I met women there whose <Col N="445" /> husbands were in jail.  They did not know what to do or whom to ask. They did not know where to go for information.  If they are put in touch with the proper authorities they will at least get that which will feed them even if it does not clothe them.  If a woman in this situation is a smoker she will be inclined to smoke more, if she drinks she may drink more.  She will do this because she may be worried but if she were sure of getting the money she would be better able to look after her family.</P>
    <P>Extra provision has been made for unmarried mothers.  If a social welfare beneficiary dies, his widow is paid for six weeks after his death.  There will be no gap between the death of the husband and payment to the widow. This is an example of the thoughtfulness displayed in the budget, of the cutting of red tape.  There is a great feeling of humanity displayed towards the needy.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member of the Dáil in 1963 there has been much talk about equal pay for equal work. However, nothing was done despite much talk in Dáil Éireann about the Treaty of Rome and so on.  This Government have taken steps to ensure that there will be equal pay by 1975 and, this year, there will be an improvement in the situation in that 50 per cent of the differential will be abolished.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the grant of £100,000 towards the elimination of poverty.  I realise it is only a drop in the ocean but at least it is a start.  It is a pity it was not done many years ago.  As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out some time ago, we did not discover poverty, it has been with us for a long time.  Although there is less poverty than 50 years ago, at least 20 per cent of our people are living below the breadline.  I understand that a nun is taking charge of the programme on poverty and I wish her every success in her work.  Perhaps next year the Minister for Finance may be able to give greatly increased benefits or introduce schemes to cater for people about whose problems we know very little now.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the capital budget of £64.7 million.  This <Col N="446" /> includes £18.7 million for construction, half of which is for local authority housing.  Prior to the National Coalition Government taking office, local authority house building in Dublin had reached an all-time low and local authority financing for private house building was in the same situation.  The ceiling for loans was disgraceful.  In my constituency there were housing schemes built but very few people could apply for a local authority loan because their incomes were above the limit.  On the other hand, they were not able to put down the huge deposits necessary.  The Minister for Local Government increased the ceiling limit and now many people who have building society loans, where the interest rate fluctuates, want to get local authority loans.  This cannot be done because it is too costly to change and the money is needed for future work.  In any event why should this Government be blamed for something Fianna Fáil did not do when they were in office?</P>
    <P>There was another problem regarding the question of bridging loans from banks and what the building societies had to pay to people.  In two years I have had at least 20 applications for bridging finance.  I am not saying the 20 applications were solely the fault of the building societies; there could have been certain snags on the part of the people concerned.  Much of this has now been cleared up.  I am sorry the money cannot be given at a lower rate of interest.  It is now given at 11 per cent, but on the money market in England one can get 22 per cent while the commercial banks are giving 16.5 per cent for short-term money. If possible the building societies should not increase the rate for the first two or three years.  When a person purchases a house he has many expenses and the repayments are particularly difficult in the first few years. Taking wage increases into account he should be able to pay the going rate after a period of three years.</P>
    <P>A sum of £8.3 million has been allocated for sanitary services and State building.  Although there was a considerable amount of rainfall last <Col N="447" /> winter, after a week of dry weather we were told there was a shortage of water.  This shows how much money the previous Government spent on a water supply for Dublin.  One would have thought there was enough water to last for a considerable time but after one week's dry weather we were warned about a shortage.  This illustrates the neglect shown by Fianna Fáil during their years in office.</P>
    <P>The cost of land in Dublin city has increased tremendously.  Inflation may be blamed but one of the major reasons is the lack of serviced land.  A sum of £9.5 million is provided for the ESB.  I agree with Deputy Haughey when he says that the amount of money required by the ESB in future will be considerably more.  With the advent of nuclear power and the number of new factories in the country we will be talking in tens of millions of pounds rather than amounts of £500,000 as we did some years ago.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there will be 40 per cent more spent on the telephone services.  This is bady needed.  We are in the EEC and communications, both road and telephonic, are as important as capital.  A top executive must be assured of efficient and swift telephone services; a matter of 30 minutes could mean a large order for this country.  During the years there was no real thinking or planning by the Fianna Fáil Governments on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is amazing the difference there is when you are in Opposition as against when you are in Government.  We had contributions from three ex-Ministers for Finance.  Deputy Haughey suggested that we should plan five to ten years ahead and not just for one year.  Deputy Lynch said we should charter a course for a year ahead and for a reasonable period in the future. It is not so long since we had a budget before an election in June and another in the autumn.  Either they could not budget for six months or they did it to win an election.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 1779 of the Official Report of 5th April, 1974, Deputy Haughey said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> Some years ago in the Departpartment of Finance a scheme of long-term capital budgeting was initiated.</P>
    <P>He did not give the year.  He went on:</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no mention whatsoever of this in his budget speech.  This is becoming one of the most important areas in economic programming and economic planning.  The idea that one can put forward a capital budget for a period of 12 months on its own is now hopelessly out of date. Any sensible approach to economic planning must, I think it is generally agreed, be based on long-term budgeted capital investment. Increasingly our capital programmes must be looked at over five or even ten-year periods.  The amounts involved are becoming enormous, and the period of years involved in capital investment is also becoming very considerably extended.</P>
    <P>I remember saying the same thing when I was in Opposition when we were having two budgets per year or, if we did not have two budgets per year, something was slipped in by way of financial resolution, and so on. I said that any businessman, not a very big one, must plan ahead and decide whether he will diversify or stay in one business and keep all his eggs in one basket.  I agree with Deputy Haughey that a period of five to ten years is right but Fianna Fáil, who never even budgeted for one year, now have the gall to ask us to budget for five or ten years all of a sudden, when prices are in a state of flux.</P>
    <P>The Kennedy Report was not mentioned by Deputy Haughey but Deputy Lynch wants it accepted.  Deputy Colley mentioned it in a non-committal manner.  Deputy Lynch wants it adopted immediately.  Deputy Haughey said we should do something about the interest rate as it is as important to a business as capital, or the working force, or the management. The dearer the rate of interest the more expensive it is to produce items.  He said it is as important to a business as raw materials.  I agree <Col N="449" /> with him on that.  We should try to bring down the interest rate, but it is very hard to bring down when you can get 20 per cent on the money market and bank interest is 15 per cent.  We should try to bring down the rate to a more reasonable figure. I do not think we will ever get back to 5 per cent because there is a scarcity of money for development throughout the world.  Let us bring it down to ten per cent or even 11 per cent, rather than 15 per cent or, perhaps, up to 19 per cent for term money.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 1513 of the Official Report of 4th April, Deputy Lynch said about mortgages:</P>
    <P>... No attempt has been made to deal with the problems of these people in any way.</P>
    <P>He was speaking about purchasers of houses.  He said:</P>
    <P>The combination of higher house prices and interest rates puts house purchase out of the reach of many, not only newly married couples but married couples who have been saving for many years to buy their own homes.  For example, repayments at the present time, on a very modest house, have risen by about 50 per cent, from £40 to £60 over the past few years.  To deal with this certainly there should be a large increase in the size of the grants.  As well as that, I believe there should be a large increase in the size of mortgages. Given that building societies may not be expected to advance the full amount of these mortgages, the Government should have a mortgage guarantee system&mdash;and they had a year in which to do this&mdash; available for those unfortunate people who now find house purchase beyond their capacity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch wants an increased grant.  I think it was during the period in office of the inter-Party Government in 1954-57 that the grant was £275.  The purchase price of a house at the time was somewhere in the region of £1,800. During that period of approximately 15 to 16 years Fianna Fáil increased the grant by £40 and the prices of <Col N="450" /> houses jumped from £1,800 to £5,500 or £6,000.  We are in office for one year and we are asked to increase the grant by 50 per cent.  My feeling is that the giving of grants is nearly outdated.  For the first four or five years after he buys his house, what a person wants is a grant to subsidise his interest.  This is of more importance to him than what he is paying out of profit, rather than the few pounds he might owe at the end of the 35 years repayment.  Deputy Colley has nothing to say about that kind of interest rate.  He does have something to say about tax on loan interest.  At col. 1486 of the Official Report of 3rd April, 1974, Deputy Colley said:</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the Government's decision to restrict loan interest as a set-off against income tax.  This was supposed to be directed against speculators but the real speculators have a way around it.  There is no major problem in getting around it and it has improved the position of speculators from the UK in this country who are given an advantage over Irish citizens in this matter.</P>
    <P>This is not true.  He goes on:</P>
    <P>One effect it has had is that it has crippled a number of Irish executives who have no wealth but their salaries.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that building societies will only give £7,500 of a loan so that there is no place they can borrow.  If the Deputy would look at what the Minister said in introducing this he would see at column 1442 of the same report where the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have already announced that as from 10th January, 1974, the Finance Bill will restrict to a maximum of £2,000 a year the amount of interest on borrowings allowed to qualify for tax relief but that borrowings for genuine business activities will not be affected.  In the light of the examples I gave, in last February's debate, of people with incomes of £13,000 and £24,000 a year claiming relief in respect of interest payments of £14,000 and <Col N="451" /> £33,000 respectively, I think, Sir, further comment is hardly necessary.</P>
    <P>I think they are both right.  I think the Minister's idea is correct.  A few professional people are willing to buy property and make nothing out of it if they can cover interest.  They do not have to pay any tax, the interest covers the tax.  They have capital appreciation and they are quite happy.  It is mainly professional people who are doing this. I think Deputy Colley was right because when you take what the Minister said, that £7,500 was the maximum purchase price of a house in respect of which building societies would give a loan, it means that the person who wants to buy a house for, say, £20,000, at the old rate at which a building society lent which was 10 per cent, or 11 per cent now, approximately, he would be allowed £2,000 on that £20,000.  But what happens today is that you cannot get a loan through the building society.  You can get it from a financial house.  I may be slightly wrong in the figures but the first two are correct: they give the money at 19 per cent over a 15-year period.  He must take out an insurance policy which will cost about £1,000 and he has to pay about £2,000 a year back on which he will get no tax allowance.  I think there is something wrong here and that this is something that should be looked into.  In this case we must look at what top executives are paid.  Very often the top executive is the person who can be the making or breaking of a company more so than the chairman or the principal shareholders.  He can be No. 1 in the business.  Unless we can give him a fair chance to buy a house and to make sufficient money for his time and effort and see that he will not be overtaxed, we will not get him.  We have seen how top scientists in England have all gone to America because of better incentives and bigger money. We should look at this £2,000 limit on relief of tax on loan interest particularly when the building societies will not give loans on houses costing over £7,500.</P>
    <P>Again, to show the difference between the financial experts who spoke <Col N="452" /> in regard to income tax allowances, Deputy Colley said that the workers had been had.  Deputy Lynch criticised the income tax allowances much in the same way as Deputy Colley and mentioned a speech in the chamber of commerce.  Deputy Haughey said nothing of any significance on that matter, just making a passing reference. Speaking on April 3rd at column 1479 of the Official Report, Deputy Colley said:</P>
    <P>In referring to the fraudulence in regard to income tax allowances and the way the workers have been had, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the 1972 budget, the last budget introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government, there were increases in income tax allowances.  Merely to restore the position as it was after that budget one would need to increase income tax allowances by approximately 25 per cent.  The Minister has not made any provision for automatic adjustment of income tax allowances in the present situation of raging inflation under this Government.</P>
    <P>He picked out 1972 but how many years was it before that that there was a change in personal allowances?  But what he did not mention in regard to 1972 was the claw-back, the taxes that were put on to cancel that tax allowance. On this occasion we got a tax allowance and there were no taxes to take away from it, no claw-back.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch, as reported at column 1510 of the Official Report of 4th April, 1974, said, in reference to the Minister:</P>
    <P>... He knew as well as that, because of the successful negotiation of the recent national wage agreement, substantial tax allowances had to be given.  He has failed miserably to match up his performance with his promise.</P>
    <P>That is not true.  We gave something and took nothing back.  Most governments give with one hand and take back with the other.  This is where most Fianna Fáil people stopped criticising the budget and realised they were getting nowhere.  They had a feedback that the people accepted <Col N="453" /> it as a good budget.  At column 1510, Deputy Lynch said:</P>
    <P>In a speech last Monday to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce I referred to the type of increases that ought to be made available.  I said that because of the overall increase in our growth of 6 per cent caused by our entry into the EEC, on that basis alone without taking any account of inflation, the income of the lower groups, and particularly the social welfare groups, should be increased by 8 to 10 per cent.  When I add to that inflation, which I estimated at that time to be 13½ per cent&mdash;the Minister said 14 per cent yesterday and I think we are entitled to anticipate without any exaggeration that it could be 15 per cent&mdash;the Minister should have raised social welfare benefits not by 18 per cent but by 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>That statement was made four or five days before the budget was introduced. When I was in Opposition and I thought that 10 shillings were to be given to old age pensioners, I would say that they should be given £1.  I exaggerated.  I am sure Deputy Lynch did the same thing.  He was not about to say 8 per cent when he thought we would give 12 per cent but he said 25 per cent.  He made a big mistake when he said that because he did not realise that we were giving 18 per cent to the end of the year but it would be 24 per cent for the full year.  Therefore, we gave more than he anticipated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said he would have given more.  This is where the Fianna Fáil ex-Ministers for Finance disagree. Deputy Colley and Deputy Lynch intimated that there should have been taxes.  If so, I agree that tax-free allowances should go up, but there were no taxes.  Farmers are being taxed.  Deputy Colley made no reference to this.  Deputy Lynch said that some farmers would be paying £500 and that £20 million would be taken in rather than the £4½ million mentioned by the Minister.  In column 1515 of the Official Report, volume 271, Deputy Lynch said:</P>
    <P>It is estimated by the Minister <Col N="454" /> that 9,000 farmers only will be caught in the first instance.  An estimate was given, I think, in one of the comments last night that each of these would pay an average of £500, making up an income of £4½ million.  The Minister said yesterday he was unable to make any assessment of it and he ignored this completely for the purpose of his budget.  I think it is not unreasonable that this £4½ million&mdash;if it is an accurate figure and I have no reason to doubt it&mdash;would rise quickly to, say, £20 million or £30 million in a year.  Let us look at that and see what is fair and just...</P>
    <P>That figure was taken out of the air. Deputy Haughey said it would be £40,000 or £50,000 and he spoke at length on this.  He cried for the small farmer whose wife is out working. There is no intention to tax the small farmer.  A farmer's wife could be earning £30 or £40 a week working as a nurse or teacher and she gets her money free of tax, whereas a single person or a married woman not a farmer's wife must pay full tax. Deputy Haughey mentioned the figure of £40,000 or £50,000 and if there are more than 9,000 such farmers here then there are a number of moneyed farmers who do not know just how wealthy they are.</P>
    <P>I am more worried about wealth tax than income tax.  It is very hard to tax a farmer in a particular year. One year he could have a loss and the next year he could have a huge profit because of the sale of cattle. I should hope that his good year will be levelled out with his bad year by the Revenue Commissioners.  A farmer can sow a crop and spend all his time working but the profit for that crop would not be shown until the next year.</P>
    <P>I could not believe what I read about mining.  It was said that we were breaking our word and robbing the miners.  They were going to take two or three billion pounds out of the country in lead, zinc or whatever they were mining.  We were told that we were left wing.  It is surprising that when the feed-back comes to the people how things can change.  Deputy <Col N="455" /> Lynch in the Official Report, Volume 271, column 1512, said:</P>
    <P>... I will give the Government credit for this though not much credit&mdash;we have seen the new mining tax legislation.</P>
    <P>Since we promised to introduce mining legislation every Fianna Fáil man said that we were breaking our word and taking money from the miners. We were not fair to them.  We, on this side of the House, felt that they were not going to dig a big hole here and then take the wealth to another country. Deputy Haughey at column 1791, Volume 271 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>What intrigues me is that in the piece of legislation which the Government are now bringing forward I find all the proposals, solemnly set out, with which I was confronted at that time.  I am quite prepared to speculate that the result of this piece of legislation ultimately will be almost exactly the same as mine and that when all the allowances set out in the Bill are given effect to no income tax will in effect be payable by most mining concerns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said it is exactly the same as his.  Up to this budget I did not hear a Fianna Fáil person speaking for it.  In fact, the ex-Ministers for Finance should tell their colleagues they had better stop talking about it around the country because they said the opposite in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch wants no inflationary measures, wants no budget deficit. Deputy Colley at column 1492 of the Official Report for 3rd May said:</P>
    <P>This Budget should have been moderately expansionist, as I indicated. I would have thought, taking the best view of the situation, a deficit of £20 million to £25 million would have been tolerable as allowing for growth related to the capacity we have for growth in this coming year and still not lead us further into inflation.  Instead of that we have had this unbelievably irresponsible Budget Statement by the Minister, backed by every <Col N="456" /> member of the Government, of a £76 million deficit in circumstances in which no reputable economist could possibly justify such a deficit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch wants no deficit.  Deputy Colley wants £25 million and Deputy Haughey at column 1797 Volume 271 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister in his outline of his budget strategy has indicated that in his view the increase in prices with which the economy would have to contend was serious enough without his adding to them by increases in taxation and, therefore, he went for a budget deficit rather than attempting to balance the budget by the necessary taxes.  I suppose that at this stage we have no option but to accept the fundamental decision by the Minister in his approach to the budget this year but it is as well on this side of the House that we should indicate our apprehension about the Minister continuing with deficit budgeting of this sort.</P>
    <P>We had Deputy Haughey warning that you cannot do this for ever.  We all know you cannot do this for ever.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have been talking about price increases.  Prices have risen. They have risen in every EEC country. Wages have risen in every EEC country by 12 to 20 per cent.  They have risen in most countries outside it at a greater rate.  Prices inside the EEC have risen continually over the last 12 months but in latter months there has been a slow down.  In some cases food prices have come down and our farmers are now cribbing about this.  Outside the EEC prices are going up at a faster rate.</P>
    <P>We are a great country for promising the people of Africa or of South America that we will do this and that for them but we did nothing for them. All we did was to get cheap food from them.  England bought the cheapest food that she could get and she kept our prices down.  Now those countries have got their independence and are emerging.  I read the other day that we will no longer get cheap tea from India or Ceylon which control 90 per cent of the tea imported by Europe.  They will look for their <Col N="457" /> pound of flesh.  The nuts from which margarine is made are dearer.  In whatever country they are grown their price will be pushed up.  Margarine is now within 3p per pound of the price of butter, whereas a couple of years ago it was half the price of butter. Perhaps this will be good for the farmers.  Citrus fruits and other seasonal fruits are grown in some wealthy countries but mostly in developing countries.  They are looking for top prices.  The western world is fully developed and has many luxuries which they do not have in those countries. Why should the western world be subsidised by those who are in poverty?  Let us take the example of oil.  We were getting oil at a very low price, for practically nothing.  The big oil combines took their cut and when we got it to western Europe we hammered it to get all the tax we could out of it and gave it out in social welfare. Why should the people in those countries not get a cut out of it and give it out in social welfare there? This is what we would do.  There are many resources in these underdeveloped countries which have not been tapped.  Imports from those countries will increase in price every year.  If a country had enough money they could stockpile.  Those countries will say now: &ldquo;Who will give us the biggest price?&rdquo; and they will get it on the world market.  They are entitled to get it and we are going to pay for it.</P>
    <P>We will no longer get cheap raw materials or cheap food.  We depend a lot on imports and re-exports.  Our wages have gone up which means that with the increased wages in these countries and the increased prices which the Third World are getting we have to pay increased prices.  Our farmers sell foodstuffs in Europe and have to get increased prices in order to pay for the increased price of oil.</P>
    <P>Prices have certainly gone up but there has been a levelling off.  We promised to take VAT off food.  We did that last year.  If Fianna Fáil were still in office VAT would still be on food and prices would, therefore, be much higher.  As well as increased prices there is the important factor that we are tied to the £.  British Governments <Col N="458" /> in recent years have not done much to keep the value of the £ steady.  It is now a floating £.  Most European countries have a currency which is of much better value than the £.  There have been increases in costs in Germany as well as increased unemployment but so far as we are concerned the £ will not buy as much as it used to.</P>
    <P>These are all causes of inflation. Fianna Fáil go around trying to fool the people.  They will probably try it again before the local elections.  They will not succeed because the people read the newspapers and they know the prices in various European countries.  Deputy Haughey mentioned prices as well as some other points.  He mentioned the capital budget and long-term planning.  Fianna Fáil only planned for six months but this budget plans for a year.  He mentioned interest rates and I agree with him that if at all possible they should be tied to the money market and the scarcity of money for developing business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said that some of the Ministers who spoke had more to say about the 70,000 unemployed than about anything else.  I have heard many budgets being introduced since I came into the House in 1963, and even before that, but I never heard a Fianna Fáil Government mention unemployment in a budget statement.  They kept far away from it and it was often greater than 70,000.  The Deputy also spoke about the western seaboard.  I have heard references to the Irish language, to the Gaeltacht being kept, to this that and the other being done for the west, in budget speeches.  Nothing was done then but now we have the Minister for the Gaeltacht doing something about the west.</P>
    <P>The budget, after Deputy Colley's speech, was in many ways praised by the Opposition.  They said less about the budget and more about other things.  Deputy Colley spoke first and you would think we had given him arsenic.  The next speakers did not say so much about it.  They said nothing against it.  In some instances the budget was actually <Col N="459" /> praised by the Opposition.  Most of the attack came on the White Paper on capital taxation.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party have spoken about the White Paper at various cumainn meetings around the country.  They have supplied scripts to the papers. Deputy Haughey, in Volume 271, column 1788, of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach attacked me, I understand, for stating that the proposals will mean the end of private property.  He suggested that I would have to backtrack on that statement.  I have no intention of backtracking on it.  I want to reaffirm emphatically that it is so. Ultimately, if these proposals go through in their entirety as outlined in the White Paper, it will mean the abolition of ownership of private property in this country.  If there is a taxation mechanism which is designed to annex 2½ per cent of the property of every member of the community every year surely it is a simple mathematical calculation to project that after 40 years the entire property of each individual member of the community will have been appropriated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey is an accountant and should know that not alone is that wrong but it is mathematically impossible. If you take 1/40th from 100 you are left with 97½ and if you take 1/40th off that you are left with something more than 95.  You will never be left with nothing.  This is what the Fianna Fáil Party are saying to the people.  If they are criticising the White Paper they should be honest about it.  They should say what is good or what is bad about it.  The Minister for Finance asked people to tell him what they thought of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said there was no profit in the country.  If that was the case we would have no foreign companies here.  The White Paper was sent out as a discussion paper. Every professional group and every business group in the city have accepted <Col N="460" /> the Minister's statement.  They are all sending their views into the Minister. Some of them have even met him.  Various business organisations have sent in their impressions of the White Paper to the Minister.  Every business is different.  A business with a big capital outlay may have a small profit and capital gains built in over the years.  Another business may have an import business with very little capital but big profits.  You must look at the whole picture before you make a decision.  Fianna Fáil are trying to make political capital out of it.</P>
    <P>There are three main taxes in the White Paper and they are open for discussion. The first is a capital gains tax. I have met no business people who have objected to this.  They have all said it is fair and should be done.  No man should get away with a capital gain of £100,000 and certainly he should not get away with £1 million on one deal.  One person can make this type of money and another person can go through life without any chance of making any profit at all.  A huge profit like this should certainly be taxed. Such profits should have been taxed 40 years ago.  They should have been taxed under Fianna Fáil for a hell of a long time and had that been done, particularly in relation to building land in the last ten, 12 or 14 years, there would be very little inequality in wealth at the moment because that is where most of the wealth was made on capital gains.</P>
    <P>Capital gains taxes here should not be any greater than they are in England. Perhaps they should be a little less.  I am 100 per cent in favour of a capital gains tax but there are a few aspects I would like the Minister to consider.  One is the case of the sale of a private house; in nine cases out of ten the person who sells is putting the money back into another residence. That person should not be brought into the net.  The situation is different where the house is sold for development purposes, a block of flats or an hotel, which may net a huge capital gain. There the position is quite different.</P>
    <P>There is a little ambiguity in paragraph 90 especially in relation to family businesses.  There is a possibility of <Col N="461" /> what amounts to double taxation as between a company and its shareholders and the provision being made to eliminate this hardship.  This could arise in the case of liquidation.  Assume an asset is purchased for £8,000 and subsequently sold for £20,000.  In the first instance it is owned by an individual and, in the second instance, by a company which disposes of it in the course of liquidation.  The computations are as follows: when the asset is owned by an individual the sale price is £20,000, the cost price £8,000, capital gains £12,000, tax of 35 per cent £4,200, net proceeds by the owner £15,800; where the asset is owned by a company and sold in the course of liquidation the sum received by the liquidator is £20,000, the cost price £8,000, capital gains £12,000, capital gains tax at 35 per cent £4,200, net proceeds £15,800.  Assuming this was a family company in which all the shares except one were held by the owner and his wife, the shareholder would receive from the liquidator the net amount secured on the sale of the property: net proceeds of sale £15,800 and from this would be deducted the original cost of the shares to the shareholders, £5,000, carrying subject to capital gains tax in the hands of the shareholder £7,800, which, at 35 per cent is £3,700.  The shareholders receive eventually £15,000 minus assessable capital gains £3,782.  Therefore the transfer represents £12,000 in one case against £15,000 in another case, the same money.</P>
    <P>There are also cases where capital gains could arise in groups of companies transferring property from one to another.  It is really a matter of transfer without a sale being involved and with different shareholders only. They might be caught under this.  I do not see why they should be caught. There are three main taxes suggested and the companies are against them all.  They think the whole thing is wrong.  I think it is a good thing.  I believe it was time it was brought in.</P>
    <P>The inheritance and gift taxes are very fair and very lenient.  I would say too lenient.  Take the case of a married man, like myself, with six <Col N="462" /> children: he could leave each of those six children £150,000 free of tax and he could leave his wife another £150,000.  That would be £1,050,000 free of tax.  Under the former system death duties on that amount of money would amount to approximately £450,000.  On £2,500,000, the tax would be £500,000; under death duties it would be approximately £1,260,000.  These are rough calculations. I may be out a few thousand. I always disapproved of death duties because very often those who died young were caught and a widow and children could be left with practically nothing when the debt to the State had been paid.  Death duties were most unfair.  The new tax is a much better idea.  It must be remembered, too, that the number caught for death duties was always pretty small.  The number is getting smaller. One has only to take up the paper to read about all the trust funds that have been established.  Before they start in business people have a trust fund practically set up so that they cannot be caught for taxes and one cannot blame them.  In fact, I had a trust.  It was not solely for my family but also for the considerable number of people involved in the business.  In any business there is more than one person involved.  If the owner lives until he is 55 or 56 years it is not unlikely that his employees range in age from 40 years to 60 years.  If the owner leaves more than £200,000 55 per cent is paid.</P>
    <P>I am citing my own example to show how bad was the system.  I employ about 300 or 400 men.  If I were obliged to dispose of some of my property and let go some of my staff, some of whom are 50 or 60 years of age, the Government might find they would have to pay a considerable amount to them by way of benefits.  If I died, although the Government would collect quite an amount of money by way of revenue, they would also have to pay social welfare benefits to the men who might not obtain employment.  I have always been in favour of profit-sharing, of employees having an interest in business.  No matter who he is, the <Col N="463" /> fact that one person dies should not mean the entire staff is victimised.</P>
    <P>In the new inheritance and gift taxes one would not have to pay at the rate of 55 per cent despite what Deputy Haughey said.  It may be that there will be a change in the income tax rate every year; this is something that should have happened during the years.</P>
    <P>Farmers can charge half the valuation of their estates, from £200,000 down, for death duties.  Unless a farmer has 2,000 or 3,000 acres, I cannot see him paying any death duties.  However, he should pay something every year, rather like an insurance policy.  In the old system of death duties it was necessary to have an insurance policy of £500 or £600 to cover death duties, which was added to the estate.  It is not too much to ask them to pay a small amount each year.</P>
    <P>The night after the White Paper was introduced I had to go to a function for the Mater Hospital, which many business people and doctors attended. After the introduction of the White Paper I was not surprised there were some remarks made but the only people who made any comment were the doctors, not the businessmen.  I attended another function some time later and the only people who were cribbing about the wealth tax were those who had not got it or would not have it for the next 20 years.  They were interested only in pretending to their neighbours that they were worth that much money.  Those who were wealthy kept their mouths shut, probably hoping to get away with it in the future.  I am not saying that the wealth tax is 100 per cent right.</P>
    <P>With regard to the inheritance and gift taxes, the trust fund is no longer of use.  Whether one gives money away when one is alive or leaves it to somebody, if it is in excess of £150,000 it is necessary to pay tax. Prior to this wealthy people could have a trust fund for seven years, they could leave £8 million and not pay one penny to the Government. The amount the Minister has set is extremely liberal; I think he would <Col N="464" /> have got away with £100,000.  It is not a hardship to ask these people to pay something during their lifetimes. There should be a maximum.  It should be no greater than the old surtax, 80 per cent.  In Sweden you can pay a maximum of £104 on £100 income.  If you are paying 80 per cent of your income it is a lot of money.  A lot of thought should be given to this.  When I talk about companies I mean private companies.  We are different from England and the big industrial countries where they are all public companies and wealth tax is tax on dividends.  In our case my fear is that we will be taking money out of reinvestment which gives employment.  This should be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>I do not think that private residences should be subject to capital gains tax or gains from insurance policies.  The Minister said he would not do that.  The disposal of assets by a trading company will attract tax.  This would have a very serious effect on the cash flow of a company. If a company has suffered trading losses and sells some property to provide working capital, the money left after the sale will be reduced tremendously when capital gains tax is taken off.  It may not be 25 per cent, as suggested, but the purchase price will come off it too.  People may say I am looking after the rich and that in most cases I have mentioned taxes which hurt me personally.</P>
    <P>If a person with money wants to go on three or four holidays a year he can spend £2,000 or £3,000 in Europe and the money is not spent in this country where it was made. If a person elects to make a gift rather than wait for somebody to pay inheritance tax the amount of tax is cut by 25 per cent.  This should be encouraged so that parents especially in the farming community will give the younger people an opportunity to get the business going and have a proper transition of the business while the parents are alive instead of somebody being thrown in at the deep end.</P>
    <P>My fear is that this tax might take money away from private investment <Col N="465" /> and private enterprise and investment credit enterprise which produce a lot more capital profit than the State bodies who have a social element. People domiciled in Ireland have to pay this tax.  It is the same in Denmark. If a person goes to America for five years and still has Irish citizenship, when he returns he is liable to wealth tax for that period so far as I can read this.  This is wrong. There is also provision that residents have to pay wealth tax.  This means that an American multi-millionaire will have to render an account to the Revenue Commissioners here of all his world-wide assets.  No matter where he has property, he must give a complete record of it to the Revenue Commissioners.  This means that any American who has £2 million invested in Ireland and is worth about £25 million in America will pull up his stakes and clear out of the country.</P>

I agree that if he has a profit in Ireland he should pay some tax.  If he pays his inheritance tax and this tax, and has his head office in Ireland, and assuming we have the right double taxation agreement, I think he should pay the wealth tax here but I do not see why he should be taxed on property outside the country.</P>

      <P>During the last few weeks we had political speeches. Every party, I suppose, will play politics but I do not think that there is much political gain in this case.  Most business people will look at this budget and say what is wrong and right, what they agree with and do not agree with.  I agree with 90 per cent of it. I know only a certain number of businesses that would find the wealth tax very difficult; to others it would be no trouble.  The sort of talk indulged in mainly by Fianna Fáil is <Col N="466" /> frightening people who have not looked at this taxation.  I think 90 per cent of the taxation is fair.  It will not affect profits being ploughed back into business.  The hotel industry have had a bad season for the past couple of years and to my knowledge their average profit was about 1.4 per cent per annum.  They cannot pay much out of that.  Their best would be about 12 or 13 per cent. You do not know how that will vary from year to year.  Perhaps the threshold for the wealth tax is wrong: I do not say it is.  Perhaps there should be different ranges in it.</P>
      <P>In general, death duties have been taken out of the way and a fair form of inheritance and gift tax provided and a means left for each individual who is left money to pay something during his lifetime as a sort of insurance policy.  Take, for example, a man with two sons.  One has brains and becomes a doctor, a solicitor or barrister and makes a lot of money.  The other fellow has no brains but if he is left £60,000 he pays wealth tax.  The doctor who got the education can earn £50,000 a year and pays nothing on it unless he buys a house or property.  I know that the prices of pubs and property in Dublin are mad but, take a publican worth £55,000 who has a house worth £14,000 or £16,000, plus a car and furniture and he would be in the £80,000 or £90,000 bracket and, if he is married, would have to pay wealth tax on £30,000.  He makes a profit on his business of 6½ per cent or 7 per cent at present, with controlled prices, but he has to pay wealth tax on £30,000.  When Deputy O'Malley was over here he had £8,000 a year plus a car and he had no wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was £6,000.  Your Ministers put them up for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>You were about to do it in any case.  The position can be that a person with an income of £10,000 does not pay it while a person with £5,000 does and while it may be only 1 per cent if he has to pay that out of £6,000 it is unfair.  Income has always been taxed to the maximum while capital has not.  Capital should be taxed in a big industrial country. <Col N="467" /> I am a little scared about it here. People speak of the tax situation in England but as regards those in the £5,000-£10,000 bracket they are not nearly as well treated here as in England. I am not suggesting we should upset the whole law for these people but you must get top management.  If you do not, England will have them or America.</P>
      <P>In all businesses in the EEC countries there is a bigger mark-up, bigger than in Ireland or in England.  I wonder if the wealth taxes are related to the higher margins.  When I mentioned that private houses should not be included for wealth tax purposes I omitted to say that this would be good in many ways but in one way in particular.  If a house is included for wealth tax people who are now living in big houses and maintaining them in good condition&mdash;in some cases very good Georgian houses&mdash;will no longer look after them and these houses will go into decay as many houses in Dublin did in the 30s and 40s because nobody was willing to pay the rates on them even though the price was low enough. We should encourage people to keep up these houses.  In France, I knew of a place beside Notre Dame built in the seventeenth century which was put into very small and expensive flats.  The Government took a huge deposit and inspected the houses when they were being let so that these houses would be kept in proper condition in the old tradition and help tourism.  Our old Georgian and Victorian houses&mdash;I do not know a lot about them&mdash;certainly look a good deal better than the types that have been built in recent years.</P>
      <P>The wealth tax could be tied in with the capital gains tax because although they are not the same they are somewhat similar.  The Minister abolished death duties.  This was very good.  It was wrong to saddle a widow with these debts while she was trying to educate and rear her family.  The threshold for a married couple is £50,000 or £60,000 and on the death of a husband this drops to £30,000 or £40,000.  This is very wrong.  If anything it should be raised to about £70,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> As I said earlier, there is no maximum mentioned in the White Paper as to the amount to be paid in wealth tax.  There should be.  A lot of property is being let today with seven or five year breaks.  There are some properties with a lease of 21 years.  If such a property was rented, say, 17 years ago at a rent of £300 a year, in four years' time one will be free to up that rent to the market price.  If the property is in one of the best streets in Dublin one might get £8,000 for it in four years' time.  Its value today would be minimal at £6,000. With seven or five year breaks thereafter one could probably get £90,000 for it.</P>
    <P>There are cases of importers who do not pay capital tax.  They use an accommodation address, import the goods and send them by rail to various retailers.  They make a great deal of money but do not pay capital tax. Farmers must pay tax now and every successful businessman should do likewise. I am not saying that there are some businessmen who do not escape but, if they do, they will not escape for very much longer.  If they try to fool the income tax people somebody will get wise to them and they will not last very long.  Every businessman keeps accounts and pays taxes.  I believe the wealth tax is the only way to catch everybody who gets ready money into his hand.  We all know of people who get money into their hands but do not pay tax on all of it. Every businessman should pay his fair share of taxes, as every worker does with PAYE.  That is why I approve of the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>Some hotels have, over the past few years, had very bad seasons.  If we had a maximum of 80 per cent for the wealth tax, and it got out of control, we could force hoteliers into selling parts of their hotels even though the Government had probably given them a great deal of money to build in the first place. Many businesses run into bad periods say, one in five or one in ten years.  Very often a business may have a good clear run for ten or 12 years.  Then they may get two or three bad years.  In such a case, if a <Col N="469" /> businessman has to pay 2½ per cent without taking profits into account, I do not see how many businesses could last.  In future I think there will be a rising market because the price of oil will prevent people from going abroad and, therefore, more of them will holiday at home.  Of course, our prices will also go up because of the cost of oil.</P>
    <P>One cannot blame Fianna Fáil for saying&mdash;although many people might believe it&mdash;that Labour forced Fine Gael to take this step.  It must be remembered that the Fine Gael manifesto promised to abolish death duties and substitute a wealth tax.  As shadow Minister for Labour, I was the first to suggest the abolition of death duties and the substitution of a wealth tax or an equalisation tax. I always felt that it was better to pay something when one was alive than to burden people when one had died with death duties.  One is making money but when one dies it is cut in half.  With a wealth tax one can pay as one goes along.  One can say: &ldquo;I have gone far enough. If I go any further I will be building only a house of straw.  This business will collapse as soon as I die and then people will be sacked.&rdquo;  If one pays a certain amount now it will be possible to cut costs in the future.</P>
    <P>In regard to the wealth tax we have different styles of business.  We have private companies and public companies.  Public companies are not affected.  It is only when a company is in private hands that it applies. There are about ten different styles of business.  There is a business like a hotel with a huge capital and, at the moment, bad profits.  A hotel can have good profits at times.  You can have a hotel that makes money because there is a restaurant or bar attached to it.  You can have a bar business with a huge turnover and a big profit or a small profit.  If a wealth tax is introduced it is very hard to have price control because then you are controlling at both ends.  I do think that is on.</P>
    <P>The White Paper has been criticised <Col N="470" /> by Fianna Fáil.  Very little was said against the budget.  Deputies spoke more against the White Paper.  Fianna Fáil speakers have gone out and spoken against the White Paper <i>in toto</i>.  I think the capital gains tax is correct and should have been brought in 40 years ago.  If it had been brought in we would have less worry about wealth in certain hands not being divided among the people who have worked hardest for it.  People made the money with a couple of quick deals.  I am 100 per cent for the gift and inheritance taxes.  They are fantastic taxes.  They are fair and good, a lot better than the death duties we had up to now.  To cover the money lost by the abolition of death duties and the introduction of the gift and inheritance taxes something on the style of an insurance should be paid to compensate for the death duties and for the wealth tax.  Two points I am very worried about are that it prevents money from being reinvested in business for employment and for development.  Another point is that the maximum would not be above 80 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that I am disappointed with the Minister's budget proposals would be an understatement. To say that I am disappointed is as far as I will go because I cannot say I am surprised with the inadequacy of the proposals.  I would like to be fair to the Minister.  The budget is consistent with the Government's performance to date.  It is another step in a line of broken undertakings.  When the budget was introduced last spring the plea was made that the Minister had had little time to prepare it.  Last spring he had an additional £30 million from agricultural subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a year to prepare this year's budget it can have satisfied nobody. I do not think it has satisfied the most loyal Government backbencher. Far from doing anything for the people receiving social welfare benefit the budget does not even maintain the purchasing power of pensions and allowances.  Let us take some examples.  A retirement pension was increased by £1.30 per week; an <Col N="471" /> old age contributory pension&mdash;68 to 80 years&mdash;personal rate was increased by £1.30 per week; an old age contributory pension&mdash;age 80 and over&mdash; by £1.40 per week; widows contributory pension&mdash;under 80 years&mdash;increased by £1.20 per week.  Disability and unemployment benefit was increased by £1.20 per week and children's allowances by 30p per week. This is what we are getting from a Minister and a Government who claim they have a social programme. Does the Minister think that the increases I have listed restore the purchasing power of the pensions and allowances of the recipients?  The Minister must know that they have lost ground due to inflation which has been taking place over the last 12 months.  The Government have proved totally inadequate to handle it. The Minister must surely see injustice where there is an increase of £1 per week in unemployment benefit and where you have workers seeking an increase of the order of £8 to £10 per week.</P>
    <P>You would think that the poor and the unemployed had some cheap source of food.  The increases given are almost gone in the price of coal or gas, for instance.  The price of coal increased during the past 12 months by £1 per cwt.  In the light of the raging inflation we have experienced in the last 12 months this budget is a very poor effort.  It is a lesson to those who listened to the election promises of the Coalition Government.  I do not know how anyone could justify a £1 increase to an unemployed man.  The £1 increase for that unemployed man must certainly take its place along with that other infamous Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;one shilling per week cut in the old age pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not attempt to balance his budget.  I suppose in the circumstances of the reduced financial year that was probably unavoidable but he must be challenged about the extent of the gap.  With the present rate of servicing such a vast deficit a massive burden is thrown on the taxpayers. We have to realise that burden <Col N="472" /> has to be met in the future.  One would get the impression that this Government are a Government of tomorrow's men as far as meeting their debts is concerned.  It was not good thinking to budget for a deficit.</P>
    <P>A number of Government Deputies mentioned the increases given to farmers.  They stated they were in the region of 32 per cent.  At first glance this looks a massive increase in one's income but when one relates it to the cost of production and looks at the type of farmer who has got that 32 per cent one finds it is mostly the large farmers who have got it.  An increase was given in milk prices because of our entry into the EEC and the large milk producers benefited greatly.  An increase was given to the tillage farmers but they are only a small minority of the total farming community.</P>
    <P>When you look at the small farmers and those who are dependent on pig production you certainly cannot find any increase in farm incomes.  The cost of fertilisers has increased by almost 100 per cent in some instances. There is also up to 100 per cent increase in the cost of fuel oils and large increases in the cost of seeds.  The price of building materials has also greatly increased.  Before the last spiral of increases it was mentioned here in answer to a Parliamentary Question that there was an increase of over 40 per cent in the cost of some building materials.  When you relate that to the increase of 32 per cent in farm incomes you see that the small farmers have not received anything. Any farmer who wants to put up extra buildings has to meet the extra cost in the price of building materials. Small pig farmers have received no increase.  Those who have suckling herds on the poorer land have received no increase over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>Drainage is also a big problem with farming land.  It is a matter of vital importance that money should be provided for arterial drainage.  An allout effort should be made to get an increased allocation from the EEC for this work.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question today in relation to the flooding of rivers the Minister <Col N="473" /> said he estimated that 12,000 acres of land around two rivers were flooded.  That gives some idea of the urgency of this problem.  Some of the land in the areas surrounding those two rivers is a complete write-off.  A lot of this flooding is caused by the delay in the implementation of arterial drainage programmes.  In that 12,000 acres of land you could have 100 viable holdings.  This will give an idea of the importance of arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>Much was said about the farm modernisation programme.  That programme is at a halt.  The Government should make an effort to have this dispute solved.  There are many farmers who have applied for grants and they do not know if they will be rated as development farmers or transitional farmers and, therefore, men who intend to increase their herds, buy equipment, build silos or milking parlours have no indication from anyone when this farm modernisation programme will get under way. There seems to be no communication at all between the Government and the farmers.  There should be some directive and some explanation about when they may expect the dispute to be resolved and they will be classified in whatever category they fit under this farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the question of retirement pensions.  There is complete silence about these also.  The Minister for Lands should issue some communication. This is the time of year when farmers begin to think about selling their farms and retiring from the land.  Their families have grown up and gone.  They cannot get labour. Now is the best time to put property on the market.  But the farmers must be told when this retirement scheme is to come into operation. I appeal to the Minister to have Directive 160 clarified.</P>
    <P>Another matter relating to my area is the payment for bomb damage in Clones.  I asked a Parliamentary Question about this some weeks ago but I got no satisfaction.  It is almost three years since the damage was done and those affected by it, business men and others, are paying very, very substantial interest to the banks on the money <Col N="474" /> they had to raise to repair the damage. The cost of the damage was over £250,000.  That shows the amount of damage done in that small town.  I appeal to the Minister to pay compensation without delay.</P>
    <P>With regard to industries in Border areas greater incentives will have to be given to encourage industrialists to establish industries in these areas.  As a result of the Border troubles there are not the same inquiries now from industrialists.  I would appeal to the Minister to ask the IDA to try to persuade industrialists into these areas through the medium of additional incentives because of the special conditions that have developed in these areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some very interesting figures in Table I on page 10.  What are described as residual borrowings for the purposes of the capital budget are usually a small proportion of it and consist for the most part of foreign borrowings or borrowings of a short-term, temporary nature, small in quantity and amount.  The estimate in the budget for 1973-74 was that residual borrowings should amount to 37.7 per cent, which is approximately 10 per cent of the proposed capital budget.  In fact, the out-turn for 1973-74 showed that residual borrowings amounted to £99.8 million.  The most interesting thing <Col N="476" /> about this is that some six months before the end of the last financial year Deputy Colley forecast in this House that, if things continued as they were, the likelihood was that the residual borrowings which would have to be resorted to by the Minister for Finance would amount to about £100 million in the last financial year.  As it happens, he was £0.2 million out&mdash;not bad going, to say the least of it.  It is interesting to note how that £99.8 million, which had to be frantically resorted to towards the end of the financial year to balance the capital budget, was obtained.  We are told £8.8 million was got from the European Investment Bank of the World Bank.  Fair enough.  We are then told the rather mysterious figure of £35.4 million was got from what is described as &ldquo;other foreign borrowing&rdquo;. We are not told what that was and neither are we told in the budget what the terms of that borrowing were.</P>

      <P>Today I wanted to ask a supplementary question whether the Minister would get permission from the EEC, if they do not continue to do so, to subsidise the pig industry from our national resources.  The worst thing that could happen to the industry is a statement from the Minister that people should get out of pig production.  That would be disastrous so far as the small farmers are concerned because this is one line of production in which they can engage. If farmers are to stay in this industry it will be necessary to have a subsidy to carry them over the lean period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view has been expressed, and I am afraid the Department have accepted it, that there is no future for the industry.  I remember a few <Col N="477" /> years ago people were told to get out of the sheep industry but nobody would suggest that today.  We are in a cycle at the moment but I am convinced it will pass and that it will be a case of the survival of the fittest.  If beef imports into the EEC are restricted, as is likely, the swing from pig meat to beef consumption will be reversed and the consumption of pig meat will rise.  If we could subsidise temporarily the pig producers to stay in business it would be an enormous help.</P>
    <P>At the moment the situation is very serious.  Last night I received the monthly returns from my own pig fattening station and the losses in the last month have been appalling. In 1973 we had a six-month period that was good but since then the losses have been very high.  However, we are prepared to continue as we have confidence that the industry will survive.  If we have not this confidence we can write off the small farmers, many of whom could not survive in another industry.</P>
    <P>We are facing many problems at the moment.  Proteins are scarce and the only substitutes we have are meat, bonemeal, fishmeal which does not give a good quality bacon, and dried grass protein which is only 10 per cent protein.  I am thinking of a subsidy of about £4 per pig.  It may be asked where this money will come from, but I would point out that before our entry into the EEC we were paying £29 million in agricultural subsidies.  The pig industry vitally affects all the small farmers and I know the Parliamentary Secretary understands its importance.</P>
    <P>I did not raise this question in order to send words of panic from this House; I did it so that the people concerned might be told that the Government will do all they can to help them to stay in the industry.  I am convinced the wheel will turn in favour of pig meat.  I am not blaming this or any other Government; it has been the policy of the Department during the years to go all out for some line of production to the detriment of other sectors.  It has always happened that the wheel went full turn and ultimately the neglected sector <Col N="478" /> came out on top.  I should like the Minister to state that he is prepared to give a subsidy.  I realise he will have to get permission from the EEC but Britain has done this and there is no reason we should not do likewise.</P>
    <P>I did not raise this matter to make political capital out of a world situation but I am appealing to the Minister to take some action.  It would be dreadful for any Government or Opposition to let down the pig producers. The pig fattening stations are a tremendous asset to the small farmers who produce bonhams.  We kept the price up when it was uneconomical but we have faith in the industry. At the moment it is impossible to obtain money to make the fattening stations more efficient and this is not good policy.  I may be blamed in two or three years time if the industry does not succeed but it is my firm conviction it will survive and prosper if help is given to it.</P>
    <P>We would need a subsidy of approximately £4 per pig in order to carry us over the period; now we are suffering a loss of £2 per pig.  Thousands of farmers depend completely on pig production and no Irish Government or Opposition can afford to let them down.  We must support the small pig producers so that the industry may survive and prosper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a continuation of an appeal I made to the Minister in July, 1973, to come to the aid of the pig producers.  From the Minister's latest statement it appears he cannot see any future for the industry and he is telling people to get out of it.  At that time he said he thought the long-term figure for the pig industry was bright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area I come from, the county committee of agriculture stated that 40 per cent of the farmers, in a county with 7,600 farmers, are involved in pig production, either in rearing or fattening pigs.  That is an indication of how vitally important the pig industry is to small farmers.  We must also take into consideration the amount of capital which was channelled into that industry over the past number of years. There are some fairly large producers <Col N="479" /> who erected very costly buildings, very costly liquid manure tanks, and very costly feeding equipment.  That equipment would be a loss if the pig industry failed.  In a country where we produce something in the region of 1,500,000 pigs per year, the producers will have to be subsidised to tide them over a bad patch.  It would be well worthwhile for the Department to spend £5 million or £6 million on this industry.  This may sound like a lot of money but we must take into account the number of farmers who are involved in pig production.</P>
    <P>We must also realise that the grain growers in the midlands and in the south are almost completely dependent on the pig producers to use the grain they are growing.  If the pig industry fails the grain industry must also fail. It would be a very sad reflection on us if we reached the time when we had ships coming into Dublin with Danish bacon and taking out Irish grain.  The officials of the Department should keep in mind the importance of using up home produced grain.  We must subsidise the pig producers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I put down this question is that certain ambiguities and certain discontent have arisen within the pig industry which is now facing very hard times. The Department issued a Press release which was confined to pigs delivered to bacon factories and registered pork export premises only.  This created uncertainty for private slaughterhouse owners who felt they would not be able to compete with the factories.  I was requested to attend, and I was delighted to attend, a meeting in a Dublin hotel at which these people expressed their reservations.  They said they had been in touch with the <Col N="480" /> Department and the Department refused to extend the facilities to these slaughterhouses which they extended to factories.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his reply that he has since arranged to extend payments, where feasible, to certain premises at which large numbers of pigs are slaughtered for sale on the home market.  Why was this not done originally?  Why was this uncertainty allowed to creep in?  Why was so much unpleasantness caused?  Why should so many people feel that their business was in jeopardy?  It came across loud and clear to me at that meeting that the proprietors of the slaughterhouses were only too willing to pass on the subsidy direct to the producer.  I think we are entirely agreed that it is the producer who should obtain this subsidy and who must obtain it.  They wanted nothing for themselves.  They wanted to be in a position to pass on the subsidy to the farmers.</P>

      <P>At this moment there is no confidence in the industry.  The Minister and his Department added to this lack of confidence by their decision at the start to allow this EEC subsidy to come through the factories and not through the slaughterhouses.  I should like to find out the minimum number of killings per week which the Department believe to be feasible in order to qualify for this subsidy. With increased costs in this industry, producers are facing a very bad time. Why should the Department add to the confusion and the lack of confidence at a time when the industry needs a boost to their morale?  With Deputy Callanan and Deputy Leonard I call on the Minister to continue to subsidise this industry at a time of dire need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the views expressed by Deputies opposite. I appreciate Deputy Callanan's sincerity and I know his interest in this question.  I know he wants to help the pig industry in any way he possibly can which, as we all know, is going through a trying time.  The same applies to the comments made by Deputy Leonard and Deputy Murphy. I am particularly interested in this question.  I have spoken on it in this House on several occasions.  I am personally conversant with the problems of the pig producers, particularly the smaller producers such as those you would find in south Galway and, I am sure, in Monaghan and Wicklow as well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy asked the Minister today if he would elaborate on the extensions relating to the EEC pig subsidy scheme.  The reply which I took to be quite comprehensive gave the information which the Deputy sought. While I have said that the Deputies are genuinely and sincerely interested in this industry, I must say that they are not more interested than the Minister. Let us examine what the Minister is doing.  First of all, by his efforts in Europe he has succeeded in getting this subsidy of £3.50 per pig on an average or £2.80 per cwt.  He has also ensured that the subsidy is payable on pigs consumed on the home market as well as pigs for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister sought this subsidy to help the bacon industry the EEC were not anxious to extend it to bacon other than that for export but because of the Minister's endeavours he secured approval for the subsidy to be paid to all premises at which slaughtering of pigs is taking place. My information is that the subsidy has now been extended so much that almost 98 per cent of the pigs are covered by it.  Deputy Murphy will appreciate that it would be impossible for the Department to provide inspectors at small butchers' premises as is required by EEC regulations to examine the few pigs being killed from time to time.  The Minister and <Col N="482" /> the Department have gone as far as possible but if there is some pork butcher who is not getting the benefit of this subsidy we shall be pleased to examine his application for the extension of the provisions of this order to his premises.</P>
    <P>I have here a great deal of information on the operation of this scheme but it would take a very long time to read it to the House.  The scheme came into operation on 23rd March.  The Minister issued the Press release mentioned by Deputy Murphy on 5th April extending this to additional small premises.  There was no undue delay between the introduction of the scheme and its extension to cover almost 98 per cent of the pigs produced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">

      <P>Premises which are suitably equipped for weighing carcasses and in which the other requirements can be fulfilled.  We are now in the EEC and must comply with EEC regulations.  The scheme has been extended as far as possible and if there is any instance where the owner thinks he has a reasonable case and if it is brought to our attention we will try to help, if at all possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leonard spoke about the subsidy of £4 per pig and said it should be paid from our own resources. We are taking the £2.80 per cwt. as equivalent to about £3.50 per pig but the Minister succeeded not only in getting approval for this subsidy in addition to the factory price, but also got approval for its payment from EEC funds, as against the British subsidy of a similar amount which is payable from the British Exchequer.  As regards Deputy McDonald's interjection about not getting the benefit of the subsidy, according to my information this subsidy must be shown separately in the document which the supplier gets for his pigs.  That is a condition of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Nobody is more interested in or more worried about the position of our pig industry at present than the Minister.  He has achieved a great deal in getting approval for this subsidy and this very day, while we are talking on this question here, the Minister is in Europe further discussing the pig industry position.  I hope some good news will be forthcoming as a result of his efforts.  The House may be assured that the Minister is anxious to see the pig industry continuing.  He realises and appreciates, as I do, its value to the economy and to people such as those represented by Deputies Leonard and Callanan and my namesake and myself.  I was very pleased to note the constructive way this subject was approached by Deputy Callanan in his remarks.  He said that he was optimistic and hoped the industry would recover and that the position would improve.  I join with him in that hope and I assure him that it is also the hope of the Department, and the Minister particularly, that every effort will be made to restore the industry to a profitable position. It is a source of worry that pig production profitability is not good at present.  That cannot be denied. We have to sell in a competitive market and conform with EEC regulations. We cannot grant subsidies from our own funds without approval.  We entered EEC to abolish agricultural subsidies and we cannot have it both ways.  We are either in the EEC or out of it.  This is the present subsidy and it will remain for some weeks to <Col N="484" /> come.  I cannot say what the future possibilities are.</P>
      <P>Deputy Callanan mentioned cycles. Possibly we are in a bad cycle at present and have been for a few months but it is hoped the wheel will turn and that the position will become more favourable.  Deputy Leonard also agreed that the position was very difficult and irrespective of what Ministers or Government are in office the same would apply.  In fact, it might not be as favourable as it is now because I am satisfied from my personal knowledge that our Minister is doing an excellent job and is particularly interested in this problem.</P>

Their statements were constructive and I appreciate that and if the Minister were here he would also appreciate that they are all genuinely interested in trying to help the industry as Members of the national Parliament.  So far as the Minister and I are concerned, and the Department officials dealing with the pig industry, Deputies are assured of every co-operation and that every effort will be made to preserve and improve the industry.  I trust that the industry will continue to thrive for many years to come as Deputy Callanan mentioned in his optimistic statement.</P>

      <P>On 27th November, 1973, the person named made a claim to unemployment benefit which was disallowed by a deciding officer.  In addition to his employment as a farm labourer, the insured person is also the beneficial occupier of a farm. Statutory regulations provide that where a person has another occupation, as in this case, from which the remuneration or profit is more than <Col N="365" /> 50p per day, he cannot be paid unemployment benefit unless at least 78 employment contributions have been paid in respect of him in a given period of three years prior to his claim.</P>
      <P>In this case investigation by a social welfare officer was considered to be necessary in relation to the claim of 27th November, 1973.  This established that the profit from farming was very much in excess of the statutory maximum and the claimant did not satisfy the contribution requirement mentioned in relation to the claim in question.</P>
