    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total quantity of waste paper imported into the country for the most recent 12-months' period for which figures are available; and the cost per ton delivered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 12-months' period August, 1972, to July, 1973, the total quantity of waste paper imported was 23,434 tons.  The cost, as declared for customs purposes, was £16.6 per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell me the price paid to local suppliers?  He may not have it.  I understand that the price is about half that paid for the imported waste paper.  It seems a shame, in view of the amount of waste paper that is around the country, that we are importing waste paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that figure.  The Deputy might be interested to know that the price I have given to the House is the price computed on the basis that the seller bears the entire cost of freight, insurance and commission, and all other costs and expenses, excluding duty or tax chargeable in the State, incidental to the sale and the delivery of the goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will make a statement on the case of a prisoner serving a life sentence in Mountjoy who failed to answer his parole on the 13th January, 1974; and if he will state the conditions for parole generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the prisoner was taken back into custody on 8th February.  As I said in the public statement issued on 18th January, the granting of parole on a gradually increasing basis is part of the process of rehabilitation of long-term prisoners but the parole of a prisoner who has been convicted of murder or any other crime of serious violence is authorised only where, among other things, it is supported by psychiatric advice, as it was in the case in question.</P>
      <P>As regards the conditions for parole generally I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave on 5th July, 1973, to the question on this subject put down by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Two statements were issued subsequent to the non-appearance of this prisoner from parole. One statement was issued by the Garda stating that he was a dangerous individual and the other statement <Col N="1991" /> was from the Department of Justice and implied that he was of a harmless nature.  Can the Minister explain the conflict between the two statements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first query was made to the Garda who as a matter of prudence indicated that a person who had been convicted of murder and had broken parole, <i>prima facie</i>, without knowing the full facts behind the case, could be classified possibly as dangerous.  A fuller statement was issued by me subsequently which clarified the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the action he intends taking to prevent a recurrence of the traffic chaos in the city and county of Dublin on the morning of 30th January, 1974; and the number of accidents which occurred on that occasion and details thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Garda inquiries into the incidents that occurred in Dublin on the morning of 30th January are continuing.  I would refer the Deputy to the statement that I issued about these incidents and I would like to say again that the most effective deterrent against this type of activity is full and speedy co-operation by the public with the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner has reported that one serious accident occurred in Dublin city on that morning.  The Garda investigation into the accident is not yet completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>These occurrences were on the 30th January.  The Minister tells us a month later that the investigations are still continuing.  Can the Minister state when finality will be reached in the investigations of these very serious incidents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must know that it is impossible to state when Garda investigations into any particular incident will reach finality. They will reach finality when the investigations are completed; I cannot put it any other way.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>During the 12-month period commencing on 22nd January, 1973, five prosecutions were taken for breaches of the speed limit regulations at Bunting Road.  In 12 cases where drivers were found exceeding the limit by only a very small margin warnings were given.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda that the enforcement of the speed limit regulations on this road receives a good deal of attention from mobile units and that radar checks are carried out there at frequent intervals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in Dáil Éireann on Tuesday, 12th February, in the course of my speech on the group of estimates for which I am responsible, a scheme of compensation <Col N="1993" /> for personal injuries criminally inflicted has been approved by the Government.  I am at present engaged in setting up a tribunal to administer the scheme.  Compensation will be payable from State funds.</P>
      <P>With regard to damage to property, claims for compensation may be made in the normal way against Dublin Corporation under the criminal injuries code.  I have no information as to whether any compensation has yet been awarded on foot of such claims. As to the question of the cost of such compensation being met from central funds, I would refer the Deputy to the answer given by the Minister for Finance to a similar question on 12th February, 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant which it is proposed should be paid to the free legal advice centres is £5,000.  This sum will be paid as soon as the Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Justice, which is at present before the House, has been approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it was made subsequent to the budget.  The sum of which it forms part was mentioned specifically in the Financial Statement as money that would be allocated as a first step towards the implementation by the Ministers concerned of the various proposals in relation to deprived children.  It was decided that portion of this sum&mdash;the total sum was £200,000&mdash;would be made available to FLAC.  I understand that, as a matter of financial procedure to ensure that the money will be spent properly and correctly, it is necessary to have a Supplementary Estimate passed by the Dáil before payment will be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be fair to say that it was almost a year ago since it was announced that it was intended to pay this sum to this group and is it the intention of the Minister to pay the interest since accrued on this amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy knows as well as I do that it is almost a year since this was announced, he must know equally well that it is important that moneys voted by this House are paid in such a way that they can be subsequently traced and that the payments have the full validity of the House behind them.  I do not want to recall to the Deputy's mind a rather notorious incident where that procedure was not properly followed in the past.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his Department will contribute towards a local improvement scheme in respect of an accommodation road in the townlands of Gola, Roughill and Derrinstowny, County Monaghan in the light of the amount of use made of it by Garda vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this private laneway is used extensively daily by Garda vehicles?  The people base their request for a contribution on the fact that the Department of Lands made contributions towards local improvements schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the basis on which the Department of Lands make contributions.  Possibly they have statutory power to do so but there are no funds at my disposal from which I could make any payment towards road improvements in this case.  If there is as much traffic as the Deputy says, he might, perhaps, raise the matter with the local authority with a view to having it declared a public road.  They might take it in charge and remove the occupiers responsibility for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a request to have it declared a public road <Col N="1996" /> but it must be brought up to standard through the LI scheme and the contributions are fairly large.  Users of the laneway felt that the authorities, whether Garda, Army or Customs, who are using it as extensively as the local users, have as much obligation to make a contribution as residents, seeing that the Department of Lands would contribute if they had a forest or part of a forest in the laneway and make a contribution similar to that of the local residents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <P>For reasons outside the control of the Garda Síochána, the circumstances in which this man's injuries were received has not yet been fully investigated.  The investigation will, of course, be thorough and will be completed as soon as possible. The name of the hospital in which he is recovering is known to the man's relatives and it would be for them to identify it to the Deputy if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards communication with his father, my information is that the man was not living with his father but elsewhere in his own home and that the Garda Síochána made repeated efforts to contact relatives before they were able to do so.  However, the <Col N="1997" /> question whether there was excessive delay is also being investigated fully.</P>
    <P>As the man was arrested, it will be clear that the question of taking criminal proceedings must arise when he has further recovered.  In these circumstances, even if Garda investigations were completed, it would be improper for me to make any further comment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the reactions to this proposal the board considered the matter further at their meeting on 14th February, 1974.  At that meeting the board again decided that the declining number of new TB cases made it advisable to provide for the acute period of treatment of new patients in the specialist TB hospitals.  To meet the objections which had been expressed, however, it was decided that patients with chronic or recurring chest complaints should be able to get treatment in Waterford if they so desired.  Until accommodation for such patients can be provided in Waterford as part of the reorganisation and improvement of medical beds <Col N="2011" /> the present accommodation at St. Joseph's unit will, therefore, continue to be used for that purpose.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations on the proposed extension of the hospital scheme have not broken down but it has been difficult to reach agreement on the method of remunerating consultants, Accordingly I have told the medical organisations that I would be willing to consider, on certain conditions, a deferment of that part of the scheme specifically related to the payment of doctors.

I would not wish to make a more detailed statement on this at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would wish however to inform the House that any deferment would relate only to the payment of doctors and that there is no intention to defer beyond 1st April next the implementation of the proposal that maintenance costs in public beds be met in full for all the population and that subsidies from the health boards for maintenance in private and semi-private accommodation will also be available to all.  Similarly the scheme for subsidising the purchase of drugs and medicines now available to the middle income group will become available to all.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be presenting draft regulations for the approval of the House to give effect to these developments.</P>
    <P>Following is the text of the letter:</P>
    <P>The Secretary of the Department has reported to me on the present state of the negotiations about the future system of payment for consultants. Very broadly, it seems that the organisations would wish to have for each consultant an option between payment on a schedule of fees (with a guaranteed minimum income) and payment by way of salary (with provision for payments for availability and out-of-hours works).  This proposal represents a very fundamental change <i>vis-á-vis</i> the present system of payment for consultants.  I do not think I could agree to giving the option requested and it seems clear to me that a considerable further period of negotiations on principles and their application is needed.  I understand that this was pointed out by a number of the participants from the organisations during the negotiations up to the present stage.  Accordingly, I have been considering the situation which will exist after the 1st April and wish to put some proposals to the organisations. They are designed to continue in so far as is practicable, the present system for payment of consultants pending the completion of <Col N="2014" /> the negotiations on the future system of contract.  For this purpose, I think I should analyse my proposal to abolish the limits in so far as it will affect consultants.  The change will, in the first place, make maintenance at public ward level available free of charge to the entire population.  It will also apply to those now outside the eligible classes the system of public subvention where treatment is given privately whether in a hospital or nursing home.  Applying this part of my proposal from 1 April next will not affect the position of the consultants.</P>
    <P>In so far as the remuneration is concerned, the intention has been that the consultant's public remuneration would cover the treatment of all patients who opt for public treatment in the future, with the retention of his right to private fees from those who opt for private treatment.  I am aware that, pending the completion of negotiations, it would be the preference of the organisations that the proposal to abolish the limits should be entirely deferred but I am not willing to do this.  However, I think that both your wishes and mine can be met by an arrangement to continue the present system of payment for the time being.  In other words, the salary or &ldquo;pool&rdquo; payment to the consultant would cover his liability for the group who are new public patients (within an updated income limit) and he would retain his entitlement to fees for those outside this limit.  For the purpose of covering the latter group, I would propose to make a special interim arrangement with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board whereby they would be recouped from public funds for the cost of covering the class in question for public ward treatment.</P>
    <P>Having studied the movements in rates of pay since 1971 when the present limit of £1,600 a year was determined and the prospective changes in rates of pay during the current year, I am satisfied that, if the corresponding limit were being determined now it would be at the <Col N="2015" /> level of about £2,500 a year. Accordingly, I would intend to apply that figure in relation to the proposals which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>In brief, what I propose to do now is&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to proceed with regulations under section 46 of the Health Act 1970 to abolish the income limit for the self-employed and the valuation limit for farmers, thereby making the services now available to the &ldquo;middle income&rdquo; group available to all;</P>
    <P>(ii)  for the cost of maintenance in public hospitals, arrange that the health boards will accept full liability for those at public ward level and make the usual contributions for those opting to be private patients;</P>
    <P>(iii)  as far as remuneration of consultants is concerned, arrange for a continuance of the present systems to cover liability for the existing eligible classes (but with the income limit raised to £2,500 a year) and for those outside that group, allow for fees to be paid to the consultants.  For any eligible person opting for private treatment, there would be no change from the present situation whereby he would himself be liable for consultants' fees (and could insure himself with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board for this if he wished).  Any person above the £2,500 a year limit (or the £60 valuation limit for farmers) who opted for public ward care would be covered by the health board arranging through the Voluntary Health Insurance Board for meeting the cost of professional fees at the appropriate number of T units. For the particular category mentioned (i.e., those opting for public treatment) arrangements would be made with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to cover types of services not normally covered, including normal maternity care and out-patient services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2016" /> These are the aspects of the proposal which would affect the consultants.  I think, however, that I should also indicate how it would affect other services.  The scheme for assistance in the purchase of drugs at present applicable to the middle income group would be extended to the entire population. The maternity and infant care scheme at general practitioner level would also be similarly extended. Representations have been made that the fees payable under this scheme would, in these circumstances, need to be renegotiated.  I accept this in principle and will ask the Department to get in touch with the organisations soon about these negotiations.</P>
    <P>The above proposals have been evolved to leave us an opportunity for discussions over a reasonable period so as to work out a permanent answer in relation to the system of payment and engagement of consultants in the future.  Both the organisations and myself have the wish to evolve a common contract for consultants.</P>
    <P>I will be available to meet the organisations at an early date to discuss the contents of this letter.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply, I am convinced that the two proposals I made here can be implemented on 1st April, that is free maintenance for all from that date and participation in the present scheme that provides for drugs.  As far as the first part of the question is concerned it is correct to state that the consultants did refuse to consider the interim offer I made, an offer I made in order to try to break the logjam and to try to have negotiations with the consultants continue after 1st April.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the interim offer he made on 13th February, 1974, it was proposed to divide the country into two categories, those above £2,500 per annum and those below it and that the consultants treating a person above it would be paid the full fee for an operation which in a particular case could be £50 while those consultants operating on someone below £2,500 per annum would be paid out of the pools system where the fee might be as low as 50p or £1 for the same operation?  Does the Minister seriously suggest that that sort of scheme is a desirable one in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think, nor do I now think, it a desirable scheme.  It was not put up as the best scheme.  As I explained to the Deputy, it was put up in an effort to break the impasse that arose in February.  It is not correct for the Deputy to say that a consultant might be paid for an operation in a public ward an amount of 50p or £1; that is entirely inaccurate. The pools system does not provide for that sort of payment.  From what the Deputy has said it would necessarily mean that every single person in a public ward would be undergoing an operation in a particular week.  This is not so.  There might be one or two operations but the pool would be contributed to in respect of people who would be actually in the ward but not having an operation.  There could be 12, 14, or 20 people in the ward.</P>

      <P>If I may say so, that is so much speculation.  What I have proposed here would have no real effect on the consultants.  What I propose is that people would get free maintenance in a hospital and would be able to participate freely in the drug scheme.  From what I have read, the consultants have stated that they would not co-operate.  I do not know whether the term &ldquo;contingency plans&rdquo; ever arose.  In the proposal I have made now, which has no real detrimental effect on the consultants, I cannot see why they should employ any &ldquo;contingency plans&rdquo; or why they should not co-operate until there is an agreement on what sort of money they should be paid is reached.</P>

      <P>Before the Order of Business is taken, may I say that on Tuesday last 26th February the Leader of the Opposition raised the question as to whether there had been a breach of privilege by the publication in the newspapers of the apparent content of proposed legislation which had not yet been made known to the House.  The Chair promised to investigate the matter.</P>
      <P>As far as I have been able to ascertain, the only information on the proposed Bill which was issued officially was the following statement which was released by the Government Information Services on Monday, 25th February:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour, Mr. Michael O'Leary, T.D., will tomorrow <Col N="2029" /> seek leave to introduce the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974, in the Dáil.  This will provide for equal pay for work of equal value in Ireland from the 31st December, 1975 at the latest.</P>
    <P>In accordance with normal practice, an advance copy of the Bill was received in the Bills Office on Friday 22nd February to facilities early printing and circulation after introduction but I am satisfied that no information was released by the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am not in a position to say how the additional information became available to newspapers.</P>
    <P>Advance information on legislation to be introduced in the House has been disclosed in the past.  The practice has, however, never been challenged as constituting a breach of privilege.  In this connection it may be mentioned that the power given to the House under the Constitution to protect its official documents has so far been interpreted only as preventing the premature disclosure of reports of Parliamentary Committees and this rule was formally adopted by the House on 28th October, 1953, following a report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  In the circumstances I could not regard the case now raised as involving a <i>prima facie</i> breach of privilege.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are committed, as part of their overall programme, to the introduction of legislation to eliminate discrimination against women.  The Government have already indicated their general acceptance of the recommendations contained in the final report of the Commission of Inquiry on the Status of Women which was published in May last.  The commission recommended that legislation should be enacted to ensure the implementation <Col N="2031" /> of a policy of equal pay for work of equal value.</P>
    <P>Equal pay is but one aspect of the general question of the status of women in employment and, indeed, in society generally which needs attention. Much remains to be done to eliminate unfair discrimination on grounds of sex wherever possible and so help to change the prejudiced attitudes which give rise to it.  The Bill now before the House is a significant statutory step along the road leading towards uplifting the role of women in our society.</P>
    <P>It is our objective as an administration to allow women to play a full part in the life of the State and to eliminate those barriers which prevent them from doing so.  Whilst it is true that the majority of women may not wish to see their family role basically altered, it must not be forgotten that women are going out to work in far greater numbers or are returning to work at an earlier age after their children have gone to school.  The proportion of women in the work force has been on the increase for a considerable time and now amounts to 26 per cent of the working population.  It is, therefore, unacceptable from the point of view of women and our community that they have tended to be concentrated in less skilled and, therefore, lowly paid jobs and that they are poorly represented in management and most of the professions.</P>
    <P>This major piece of legislation follows on a number of other measures which have been introduced by this Government.  In this connection, I would mention the removal of the marriage bar to employment in the Public Service, the improvement of facilities for deserted wives and the introduction of benefits and allowances for unmarried mothers.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that this is a Bill to deal with equal pay.  It is a necessary and important step along the road to eliminating discrimination but it covers only a limited though significant area of discrimination and does not in itself ensure equality of opportunity for women.  In the preparation of later legislation, I propose to consider making unlawful practices <Col N="2032" /> in employment which impede the progress of women and tend to restrict them to the less skilled and more poorly paid jobs.  Such legislation should also provide a means of redress for individual women who feel they have suffered unfair discrimination in employment.  This present legislation does not provide the complete answer to the subordinate position of women in employment.  More fundamental problems, such as the nature of their work in industry, the availability of training facilities and of access to these facilities, all these are matters which will require consideration and which may require legislative treatment.</P>
    <P>From the experience of other countries, I think I may say now that further legislation will be necessary to deal with questions of discrimination on grounds of sex in the selection of workers for industry, their advancement and promotion and structural changes required by the needs of married women in industry.  I have set in train consideration of all these matters in my Department.  This Bill is, therefore, the first of a series of anti-discrimination measures which I propose to bring before the Oireachtas as soon as possible so as to give the individual citizen, whether man or woman, a fair contract of employment with statutory backing.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a woman will have the right to the same pay as a man who is employed by the same employer in the same place of employment if both are employed on &ldquo;like work&rdquo;.  The definitions of &ldquo;like work&rdquo; follow broadly the definitions set out in the report of the Commission of Inquiry on the Status of Women&mdash;an excellent report&mdash;and used in successive national wages agreements.</P>
    <P>These criteria are a good deal wider in scope than those contained in the equivalent British legislation of 1970 and should ensure that the fairest possible comparisons are drawn between jobs being done by men and women.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Bill that both sides of industry should work together and secure by their joint efforts <Col N="2033" /> the transition to equal pay.  I visualise the vast majority of equal pay claims being settled through direct negotiations between employers and trade unions.</P>
    <P>Where, however, settlement of an equal pay claim cannot be reached by direct negotiation, the Bill provides that a party to a dispute can refer it to an equal pay officer of the Labour Court who will investigate it and issue a recommendation.  The equal pay officers will be trained in the techniques necessary to enable them to give informed and authoritative guidance to the parties involved.  If a party to a dispute is dissatisfied with the recommendation of an equal pay officer, there is provision in the Bill for appeal to the Labour Court who will then issue a binding determination&mdash;enforceable by law.  Appeal may be made to the High Court on a point of law arising from any such recommendation.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately selected the Labour Court as the body to be the final arbiter of equal pay cases rather than setting up a separate tribunal as has been done in a number of countries. In our situation the Labour Court enjoys a high reputation at the centre of our industrial relations system as a body trusted by both employers and unions.  I would hope that this would contribute towards the acceptability of decisions in this area.</P>
    <P>Where it appears to me that a particular employer has failed to comply with the provisions of the Bill and where for one reason or another it is not reasonable to expect an employee to refer her case to an equal pay officer, I will have power to refer cases to the equal pay officers for investigation.</P>
    <P>In the course of my consideration of the most effective kind of dispute-settling machinery my concern has been to ensure, as far as possible, that claims can be settled quickly and without the necessity of those involved going through complex procedures in order to secure their rights.</P>
    <P>It could, perhaps, happen that some woman might be deterred from seeking equal pay to which she might <Col N="2034" /> feel she is entitled through fear of retaliatory action by an employer&mdash; such as dismissal.  I have, therefore, included a provision in the Bill making it an offence for an employer to dismiss a woman on the grounds that she sought equal pay.  In a prosecution for an offence of this kind the onus will be on the employer to satisfy the courts that the dismissal did not arise solely from the making of the claim for equal pay.  A woman who has been dismissed in the circumstances I have referred to should not be placed in the position of having to incur legal expenses in order to assert her rights.  The Bill, therefore, provides that she can lodge a complaint with the Labour Court that she has been dismissed from her employment because she sought equal pay whereupon the Labour Court will consider the complaint.  If the court is satisfied that the complaint is well-founded it can, by order, direct the employer concerned to compensate the woman for loss of earnings. An employer who fails to comply with a Labour Court order will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I may add&mdash;for any male chauvinist Deputies there may be in the House&mdash; that the Bill will apply equally to a man who seeks equal pay with that of a woman who is doing like work in the same place of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given careful consideration to the question of the date for full implementation, before deciding that the Act should be brought into operation on the 31st December, 1975: in other words that, from that date, women should be entitled to full equality with a man who is doing like work in the same place of employment from that date.  As a Government we are convinced that there could be no further delay in nominating a final date for the implementation of equal pay.  The Government also had regard to the fact that if legislation were to provide for the full implementation in three or four years there would be the inherent danger seen in the experience of other countries that little progress towards <Col N="2035" /> equal pay would, in fact, be made in the intervening period irrespective of how long that would be.  Real progress would, in fact, be confined to a very short period before the date specified in the legislation.  While the implementing of equal pay will involve additional costs, I do not think that this problem must stand in our way. It is impossible, in legislation of this kind, to get a universally acceptable right time for implementation and the reasons for doing nothing in social legislation of this kind are always legion.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the decision to proceed to full implementation of this measure by December, 1975, has been the subject of criticism, notably by the employer organisations.  In social legislation of this kind, I accept the right of nationally representative organisations to make known their observations, whether of opposition or support, but in the last analysis it is for the Government of the day to take the necessary legislative decisions after consideration of all the factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the progress towards equal pay, it is fair to say, has occurred thus far from under the aegis of the various national agreements.  The transition towards equal pay commenced on a voluntary basis following the successful negotiation of the national agreement of 1972.  Under the provisions of that agreement, the parties could negotiate claims aimed at reducing by 17½ per cent the differential in the rates of pay of men and women.  This narrowing of the differentials has already been implemented in the Civil Service.  The proposals for a third national agreement contain provisions for further substantial progress towards the goal of equal pay, by providing for the negotiation of claims on the basis of 33? per cent of the difference between male and female rates, that is in addition to the 17½ per cent closing of differentials involved in the 1972 agreement.  The clause in the proposed third national agreement provides that &ldquo;It shall not be inconsistent with this Agreement for the parties, on the basis of mutual consent, to make arrangements for <Col N="2036" /> the application of equal pay by the end of 1975&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I often have the impression that there is too little recognition as yet in the country of the social obligations of our membership of the European Community.  Every member country of the Community has legalisation on equal pay.  The Netherlands, who were the only country without such legislation, have now decided to introduce it.  As a member country of the EEC it is in the national interest to work towards the development of a comprehensive social policy in the Community, a policy of a comprehensive kind that would animate all the other decisions of the Community. Despite difficulties which the Community is presently encountering the Government will continue to work towards the objective of a Community which accords the same status to the requirements of social policy as to economic policy.  It would, therefore, be inconsistent on our part to delay implementation of legislation on this matter.</P>
    <P>While this is, for our State, the first piece of legislation in this area and whilst as such it may not give complete answers to all of the problems connected with discrimination in employment, I hope it will be accepted for what it is&mdash;an honest endeavour towards the improvement of the status of women.  As I said at the outset, this is only one of a number of measures which will be needed if we are to proceed towards the removal of discrimination against women.  Of course, legislation on its own can never be the final answer.  It will always need to be complemented, for complete success, by changes in the attitude of society at large.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill I should like to say that our attitude is summed up in the budget speech of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy George Colley, in 1972 when he indicated at page 27 of the publication &ldquo;Budget 1972&rdquo; that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these is equal pay for women, which the Government <Col N="2037" /> accept in principle and which they now affirm as a national aim.</P>
    <P>Of course, he was referring to equal pay and it was affirmed at that stage.</P>
    <P>Having heard the Minister explain the contents of the Bill in detail I am very disappointed that it was not one of a more comprehensive nature.  The Minister has had plenty of time, since the introduction of the first Bill on the 3rd July, 1973, up to now, to take into consideration all the aspects which he mentioned in his brief.  He indicated it was necessary and desirable to bring in further legislation in order to ensure the full implementation of equal pay.  I believe, this being a new Bill, that it would have been desirable that it be a full and comprehensive measure which would have been discussed here on its introduction. The time factor would indicate now that the introduction of the first Bill in July, 1973, was a mere whitewashing effort.  It would appear to me that there was one word only in the long title which differed from the title of the present Bill, the word &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo;. Therefore, it is disappointing that, after this prolonged period of study, the Minister has not got something more concrete to offer to the House so that we could have had for consideration the concomitant measures necessary and desirable for the implementation of the comprehensive system of equal pay for women.</P>
    <P>The important clauses of the Bill are very few indeed.  There is the question of like work in section 3; the dismissal, because of seeking equal pay in section 8; the provisions applying to dismissal in section 9.  When we examine sections 8 and 9, if lack of equal pay is to be the sole criterion of discrimination against women and if there are no other conditions which may be construed as discriminating against them, why not call it the Equal Pay Bill?  The main clauses deal only with remuneration for women and the possible causes of discrimination against women at work.  It appears to us that the change of title was merely a whitewashing operation to cover over the long period of inactivity since the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2038" /> The passing of this Bill at an earlier stage would have given employers a longer period in which to set in motion the services necessary and desirable for its implementation.  The Minister has specified December, 1975, as the date for the implementation of the Bill as against 1977 which was recommended in the Report on the Status of Women.  The Minister mentioned the criticism of the Federated Union of Employers who felt that the deadline for the Bill's implementation was unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;like work&rdquo; is worth noting.  It is a term which is open to a variety of interpretations.  If we look at legislation already enacted in other European countries, it will be noted that difficulties were encountered in various EEC countries in regard to this matter.  In 1967 the Belgian Government indicated imminent activity in relation to equal pay and they encouraged employers to observe the principle of equal pay.  It was 1961, following promptings from the EEC, before there was favourable reaction to the question of full implementation of &ldquo;like work&rdquo;.  In 1964 there was a decree in France providing for wages to be fixed in accordance with occupations and skills.  In 1968 the commission had to take further steps there to ensure that the difficulties then existing were overcome.  There are still some differences between what was done and what should have been done.</P>
    <P>The lapse of time between the implementation of the Bill and its effects was considerable even in these countries where they were geared to this situation.  In Germany, even with the resources available there and their goodwill towards the implementation of the principle, while they were faster than other countries, it was as a result of prompting also that further steps were taken to ensure full implementation. There were factors in all these countries which produced an undesirable situation because of the long lapse of time.  It is desirable that the Bill should be implemented as soon as possible but there is a long lapse of time; questions arise about the downgrading of women in the interim <Col N="2039" /> period.  In Italy the Government were committed to equal pay long ago but it was 1968 before they started in earnest to develop this principle. There were further promptings in 1971 and the whole question of equal pay was further considered.  There is still a gap there between what is intended and what has been done.  In Luxembourg and the Netherlands there are also gaps.  In Britain there is a Bill which is to come into operation in December of next year. Various difficulties and complications were indicated during the debate on that Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he has taken into consideration factors which came to light during the debate in Britain.  We are aware that the terms &ldquo;like work&rdquo; or &ldquo;equal pay for work of equal value&rdquo; create problems. The problems should be identified and eliminated.  The terminology in this Bill should be simple.  Does the Minister intend in further Bills to make provision for pregnant women and their reinstatement after an absence because of pregnancy?  There are similar provisions in some Bills but not in others.  Many married women are now employed.  It is desirable that their position should be protected.  If there is no indication in this Bill about them, it can be taken by implication that we are not concerned about them. It is most important that pregnant women should get recognition in the Bill in order to ensure that their rights will be observed by the employers and that the employers will have to consider them and not merely dismiss because of a desire to reduce the number of female personnel on the staff, leaving them without an opportunity to return to employment after a reasonable period.  A reasonable period in which they can return to their jobs should be defined in the Bill in order to ensure their return to employment.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what the Minister proposes to do in relation to the employment of equal pay officers and what terms of reference he will give them in relation to the assessment of equal pay for work of equal value.  In many countries it has been the practice to downgrade women in the period <Col N="2040" /> between the introduction of a Bill and its final implementation.  It is important that the necessary measures should be taken to ensure that downgrading does not take place on a large scale so that the Bill would not apply to women who would normally get an increase. We are aware that in other countries there has been this downgrading; there has been the removal of male employees to other places of employment in order to ensure there can be no basis for comparing work of equal value.  I hope that through discussions with the Federated Union of Employers and other employers' organisations the Minister will ensure that the tactics used elsewhere to nullify the effect of the Bill will be overcome.  The long-term advantages are there, but, in the short term, there may be an adverse effect.  I would hope that any legislation coming before this House would not have an adverse effect on the employment of women.  The lay off of female personnel and the employment of male personnel to replace them is a matter that must be considered at an early stage.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Bill is inadequate to deal with equal pay on a comprehensive basis, because it only deals with a very few factors.  As regards the initial Bill which came before the House way back in July and which was withdrawn at a later stage, if the time lag which occurred there is to be the same in the future in relation to the additional measures that are necessary, the whole effect of the Bill will be lost.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that an employee would have the right to appeal on a point of law to the High Court.  It is very important in a Bill of this nature where costs are involved that the worker would not be the one to be at a financial disadvantage as a result of pursuing a course which he thought was in keeping with his claim. I hope the Minister will clearly indicate who will be responsible for the costs in relation to an appeal to the High Court.  If costs are given against the worker, this will be the discrimination Bill instead of the Anti-Discrimination Bill, a term which certainly has not won the admiration <Col N="2041" /> of many people either inside or outside the House.  It is difficult to understand why the Minister chose the term &ldquo;anti-discrimination&rdquo; in relation to this legislation.  As far as I am aware from inquiries I have made, it is the first occasion we have had a Bill prefixed with &ldquo;anti&rdquo;.  The other provisions in the Bill are purely related to its implementation, namely, the equal pay officers and the Labour Court as the court which will make the decisions.  One cannot find fault with them, but it would be desirable to have an indication as to where the costs will lie.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would indicate why he has provided in the various subsections of the Bill that the hearings would be in private and whether at any stage he would consider the question of an appeal to a body that would include trade unionists and possibly employers in relation to some of the decisions arrived at.  It might be well worth while for the Minister to consider the setting up of such a body.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will be fully implemented and that there will be no difficulty experienced by employers as a result of the time lag in the presentation of the Bill to the House.  From discussions I had with employers, I gathered they thought that when the Minister failed to present the Bill after the First Reading, he was allowing the position to lapse.  As a result, many employers did not proceed as far as they could or should with the restructuring which will take place now, I am sure, in order to avoid immediate repercussions because of the early implementation.  I have no disagreement with that, having regard to our entry to the EEC and our obligation to ensure that conditions laid down by the EEC in regard to the improvement of working conditions and other improvements, which we hope will be to the benefit of the Irish workers are implemented.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give us a clear indication of the other measures he proposes to introduce.  It is regrettable that he did not indicate them in his opening speech so that we could examine the Bill in the light of <Col N="2042" /> those other measures.  The introduction of a comprehensive measure would be more desirable and would possibly give a greater opportunity to Members of this House to discuss all the factors involved in equal pay legislation.  Now that the Bill is before the House, I hope the employers will make the necessary arrangements and so ensure that women are not discriminated against in any way, and that they will also, unlike employers in other countries, take a realistic look at this and in no way downgrade women in order to evade their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>I rise to extend a very special welcome to this Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974, and to compliment the Minister on its introduction.  This is, of course, a continuation of the policy of this Government to end discrimination against women and to improve the status of women.  I hope this will be the first of a series of anti-discrimination Bills aimed at correcting the imbalance against women in this State.</P>
      <P>This Bill is framed largely in accordance with the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  I want to compliment the members of that commission on what was an excellent report.  It has produced, very objectively, a wealth of information and documentation and can form the basis of a good deal of anti-discrimination law for the future.  I hope the other recommendations in the report will find their expression in legislation in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of giving equal pay for work of equal value has been with us for quite a considerable time.  We can go back at least 26 years to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948.  It stated that everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.  In June, 1961, we had the ILO Convention 100, the one that formed the basis of so many questions in this House, ratified by 70 countries, all the then EEC countries, the United Kingdom, <Col N="2043" /> Norway and Denmark.  It was not ratified by Ireland and for that reason it was the subject of several questions in this House.  The replies were fairly consistent, and the State was not going to lead the way in this matter.  Thank heavens the State has decided to be definite in where it wants to go in this regard.  We then had the European Special Charter in 1961 again dealing with equal pay for equal work.  The relevant paragraph&mdash;I think it was paragraph 3 of article 4 &mdash;again was not accepted by Ireland. Therefore, I can understand the urgency with which the Minister introduces this Bill and as far as I am concerned it is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I know that even in countries where legislation has been introduced for some considerable time, in the EEC countries, for instance, the progress anticipated has not been made. I certainly take the Minister's point, that probably a programme set out in a very short period is the most effective way to do this.  I sincerely hope the ambitions of the Minister in this regard will be realised before the end of 1975.</P>
    <P>We have a situation in this country where women's earnings do fall drastically short of the earnings of men. We find&mdash;and I am quoting from this report to which I referred previously&mdash;that in March 1972 the average hourly earnings of women in industry on adult rates were only 37.6 pence as against 65.6 for men.  This strikes me as a tremendous gap to be bridged.  In September, 1970, the latest date for which data is available, we find from the Quarterly Industrial Inquiry that 65 per cent of men earned more than £20 at that time whereas only 2.3 per cent of women earned that figure.  Seventy-five per cent of all women earned less than £12 at that time while only 1.8 per cent of the men earned less than £12. Although some improvement has taken place since, the pattern largely exists up to the present and would continue, to some degree, without legislation of this kind.  It would even continue with legislation unless the legislation has teeth to ensure that it <Col N="2044" /> does not and unless it is followed up forcefully by other anti-discrimination legislation and by education on a very broad scale.  We require a new charter for women.  I am happy that an understanding of the problems of women and of the injustice committed against them in the past seems to exist now and that positive steps are being taken to right these wrongs.</P>
    <P>The implementation of any Act in this area and of an equal pay Act in particular encounters many obstacles such as the social attitude of the people, fears of male workers and prejudice.  It is generally accepted that skilled male workers particularly vehemently oppose the admission of women into their areas of occupation. They fear job dilution and they fear&mdash; perhaps they had some reason to do so up to now&mdash;that cheap female labour would lessen the value of their own jobs.  They should be happy to find that as a result of the introduction of a Bill like this these fears need no longer exist and that if women enter, as I hope they will, that field of activity&mdash;I see no reason why not&mdash;there will certainly be no question of them providing cheap female labour in that area of employment.  All that must be overcome in this area then is prejudice. I understand that prejudice would exist but perhaps when the economics are overcome the prejudice will slowly die a natural death.</P>
    <P>We have the social attitude also.  The Minister said that we had to change the attitude of society and that no legislation would do this.  Perhaps the two are interlocked and that by usage, in some areas, attitudes will change also. In society up to now and even still very largely men are regarded as breadwinners, whether or not they marry or whether they win the bread.  Wages are linked with family needs.  We speak in terms such as &ldquo;good wages for a man&rdquo;, &ldquo;very good wages for a girl&rdquo;. We often hear these terms with no reference to the skill required for the job or the sort of job it is.  For instance, £30 a week today is considered a very good wage for a girl; it is not so considered for a man.  There is no advertence to the value of the job in using those terms.  We must admit, however, <Col N="2045" /> that this is not consistent because there are vast differences between the wages or incomes of different men; we must, therefore, conclude that the needs of different families vary very greatly. The hypocrisy is still greater when we consider what little reference to family needs there is in the case of widows; there are no family wages for them. Even when we talk of married women going to work and the children's need to have their mothers with them, we do not extend that thinking to widows. The provision made by the State for widows makes it necessary for them to go to work.  We tend to change our attitudes to suit the occasion.  I believe that while these attitudes have been with us a long time they can and will be changed.</P>
    <P>You very often hear that women are their own worst enemies and this is frequently true but on the question of equal pay the attitude of men is definitely harder.  The Economic and Social Research Unit made a survey in 1968 in which it was shown that 79 per cent of men felt a fair, basic minimum wage for a single man should be more than that for a single woman. I would ask: why?  That was only four years ago.  Only 5.4 per cent of them thought that all should have the same pay, men or women married or single.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that any legislation introduced will have public opinion to overcome and I wish him well in his efforts to cope with this problem of woolly thinking in regard to pay.  Another survey was done among women at that time and it was found that they were definitely more sympathetic towards the condition of women than men were but the same emphasis on dependence was revealed. We will need a great deal of clarification on that point.  We must think in terms of rate for the job while not disregarding family commitments or responsibility&mdash;these should be dealt with in another area and under another heading.</P>
    <P>In the main, women are relegated to the lower-paid jobs and facts bear out this view.  Indeed, it is quite evident in our society that women are relegated in the main to lower-paid service jobs or jobs of routine nature, <Col N="2046" /> even where their education or skill fits them for something better&mdash;certainly their education, because up to a point girls are educated to the same extent as boys.  But beyond a certain point there seems to be a blockage in the advancement of women.  The horizons are limited by convention.  The attitudes of employers are hardened.  The ambition of the skilled typist seems to be to become a secretary to the boss, who is always a man.  A great deal of improvement is required in this area. Jobs as typists, shorthand typists, dictaphone typists and secretaries could be done by men and women, but because they are done predominently by women they are treated as female jobs and automatically downgraded as far as remuneration is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that equal pay legislation should have teeth in it.  A number of firms have taken steps to implement equal pay but so far these have not been very effective. Equal pay has been applied to a few specified jobs.  The Report of the Commission on the Status of Women, at page 89, states:</P>
    <P>It should be noted, however, that while in some cases all office jobs have been incorporated under the equal pay scheme, for the majority equal pay applies merely to a few specific jobs or tasks such as accounts, wages, etc., and does not include the bulk of office jobs.  For example, one organisation which spoke of its equal pay scheme for male and female clerical workers, had only one female classed as a &ldquo;clerical&rdquo; and she had a university qualification.</P>
    <P>This is typical of women's struggle to be recognised in industry or any other area where remunerative jobs are concerned. Any Equal Pay Bill will not do and an Equal Pay Bill alone will not do.</P>
    <P>Some EEC countries have had equal pay legislation on the stocks for some time and have not made the progress we had hoped they would.  We can learn from their mistakes and ensure that our legislation will be effective. France have had legislation on their books since 1950.  They admit that the <Col N="2047" /> requirement of strength is still more heavily weighed than the requirement of dexterity.  The same applies to Germany.  Discrimination was practised in skilled classifications.  At the moment we have male jobs and female jobs and never the twain shall meet; therefore, we must have job evaluation.</P>
    <P>What type of evaluation does the Minister envisage?  Will it be on an organised basis under the Bill or will it arise as claims are presented to an equal pay officer or the Labour Court?</P>

      <P>The Minister would step in where a person could not be expected to bring the case to the Court. This is very important because I envisage that many of these people were deprived as a result of centuries of a certain type of thinking.  They would be the least equipped to bring their cases to the Labour Court.  I appeal to women generally to make their voices heard.</P>
      <P>I am realist enough to know that any system would depend on the judgment and experience of the person assessing.  Tradition has been weighted against women.  It is very difficult for people who have been reared in this tradition to be completely objective. Every country has problems of physical effort on the one hand and manual dexterity on the other.  Physical effort commands greater remuneration in all cases.  In this age of mechanisation surely this is not very logical.  I presume that the post of equal pay officer will be open to both men and women. There is a lot of repetition in the Bill of &ldquo;him&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This Bill implements the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  It is a personal triumph for the Minister for Labour.  It must be remembered that the commission recommended that by 1977 equal pay should be implemented; we will have it here in 1975.  This is a measure which women will welcome.  As a Deputy I also welcome it.  I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated by Deputy Dowling, we on this side of the House welcome this Bill as far as it goes.  Unfortunately, that is not very far.  Deputy Dowling referred to the budget speech made by me as the then Minister for Finance on 19th April, 1972, in which I stated that the Government accepted in principle equal pay for women and that they now affirmed this as a national aim. I went on to detail the various aspects of this matter which could be dealt with and to outline a timetable during which they would be dealt with.  It will be appreciated that in a budget speech it is not possible, or appropriate, to go into very great detail on a matter such as this.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I did make reference at that time to the fact that the commission also recommended the enactment of legislation to give effect to their proposals.  I also referred to the fact that the Employer/Labour Conference would be taking account of the recommendations moving towards equal pay, something which was done, as the Minister indicated in his speech, in the 1972 national pay agreement.  A greater step on that road is, as indicated by the Minister, proposed in the third national pay agreement if it operates.</P>
      <P>In that budget speech I further stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also intended to consider the question of the ending of restrictions on the employment of women <Col N="2049" /> which, by excluding them from equal work with men, are an automatic barrier to equal pay.  It is hoped that the final report of the Commission will be available when the legislation is being prepared.</P>
    <P>The final report did become available. Further on, having referred to the marriage bar in the public service which operated under various statutory and non-statutory regulations, I pointed out that it was hoped that all non-statutory restrictions on employment of married women would be ended as soon as possible and that the necessary legislation for the repeal of any statutory restrictions and for the prohibition of restrictions on the employment of married women generally, would be enacted within the period of two years as recommended in the interim report.</P>
    <P>I further pointed out that it was intended to enact, within two years of the interim report, legislation for the prohibition of restrictions on employment of married women generally. None of these matters is contained in this Bill.  In so far as we are concerned we can only regard this as a sliding back on the part of the Government from the programme which we had set out and announced at that time.</P>
    <P>In case the Minister is tempted to regard this as a debating point I should like to draw attention to a very important matter.  It is agreed on all sides of the House, and the Minister has indicated his agreement with this in his speech, that all experience in other countries shows that the mere statutory provision of compulsory equal pay for work of equal value does not achieve what we want to achieve.  Indeed, the Minister goes to some trouble in his speech to spell out various other areas which will need attention.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from the Minister's script:</P>
    <P>In the preparation of later legislation, I propose to consider making unlawful certain practices in employment which impede the progress of women and tend to restrict them to the less skilled and more <Col N="2050" /> poorly paid jobs.  Such legislation should also provide a means of redress for individual women who feel they have suffered unfair discrimination in employment.  This present legislation does not provide the complete answer to the subordinate position of women in employment.</P>
    <P>That is certainly an understatement. The Minister went further and stated:</P>
    <P>More fundamental problems such as the nature of their work in industry, the availability of training facilities and of access to these facilities, all these are matters which will require consideration and which may require legislative treatment.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that he knows, and all of us know from our experience in other countries, as well as from our own practical appreciation of the situation, that without comprehensive legislation of that kind, as was pointed out by Deputy Dowling, the position of women in regard to equal pay will not alone be defective but could well be made much worse as a result of this legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>I know that it is not the Minister's intention and I do not want him to misunderstand me or misquote me by suggesting I was putting forward the thesis that that was his intention.  I know it is not his intention but we have got to be realistic.  We know that this very limited legislation in the short-term and pending further legislation, could lead to a disimprovement in the position of women in so far as equal pay is concerned.  Indeed, it could lead to a disimprovement in their position relevant to their position today in the absence of this legislation today.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is necessary for me to spell this out in detail because the Minister has indicated he is aware of this.  There have been some references by Deputy Dowling and, I think, by Deputy Mrs. Desmond, to the possibility of this happening, to the possibility that under the provisions of this Bill, limited though it is, employers <Col N="2051" /> will so arrange their work force as to result to the detriment of women workers.  That is not what any of us wants but that is a most likely outcome of producing such a limited Bill as the Minister has produced.  The Minister has produced this Bill behind schedule and after he had been manoeuvring around with the title of the Bill.  After all that time he comes in with this Bill which, I believe even he would admit, is not exactly the most earth-shattering legislation that has come before this House.</P>
    <P>This is relatively simple legislation and there is, in fact, a great danger that, because of its very limited nature, it may have a detrimental effect.  The Minister has not, as far as I can see, offered to the House any explanation as to why the more comprehensive legislation, the outlines of which he has mentioned in his speech and more of which were mentioned in the budget speech of 1972, was not introduced and why this legislation is so limited.  He has not explained why this legislation does not cover the various points he highlighted as being necessary to be covered.  I feel, since this Bill is not intended to operate until 31st December, 1975, that if for any reason, and I cannot imagine what the reason was, the Minister was unable to produce comprehensive legislation at this time, and it is our belief that he should have been able to do it, then it would have been better to have held back a little longer until he could produce the comprehensive legislation.</P>
    <P>Since this legislation would only operate at the end of December, 1975, nothing is being achieved by introducing it now except, as mentioned by Deputy Dowling, that it gives that much more notice to employers, in particular, to gear themselves for the implementation of the Bill.  Since the Bill is so limited and since it appears to leave so many loopholes, I am not so sure that that length of notice to employers is a desirable thing.  I hope the Minister will indicate in much more detail why the Bill is not as comprehensive as he would desire it to be and what his view is in relation to the dangers of introducing a less than <Col N="2052" /> comprehensive Bill in the circumstances which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>To indicate just how limited this Bill is, Sir, I want to refer to the Explanatory Memorandum because it expresses what is in section 2 of the Bill in clearer language than could necessarily be done in the Bill itself. The Explanatory Memorandum refers to section 2 in the following terms:</P>
    <P>This section provides that where a woman is employed by the same employer on like work with that of a man in the same place of employment she will be entitled to equal pay.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister could have made the section more limited than that if he had gone out of his way to do so: &ldquo;...employed by the same employer in the same place of employment...&rdquo; That, of course, is extremely restrictive.  It also leaves numerous loopholes to avoid the intention of the Bill.  I hope this Bill is not really a piece of window-dressing but it is difficult to avoid the suspicion, when one looks at the terms of the Bill and has regard to the dangers I have referred to&mdash;and, indeed, which have been recognised by the Minister himself&mdash;that this is what this Bill is, a piece of window-dressing. It will not do any good of itself, within the limited terms of this Bill, to achieve equal pay.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could assure us that he intends to bring forward the further legislation which is necessary, and to bring it forward in a reasonably short time, I would be less concerned about the dangerous implications of the Bill on its own.  If he can assure us that that is so, he should explain why it is that he has not got a comprehensive Bill here now.</P>
    <P>I also have some reservations in regard to the title of the Bill, not the ones mentioned already in the House, but because it is called the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974.  If you look at the terms of section 2 it could be argued that section 2 displays a discriminatory mental attitude which should not be there.  Section 2 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> Subject to this Act, it shall be a term of the contract under which a woman is employed in any place of employment that she shall be entitled to the same rate of remuneration as a man who is employed in that place and by the same employer if both are employed on like work.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides:</P>
    <P>Two persons shall be regarded as employed on like work&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 2 refers to a woman and a man.  I am not convinced at all that it is necessary for the purposes of this Bill to do so.  If men and women are entitled to equal pay, they are entitled to it because they are doing work of equal value, and because they are human beings, not because they are men or women.  It seems to me that the mental attitude that comes out in section 2 is, as I have said, discriminatory of its nature, whereas section 3 shows that the problem can be approached in a different way.  The title which the Minister made such a hoo-ha about in introducing it is even more unfortunate, when one looks at the terms of section 2 in the light of what I have said.</P>
    <P>The recommendation in the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women or the date of implementation of equal pay was 1977 and this Bill provides for the end of 1975.  Incidentally, I should like to support very strongly the praise given by Deputy Mrs. Desmond to that report which I believe was an invaluable document which will ultimately have a very great influence in altering the whole attitude of society to women and in altering the position of women in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked at some length in his introductory speech about the date of implementation of equal pay. I seem to recall that on a previous occasion the Minister said he could not introduce the equal pay provision by the end of 1975.  If I am right in that, perhaps the Minister would explain in more detail what the factors were which changed, or what the factors were which changed his mind in that regard.</P>

      <P>I have not got a reference but if the Minister tells me he did not say it I or some Fianna Fáil Deputy will produce it for him. I worded it in such a way as to suggest that I was not purporting to quote the Minister but that I had a recollection that the Minister had said so. I think he will appreciate that my wording was rather careful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I must compliment the Deputy on his careful wording.  His budget statement of 1972 is doing great service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to the point I was about to make.  The Minister will recall that he withdrew the previous Bill and introduced this one.  Apparently he was just changing the title.  He will recall that at that time he said something to the effect that when he went into office he found nothing done in this regard. The Minister really ought to be a little more forthcoming with the House.  I would refer him again to what was stated in the budget speech of 1972 and I would ask him is it not a fact that, when he went into office, he found a great deal of work had been done in regard particularly to the first priority mentioned there, the removal of the marriage bar in the public service, the removal of the non-statutory restrictions, and the identification of the problems involved in the removal of the statutory restrictions which applied?</P>
      <P>Furthermore, with all due deference to the Minister and to the draftsmen and the officials in his Department, he cannot say that it took him a year to produce this Bill.  It did not. It could not.  The only major political decision to be made was on the date of implementation.  Perhaps that is what held him up, but it does not explain why the various requirements the Minister himself has highlighted are omitted and why it is that the Bill is of such a limited nature as set out in section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I was about to make was <Col N="2055" /> that I would like the Minister to give some examples of a court of competent jurisdiction as referred to in section 8 (1) (c).  I would assume, though I may be wrong in this, that in the normal case a court of competent jurisdiction would be the District Court.  Perhaps it would be more normal that it should be the Circuit Court.  It might help our understanding if the Minister could give us some examples of what might be a court of competent jurisdiction in particular cases.</P>
    <P>I would also appreciate it if the Minister would comment on section 8 (3) (a) where a person is referred to as the plaintiff for the purposes of this subsection.  I take it that the reference to that person as a plaintiff is merely for convenience and that, although that reference is made, it is accepted that in all or virtually all cases of prosecutions such as are envisaged in this section, the prosecution will be instituted by the State and not by the person referred to as the plaintiff. Reassurance by the Minister on that point would be appreciated.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated towards the end of his speech that, while legislation in this matter is important, and we believe that the right legislation is very important, ultimately what we are trying to do here is to change the attitude of society.  There is no use fooling ourselves and blinking our eyes to what we all know to be a fact: there is among certain sections of male workers a distinctly hostile and antipathetic attitude to the whole notion of equal pay for women.  This is a fact.  It has been demonstrated in other countries.  It has been demonstrated in this country in the trade union movement in regard to negotiations, for instance, in relation to national pay agreements and in other ways also.  It is not a phenomenon that applies only to this country.  It is a phenomenon that appears to apply to men generally.  Deputy Mrs. Desmond advanced one theory to explain it, namely, the fear of dilution of jobs.  That goes some of the way, but I believe there is more to it than that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2056" /> It is a very deep-seated attitude.  It is tied up in thousands of years of acceptance of the man as the breadwinner. Now one does not reverse attitudes grown up over thousands of years overnight.  There is a failure to recognise the very quick changing character of society both here and in other countries and many of the attitudes valid in a different economic environment are not valid today.  One cannot accept for a moment that legislation, no matter how comprehensive, will overcome all the problems associated&mdash;not just with equal pay for women; that is the priority we are dealing with at the moment&mdash; with the position in society of women not merely as equal to men but as, perhaps, co-equal with men to distinguish the basic fact that the characteristics and requirements of women in society are different from those of men.  That does not mean that women should because of that be inferior to men or treated in an inferior way.</P>
    <P>This whole problem will not be easily overcome and the experience referred to by Deputy Dowling and Deputy Mrs. Desmond, particularly the experience in EEC countries, is not encouraging.  We know that in some of these countries equal pay for women has nominally been in operation for many years.  We also know that in practice this is just not the case.  This has not happened.  This is not happening.  That being so, I revert to a point I made earlier.  We know from experience something of the problems and something of the weapons needed to solve these problems. These are not being dealt with in this measure and we are, therefore, running the risk, unless this Bill is very quickly supplemented with other legislation, of disimproving the position of women.  We should not blind our eyes to that fact.  The Minister should&mdash;I hope he will&mdash;indicate his understanding of this and his intention to deal with it as best he can by bringing in further legislation with the least possible delay, thereby ensuring that any possible damage that could arise as a result of this Bill will be minimised.  If the Minister <Col N="2057" /> can do that I will be much happier about this legislation than I am at the moment.</P>

      <P>I doubt if the Minister could have made the Bill any more limited than it is.  Under section 2 people have to be employed by the same employer in the same employment. This leaves the position wide open.  One cannot escape the conclusion that this is merely a piece of window-dressing.  The Minister would have us believe he has been active in this field.  Actually what he is doing is the minimum possible.  If he did assure us that this will be followed by the necessary comprehensive legislation we would be a good deal happier than we are with this Bill at the moment.</P>
      <P>As far as the Bill goes&mdash;it is not very far&mdash;we welcome it.  Subject to what the Minister has to say in reply to the debate we will consider the attitude we should take on a detailed discussion of the provisions of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue.  I do not blame the present Minister for that.  I am rather amazed at Deputy Colley saying he mentioned this whole matter in his 1972 budget.  I take it he and his Minister for Labour had been discussing anti-discrimination measures against women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were 16 years in Government and in <Col N="2058" /> those 16 years they did very little about some of the things they said they were thinking about.  Now that they are in Opposition we hear a great deal about what they meant to do.</P>
      <P>The mere implementation of this Bill does not, of course, mean that it will cure all the ills where the employment and working conditions of women are concerned.  I agree with Deputy Colley on that.  There is, in this country, a bias against women in employment. It probably stems from the general feeling that a woman's place is in the home and any woman who is not working in the home is somehow less equal.  I can understand the reaction to some extent.  Male employers look on women as cheap labour, slightly inferior to the male employees in their establishment and, because the law was such a woman had no redress if she decided to question her position in her employment; she usually got a week's notice or sometimes less.</P>
      <P>Women put up with this; so, in fact, we are as much to blame as the males in our society.  In the main, I would say, when women began to work first they worked not for the love of it. They had to because of the financial necessities of the family which drove them out to work.  They were glad to accept any kind of pay and conditions. Even though they did the same work as the man in the same establishment, they were glad to accept less.  I have often heard a girl say that such and such a man was leaving her employment establishment and that she was getting his job.  But, if you asked her was she getting his pay, she would say: &ldquo;Oh no; I am getting a few extra pounds a week to do his job!&rdquo;  She was glad to get the few extra pounds a week and accepted it. Therefore, in some cases women themselves were responsible for the conditions in which they worked.</P>
      <P>That is why I am glad to see in the Minister's speech that it will be an offence for an employer to dismiss a woman for seeking equal pay for equal work.  this is a very important thing.  This is, I think, what kept women in the lower paid jobs&mdash;they were afraid to seek or ask for a rise because it meant dismissal.  Under this Bill they will be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> The Labour Court officer is a good innovation also because it will assure women of their rights and ensure that they get them.  Of course, this Bill will not, as has been stated by every other speaker, automatically mean that improved conditions will come about for women.  In fact, in other countries this has not proved so and I imagine that we will run to the same pattern.  But it is a start and for that reason, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I am sure&mdash;at least I hope I am sure &mdash;that the Minister has much more legislation on the stocks for us in this regard.  There are many more areas concerning general conditions of women in employment that should be looked into and I hope will be.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to compliment the Commission which sat and produced such an excellent report&mdash;the Commission on the Status of Women.  It was the first time in this country that anyone made a determined effort to look into the whole position of the status of women because, believe it or not, the status of women does not exist at all.  We are quite definitely classed as second-class citizens, mainly because the male in this country has been recognised as the head of the household, the leader of the little family unit, in all matters supreme, and it was expected that the women should bow to his superiority or supremacy.  I think this has gone in 1974 and I am glad of that fact.  I think it is time the State recognised the fact that it is gone.</P>
    <P>I know this is not the place to discuss the position of women, their legal rights, <i>et cetera;</i> we will get plenty of opportunity to do that on other Bills.  I should like to give a gentle reminder to the Minister that if further legislation on these lines is not forthcoming in the future, he need merely look over his shoulder and he will get plenty of reminders from us here in the back benches.  He will not have to look across the House at Members of the Opposition because we will keep him on his toes.  I should like to compliment him.  I think he is a young Minister who means to do a <Col N="2060" /> lot for this country and, in so doing, he will get our support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputies Dowling and Colley, I welcome the Bill&mdash;not perhaps for what is in it but for the promise of a glorious tomorrow on the road to women's liberation.  I would say to the Minister that I was always taught that one should never be anti anything but rather be pro something&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the title of the Bill is rather intriguing.  The Minister says he is very pro women but the Bill would not convince me of that.  Had the Bill been entitled a Bill for the Improvement of the Status of Women then we could all have joined in a great spirit in it and tried to help the Minister in the further legislation he promises.  The Minister has given a declaration of intent&mdash;that he is going to do something much greater for the equality of women.  I suppose there is a whole tradition of male chauvinism against women.  At least, by speaking this evening the Minister and Deputies on this side of the House, and on the far side too, will show the women that we are no male chauvinists, that we think of them in a kindly, constructive way and that we do hope to improve their status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said this Bill is all about pay and that is true.  He has said also, of course, that you cannot legislate against an attitude.  That is quite true.  the Bill, in itself, will not help women all that much or effect a completely comprehensive scheme of equal pay for equal work.  As is known, in many industries&mdash;in the commercial world&mdash;the very fact of a woman having to be given equal pay with a man may well mean that she will not be so readily employed in the first place.  There are reasons for this. A man, if he is to be employed, will probably remain in that employment all his life whether or not he marries. On the other hand, many women leave employment and marry.  Therefore an employer may well say he will take the male applicant rather than <Col N="2061" /> the female.  I do not think this Bill will help at the initial stage when a woman seeks employment.  But it will help to some degree afterwards to ensure that she is not exploited by an employer who wants cheap labour.</P>
    <P>I suppose this Bill has a moral basis inasmuch as we must do everything possible to ensure that an unscrupulous employer for the sake of making money will not employ cheap labour, whether female or male&mdash;generally it will be female because of the whole state of the world.  Writers such as Tom Payne wrote about the rights of man but I do not think they were all that concerned about the rights of women.  Therefore the Minister has that handicap; he has to try and conquer in a world which from the beginning of time has been male dominated.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I think the Minister could have made a much better attempt in his first legislation on equal pay for equal work.  He admitted that the national pay agreements had brought about the position of women having equal pay for equal work.  I know of one firm where already some of the women have equal pay.  Of course we can always show that in the House here we have equal pay for male and female Deputies.  Therefore, we do set an example.  But, on this matter of setting examples, I would direct the Minister's attention to the Civil Service where we have what are known as temporary clerks or temporary female assistants.  Even though the last pay agreement had written into it a clause which would help these women gain equality in the Civil Service, this is not being implemented. I would ask the Minister to initiate an investigation into the Civil Service in order to ensure that no female clerk will be exploited or will suffer, not because of her sex but because of the fact that she is a temporary employee only.  Let us, for heaven's sake, try to set a good headline in State employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister might as well say he inherited this, and of course he did. But, in 1974, let us take appropriate action to show we are not being completely hypocritical.  We may criticise <Col N="2062" /> the private employer, the outside employer, who may exploit female labour.  However, judging by correspondence received&mdash;I have a question down on this matter at the moment&mdash; we have in the Civil Service some women who are being exploited perhaps on two counts: first, because they are women and, secondly, because they are temporary employees.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have a new charter for women in the new legislation. There should be a charter for their liberation and I do not mean the hackneyed &ldquo;liberation&rdquo; which we have seen in recent years.  The Minister should bring in legislation which will stand as a monument to him and will show that in 1974 we saw women in their true role and by our legislation ensured that if a woman decided to go into business or commerce or to stay at home she would not be exploited by employers or by society which should regard the role of wife and mother as the greatest role a woman can play.  The whole scene should be examined.  I support the Bill wholeheartedly in so far as it goes to ensure that a typist, a clerk, an architect or an engineer will not be exploited by an employer in order to cut down costs.</P>
    <P>If a single woman leaves her employment to look after an ageing parent we give her a mere pittance and yet we talk about equal pay for work of equal value.  Some people sacrifice themselves to look after ailing relatives.  In a short Bill like this it is hardly possible to deal with all aspects of the problem and to ensure that we give women their rightful place in our society.  If a business only exists because it can meet competition by employing cheap female labour there is something wrong with that business and it should not be in existence.  One sees girls going into factories in the mornings while young men are unemployed. In the shirt-making industry in the North of Ireland women were employed in their thousands while the men stood at the corners unemployed. If there had been legislation there similar to the Bill before the House it might have staved off some of the <Col N="2063" /> holocaust which engulfed the North eventually.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to examine all aspects of women's employment and to bring in legislation to remove the injustices and grievances and to set a course for a better-balanced society. Deputy Colley mentioned that this seemed to be stop-gap legislation and that the Bill has been brought in to appease the demands for the time being for further liberation, although I would not call it &ldquo;liberation&rdquo; but exaltation.  We must exalt the role of women in our society by seeing that they have equal rights with male workers and that suitable legislation is brought in, has teeth and can be enforced.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which an employer can get around this Bill when it becomes an Act.  I am not criticising the Minister's draft.  No matter what legislation is brought in it can be circumvented by employers, some of whom are used to this sort of action.  It will be seen from the Bill that it will be easy not to grant women equal pay with men.  The Bill says that the women must be employed by the same firm in the same place as the men.  Could the Minister ensure that the job will be evaluated on a categorical basis, that there will be certain categories of workers doing certain categories of jobs, and that the law will lay down that the worker is entitled to equal pay whether that worker is male or female?</P>
    <P>If there were a woman's charter there should be no trouble getting equal pay for women whether they are architects or engineers or in other professions.  A girl with a leaving certificate should be paid the same salary as a boy with that certificate. Many clerks have intermediate certificate. Many older people may not have either certificate.  Grades should be designated on a certain broad basis and it should be laid down that a man or woman doing the same work is to be paid the same wage.  Thanks to the trade unions it has been established in some cases that the pay for a particular job is £x per week.</P>
    <P>There will be a lot of trouble with the equal pay officers coming into <Col N="2064" /> offices and factories looking for injustices. The factory inspectors have an important job to do in ensuring that the employer has machinery well safeguarded in order to prevent employees being injured.  In this case the officers will not be dealing with machinery but with salaries and wages.  The work will be tremendous. The officers concerned will have to examine each individual case.  Between now and the Committee Stage the Minister should see whether the categories of workers could be defined.  He must ensure that women who enter business will know beforehand that they will automatically have equal pay.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking about clerks. Differences can arise easily in their pay.  Professional men and women should not have much trouble getting the same rates.  The category of clerical worker can be very wide and employers are not used to paying females the same rates as males and they may try to circumvent this Bill.</P>
    <P>No matter what legislation is brought in here it cannot be 100 per cent watertight but it should be made as watertight as possible, first of all, to discourage employers from thinking they would get away with the exploitation of female labour in 1974. However, human nature being what it is we still have employers&mdash;they were there in the time of Dickens&mdash; who may be in the minority but who nevertheless, as a minority in the labour market, could cause a great deal of trouble.  A very small strike may suddenly expand and engulf a whole industry.  Therefore, unless we make this legislation as watertight as possible we shall not be able to stop the Bill from doing a certain amount of harm.  It may well be that the abuse of anything is no condemnation of it, and the abuse of this Bill would not be a condemnation of the Bill but a condemnation of the legislators who did not take sufficient time to examine its weakness and draft a proper piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been looked forward to very avidly by the women of our country, and especially those who are engaged in industry or commerce.  I <Col N="2065" /> think they will find it rather disappointing that we cannot do more for them.  We know that in other countries legislation has not safeguarded women from exploitation, and we must admit that it never will. What we must do is build up the goodwill of the employers and say that the State expects them to act honorably in this matter, that the prosecution entailed in the Bill is secondary.  It is time to build on sound foundations, one of those foundations being, of course, that there will be no injustice to women who elect or, indeed, are forced to go out to earn a living or to secure a profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister will, I am sure, when replying, be able to tell us why he did not bring forward a more comprehensive measure.  I have not yet seen the reaction of the women's organisations and, no doubt, for other Stages we must be guided by this.  I am not saying we would allow ourselves to be guided by all organisations who purport to speak for women, but there are tremendous, long-established women's organisations and I hope they will let their voices be heard before this Bill is enacted.  If they do not, it will be very hard for the mere male to interpret exactly what they want.  I would like to hear what the professional women's organisations, for instance, the Women Workers' Union, suggest we can do in order to improve this Bill.</P>
    <P>While all over the world today we hear the cry of equality for women, we have to ask what we really mean by equality.  It is not just enough to remove a grievance and to ensure that a woman is paid equally well for a job she is doing as well as the man is doing it.  As James Connolly one time wrote about women, they must have been the most forebearing individuals going; otherwise they would have revolted long ago.  He did not mean a military revolution but a revolt against the attitude of men towards women generally.  While the attitude may have become more refined in recent years, it can, on many occasions, be no less cruel than it was 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>We should be able to ensure today <Col N="2066" /> that women are treated equally with men, at least in one respect, that is, that every woman who is doing a job as expertly as a man will not be exploited any further than December, 1975.  Deputy Colley and Deputy Dowling wondered at the long delay and questioned whether it was due to giving employers time to get things properly organised.  Let me pay a tribute to some employers in this city who have already gone over to equal pay for equal work.  The more progressive employers have done this and that is why they are more progressive and why they are making plenty of profit, because they see that any industry which is carrying a number of dissatisfied employees cannot possibly be progressive.  For their own sakes, therefore, employers should think of this and ensure that without compulsion they will implement equal pay and will no longer exploit women.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that women may be disappointed, initially, at the reaction by employers.  Employers may well decide to take on a male employee rather than a female.  I do not know how anyone could prove that an employer had discriminated against a woman because of her sex.  He could say he took the person who suited him most.  There is a story told of people who brought in experts to select female staff.  At the end the experts announced why they chose a particular girl and said they chose the girl with the yellow dress.  I hope the selection of the employers will not be based on such flimsy recommendations as that.  The State must ensure that should an erring employer be tempted to discriminate on grounds of sex some action can be taken against him.  Again, no Bill can provide the answer to this problem. The Department, therefore, should launch a great publicity drive to encourage employers to take the view that in the interests of peace and justice they should ensure there would be no more discrimination on grounds of sex.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the serious decline in farm income which has been aggravated by the enormous increases in farming costs.</P>
      <P>I am moving this motion on behalf of my party, Fianna Fáil.  It is a very serious motion and provides the House with an opportunity of discussing the many serious problems those involved in farming have to face today.  It is hoped that as a result of this discussion the great lack of confidence existing in so many sectors of agriculture will be set aside, that those lacking confidence will be given confidence and those faced with seemingly insurmountable problems will be given the courage to meet these problems and deal with them effectively.  I hope that nothing but good will emanate from this short discussion which we in Fianna Fáil are forcing on the Government by this motion in Private Members' time.</P>
      <P>One must ask oneself whether the Government believe that there has been a serious decline in farm income and that it has been greatly aggravated by the enormous increases in farming costs.  If the Government agree that such is the case they must naturally also agree that a public debate of this nature can be of immense help to all involved.  I believe this three-hour debate will serve its purpose and I suggest that if the Government are serious in their intentions the many elected representatives on all sides of the House who feel they ahve a contribution to make on agriculture under existing circumstances, should have the opportunity of making it and that the adjourned debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries begun last November should be resumed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like it to be clearly understood that this discussion is not a voluntary one so far as the Labour-Fine Gael Government are concerned. It appears we are to be denied a voluntary debate on agriculture until the adjourned debate on the Estimate is <Col N="2068" /> resumed.  I am sure this motion will be regarded by the public at large as one deserving more than three hours. Certainly, people are already beginning to ask why the Government are refusing to have an agricultural discussion in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>In the recent debate on the energy crisis motion&mdash;tabled by Fianna Fáil but amended by Labour and Fine Gael to suit themselves by giving them the right to move it&mdash;many people wondered why nobody on the Government side spoke on agriculture.  Many wondered why the Taoiseach himself did not take part in such a serious debate or, in his absence, why the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries did not become involved.  That motion was certainly looked upon before and after the discussion as the joke of the year but, unfortunately, it was a very sick joke.  It was regarded by the farming community particularly with great suspicion, as just another Coalition gimmick and was further evidence to many of the ostrich-like position of the Government, hiding their heads in the sand hoping everything will right itself in time.</P>
    <P>It was very noticeable that in that recent debate all the speakers from the Labour and Fine Gael benches were from Dublin except the Minister for Transport and Power, who is from Cork city.  This adds further to the genuine belief of many that there is no real feeling of sympathy or understanding for the farming family in the present Coalition Government and that it is an urban minded, trade union dominated Administration.  Many believe the Government are totally unaware that 80 per cent of our farmers are engaged in a grinding struggle to win a livelihood from small farms which are barely economic.  Many believe that Labour and Fine Gael are not dedicating themselves to fighting the case of the Irish small farmer in the EEC councils or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>One can discuss the fall in farmers' income under two headings.  There is the rising cost of necessary farm inputs such as feedingstuff, fertilisers, agro-chemicals like sprays, insecticides, herbicides, fuel and oil, agricultural <Col N="2069" /> machinery and spares and packaged materials and farm buildings. As well as the exorbitant price of these inputs there is the greater concern of guaranteeing adequate supplies of them.  If the manner in which the Government have handled the shortage of oil in recent times is any guide, God help the farmers if other inputs are placed on the same scarce footing.  Because of the vast increases in farm production costs, especially of purchased or bought in feed, the continued expansion of Irish agriculture is in jeopardy.  One must look at the reduced returns from the market as well as the more expensive inputs.  One has reduced returns on the outputs or products.  This is particularly true in regard to cattle and pigs.  The price of Irish bacon on the UK market was recently reduced by £50 per ton.  At present the Irish farmer is in a vicious circle of increased costs and reduced returns.</P>
    <P>We are in a time of tremendous world uncertainty in regard to food production and supplies and it therefore behoves Irish agriculture to take every precaution to maintain growth.  This will entail guaranteeing supplies of essential inputs, facilitating necessary farming investment, processing into a diversified product range and obtaining markets for products at most remunerative prices.  The increases in farming costs have given rise to extreme dissatisfaction and grave worry. There has been an alarming and unprecedented increase in the cost of essential farm inputs in recent months and while this development is related to across-the-board inflation in national economies it has been compounded as we know by international shortages in essential agricultural inputs, especially animal feedingstuffs and the energy crisis resulting in reduced availability of oil-dependent fertilisers.</P>
    <P>We have had frightening and staggering increases in the fertiliser area, up to 40 per cent on compound fertilisers starting right now.  The price of the 16 per cent superphosphate is up by 80 to 100 per cent.  I see that Nítrigin Éireann have been given permission to increase the price of the <Col N="2070" /> nitrogenous CAN by 26 per cent and ammonia by 33 per cent.  When the Minister is contributing to this debate I should be grateful, as many Deputies would be, if he would let us know what he and the Government did about the stockpiling which many allege took place before the increased prices were announced.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that the Minister and the Government are on record as denying that any stockpiling took place.  Now, I gather there is an about-turn on their part and they say they are having an investigation or inquiry into the allegations being made.  In that context I am sure the Minister will agree that the method of selling fertilisers calls for very serious examination right now if he is at all perturbed by charges of stockpiling until prices were increased. Sales of fertilisers are continuing on the basis that the price to be charged will be that ruling on the date of delivery.</P>
    <P>The Government allowed the decontrolling of the prices of animal feeds.  This resulted in sharp increases in the price of compounds by some manufacturers.  One of the biggest manufacturers, whom everybody knows, is charging twice as much as some of the other co-ops.  This has resulted in consternation in the market.  What are the Government doing about this situation?  What are they doing about maize which is currently costing about £70 a ton from the silo?  What did this maize cost before going into the silo?  Is the Minister satisfied that a fair margin of profit was made in this instance? What is the Minister doing about the merchants and middlemen who are at present selling beet pulp at £80 a ton, the same beet pulp which they bought for around £18 a ton?  What has the Minister to say about the margin of profit which is being made here?  What has the Minister done about the identification necessary to distinguish between fertilisers manufactured from raw materials not subject to price increases and those which are?  The manufacturers when asked said there were technical difficulties involved in their factories.  Does the Minister know what these technical difficulties <Col N="2071" /> are?  If he does, will he please let us know?</P>
    <P>The Minister is on record as saying, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> dated 2nd February, that the Irish fertiliser industry would help farmers by absorbing as much of the cost increases caused by the oil crisis as the industry could bear in the present circumstances. What is he doing about that?  Is he doing anything about cheap imports, either by waiving import duties, issuing duty free licences or giving a special fertiliser subsidy to cushion the farmer against higher costs?  In terms of advising farmers not to cut down in nitrogen application it is noteworthy to note that the State-owned Nitrigin Éireann were allowed a 26 per cent increase in their fertiliser CAN.</P>
    <P>People are very anxious to know what will be done about the increased cost in feedingstuffs and the deleterious effects on pig and poultry production where 80 per cent of the cost is due to feeding.  Those directly involved, especially those small farmers who have in the past depended on the income from their efforts at pig and poultry production to see them through, want to know what their future will be.  The question to be asked and answered now is: what are the Government doing or what can they do to protect our pig and poultry industries?  In 1973 these industries contributed to the national economic out-turn.  Any adverse effect on these two closely associated industries is of major national significance.</P>
    <P>According to statistics recently released, the first ominous signs of a serious decline in pig production can be seen.  The number of pigs received at bacon factories shows a drop of 217,903 or almost 10 per cent of the 2,196,526 pigs sent to the bacon factories since 1972.  There has been a dramatic increase in the number of sows slaughtered in our bacon factories in recent times.  The number of sows slaughtered in the latter part of January was more than double those slaughtered at the same time last year.  This is positive proof that <Col N="2072" /> the recent large increases in the cost of feedingstuffs are beginning to have their effect.  What will the trend be for the remainder of 1974?  What steps will be taken by the Government to prevent the pig and poultry industries from being wiped out completely? The man who wants to know most, as I have already said, is the small farmer who is dependent on his income from these industries.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Minister recently admitted, as a result of many questions in the House from members of my party, that a difficult situation for our pig industry has developed over recent weeks.  This was due, on the one hand, to the rise in the feed prices and, on the other, to the downward fluctuations in pig meat prices on our main export market. Commenting on what the Minister said, that this difficult situation for our pig industry has developed over recent weeks, I feel that he is being less than honest with us if he expects us to believe that this crisis has only now developed.</P>
    <P>I have been reliably informed by my sources, who might not be as in touch with the day-to-day situation as the Minister's sources should be, that the number of fat sows being slaughtered at present is in the region of 3,300 per week, whereas under normal circumstances there would be between 1,000 and 1,200 sows slaughtered per week.  Up to 50 per cent of the sows being slaughtered at McCairns pig factory in Monaghan are heavy in pig and even live bonhams have been born.  I was told by a person who is involved in pig production that at the present cost of feedingstuffs, a farmer is losing £4.90 or £5 per pig between birth and slaughter.</P>
    <P>In a recent statement the Minister said that the present high prices for feed were worldwide and pig producers in Northern Ireland and Britain had been similarly affected.  He also said that fluctuation in pig prices were to be expected in the freer trade conditions obtaining in the European Economic Community.  The price rise of £13 per ton adds about £3.50 to the cost of producing a bacon pig.  Irish bacon is now £650 a ton at Smithfield <Col N="2073" /> but before Christmas it was in the region of £680.  When dealing with the fluctuations in pig prices the Minister said such fluctuations also occurred last year but that on the whole that year was a profitable one for pig producers.  He said also that in those circumstances it was important for pig producers to stay in the business and refrain from selling off more sows to factories as some appeared to have been doing.  He also said that it should be accepted that periods of reduced profitability must be balanced against these when profits were good.</P>
    <P>I accept that 1973 was a good year for those involved in pig and poultry production.  I have been reliably told that the profits made for 1973 were hardly enough to cover the losses sustained in the month of January, 1974.  The Minister says it is important that pig producers should stay in the business but the smaller farmer involved in pig production has no chance whatsoever of being able to stay in the business and he is already, if not gone out of the business completely, certainly on the way out.  Is the Minister aware that as late as this week we had pig producers in it at a big level saying that they had no option but to stay in the business and their only reason for doing so was a salvage operation for them, an effort to try to salvage as much as possible out of their investment to date.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, as he says, wants us to believe that the recent sales of sows are partly due to current good demand and prices for sows for special markets and for processing, and that they do not necessarily indicate any significant movement out of pig production, then I would like the Minister to enlarge on this statement considerably.  I would like the Minister to give us his comprehensive views as to the percentage of sows being sold to factories for the reasons he states as against the percentage of sows sold to factories, many of them very heavy in young, for the reasons I state.</P>
    <P>I know I am right because the present price of sows is £15 to £16 <Col N="2074" /> per cwt, whereas in January, 1973, fat sows were £15 to £17 per cwt and despite the fact that we have had such staggering increases in feeding stuffs I cannot understand why the Minister says that people are selling sows partly due to the current good demand in prices for them.  This is not so.  Farmers are now getting out of pigs and also out of poultry.</P>
    <P>It costs about 7½ cwt to produce a bacon pig of 190 lbs liveweight and the present cost of feedstuffs alone is more than what the finished bacon is worth.  In normal conditions a pig farmer would be losing £5 per head and if the only advice the Minister can give to farmers is to hang on, to stay in pigs and stick together, it is pretty poor advice to people who cannot possibly carry on in pigs. Unless bacon prices rise or feeding prices fall there will be no export of bacon in a few month's time.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the decontrol of foodstuff prices was a disaster.  At the time two or three months ago there was a demand for an increase of £13 per ton and members of our farming organisations thought, we are told by the Minister, that if decontrol were introduced competition would keep the increase to about £5 per ton but the facts are that practically all the private companies took all the full £13 per ton rise.  Indeed, if one wants to read the recent report of the Occasional Paper No. 11, on the animal feedstuffs industry in Ireland, one will see that the first three or four pages show that a rise was necessary on only two out of four counts and that the rise should have been about £6 per ton and not the £13 per ton which took place.  The co-operatives as we know, took only between £5 and £8 per ton.  According to the first four pages of this report, pig rations varied by as much as £20 to £25 per ton between different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>As we are talking about different parts of the country, I should like the Minister to give us an explanation as to why County Louth has the dearest charges of all.  At present I cannot get my hands on an up-to-date price list of foods but I know that <Col N="2075" /> dried barley from the silos is £65 per ton and that pig rations vary from £70 to £90 per ton, but the co-ops are from £70 to £75 per ton and the best of the private men are about £85 per ton.  If these price ranges are the result of decontrol, it is obvious that this action taken by the Government was nothing other than panic action which has resulted in chaos in the industry, chaos from which it will take a supreme effort to recover.  We will have many who will not be able to stay in the business until things begin to brighten up again.</P>
    <P>The one output sector where falling prices have eroded farmer confidence is that of cattle.  We know that cattle prices have reverted to their normal seasonal low of last winter and that this period of low prices has been greatly aggravated by a scarcity of feedingstuffs due to two reasons.  The first reason is the inflated costs of compound feeds and the second is the very poor quality of hay because of the wet summer, something which I do not blame on the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In our environment it is naturally essential to take every step possible to instil farmer confidence in cattle production, to maintain the 8 per cent growth in cattle numbers we had in the last year.  In this context one can justifiably attack the Government, and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who knew last August that we had a record number of cattle of all ages and also the amount of good quality fodder conserved was less than usual.  Yet, there was a silence from the Minister, and from his Departmental officials as to the action that should be taken to prevent the situation which we now find ourselves in with regard to losing cattle through malnutrition as a result of lack of fodder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is widely reported that there are many deaths of cattle at present and that there will be heavy losses in the next four to six weeks unless our good God is kind to us weatherwise. I should like to hear from the Minister <Col N="2076" /> what statistics are available to him with regard to the situation as it is. I hope the Minister will not be offended if I say to him, and to his officials, that his officials were a little unwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought not to reflect upon officials at all.  The Minister, as head of his Department, is the person responsible and it is not in order to refer to officials or anybody outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, and those who were advising him, were unwise to have rushed in to deny that the deaths of cattle were taking place when these allegations were first made.  They should have kept their options open for what now seems to be an uncertainty.</P>
      <P>The Minister should let us know what the official view is with regard to the prospects of shortages or possibly the rationing of milk for liquid consumption next winter.  Recently the chairman of the National Dairy Council said that the prospects of escalation of the problems of obtaining sufficient supplies of winter milk for liquid consumption was a distinct cause of worry to the dairy industry and that it was most essential that steps should be taken immediately to find a solution to this problem.  I hope that the Minister will tell us what steps are being taken to ensure that there will be a plentiful supply of milk for 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must make this country more self-sufficient in feed grains for a number of reasons.  The current high prices for animal feeds, soya beans at £150 per ton, maize at £70 per ton, feed barley has jumped in price by 50 to 60 per cent in the past few months, is an adequate enough reason for striving towards this goal.  More critical than the high prices is the restricted availability of some traditional imported animal feedingstuffs. Indeed, we well remember the United States placing the embargo on soya beans last summer.  Greater domestic production of feeding grain would <Col N="2077" /> render us independent of international supply and demand fluctuations. In this context one could fairly and justifiably criticise the Minister and the Government for not doing something more positive, far more positive, about exhorting and encouraging Irish farmers to increase their cereal acreage.</P>
    <P>Another farming enterprise about which we need to have greater confidence is also a tillage crop&mdash;sugar beet. The growers are gravely concerned about the future of the industry. Naturally they are worried about the escalation of production costs mainly arising from increases in fertiliser and transport and other inputs.  They are also worried about the absence of a clear-cut policy on the sugar beet A quota.  As I have already said, they are not only worried but annoyed about the fact that the merchant middlemen have made all the money in selling the molassed beet pulp at very high prices&mdash;they have already said up to £80 per ton.  I should like the Minister to inform the House what his intentions are with regard to his responsibility to restore and instil the confidence which is required in the sugar beet area of operations.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister whether it is a fact that, from now on, fertiliser manufacturers need only give two weeks' notice of price increases to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I should like to know whether we can expect, in the immediate or near future, the decontrol of fertiliser prices in the same way as we have had the decontrol of animal feedingstuff prices.  Production costs in agriculture certainly show the impact of inflation, the results of the oil crisis, and the general upward spiral of commodity costs.  The price of compound fertilisers has doubled and the cost of nitrogen has increased by well over 50 per cent.  It is estimated that the cost of production of barley and wheat will increase by 30 per cent and that the cost of production of beet will increase by at least 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The dairy industry, which looked so healthy 12 months ago or so, is also <Col N="2078" /> now caught in the squeeze between declining calf and culled cow prices and increased costs of fertilisers, fuel and all the basic supplies.  As if all these difficulties were not enough, we have added to them the current bank interest rate of 15 per cent.  These are all contributing towards depressed profits in the beef trade and are proving a real discouragement to farmers with development plans.  We know that farmers in other parts of the EEC have problems similar to ours and for that reason we should not allow undue despondency to permeate Irish agriculture.  We must lose no opportunity whatsoever of getting maximum price increases.  We must strive hard for the removal of the EEC difficulties under which we labour.  We must pay much more attention to every detail of production efficiency.</P>
    <P>We believe that the EEC Commission's proposals for agricultural price increases at 7 per cent for the coming year are not enough.  They are certainly not enough to meet the increases in the farmers working and living costs.  We believe that with inflation in Europe probably exceeding 15 per cent farmers have every reason to strive harder to get a better percentage increase for themselves.  In the situation as we find it in the country today we believe that the Government must show considerably more activity in pressing for the removal or at least a modification of monetary compensation payments.  We know that these levies will eventually cripple our big industries, damage beef production and endanger development in dairying.</P>
    <P>The current wave of cost increases clearly indicates to us the grave need for watching our production costs and production efficiency in all aspects of farming.  I believe this applies as much to dairying, which has been having a fairly good time, as to beef production, which needs a thorough re-examination if it is to return to acceptable profits.  We believe that Irish farming could thrive and could overcome the many seeming insurmountable difficulties facing it.  Vigilance <Col N="2079" /> at all levels is the price of success.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few comments in connection with a most unusual practice which has cropped up in this Dáil, a practice which to my knowledge is new and recent, that is, during Private Members' Time an amendment being tabled on the Clár in the name of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  In compliance with Standing Orders, Sir, I am fully aware that this would not have been allowed by your good self if it were a direct negative to the motion on the Order Paper in my name.  If the Minister and the Government want to have a discussion on agriculture we on this side of the House are ready to facilitate them at all times.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I suggested that the adjourned debate on the Estimate for the Department should be resumed immediately.  The many Deputies on all sides of the House who feel they have something important to contribute on agriculture, because of the difficult circumstances in which we find it today, would welcome the Minister if he returned to the House and resumed that debate. It would not then be necessary for the Minister, or those prompting him in his parliamentary parties, to table this amendment which I understand, Sir&mdash;I am open to correction by your good self on this&mdash;denies me the opportunity of having my motion voted on by Members.  This is sharp practice.  I know the Minister would not personally be responsible for this but it is very sharp practice.  If we are to have Private Members' Time&mdash;as we are fully entitled to have it and will have it&mdash;I would respectfully suggest to the Minister and his parties that they should allow Members to introduce their Private Members' Motions, discuss them as best we can from all sides of the House, and then make a decision on them with none of this shilly-shallying and hiding behind amendments.  If the Government are afraid to admit that farming conditions are not as good as they would like them to be, mainly as a result of actions of their own, in some instances, and, as I said before, lack <Col N="2080" /> of action in other instances, then let them hear the charges made against them.  They have the manpower, or the footpower, to walk us into the lobbies and out-vote us.  I do not think the Minister and the parties behind him will gain anything by this shoddy introduction of an amendment to a Private Members' motion.</P>

    <P>Deputy Collins says that last August I knew we had had a bad summer, the hay was bad, fodder was in short supply and there was a big number of cattle.  He wanted to know what I did about it, what advice I gave the farmers.  Mark you, Deputy Collins could not give the farmers a great deal of advice that would not mislead them.  I did not mislead them.  I told them that, if certain things happened, cattle prices would drop by more than £20 a head.  I was publicly attacked for doing that.  I was told it was a wrong thing to do because it might generate panic selling.  That danger is always there.  I believed I had a duty to warn the farmers that if certain things happened this would be the outcome of it.  Unfortunately, I was right.  I could have been wrong.  It is a dangerous thing to make forecasts at this time <Col N="2083" /> and to give advice; everybody who has any experience of farming knows that it is a dangerous exercise.  However, there are times when one has to take a chance in order to assist that section of the community for which one is particularly responsible.  I took that chance.  I fear greatly, from the outcome, that the advice was not taken; in fact, I know it was not taken.  I know many farmers did not sell cattle that were ready to be sold, which they could have sold for at least £18 a cwt.  They kept them until they ate some of the scarce fodder to which Deputy G. Collins referred and then sold them at lower prices.  These are the unfortunate aspects of the business but I think it was just a case where the farmers expected too much.</P>
    <P>While I am on the cattle and beef end of the business, I suppose I had better stay with it for the moment. Everybody knows that farmers lost money if they were depending entirely on beef farming.  Everybody knows the reason and nobody knows it better than Deputy J. Gibbons who intervened a few moments ago.  He knows that farmers paid exceptionally high prices for cattle last spring; some of them paid as much as £26 a cwt.  All I can say is that that was a foolish exercise when the farmers knew that the intervention price for prime cattle was approximately £16 a cwt.  If beef producers want to make sure that they are not going to lose heavily in the future they must have regard to what will be the intervention price at the end of the year when, normally, cattle are going out in large numbers. That is the time we are likely to reach intervention if we are going to reach it at all.  They paid too much for cattle and they kept them too long expecting too much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want that to get the headline, as Deputy J. Gibbons says. The value of farm output rose from £478 million in 1972 to £600 million in 1973.  That is output.  Of course, I am not taking from anything Fianna Fáil did; I know that you do not create instant miracles in agriculture and in farming generally.  I have not detracted from anything that my predecessor in office did; I am not foolish enough.  I am too long in this game to pretend that I can be responsible for any instant results of this kind.</P>
      <P>There are certain things for which I share the credit while not detracting from what my predecessor in office did.  I share the credit with officials who have been wrongly criticised, with everybody concerned in agricultural production from the Minister down to the farmer and from the farmer back through the processor and on to the consumer's plate.  Unless we have the fullest co-operation from and team work with all those people we cannot get maximum benefit for farmers.  Those are the means I try to use to get the maximum benefit at all times.  I am very proud to say, and very happy to feel, that there never was a time in the history of this country when there was a greater measure of co-operation and team work in efforts to improve farmers' positions in Ireland.  To say that we are not concerned about those areas of agriculture that are in some difficulty is utter and absolute nonsense because we have done everything possible to improve the position of farmers in those difficult areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody seems to want to get me away from milk but I have no intention <Col N="2086" /> of so doing because the picture there is too good.  It is right to say that never have they had as good a year as 1973.  They got an increase in milk price of approximately 4½p.  Now, everybody knows it would take ten years of Fianna Fáil in office to get that much of an increase.  One could go back over ten years before one could pick up that sort of money because that is equal to 10p and we all know what the farmers had to do to get a 1p increase in the price of milk in the past.  They had to march; they had to sit on the steps here, there and elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In this unfortunate industry of which we are speaking there was an increase of 35 million <Col N="2087" /> gallons in milk production.  There was an increase in cow numbers of 200,000.  This is the depressed industry that we are moaning and wailing about.  There is nothing to moan or wail about, and prophets of doom will not be listened to because the people in milk production know what they have got; they are delighted with themselves and extremely satisfied.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that in recent times profits are nothing like what they were but milk production has been at its lowest.  In Brussels at present we are talking about additional price increases.  I am hopeful that the outcome this year will be good.  Everything is not in our favour.  We are doing what we can on our part to get as large an increase as we can for the dairy farmers.  I appreciate that liquid milk producers in the Dublin and Cork areas have been affected by the increases in the cost of feeding concentrates. I realise that they will have to be compensated for this.</P>
      <P>When my opponents across the floor of the House are throwing mud at me for my failures and quoting the chairman of the milk board talking about a milk famine and rationing it must be remembered that for 12 months before I came into office there was an application for a price increase for milk producers but they did not get anything.  I had to give them two price increases, one a month after the other&mdash;a total of 5¾p.  I restored the differential that had been gone for a long time.  It should not be pretended that I did nothing for the winter milk producers in the Dublin and Cork areas.  I was very concerned about them.  Their time is coming again, just as the time is coming for increases for people producing milk for processing.  There is no neglect of them.  I would like everybody to know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about anybody who is not doing well in any branch of farming and I am anxious to help him.  With regard to sheep, I defy contradiction that last year was the best year in the history of this country for sheep.  I do not want to be <Col N="2088" /> boasting but I claim a certain amount of credit for keeping the French market open.  I approached this problem on many occasions with the French Minister and in the Council of Ministers in Brussels.  I explained our problems.  We kept the market open and prices were never as good.  It is fair to say that the return from sheep last year increased by about 50 per cent.  That is an enormous increase. The figures are there to show this. I am including in this figure wool prices as well as the prices of lamb and mutton.  This is another area where I think I have done a good deal to destroy the picture which has been painted by the proposer of this motion.</P>
    <P>I am not avoiding the areas which have not done so well.  We will talk about cereals next.  There was a 50 per cent increase in the price of cereals.  Nobody will attempt to deny that.  If anybody does so, I will give figures.  The price of cereals increased by approximately 50 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I will get comment from Deputy J. Gibbons afterwards.  Barley was sold from the combine at £28 per ton in 1972.  It was freely sold at £44 per ton in 1973. The figures speak for themselves. There was a decline in wheat production but an increase in the value of output.  The increase was approximately 20 per cent which is enormous having regard to the fact that output was down substantially.  For the first time in ten years there was an increase in the potato crop.  Prices dropped substantially because the prices in the previous year were outlandishly high.  People went into potato production and over-produced. In case anything went seriously wrong, I put a floor on the price of potatoes and the producers were pleased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming now to pigs and feedingstuffs, I wish to say that the figures for 1973 indicate that it was a year of profit for pig producers, taking the years as a whole.  There were two months in 1973 when the profit was <Col N="2089" /> quite low.  Everyone admits that.  That happened in June and July.  Prices recovered again and it was not until late December that the industry got into trouble.  There were serious price increases, some over-production and difficulties because of the state of the British economy and because we were facing unusual competition on the British market.</P>
    <P>Much comment has been made about feedingstuffs.  It has been said that people were making fantastic profits and the farmers were suffering unfair competition because of feedingstuff prices.  The price of sow and weaner rations in Ireland is £82.80 per ton.  In Northern Ireland the price is £92.05 per ton, while in England the price is £87.13 per ton.  Everybody must admit that we have a substantial advantage in regard to sow and weaner ration prices.  The price for pig-fattening ration per ton is £79.70 here; in Northern Ireland, it is £83.92 and in England £83.71.  These are the actual figures.  We have a substantial advantage here also.</P>
    <P>Speaking about poultry the layers' ration is priced at £86.34 per ton here. In Northern Ireland the price is £84.92.  Again we have an advantage.  While prices are high here&mdash;and we all regret that &mdash;if the people providing feedingstuffs here are making huge profits, what are the profits like in Northern Ireland and in England?  There is a free movement of cereals between all these areas.  There is nothing one can do about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins spoke about the need for us to grow more grain in order to meet our own requirements. I agree with the Deputy on that point. I have said so on numerous occasions. The Deputy blames me for not having more cereals grown last year even though the cereals were in the ground when I took office.  I do not want to blame Deputy J. Gibbons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

      <P>The Deputy did it all himself.  It is foolish for Deputy G. Collins to blame me because we had <Col N="2090" /> not planted more grain in the ground last year.  Neither will I accept the blame this year if the farmers do not do what I suggest to them and sow grain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers should grow more grain.  I never advised farmers to go all out on beef production.  I told them to expand milk production and to grow grain and to increase the grain production.  They should not concentrate on beef alone.  Deputy G. Collins is not justified in what he says about the midland ranchers.  They are indispensable to the small farmers and to the dairy farmers because they take their calves and their stores from them.  I care about all farmers, while Deputy G. Collins pretends he does not care for anybody except the very small farmers.  We must be concerned about the small farmers more than about the bigger farmers.  They need all the help they can get to stay in business, and the more of them that can stay in business the better I will like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we doing about the pig situation?  What we can do is very limited.  As I said, we have feeding stuff prices at the lowest that they can be got.  The Deputy talked about the way it is being decontrolled.  Of course, it must be decontrolled but it was decontrolled after full discussion with the people concerned.  The farmers were brought in and they were asked if they thought it was the right thing to do.  We believe in discussing these things with farmers and asking them what they want.  They felt competition would take over, and to an extent it has taken over, and the co-ops run by farmers have kept their prices down to a minimum.  The increase they brought in was not much more than half what the other merchants added to the price of feedingstuffs There is not much one can do in relation to feedingstuffs because prices are going to be high in any case. We have done and are doing what we can about MCAs.  Remember we are working an agreement that <Col N="2091" /> was negotiated not by me&mdash;and I am not saying my predecessor did a bad job; I think he did a reasonably good job having regard to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If he does, it will mean about £2.50 a pig, and I think it will take farmers out of a loss situation.  I cannot hold out any bright hopes, but I would ask Deputy Collins to try to get away from the insularity of outlook that he has from Abbeyfeale and realise now that we are not a remote island on the perimiter of Europe.  We are part of Europe; we have to do the best we can there, and that is what we are doing.  However, as regards the farmers of this country, I consult them, I discuss their problems with them and at all times I want to do that and to give them the maximum assistance.  I am sorry I have not more time because there are many more things I wanted to deal with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the motion, I wish to protest in the strongest possible way at the failure of the Government to realise the terrible state of farm incomes which have been declining over the past six months or so.  I notice that in his amendment the Minister stated he recognises that there have been cases where individual farmers have suffered losses.  It appears that he is referring mainly to small farmers when he refers to individual farmers. He should realise that the vast bulk of farmers in this country are in the small farm category.  These people must be looked after because they have to specialise in milk, beef or grain; they cannot swing overnight from one item of production into <Col N="2092" /> another.  The Minister referred to the Monaghan by-election but he can rest assured that it was not the small farmers of Monaghan that let Fianna Fáil down.  He must also bear in mind that there is a substantial drop in farm incomes since last November.</P>
      <P>I believe one of the principal reasons why the Government would not allow Private Members' Time a few weeks ago was that the Minister and the Government were afraid to face this particular motion.  The Minister fails to appreciate that many farmers are at present facing disaster because of the complete collapse of the cattle business, the substantial drop in the price of calves, the soaring and uncontrolled cost of feeding stuffs and fodder, and the fact that there is no substantial increase at all in the price of pigs despite the substantial increase in production costs.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt but that all farmers are badly hit by present rising costs and by the drop in prices but the small farmers are hit the hardest of all, and the vast majority of the farmers in the west and the south west of Ireland are in that category. We have seen reports in the newspapers over the past week or so that calves were sold for £3, £5 and up to £10 over the last couple of weeks.  I know a case where calves were up for sale and there was no bid at all for them.  Last year these calves would fetch from £30 to £70 each.  Now cattle are down from £50 to £70 a head from last year's prices.</P>
      <P>The seriousness of the drop in the price of calves is its terrible effect on the smallholder, who depends on the income from calves at this time of the year to buy in fertilisers and seeds and to provide for his family, to pay his rates on buildings and dwellings. He has no other income until he receives his milk cheque in the month of May.  These farmers are generally honest, hard working people.  They do not mind hard work, even hardship if their reward enables them to pay their way and give their family a reasonable education.  This is what they are being denied at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and the Minister <Col N="2093" /> encouraged farmers last year to increase their cattle numbers substantially. At that time no preparation at all was being made for the marketing of the increased number of cattle. This is one of the major reasons for the present slump.</P>
    <P>A very popular scheme, namely, the scheme for subsidising potatoes and seeds in the congested districts, was scrapped this year.  This was really a social assistance service scheme rather than an agricultural support scheme.  This is a serious loss and I would ask the Minister to see whether these people can get some contribution towards the cost of purchasing potatoes and seeds, whether it is done through the public assistance authority or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to state what efforts he is making to get a market for calves at the moment in this country, and what efforts he has made over the past few months to get an export market for calves and for very young cattle.  It is strongly alleged that British farmers are getting about £75 a head for calves in Italy. I would like to hear from the Minister on this matter.  It is also alleged that vast quantities of beef are being imported into the EEC from outside countries.  I believe the Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should have vetoed any decision in Brussels to allow beef into the EEC countries when it was well known during the latter months of 1973 that we were reaching a crisis situation and that we would have a surplus of meat and cattle in stock.</P>
    <P>The Minister should let us know the position.  Farmers' expenses are higher now than ever before.  In order to get top price for milk they must instal new cooling systems and have a very high standard of hygiene in their out-offices. Veterinary charges have gone up and there are many other increases in expenditure in and around the farmyard.  ESB charges have increased considerably and some smallholders regard the additional charges as outrageous. Many living in remoter rural areas suffer considerably as a result of low voltage.  Approaches to the <Col N="2094" /> ESB to remedy the problem have been unsuccessful.  In the interests of these farmers I ask the Minister to see the Minister for Transport and Power and get something done immediately so that these farmers can carry on their business.  In some areas when the milking machine is switched on the television set in the next house cuts out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall refer the Minister to substantial increases in farming costs which took place in the past year.  Incomes have not nearly kept pace with these increases.  Pigs and bonham rations increased in the 12 months from January, 1973, to January, 1974, from £48.60 a ton to £80.83 a ton, over 38 per cent.  The price of dairy ration increased from £57 per ton in the same period to well over £82 per ton, or nearly 44 per cent.  Layers mash increased from £64 per ton to £89 per ton, about 39 per cent.  Turkey mash increased from £65 per ton to approximately £100, well over 50 per cent.  I am reliably informed that a £6 to £10 per ton increase is on the way in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The 26 per cent nitrogen increased from £29 per ton to £42.50, about 48 per cent.  The 0-10-12 increased from £27 per ton to £45, about 66 per cent. The 10-10-20 increased from £39 per ton to £70, about 75 per cent.  This increase, I think, has hit the farmers hardest in the area of fertilisers.  Urea has increased from £36 per ton to £70, almost 100 per cent.  Also, insemination costs are going up by about 50 per cent.  This time last year one calf fetching £60 could buy in a ton of dairy ration while now a farmer must sell four calves to make a similar purchase.  That is a fair comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will take a tremendous effort to restore confidence among the small farmers and ensure that they will continue to produce cattle in the numbers desired.  The Minister should give the House an assurance that every effort will be made to plan marketing arrangements in accordance with the increase in the cattle population and <Col N="2095" /> the number of pigs and farm animals in the country.</P>
    <P>Farmers generally are concerned about the fact that the farm buildings scheme has been scrapped and incorporated in a large scheme under an EEC directive.  I should like to know if this scheme could continue to operate, apart from the EEC scheme.  Payment of water supply grants has been discontinued by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries since 1st February.  These schemes should be continued; they were invaluable to many farmers who could not afford to take part in large schemes such as those envisaged in the directive but who would carry out a fair amount of improvement on their farms over a period in a piecemeal way.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government may be embarrassed as a result of some of their Labour colleagues in the EEC being opposed to the common agricultural policy.  The Minister's hands may be tied in many respects in this manner.  The weakest farmers are the worst hit&mdash;the small farmer. Assistance should be provided in some way right down to the man who is compelled to sell at a substantial loss. This money could be provided out of the Exchequer from the increased VAT the Government is getting in from the daily increasing cost of feedingstuffs and fodder.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to remedy matters in a crisis situation but I can make a few suggestions to the Minister.  First the ACC and the banks should be asked to help farmers.  Local authorities should be asked to get rate collectors to go easy on farmers for the present.  The Minister should ask his colleague the Minister for Health and Social Welfare to get the health boards to restore to small farmers the medical cards of which they were deprived early last year.  This would be of tremendous benefit.  The same Minister should be asked to ensure that social welfare officers would not harrass small farmers in receipt of the land dole because it is well-known that their incomes are now so low that the dole should be substantially increased if they are to stay on the land at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2096" /> The Minister should find some way, by public assistance or otherwise, to subsidise fertilisers and manures.  This is vital.  This year it will be impossible for many farmers to manure their land properly and grow grass in the way it was done last year.  Some subsidy or some assistance should be provided in respect of fertilisers and manure.  Credit should be made freely available, interest free, from whatever source to enable small-holders to retain their calves and young cattle.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was speaking about the status of women generally and pointing out that this Bill, if enacted, would help to raise that status.  In the early part of this century James Connolly wrote of women that &ldquo;in Ireland female workers had hitherto exhibited in her martyrdom an almost damnable patience&rdquo;.  That was long before women had any right to work, except in the sweet factories of Ireland or Europe.  Irish women still show a damnable patience in some things.  I am referring mostly to the housewife and mother who has seen many <i>avant garde</i> movements for the so-called liberation of women.  They have not done very much to raise the standard for the housewife and mother who stayed at home from choice or because of family cares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation must ensure that while we stop the exploitation of women in industry and commerce we do not allow exploitation in the homes. Industry needs women today and encourages them in various ways to go back to work in the factory and the office.  One can appreciate that this can happen when we are short of skilled personnel.  This could be an indictment of our training system in trades and industries.  On the one hand we have many untrained workers and on the other a great shortage of workers.  In our crazy way of doing things, we go to the homes and take the mother from her children to work <Col N="2097" /> the machine in the factory or thump some typewriter.  That is all wrong.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister in his promised legislation will go so far as to say that the State will pay women who stay at home and look after their families properly.  A decision was taken in the EEC about the rights and status of women.  Results are expected by June next.  Have we done our part to ensure that our legislation will be of the same standard as that of the EEC countries?  In a trade union information sheet issued by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in April, 1973, it was said that the EEC advocated the setting up in member states of national committees on women's employment problems and a permanent committee to assist the commission in co-ordination at Community level.  This committee would report by 30th June, 1974, with suggestions for improvement in such matters as access to employment, promotion, training and retraining, paid maternity leave, child care facilities, flexibility in hours of work and social security provisions.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, a very full programme has been laid out.  This may be an indictment of the standards for women in those countries, but I doubt it.  It sets a headline which we must aim for in our legislation.  We must legislate for the minority if we are to achieve the common good.  In recent times we have been allowing ourselves to look after a minority in employment.  Yet we have ignored the majority of women who do not seek liberation but who want to feel free to serve their husbands and children better.  They want to be moved from the poverty line and live as dignified human beings.  The State must ensure that no mother must leave her home and go into industry unless she wishes to do so.  If the State does not legislate for this, it is failing in its duty.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>Subject to this Act, it shall be a term of the contract under which a woman is employed in any place of employment that she shall be entitled to the same rate of remuneration as a man who is employed <Col N="2098" /> in that place and by the same employer if both are employed on like work.</P>
    <P>This is discrimination.  The difference between the sexes is being emphasised. It should be amended to say that equal pay will be given for equal work. Section 2 (2) says:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Act shall prevent an employer from paying to his employees who are employed on like work in the same place of employment different rates of remuneration on grounds other than sex.</P>
    <P>Again there is discrimination there. Are we putting the idea into the employer's mind: &ldquo;I do not want to take on women&mdash;or men&mdash;so I will use some other grounds to discriminate against them.&rdquo;  Therefore in my view those two sections should be amended.  They are ambiguous and clumsy as they stand.  Section 10 reads:</P>
    <P>...shall be construed as applying equally, in a case converse to that referred to in those sections&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, section 2&mdash;</P>
    <P>to a man in relation to his remuneration relative to that of a woman.</P>
    <P>That is even hard to read.  Emphasis should be laid on equal pay for equal work.  A female chauvinist may insist that this be left in but I can see no reason for it.  I do not know of equal work being done by both sexes where a man would be discriminated against on grounds of sex.  The Bill could be tidied up by the amendment of sections 2 and 10.</P>
    <P>Section 2 states:</P>
    <P>Subject to this Act, it shall be a term of the contract&mdash;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister envisage in this regard a contract in the strict sense of the word or the term loosely that when a person accepts employment he is making a contract which is sacrosanct, which cannot be broken without breaking the law?  Does he envisage at some stage that each worker would have a binding contract which both sides might find irksome at times?  The Minister should endeavour <Col N="2099" /> to tidy up the subsections of section 2.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill not because of what is in it but because it promises something more in later legislation. Those who have been pressing for some action on equal pay may be helped by this Bill.  I should like to pay tribute to the employers who have implemented equal pay for equal work and to state that the Minister, and the Government, should put their own house in order before they start lecturing private employers. They should make sure that the temporary clerks in the Civil Service receive pay and conditions equal to those on the permanent staff.  Apart from the fact that women are affected because of the present system which does not provide for equal pay, some of them are also affected because they are in temporary employment.  The State should set a good example in pay scales and conditions of employment. If they did so they would then be in a better position to face the employers, pointing out to them that the headline had been set and they should not drag their heels.</P>
    <P>As long as there are people in the Civil Service who are suffering because they are female or temporary something should be done to rectify the matter.  There was provision under the last national pay agreement to help these people.  Women who also need help are those who sacrifice their jobs to look after aged parents or relatives.  We should think of these women before career women although some career women take a career not out of choice but because of compulsion or economic circumstances. I hope I have contributed something in the effort to improve this piece of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for bringing this piece of legislation forward particularly in view of the fact that he is in office for less than one year.  Earlier we heard Deputies on the opposite side of the House describe this as a bit of window-dressing.  I refer to Deputy Colley in particular.  The question <Col N="2100" /> of equal pay for equal work for women arose out of the interim report on the status of women which was issued in 1970.  In the budget of 1972 Deputy Colley mentioned it as a &ldquo;national objective&rdquo;.  At that time he stated that it was not to come into being until 1977 but this Government have brought it forward to 1975.  I would dispute any window-dressing here.</P>
      <P>This Bill highlights the attitude of the present Government towards the social issues which we have to deal with.  Deputies have spoken of what is not in the Bill and what the Minister should introduce in the future but this Bill gives women the right to equal pay for equal work.  This has been spoken about for a long number of years.  Deputy Dowling told us that this operated in continental countries for many years but his party were in Government for 16 years and did precious little about it.  We are only in Government one year and it is becoming a reality.</P>
      <P>The Bill may have deficiencies but it is the first step along the right road. This is the one issue which was causing problems and concern.  It was the one which was spoken most about. Women were doing the very same job as men but were receiving less remuneration for it.  When one thinks about it, it is hard to see why it happened or was allowed to go on for so long.  One could say there are historical reasons for this&mdash;the fact that the Industrial Revolution began a whole new era rather quickly and that the trade union movement tended to look after the aims of men, because it was usual that men controlled the trade union movements.  The evolution has now taken place and we now have this worthwhile Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy with the Bill because it does away with a situation about which we have all been speaking for a number of years.  Some of those speakers on the Opposition side stated that we were giving the employers a considerable amount of time to alter the status and conditions of women, to run down their job so that they would not have to give them equal pay, but I think they have a low <Col N="2101" /> opinion of women workers.  The female worker is contributing in a worthwhile way to the economy and is doing a first class and efficient job. No employer concerned about his own position and business will attempt to do this because he would have a disgruntled staff on his hands.  We all know that a disgruntled staff is of little use to anybody.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that there is such a thing in this country as organised labour.  Apart from this Bill at all the organised unions and organised labour will see that there is no wrong done to anybody. They will ensure that the terms of this Bill are enforced and operated. I have no doubt that the employers will welcome it because the cheap labour situation tends to militate against productivity.  Those operating cheap labour seldom think in terms of updating their equipment or retraining their staff but when it becomes a high cost situation employers tend to look at the productivity side of it.  When they look at the productivity side there will be no question of this costing a vast sum of money, as some employers might lead us to think.  Some of them will obviously have to rethink their situation and update their equipment.  They will also have to rethink their organisation to maximise the efficiency of their staff.</P>
    <P>This is good for our economy and it is important that we do this. Another reason I am happy with this Bill is because our partners in the EEC have adopted a similar measure. Luxembourg are in the process of adopting it.  We would be accused of formulating some form of cheap labour policy here if we did not do the same thing.  Now we can stand beside our partners as equals in this matter and show that we are not second rate, that we are not second leaders but that we are up to standard.</P>
    <P>I hope that when we are recruiting the equal pay officers we will be very careful about the type of people we select whether they are male or female.  We must ensure that they are concerned with the welfare of people and that they are not just bureaucrats. <Col N="2102" /> This is a job which will require a very delicate touch and great concern for people.  I wonder will these inspectors have the right to go into a firm without being invited&mdash;I believe they should&mdash;to have a look around.  This Bill provides that employees who look for equal pay cannot be sacked, but there is always the element of fear that they might be sacked even though the legislation says they will not be sacked or, if they are, the courts will protect their rights.  You cannot legislate against fear.  It is important that these equal pay officers should be able to make periodic examinations and checks to ensure that the Bill is being implemented and that the concept of equal pay is being operated.</P>
    <P>I believe the Bill will operate very well.  Some people say that on the Continent the principle does not operate all that well but I believe because of our high trade union labour content here it will work well. There is no reason why it should not. Some people are fearful of becoming members of trade unions but, apart from this Bill, they should have other means of ensuring that their rights are protected.  Section 9 provides for a fine of £100 on summary conviction. I am always doubtful about these sums of £100 because, when the people go before a judge, they are fined £5 or £10.  We know what has happened under other Acts like the Planning Act.  These sums do not seem to act as a deterrent.  The Minister should ensure that the deterrents are worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The proportion of women in the workforce has been on the increase for a considerable time...</P>
    <P>This is all the more reason why they should have their rights.  Deputy Moore spoke about the rights of married women with families.  That matter should be looked at too but the way to do it is by better social welfare payments and family allowances, as is done on the Continent. In the last budget there was a first step towards this.  We must ensure that the housewife is not just a poorly paid servant but a person of dignity.  The <Col N="2103" /> State recognises this by giving ever-increasing family allowances payable to the wife.  The married woman has dignity.  All that is required is increased social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of discrimination like the age barrier, health, where people live.  Sometimes a person's address counts against him or her.  I have no doubt that the Minister will be looking at these areas.  We all recognise this Bill is a first step to deal with discrimination in our society. We are all anxious to ensure that we make the society we live in as equitable as possible.  By doing that we would remove frustration and this would lead to a more peaceful situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a woman will have the right to the same pay as a man and that a man will have the right to the same pay as a woman.  I suppose it is no harm to write that into the Bill although, in the male-dominated society in which we live, we can well look after ourselves.  I suppose it is no harm to write it into the Bill to show that there is equality of treatment for men and women. When the Bill has settled down it will have the great virtue of bringing more women into industry and into commerce.</P>
    <P>Women felt deterred from going into industry because they felt they could only get so far.  There are very few females on the management side or in the engineer's and architect's professions.  We will now have a greater labour force on our market and a very efficient labour force.  This will have a great effect on our economy. We all know that when women get involved in politics in our own constituencies they put a great effort into anything they put their minds to. When they feel a sense of fair play which this Bill will give them their contribution will lead to great advances in our economy.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister on this Bill.  I was rather surprised by some of the criticisms from the far side of the House.  They were going to bring in this Bill, that Bill and the <Col N="2104" /> other Bill.  The reason they are sitting on that side of the House is that they did not bring them in.  We are bringing them in and, if we continue to bring in this type of legislation, we will remain in Government.  I compliment the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker ended up on the note that they have brought in this Bill now, but just look at what they have brought in and the nomenclature of what they have produced.  This is described as the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974.  The word &ldquo;Pay&rdquo; is contained within brackets.  This presupposes there will be an Anti-Discrimination (Equal Opportunity) Bill, an Anti-Discrimination (Conditions of Employment) Bill, an Anti-Discrimination (Hours of Employment) Bill.  The possibilities are unlimited.  I allege this Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill is a political title, political windowdressing.  Why not call it an Equal Pay Bill?  That would be a simple title.  It would convey what the Bill intends to do.  It would not conjure up in the minds of the public an anticipation of something that does not exist in this Bill.  If this title is followed we will have a whole series of Anti-Discrimination Bills.  I suppose the title sounds nice.  It will give the public the impression that the Coalition Government are doing something that sounds good.  It would not do, of course, to call it an Equal Pay Bill. All this reminds me of the series of pictures &ldquo;Doctor in the House&rdquo;, &ldquo;Doctor at Sea&rdquo;, and so on.</P>
      <P>Is &ldquo;pay&rdquo; the appropriate word in the title of this Bill?  Will the Bill apply to salaries?  Will it apply to wages?  Will it apply to remuneration? Remuneration can include other items apart from pay.  On page 2 a number of words are explained: &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Labour; &ldquo;the Court&rdquo; means the Labour Court; &ldquo;collective agreement&rdquo; means an agreement relating to terms, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no definition of &ldquo;pay&rdquo;. In the world of today the actual pounds and pence are not everything. Employers who look after their employees <Col N="2105" /> go further than just the pounds and the pence.  That is why I register certain protests where the title of the Bill is concerned.  It may be possible to amend the title.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should look forward to a future littered with Anti-Discrimination Bills with a, b, c, d, x, y, z in brackets.  Is there any provision in the Bill paywise, salarywise, remunerationwise, wageswise for industries, occupations and employments in which women only are employed?  There could be discrimination in these because there is no comparable employment.  There are several occupations in which all female labour is employed.  Will this Bill be of any benefit in such occupations?</P>
    <P>Doubtless this is a Bill on which we can get more information on Committee Stage, but there are certain questions which come to mind and I should like to hear the Minister on these.  In that part of Donegal from which I come we have a fair number of shirt factories employing almost 100 per cent female labour.  Is there any guarantee that that percentage will not be discriminated against?  Is there any guarantee that it will be safeguarded?</P>
    <P>This Bill does not safeguard the employment of women.  This is a weakness in the Bill.  We may have subsequent Bills safeguarding employment. This Bill certainly does not do that.  It would be interesting to find out after this Bill has been in operation for six months or so, whether the same percentage of female employment continues.  Is the Minister not putting the cart before the horse here?  Would it not be wiser to bring in first a Bill designed to safeguard the numbers of women in industrial employment.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the problems this Bill may create.  He is not seeking in this measure to prevent a drop in the number of women employed.  This could very well happen.  I have not studied the Bill in great depth but nowhere has the Minister taken any steps to safeguard the employment of women.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2106" /> In section 2 there is the following provision:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Act shall prevent an employer from paying to his employees who are employed on like work in the same place of employment different rates of remuneration on grounds other than sex.</P>
    <P>Was it necessary to put that in?  Does this not point to a loophole in the whole operation of this?  In other words, does not subsection (2) say you must pay equal remuneration to men and women employed on the same work just because they are male and female?  But, at the same time, it says that you can pay different remuneration for like work in the same place for other reasons.  Certainly, that puts bad and sinful thoughts into the minds of employers.  I think it is unnecessary to have this section. Perhaps the Minister can give me a good reason, or a number of good reasons, for having included subsection (2) in section 2.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be a number of reasons, I know.  Is it necessary to say it and why?  Piece work is fairly common in certain industries and I am presuming that pay means remuneration for piece work as well as for hourly, daily or weekly employment.  It does, I am sure, apply to the civil service, teachers, guards, army and so on.  In some of the civil service jobs&mdash;teaching and the other State jobs&mdash;you have married women and single men paid the same salaries. Married men are paid a higher salary. Do I take it that this will make a change?  Will married men and married women be on equal salary and then single men and single women on equal salary?  It does not say so in the Bill.  Will the Bill remedy the discrimination that exists in the case of teachers, civil servants and others where there is a differentiation not alone as between women and men but as between single men and married men and, therefore, a discrimination <Col N="2107" /> as between married women and married men.</P>
      <P>That is most of what I wanted to say at this stage.  These are questions that would be posed normally on a Committee Stage debate.  I shall not take up the time of the House other than asking those questions and hoping that the Minister will give us the answers in his reply.  We should like to know because this is a Bill which may have to be amended fairly extensively.  My main reasons for posing those questions is that I am not happy with the Bill.  It does a tiny part of the work only of establishing equality to women. It is called &ldquo;anti-discrimination&rdquo; to give the public and the country generally the impression that it is the panacea for all the problems of inequality that have existed.  It solves one problem of inequality only; that is the problem of pay.  Without the introduction of another Bill, side by side with, or included in this one, it may be a discrimination rather than an &ldquo;anti-discrimination&rdquo; Bill.  If the Minister gives us some of the answers at this stage, then we will be in a position to decide whether or not it is necessary to improve the Bill by amendments and we shall not know until we get more information on the questions asked and, indeed, on the questions posed by all the speakers on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the feeling in this House is that we all want to see a Bill of this nature enacted.  No matter what walk of life we represent, we are all aware of the fact that there has been a discrimination against the fair sex in employment and in terms and conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the definition section and particularly to the use of the word &ldquo;employed&rdquo;.  Perhaps I might point to a legal matter here.  It is the use of the words &ldquo;contract of service&rdquo;.  It is well known, in courts of law, that there is a very clear distinction between &ldquo;contract of service&rdquo; and &ldquo;contract for service&rdquo;.  Despite the use of words &ldquo;contract personally to execute any work or labour&rdquo;, I could see many employers indulging in devices whereby employees coming in <Col N="2108" /> would find themselves virtually in the position whereby their relationship with their employer would have to be regarded as that of a contractor. I gather that this type of manoeuvre has been made use of in England in recent times for the purposes of avoiding tax.  It worked for some time and I gather that that gap has since been either wholly or partly plugged.  That is why I should like to see, in addition to the words &ldquo;contract of service&rdquo; the words &ldquo;contract for service&rdquo; included in that definition so as to give the definition a wider ambit and close a possible loophole.  The section giving the definition of &ldquo;employed&rdquo; may preclude that difficulty but, to make doubly certain and safe, I should like to see those additional words added.</P>
    <P>The section that concerns me a little here and which I feel could be used also as a loophole in section 8 because, as far as I can see, section 8 is directed only to dealing with cases of dismissal.  There are many other ways in which an employer could get at an employee.  I would be afraid that that section would not give protection to the middle-aged employee. I have found in practice as a lawyer that there are various devices whereby people can be eased out of positions of employment.  They can actually be downgraded without being dismissed.  They can be morally downgraded. A common example is the case of a man who has worked as a senior executive and is seconded to the board of directors of a company, but following a change of management a new board may want to get their man in.  This senior executive may have had a contract of employment, in some cases in writing.  The way it is done with a man in that position&mdash;a man aged about 50 with a lifetime experience and a record of good work, a man who is getting to the stage where he will be retiring&mdash;is to bring in a young fellow, very often little more than a wet-nosed kid, as senior to him.  A man who has been in a responsible position in the firm may find himself merely a side kick to a young, inexperienced man.  The shame is colossal to a man like that.  He has no standing in the firm any longer. <Col N="2109" /> There is only one way out and that is to retire and leave his job.  My personal experience of dealing with these cases in Ireland is that there are far too many of them.  I have seen it happen to lady executives in firms. Very little can be done in those circumstances. If one can anticipate such circumstances arising there is a formula that can be adopted in the drafting of the agreement.</P>
    <P>That is why through you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I want to bring this matter to the notice of the Minister. I am aware of the Minister's intentions.  They are all in favour of employees.  I would hate to see the Minister's good intentions nullified by a manoeuvre such as I have described. In that section of the Bill the use of the word &ldquo;dismiss&rdquo; or &ldquo;dismissal&rdquo; would seem to be a serious defect.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the last speaker in regard to section 2 (2).  One must allow for the fact that the Labour Court when dealing with this legislation must take into consideration the economic circumstances of a company or an employer.  It might be economically and physically impossible for a firm to give full parity to employees. I would hope not, but I could conceive of circumstances where that situation could arise.  It would be most unfortunate if that were the case that the employer could be deemed to have committed a criminal offence for the purposes of steps being taken under section 8.  I do not think that should arise but it might arise in certain cases.  One always has exceptions.</P>
    <P>I should like to see section 8 altered because of the use of the words &ldquo;sole or principal reason for dismissal&rdquo;. This will be rather hard to deal with. Some other formula will have to be thought of.  When looking at the section, the first person that comes to my mind is somebody over the age of 45 who has given long, good service to a firm.  I have dealt with that point sufficiently already.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in implementing the obvious intentions of this Bill.  As the last speaker said, we may have to add to the Bill.  It must be the unanimous view of this House that <Col N="2110" /> every Deputy should do his best to make this a good Bill, one that is worth having, useful, and which will have a real effect on our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has taken a particular interest in the progress of events in regard to women in our society I wish to make a short comment on this legislation.  It is fair to say that the Fianna Fáil Party have concerned themselves with this area of endeavour and have supported at all times the type of legislation the Minister is introducing.  Deputy Dowling, as Opposition spokesman on the Department of Labour, has said that he welcomes this Bill but has reservations about it.  His reservations are shared by all Deputies on this side of the House.  We feel, as has been pointed out by other Deputies, that the title to the Bill should read &ldquo;Equal Pay Bill&rdquo; or &ldquo;Equal Pay (Women) Bill, 1974&rdquo;.  There should be some reference to equal pay in the title of the Bill.</P>
      <P>We accept that by introducing equal pay for women an area of discrimination in society is being brought to a proper end.  Nevertheless the use of the specific title, Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974, leads me to ask: does the Minister think there are other areas of discrimination yet to be dealt with in relation to women?  Will there be other anti-discrimination Bills brought before this House with different words in brackets in the title?  We believe the Minister should have been more specific in regard to the title of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was being given its first public airing through the media we had once more the performance by the publicists of the Coalition.  The propagandists of the Coalition suggested that we would be given a Bill to end all Bills so far as the equality of women is concerned.  What do we find?  The Minister has come into the House with a Bill dealing with a very important area, but it is dealing with one specific area only.  We were treated to a fortnight publicity campaign for this Bill, a campaign in the tradition of the Coalition.  The Government <Col N="2111" /> propaganda services are excellent in this respect.  I have no doubt they are doing a wonderful publicity job for the Coalition by suggesting that something is being done here or there, and that they intend introducing magnificent pieces of legislation. But when it comes to the crunch, when the legislation comes to the floor of the House, we find the Bill deals with only one particular area, that of equal pay for women.  Undoubtedly it is an extremely important and basic provision undoubtedly, a provision which, as Deputy Dowling said, receives the support of Members on this side of the House.  But this Coalition Government, who have suggested there are so many areas in our society where things are wrong, could have included more in relation to this matter of discrimination against the fair sex in our society.</P>
    <P>The report on the status of women by the commission set up by the Fianna Fáil Government was sent to the Minister for Finance in December, 1972.  This report incorporates the material included in the interim report on equal pay submitted in August, 1971, Therefore, there was all this brouhaha in relation to the production of this Bill although the matters on equal pay had been effectively dealt with and accepted by the previous Government arising out of the commission they had set up.  Here we have the Coalition Government indulging in collective back-slapping of one another on this great achievement of theirs.  I do not think they can credit themselves with a great achievement. It is a normal, natural progression that we should have an Equal Pay Bill before us.  As we have said, it is about time it came to the House. Fianna Fáil, unfortunately, did not have the opportunity of bringing it to the House because they were defeated in the last election, but I have no doubt that had they succeeded in the last election they would have brought a Bill to the floor of this House far quicker than the present Administration, the Coalition groupings, have brought this Bill here.</P>
    <P>Almost a year after they came into <Col N="2112" /> power they bring in an Equal Pay Bill to the House which is described as an Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill. We have already given our views on the matter of the Title of the Bill.  I am not quite conversant with the rules of procedure in this House in relation to the matter of setting down an amendment to the Title of the Bill.  I doubt if we can place an amendment to the Title of the Bill, but if it were possible to do so we would consider, I would imagine&mdash; again subject to what our spokesman, Deputy Dowling would say&mdash;an amendment setting out explicitly what the Bill means: Equal Pay (Women) Bill, 1974.  That is what it means.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his rather short speech has said:</P>
    <P>Much remains to be done to eliminate unfair discrimination on the grounds of sex wherever possible and so help to change the prejudiced attitudes which give rise to it.</P>
    <P>This is a clear admission by the Minister that he is not happy with the Bill, that it does not contain what he would like to have it contain.  As the Minister says, in addition to equal pay, much remains to be done.  It is of considerable concern to us on this side of the House that more is not included in the Bill, in view of what the Minister says in his opening statement.  The second paragraph is very interesting:</P>
    <P>It is our objective as an administration to allow women&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>to allow women&mdash;very patronising, very decent of the Coalition Government</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;to play a full part in the life of the State and to eliminate those barriers which prevent them from doing so.</P>
    <P>Any women reading that sentence might say: &ldquo;How dare they?&rdquo;  That the present Government should allow women to play a full part in the life of the State.  The present Government have no entitlement to prevent women from playing a full part in the life of the State.  Of course, women are <Col N="2113" /> entitled as of right to play their full part in the affairs of this country, as equal citizens, with the same opportunities as men have.  Then the Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>This major piece of legislation follows on a number of other measures which have been introduced by this Government.  In this connection I might mention the removal of the marriage bar to employment in the Public Service...</P>
    <P>That was a piece of Fianna Fáil legislation.  This is pretence, a piece of fraudulence on the Government's part to suggest that these are original ideas, that this is original thinking on the part of the Government.</P>

      <P>As my colleague, Deputy Dowling, the spokesman for the Opposition on the Department of Labour, points out, the first Bill was introduced on the 3rd July, 1973.  The Minister said he would circulate a similar type Bill on this topic during the recess.  What did they do?  They withdrew their proposed Bill on the 26th February, 1974.  That is a piece of the gimmickry, the trick of the loopery, whatever you like to call it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of points relating to the Bill which are of concern to this side of the House.  In section 5 (1) it is stated that &ldquo;The Minister, after consultation with the Court and with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, may appoint as equal pay officers of the Court, such and so many persons as he thinks fit and a person so appointed shall be known (and is in this Act referred to) as an equal pay officer.&rdquo; In his reply which I know will be considerably longer and more explicit than a Second Reading speech, the Minister might tell us how these people will be appointed because there has been a tradition on that side of the House built up over the past year of a jobs-for-the-boys syndrome.  How will these people be appointed?  We urge the Minister to make it clear to the House that these people will be appointed through the normal process of the Civil Service Commission and that the Minister himself will not pick out, as has been <Col N="2115" /> traditional with himself and his colleagues, political pals and uplift them from his own or other constituencies.</P>

That is a most unfair attack by the Chair on me.  I should like to have the record straight in that respect.  My reference to officials, if you could describe them as officials, was in regard to my question to the Minister for Justice in relation to the appointment of peace commissioners and I pointed out that since 1st April the present Government have appointed 425 peace commissioners. But in relation to an official or officials or a specific official, the Ceann Comhairle, I imagine, would have an obligation to point out where I made this attack and if he thinks I made an attack I should unreservedly and without qualification withdraw it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am certainly not going to be stifled or censured by the Chair in this regard.  I am entitled to make a reference to the appointment of individuals to various bureaucratic positions.  If they are appointed unfairly we in this House are entitled to point out that they are being appointed unfairly and incorrectly.  That is why I make the point that having regard to the practice by the present Government in relation to a number of appointments in the recent past, since they came into office, I would ask that the Anti-Discrimination Bill and section 5 in particular should be operated fairly.  That concerns the appointment of equal pay officers.  It is my considered view that these people should be appointed through an independent body.  I suggest, with great respect to the Chair and to the Minister, that they be appointed through the Civil Service Commission.  Having dealt with that point and having put on record that at no time did I attempt to or indulge in the unfair and rather mean practice of attacking officials, let me say that my whole point was in regard to the method of appointment of officials.  They are two distinct areas; even the Ceann Comhairle will concede that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 7 (3) a party to a dispute determined by the court under subsection (1) may appeal to the High <Col N="2119" /> Court on a point of law.  While no doubt this is a proper provision the matter of costs has not been dealt with by the Minister.  He might do so in his reply.  Who pays the cost in regard to bringing the matter to court?  Does the normal practice apply by which the losing party pays the cost?  Is that the situation here under this section?</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill.  Our attitude can be summed up in the budget speech by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, in 1972, when he said that the Government accepted in principle equal pay for women and affirm it as a national aim.  Women have been unfairly discriminated against in this society for too long.  This legislation will go part of the way&mdash; and we emphatically stress part of the way&mdash;towards eliminating these very serious areas of discrimination against what is euphemistically known as the weaker sex.  Our view is that women as citizens of this nation are as entitled to equal recognition, equal opportunity and equal pay as men.  I do not think that we as an almost all-male dominated political Assembly should be patting ourselves on the back because this legislation is coming into the House.  It is a natural progression towards an awareness in society that women have equal status.  It is a proper recognition.</P>
    <P>Women, particularly in the area of employment, have been treated as second class citizens.  This may have been for psychological reasons. Women get married after a short time in employment, have families, and their time then is occupied bringing up those families.  When the families are reared and are going out into their own areas of employment, then the employer might take the view that on that basis continuity of employment of women&mdash;which they would look for from a male at any rate&mdash;is not there.  Many women who have gone into a job and gained a very thorough knowledge of it, left, got married, reared a family but now find themselves at a loose end.  It is unfair that a woman with such experience should not have the opportunity to go back to her original or similar place <Col N="2120" /> of employment.  Under this legislation the experience of women will be recognised by equal pay for like work. As the then Minister for Finance said in his budget speech of 1972 this is a proper national aim.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to reflect on the second class status of women throughout the aeons of history, and why they were considered to be the weaker sex.  One can only put that down to an attitude of mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not think that women are the weaker sex?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite the contrary. I am all for equality and recognition of women as equal citizens entitled to be given the same opportunities as men.  We do not want to ask them to do physical work such as on building sites having regard to our natural and innate courtesy to them and the likelihood of their becoming physically injured.  In the normal sense, the young girl works on the conveyor belt or is reading for a degree in social science or architecture.  But can anybody in this House point out where women are not equal to and in some cases better than men?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a number of countries women have been given a special recognition not because they are women but because they are equal, if not better than men and that is in the area of politics.  We have Mrs. Golda Meir in Israel.  India, one of the largest countries in the world, chose Mrs. Nehru as Prime Minister and Ceylon chose Mrs. Bandaranaike.  This answers the Minister's question as to whether I consider women to be the weaker sex.  I do not except in the area of an attitude of man to woman, man's basic courtesy to woman.  One would hold the door open for a woman, one would offer a woman one's seat in the bus if it was full. One would go to the trouble of putting a woman's coat on her shoulder or stand up if a woman comes into male company.  In that way the Minister might appreciate how my thoughts are developing.  If an all-female company were sitting at a table in a room and a man walked in I would not <Col N="2121" /> expect that the women should stand up.  In the reverse situation where men are sitting down and a lady walks in one would expect the men to stand us.  This is a recognition of the special position of and the regard in which we in this society hold women.</P>
    <P>I now come back to the question of women being given equal opportunities in the professions.  Educationally the opportunity is there for women with proven ability.  Women have distinguished themselves in science, art, literature <i>et cetera</i>.  They have been given an educational opportunity to become social scientists, architects and doctors.  Here is the crunch and it comes right through the Commission on the Status of Women which reported to the Minister for Finance, and it does not specifically relate to equal pay, it is on the matter of the reinduction of experienced women into areas of employment after marriage. Some women can, having regard to their circumstances, employ someone to look after their children during the course of the day but it is a tragedy that women who are specialists in their own field, be it a special knowledge of the work floor of a factory or a special knowledge of medicine, having completed their duties to their family do not immediately go back to their place of employment.</P>
    <P>In this respect it is fair to say that society is all the less well off for their not going back and giving the benefit of their experience to society which, after all, did give them the education in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with some interest to the contribution of Deputy Andrews and, quite frankly, I expected more.  It seemed to me that he was articulating quite a lot of propaganda about such matters as propaganda and public relations and allegations of the activity of the present Government in the realm of publicity.  I believe there has been too much carping about the title of this Bill.  One could choose to call it the &ldquo;Equal Pay Bill&rdquo; or &ldquo;Anti-Discrimination Bill&rdquo; but, regardless, <Col N="2122" /> of what one might decide to title a Bill such as this, I do not think a discussion on the title is terribly relevant.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews seemed to be concerned about what he deemed to be the publicists or the propagandists in the present Government.  He seemed to talk about a good publicity job and he seemed to emphasise this question of public relations and the extent to which the Government are articulating their viewpoint and getting their viewpoint across to the general public.  Frankly, it is a train of thought to which we have been much subjected in the last few months relative to many of the initiatives of the present Government.  It is the type of thing that has been thrown up in many other areas of discussion, in the realm of industry, education, lands and agriculture.</P>
      <P>By definition it is a fairly weak thing to say because it might be said by default at not having a great deal else to say.  It might also be said from an inferiority point of view in the sense that one might be very conscious of the fact that the Government was very effective in the constructive use of public relations and in getting the message across to the people of this country through the organs for which it has responsibility and through the men it has in Government as Ministers of State in different areas.  I do not see this as a reason for being critical of a Government.</P>

    <P>It is possible, if we wish to become political about this issue, that the Government has been seen to do fairly well in this area possibly because of the fact that the Opposition has not been altogether as bright in this particular activity as the present Government.  If as a Government we have been bright in that particular area it is more to our credit.  Government is about communication, it is about articulating views, it is about getting the viewpoint of the Government across to the people of this country.  At the only political contest that took place since the election of this Dáil it seemed that the people in that particular constituency were <Col N="2123" /> responsive to what the Government has done.</P>
    <P>The Opposition, just as we are, are responsive to people and possibly the people will at some time in the future have the opportunity of passing judgment again.  We will welcome that.  Deputy Andrews referred to the fact that the Minister, in introducing this Bill, introduced it as merely one specific item and said that this was not good enough.</P>

      <P>It is a useful talking point to introduce what I wish to say. In one breath Deputy Andrews talked about the fact that the Minister was only introducing one specific and in the next breath his principal complaint was that the Minister's speech of introduction was to short, a speech of introduction which ran to eight pages about a matter which Deputy Andrews deemed to be one specific item.  It would seem to me that one cannot have one's cake and eat it; one has to settle for one approach or the other.  That is by way of saying that there is not much criticism being offered against this Bill.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, the only objection in detail was on a legalistic point about the High Court situation where costs would be concerned, in the third area of appeal. It seems to me that when one gets down to the precise details, to the nuts and bolts, that is a tiny and fairly inconsequential criticism.  I believe it was mischievous to talk about the question of the employment of the equal pay officers and to suggest that it was the intention of the Government to act in a partisan fashion in relation to such appointments.  It was taken quite out of context and it is not relevant to this discussion.  However, for the record, in the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, we read about <Col N="2124" /> employment of personnel within the Labour Court itself:</P>
      <P>The Minister, after consultation with the Court and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may appoint such officers and servants of the Court as he thinks necessary to assist the Court in the performance of its functions.</P>

      <P>I believe it was mischievous to raise this matter in this manner, especially when we are talking about anti-discrimination.  It has been said that the Minister is merely introducing a specific point.  The issue of equal pay is extremely important and it would seem to be wise to consider such an important subject in isolation so that the full import of what is happening is recognised by the public.  The Minister said he recognises that this is merely one aspect of a particular problem.  He said:</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that this is a Bill to deal with equal pay.  It is a necessary and important step along the road to eliminating discrimination but it covers only a limited though significant area of discrimination and does not in itself ensure equality of opportunity for women.</P>
      <P>He also said:</P>
      <P>This Bill is, therefore, the first of a series of anti-discrimination measures which I propose to bring before the Oireachtas as soon as possible...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He recognises the criticisms that have been made.  His intention is incorporated in his speech.  As a token of the Government's intent it is notable that, while the Commission on the Status of Women in their report recommended 1977 as the year for implementing equal pay, the Government <Col N="2126" /> have decided to arrange for its implementation in December, 1975, two years before the period recommended by the commission.  This is an indication of the importance the Government are placing on this issue.</P>
    <P>There will be certain problems which will have to be taken into account.  The consequences will not entirely concern the Minister for Labour.  He said:</P>
    <P>While the implementation of equal pay will involve additional costs, I do not think that this problem must stand in our way.</P>
    <P>I agree with him completely.  It is fundamental.  Every country in the EEC now has legislation in this area. Possibly the fact that we were relatively under-developed meant that up to this time our emphasis to a great extent was on economic legislation and policies and possibly to a letter extent than other European countries on the area of social policy.  Obviously we are now catching up.</P>
    <P>We will have a problem in the sense that additional costs will be involved. When this legislation takes effect it will create problems, and rightly so, throughout industry, throughout the economy, throughout the services, and in every area of employment in terms of cost.  The Government will have to recognise this fact.</P>

      <P>From studying the Minister's speech one gathers that he really did not have as much to say as one would have thought.  Having regard to the length of time it has taken for this Bill to come before the House one would have thought he would have had considerably more to say.  Let there be no mistake about this.  Fianna Fáil have always been to the forefront for equal rights for women.  This is indicated by the fact that in the 1972 national wage agreement in the Minister's speech at the time, a step was taken towards the implementation of equal pay for women.  The Labour Party were not always in favour of equal pay for women and, in fact, created somewhat of a fuss at the suggestion that married women should engage in employment some years ago but that seems to be forgotten by them now.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has been waiting with great curiousity to hear what I have to quote at him.  This shows how certain people change as the years go by because any time Fianna Fáil tried to take another step forward and give equal rights to women they were thwarted in their efforts.</P>

      <P Just="Center">JOBLESS WOMEN TEACHERS PROTEST.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A barrage of questions is expected in the Dáil when it assembles.  They will be fired at the Minister for Education on behalf of newly qualified jobless school teachers mainly from south eastern counties.  They claim they are not able to find work because so many married women in the area have flocked back to teaching since the revocation of the ban on married women on July 1st, 1958. Lifting the ban, Mr. Lynch, Minister for Education, said: &ldquo;This will <Col N="2128" /> make available for service 400 to 500 trained teachers together with the continuation of an increased training programme.  It will mean that gradually all untrained teachers will be replaced by trained ones.  Also it will be possible in time to improve the ratio of teachers to pupils&rdquo;.  His action was severely criticised by Mr. Brendan Corish, T.D. Labour, as a dangerous precedent which might spread to other women working in the State service.  Mr. Corish advocated higher salaries as an incentive to teachers.</P>
    <P>That was the attitude.  When Fianna Fáil were looking after the interests of women they were opposed.  Our policy is well known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of Women was set up by Fianna Fáil.  The proposals in it in the main are supported almost entirely by Fianna Fáil.  We had in the past and we still have a high rate of unemployment. In those circumstances it was recognised that the breadwinner should get first preference.  There is a fast developing situation now in which married women are having to go out to work because of economic necessity. Those of us who revere our Constitution, unlike many on the other side of the House, know that that Constitution lays it down that no woman should be forced to go out to work through economic necessity. That was the ideal we set ourselves in 1937.  Unfortunately in this year, 1974, more and more women are being forced to go out to work through economic necessity.</P>
      <P>As far as women in professions are concerned, there is no restriction that I am aware of on their entering any of the professions.  There may be a bias in certain circumstances towards women, but this has no bearing on legislation because one cannot legislate for emotions.  What the Minister is doing in this Bill is creating a situation in which an emotional bias may be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that the Minister <Col N="2129" /> should clarify certain sections of the Bill, particularly section 2 (2). Frankly this has me puzzled and I should like to have it clarified: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall prevent an employer from paying to his employees where employed on like work in the same place of employment different rates of remuneration on grounds other than sex&rdquo;.  Will the Minister explain that when he comes to reply?  I am sure he will have less difficulty in explaining it than I have in understanding it.  It looks to me like the thin end of the wedge.  In his opening speech he said women tended to be concentrated in the less skilled and lower paid jobs and were poorly represented in management and in the professions.  Women are very well represented in management and in the are even a certain number of women dentists, not a very large number, but that is because dentistry is not a profession that attracts women.</P>
    <P>I think it will be very difficult to decide as to what is discrimination and what is not.  The Minister talks about training people to inquire into disputes.  I believe this kind of thing will have to evolve through experience. I cannot see how training could help.  There may have to be education on certain legal aspects, but not until the Bill has been in operation for some time will it be possible to garner the necessary experience.</P>
    <P>I look forward to further legislation. There are many things with which I should like the Minister to deal.  I should like him to tell us what further legislation he has in mind.  The date is fixed for 31st December, 1975, two years ahead of its time.  The foundation for this was actually laid in the 1972 wage agreement.  It will be interesting to see how successfully this Government will be in getting a similar agreement.  I hope the Government will be able to come in here soon and tell us they have achieved this.</P>

I can see there is a great need to implement many of the recommendations in this pamhplet.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to remind the Minister and his colleagues in the Government that when they try to imply that Fianna Fáil were never as progressive as they in relation to the rights of women to bear in mind the quotation I have given of the Leader of the Labour Party in 1959.</P>

      <P>I am very happy to see this legislation introduced.  Indeed, I am very happy to see any legislation being introduced by the present Administration because it has been very scarce in their first year of office.</P>
      <P>In no circumstances would anybody on the Government benches be able to say that I was silent for 16 years in regard to legislation of this kind.  Throughout several Fianna Fáil administrations and indeed during a period of one previous Coalition Government I raised this question on numerous occasions.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not read the entire ministerial speech but, having read the Bill and explanatory memorandum, I should like to query the Minister and the Government as to whether or not the legislation before us has been fully thought out.  I wonder, particularly in view of the date of <Col N="2131" /> the proposed implementation, whether women, as a sex and as part of the citizenship of this community, will gain as a result of the present apparent haste on behalf of the Minister and the Government.  I can see they will gain in a few trades but there are others in which I do not foresee this happening at all.  Indeed, I can see a situation evolving in which, unless the definition of equal pay for equal work or equal production or whatever may be the term used is clarified, women at present in employment may find themselves out of employment and replaced by their male counterparts.  I remember when I left school, that was just after the war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to want to be facetious.  I am trying to be serious about this matter.  My first position of employment was in my grandfather's shop, a retail hatters and outfitters, a drapery store in Capel Street.  I moved from there to serve my time in the woollen and worsted industry in the Botany Weaving Mills in Cork Street.  I remember that my managing director at that time was approached by social workers, I suppose, regarding some children who found themselves in difficulty with the law, who had gone to an industrial school and had been trained for a trade.  These individuals were in the textile trade, in which I was serving my time.  Two young lads were taken out of this industrial school and put on the looms, which were staffed entirely at that time by women.  The productivity of these two 16 or 17 year olds was much greater than that of the women and they found themselves running the most advanced looms and weaving the most expensive cloth produced by that particular textile mill.  I understand that through the slow process of redundancies, created by people who had retired, died and so on, the general manager of that mill decided to replace those women by men because of the greater productivity of the men. This is a matter which needs a great deal of thought and consideration before we give an out-of-hand approval <Col N="2132" /> to the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>While I am happy that the Minister believes he can fulfil the wishes of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions by bringing forward the implementation date by two years, I am not entirely happy that he has fully considered the various diverse consequences which might arise by bringing this legislation fully into force within such a short period.</P>
      <P>There are some questions I should like to pose to the Minister.  As I have said, I have not had an opportunity to read the full text of the Minister's speech.  Perhaps the point I am about to make has been dealt with in it and if so I will not pursue the point any further.  What is very important for all of us to know is what proposals the Minister has in mind to expand the Labour Court, not just in numbers but with people who are technically proficient, a staff who can really assess the value of equal work or equal production. In England, where the same principles are at present incorporated in their legislation, this question of equal pay for work of equal value has been a sore point over the years.  I do not think that even after their years of experience they have come up with the final solution of definition. Again, I question the date of 1975 mentioned in the Bill.  Have we available in this country the technical staff that should be added to the Labour Court in order adequately to assess this definition?  This definition is probably a lovely catch cry&mdash;it is a good thing to get across to the masses.  But what we must do here is sit down and think very very carefully as to how best we can implement the theory and principle of non-discrimination against people regardless of their sex, colour or creed.  Since the establishment of this State if any of these categories have not got justice from successive Irish Governments I believe that category has been women and in particular working women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income tax is not the subject matter of this Bill.  In case I am asked what I did over the last 16 years I wish to say that I held up a former Minister for Finance in this House for a considerable time on this point.  That Minister was a brother in-law.  I delayed <Col N="2133" /> him discussing the tax imposed on working wives.  I assume this matter is proper to a discussion on the financial proposals of the budget.  Nevertheless, it is discrimination.  Any form of discrimination either in this House or elsewhere will encourage me to express my personal convictions.  I know that will not worry the Minister or members of the United Nations.  But it is the solemn duty of any of us who feel strongly on this point to express our views as clearly and precisely as we can.</P>
    <P>I am aware that certain trade unions are hostile to the employment of women.  For example the union representing the barmen is hostile to the employment of women in bars.  The ITGWU represent workers in hotel bars and they do not share that point of view.  Speaking with some members of the union representing the barmen I have found that they are of the opinion that the fact that our licensed premises are staffed entirely by males has resulted in our public houses being the most efficient and the most well-run in the world.  If this trade union rule is found to be discriminatory when we go to our local lounges we will find long-legged girls in mini-skirts and we will also pay an extra 5p for the drink just to have a look at them.</P>

If we proceed with this haste I would ask whether in certain trades and employments women would be the sufferers instead of the beneficiaries under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Since first elected in 1956 I have been persistent in promoting the interests of non-discrimination against women and against anybody, regardless of class, creed or sex.  I agree that that is repetition.  I have been addressing Deputy Coogan and the Minister until now.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he has done sufficient research and investigation to ensure that industry as a whole can implement the Bill within the period laid down without the risk of creating unemployment for men as well as women.  I have read the comments of representatives of Irish industry in the Federated Union of Employers. They are apparently quite worried as to whether they can absorb the costs involved.  What sort of research has the Minister done?  Is he satisfied that the competitive position of Irish industry will not be challenged or put at risk as a result of his obvious desire to meet the wishes of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one time I was spokesman in this House on the back benches for the Women Workers Union and I hope to be favoured with their confidence again in the future.  While I am most anxious not to be misinterpreted in any way in what I am saying&mdash;I welcome the Bill&mdash;I just want an assurance from the Minister that all the possible consequences of this Bill have been fully thought out. For instance, section 6 says that, in the event of a dispute, the Minister may find himself as a final judge.  I should like to know if the Minister has decided to take this responsibility upon himself while his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, is removing from himself this type of responsibility which, in my view, is undesirable.  I do not think that in matters of this sort any individual Minister can be the final judge because the person who occupies that <Col N="2135" /> seat will change from time to time&mdash; and the way things are going there will probably be a change very shortly.  However, no matter what Minister occupies that seat when the equal pay officer has investigated the case and conveyed his recommendation to the parties concerned and, where appropriate to the Minister, as I read this Bill, if agreement is not reached at this level the Minister has the final say at arbitration.  That is a dangerous thing.  I hope our spokesman for the Department of Labour will consider putting down an amendment in relation to this section.  The women about whom the Minister expresses concern, and indeed the men who might be involved as well, should have the protection of a body of people, not just the Minister on his own.  I am a little nervous about this section, and I should like the Minister to explain why this responsibility should be placed on him.  There is a court of appeal from the Minister:</P>
    <P>A party to a dispute determined by the Labour Court may appeal to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>That is all very fine, but the Minister for Justice, in reply to a question of mine today, told us that the £50,000 which we in this party as an Opposition agreed to and which was provided in the last budget for free legal aid, had not been paid, and held out a threat that it would not be paid unless we passed the Supplementary Estimate which is at present before the House and will not be dealt with, I would imagine, until next Thursday.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, in his wisdom, makes an adjudication and there is an appeal to the High Court who will pay for this?  Is the State going to pay for it or will the individual take the risk of losing some thousands of pounds in making an appeal against the Minister's decision which is thought to be unwise.  It is not determined whether the Minister's decision was wise or unwise.  The point is that the only form of appeal from the Minister's decision is an appeal to the High Court on a point of law and, if <Col N="2136" /> that is lost, I suppose to the Supreme Court.  Like the leader of a certain party not represented here these people may find themselves in financial difficulties because they cannot meet their responsibilities.  That is the end of their employment opportunities and their way of life for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>I would seriously appeal to the Minister to have another look at sections 6 and 7.  While the intention is excellent, the Bill is not as well thought out as I would like it to have been.  Perhaps he could satisfy me in his reply and I can withdraw these objections.  The one thing I am concerned about is that, if this Bill passes the House&mdash;and I think it will; on the general concept of the Bill I do not think we have any objection on this side of the House&mdash;there are the nitty gritty pieces that will have to be worked out on the Committee Stage. I am making this contribution now so that the Minister may consider the points I am making with a view to either explaining the provisions in the Bill if I have misunderstood them or agreeing to amend them if I have understood them correctly.</P>
    <P>There are many concepts throughout the world on the idea of equal pay for equal work.  There are many concepts of what equal work is and on the productivity levels of various workers. This can occur in a factory that entirely employs male workers where one worker can produce more than another.  I came across a case about 12 years ago where I helped to get an unemployed man a job in a private industry constructing wooden boxes. This man constructed at least 50 per cent more wooden boxes than any of the trained workers who were there before him.  The employer was threatened with strike action and was told to fire this man because he was embarrassing the rest of them by forcing them to bring up their productivity. In the end the same worker just cut down on his production, and that idea is not in the best interest of the nation.</P>
    <P>We have been very fortunate in this country that the worst elements of massive trade union opposition to <Col N="2137" /> Government policies have not appeared here.  In recent times we have seen this sort of thing taking place in England.  What we want to get is a clear concept of what equal pay is and what equivalent levels of work may be.  This question has been taken up time and time again in other countries not only in Europe but in the United States, Australia and Canada, and there is no clear definition yet. If the Minister for Labour can define these matters clearly&mdash;with the help of his advisers, of course&mdash;then I would be the first to stand up in this House and congratulate him on doing a job that so many others found impossible.</P>
    <P>There are many different attitudes to this concept of equal pay.  This is a human thing.  For instance, I was talking about the situation in England and about the power of the trade unions and their concepts of equal pay.  Probably the situation that has arisen in England is due to the fact that they were the first industrial exporting nation in the world.  There is no doubt that every worker in industry in England at the time of the Industrial Revolution was exploited. I believe male as well as female workers are exploited now in this country.  The deep tradition of exploitation began well over 100 years ago&mdash;perhaps 200 years ago&mdash;grew in the minds of the English workers and was handed down from generation to generation, as our concept of freedom has been handed down here.  There is still in this country a little anti-boss attitude handed down from the time when it was patriotic not to be cooperative with the employer of 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>Our great problem is to determine how we can expand the Labour Court with technical staff who can evaluate what is equal pay in real terms.  This problem has been examined in many other countries without very much success.  We need somebody to do some form of job evaluation.  I think AnCO are engaged in this work and perhaps the Minister can use the services of those who are now trained in this field in trying to give effect to <Col N="2138" /> the Bill now before us.  There is no point in passing a Bill unless it is given full effect.  We are only exchanging words here unless we are sure the legislation we pass will be given full effect.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the causes of unequal pay.  When we achieved independence any industry worth talking about&mdash;except perhaps a little in Dublin&mdash;was located around Belfast. There was great poverty.  Very few children had a pair of shoes going to school.  I am glad to see Deputy Dockrell here because his father would remember this.  I believe one of the reasons the Deputy is in the House is because of the great humanity shown by his family to Dublin workers at that time.  We had a situation where there was an employers' market.  People took employment &ldquo;for buttons&rdquo;, as the expression goes.  The tradition of working for less than a fair wage grew up but fortunately, the trade union movement also grew up and great advances were made in our social services.  The situation has now been reached when people will not starve, although they may nearly do so with the social services that are available.</P>
    <P>This unequal pay situation has an historic basis handed on to us by British masters when we accepted gratefully anything we could get for many years.  I agree that this Bill is timely and with its introduction we should get away from that old tradition that has so long persisted here. To get away from 50 years of tradition is something I am not sure we should try to do in less than two years.  I believe in this Bill's final objective but I think the Minister is rushing into it a little too quickly in order to satisfy his former trade union colleagues.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the difficulty in certain trades in which women are now employed.  If the equal pay concept is fully operated these women will find themselves replaced by men. I do not think that problem has been properly evaluated in drafting this Bill.  Perhaps in certain trades men will be replaced by women but that is far less likely than women being <Col N="2139" /> replaced by men.  We have this two-edged sword in our hands.  Especially on the Committee Stage we should consider this important point, that in some cases women may be at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, much remains to be done to eliminate unfair discrimination on grounds of sex wherever possible and to help to change the prejudicial attitudes which give rise to it.  That is what I have been talking about.  These prejudices have built up over the years.  Middle-aged and elderly women are very slow to accept any change.  We now have a generation of younger women who want to involve themselves in every aspect of national life and Government. Yet, there have not been sufficient women to elect more than three women Deputies.  That is regrettable.</P>

I ask the Minister to consider seriously the points I have made.  Some of the discrimination accepted by the vast majority of women has been brought about by history and tradition.  I am glad this legislation is being introduced If the Minister will seriously consider the further Stages the Bill can be greatly improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody welcomes the Bill but I think we are a bit hypocritical about the opposite sex.  We can pass a measure for equal pay for equal work but the whole point is what will the employer regard as equal work? Down the years the opposite sex were supposed to be the tender sex and were not supposed to do the type of work, or as much work, as a man.  In fact, a man was expected to support his wife when he married her; there <Col N="2140" /> was no question of her working at all. There are some men who expect their wives to support them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more, providing the wife will do it.  If the minds of the employers are not cushioned the whole thing could backfire. The interpretation of how well the job is done is important, and will remain in the minds of the employers. Their attitude will not change no matter what Bill is passed.  If an employer thinks a male will do the job better, and he can get him for the same salary as a female, he cannot be ordered to employ female staff.  Is there a danger that in the long run this may react against the employment of females?</P>
      <P>I sounded a word of warning when we were passing the Bill removing the marriage bar.  Everybody agrees that married women should be allowed work.  There are a number of young girls with leaving certificates who are hostile to that idea.  I realise that this is irrelevant to the debate but I am merely pointing out that women change their minds.  If this backfires, and I hope it will not, there will be a danger that the young ladies looking for jobs will find that they are in competition with men.  As the salary is the same, men may often get preference.</P>
      <P>If a Government is appointing a board of directors will a Minister choose a lady and nominate her to the board?  This is a situation we must face.  Women should be placed in key positions if they are to be on equal terms with men.  They have not been. That is a fact of life.  Even in a family the head of the house is a man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not face the facts of life. We pass this Bill because it is a popular thing to do.  But how will it work in practice?  In theory it is the ideal situation but one must be practical. Deputy Lemass spelled this out clearly.  Will the trade unions accept this?  I hope they will.  I will be sad if women were to lose employment because they had to get equal pay for equal work.  As I said, this is an interpretation of how well the job is <Col N="2141" /> done.  An arbitrator will decide on equal pay for equal work.  But I can claim that an employee who is not getting equal pay is not entitled to the extra money because the job, while appearing to be the same as another, in fact is not.  I do not envy the arbitrator his job.  This may not be so but I can claim it to be so if I prefer male employees.  That is why I am worried about this Bill but, as I have said, the interpretation of equal work is the most important point.  I agree with this Bill wholeheartedly.  Are the minds of the people cushioned to accept that women can do an equal amount of work as a man?</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I would prefer a female secretary to a male secretary any day.  Would a hardheaded businessman employ a female if a male would do the same work for the same pay?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.  The businessman's main idea is production. So far as directors are concerned production means money.  If they think male employees are more likely to increase production I do not think any Bill will convince them that they should employ females.</P>
      <P>Women were complaining when there was a marriage bar.  Some are now complaining that they cannot get jobs.  The danger is that if this measure backfires the younger generation will be complaining that they cannot get jobs.  Nobody will lose employment because of this Bill.  Is there a danger that where people employed females previously they will now employ males?  As I said, I do not envy the Minister his task as arbitrator. Equal pay is easy to decide but equal work is a different matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree with the principles of the Bill but I see difficulty in putting the Bill into practice.  I accept that women can do equal <Col N="2142" /> work but the point is that down through the years women have not been involved in industry or otherwise. Even at the marriage ceremony the man is made superior; the woman undertakes to love honour and obey.</P>
      <P>The Minister has to face many big problems in this regard and he has my sympathy when it comes to arbitrating on them.  A lot of women have been employed in offices as clerks because the employer could pay them less than a male clerk.  That was morally wrong. While we can make the laws here which will ensure that this does not happen again it is those who are employing people who will have to implement the laws.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to inform the House who will pay the costs if there is a court case arising out of a breach of this piece of legislation.  A person could be finished for all time if they had to pay the costs of such a case.  This legislation is a fine thing in principle and it is nice to hear people say that everybody should be treated equally but how is such a piece of legislation to be implemented?  Had the Minister taken more time on the preparation of this Bill it is possible he would have done a better job.  He has informed me that the business people will &ldquo;cop on&rdquo; and agree with this piece of legislation but he must take into consideration that an employer will take on the people, male or female, he considers best to run his business.  In my view no piece of legislation can compel any employer to employ male or female.</P>
      <P>In this regard we should set an example in appointing females to State boards and giving them responsibility. The Government should set an example by appointing females if they feel they are able to do a particular job as well as a male.  For instance has a female judge been appointed in this country?  The fact that we have only three lady Deputies as Members of this House is the fault of the people who elect us but how many females have we in prominent positions on State boards or on the boards of directors of private companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to change the whole <Col N="2143" /> attitude towards women in the community and this is a tough job.  Down through the years it was accepted that women were not inferior but superior and were to be treated as such and were not to be asked to work.  No matter what they say about Women's Lib today the older generation looked up to the opposite sex as people who should be looked up to and should not be asked to work.</P>
    <P>The Minister in making appointments instead of giving &ldquo;jobs to the boys&rdquo; should give &ldquo;jobs to the girls&rdquo;. Unless females are appointed to senior positions by the Government the private employer can accuse the Government of being hypocritical in this regard.  We should not ask business people to do something we do not do ourselves.  The Minister, in his reply, should give some indication of the attitude of the Government to appointments of females in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be misinterpreted in this regard because I am for equal pay for equal work but I have endeavoured to point out the dangers that may <Col N="2144" /> arise following the adopting of this piece of legislation.  Why have we not some female peace commissioners? Such appointments would show the community as a whole that we think females are important enough to make decisions and to enforce justice.</P>
    <P>The trade unions could also give a lead in this regard.  There are certain trade unions who would not like to see females getting equal pay but I presume that the Minister has prevailed upon these unions to accept the contents of this Bill.  We should show that we are sincere by appointing females to the Judiciary and to State boards. One danger I see is that too many men will become dependent on women and will want them to go to work in order to support them.  I should not like to see that happen because it is a man's job to provide for the household.</P>
