    <Title>Control of Importation, Sale and Manufacture of Contraceptives Bill, 1974: Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, section 17, provided that it was an offence to sell, import or advertise for sale any contraceptives.  This piece of legislation was challenged as to its constitutionality and in a recent Supreme Court case of McGee against the Attorney General the Supreme Court in a majority judgment, held in effect that the provision of section 17 (3) of the 1935 Act prohibiting the importation of contraceptives was contrary to the Constitution and hence not part of our law.  The Supreme Court did not make any finding on whether the prohibition contained in the 1935 Act against the sale of contraceptives was or was not constitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the Supreme Court decision the position now is that any person may purchase abroad and import contraceptives into this country for his own use or may freely distribute <Col N="286" /> them but they may not be sold in the State.</P>
    <P>We now have a rather anomalous situation that there is no restriction whatever on the importation of contraceptives but there is an absolute prohibition on their sale.</P>
    <P>The <i>rationale</i> of the Supreme Court judgment was to the effect that married couples are entitled not to have reasonable access to contraceptives denied to them and that the ban on importation was such a denial.  The court did not go on to decide whether the ban on sale constituted such a denial but, having regard to what was said in some of the judgments, I would have little doubt that if a case were shown to the court that the total ban on sale meant that reasonable availability was not possible then that ban too would be found unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The legal position at the moment, therefore, is that importation without restriction as to quantity or type and by any person is quite legal; that the ban on sale which continues to subsist would appear to be liable to be challenged successfully.</P>
    <P>I considered that this anomalous position had to be rectified because an anomaly itself is unsatisfactory but, in addition, I have had clear evidence that as a result of it a black market exists and is growing in the illegal sale of contraceptives in this country.  They can be imported as I have said without let or hindrance and this is being done.  Orders for contraceptives are being solicited by mail order firms from outside the State and these orders are being solicited indiscriminately.  The firms concerned apparently are using street or telephone directories.  It has been rather irately brought to my notice that one firm is enclosing a sample of its wares with the order form.</P>
    <P>For these reasons it was quite clear to me that the position consequent on the McGee case required to be regularised and that the unfettered importation should be controlled but, at the same time, having regard to the <i>obiter dicta</i> of the Supreme Court in that case the prohibition on <Col N="287" /> sale should be eased.  The Bill now before the House, I submit, meets these two requirements in a reasonably satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>The right to import is restricted to persons who will be selling by retail in this country and it is suggested in the Bill that the proper outlet is through pharmaceutical chemists shops as this is a retail trade with high ethical standards and contraceptives do have a medical connotation.  The right to purchase will be confined to married persons and this restriction is an acknowledgement of the finding by the Supreme Court that the constitutional right to have reasonable access to contraceptives is a right of married couples.  There was no finding as to whether a single person has such a constitutional right.  As I am concerned only with the legal position as I now find it, this Bill does not go beyond the finding in the McGee case.</P>
    <P>Reasonable availability for married couples has to be maintained.  I quite appreciate that in parts of the country pharmaceutical chemists may not wish, for conscientious reasons, to sell contraceptives and, accordingly, there is provision for a licence to be granted to persons other than pharmaceutical chemists or, indeed, to individual persons and thus reasonable availability will be assured.  Again, of course, because this availability is the legal right of married couples only there is a restriction on the purchase by single persons.  There has been considerable misunderstanding in regard to this, some of it deliberate on the part of people who want to ridicule the restriction on sale to married persons. It has been asked if purchasers will be obliged to produce marriage certificates or other proof of marital status. The answer is no.  Likewise there will be on requirement or obligation whatever on the vendor to inquire as to the marital status of the purchaser. Such a requirement would be intrinsically objectionable and, in addition, it would impose such an obligation on the vendor that in effect no person would stock and sell contraceptives.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill is quite simple and unambiguous; it makes it <Col N="288" /> unlawful for an unmarried person to purchase a contraceptive.  No doubt it will be urgued that this prohibition is unenforceable and like any law I have no doubt that it will be breached.  This does not, nevertheless, take from the validity of having the prohibition because laws essentially are obeyed because people want to obey them not because they are afraid of the sanction behind them or the threat of being detected in breach of them.  Enforcement of any law can be a problem and there are other areas, notably in the intoxicating liquor code and the road traffic code, where we have this problem and one would hardly argue that because there are breaches in these two areas there is, therefore, a justification for relaxing or abolishing the prohibition on under age drinking or dangerous driving.  It is the aim of any criminal law to prohibit undesired conduct and that law is not futile even if it does no more than mark society's values in a particular area.  I have no doubt that the vast majority in the State are in favour of a law restricting sales of contraceptives to married couples.</P>
    <P>It is a well recognised principle of jurisprudence that to set out a prohibition in a statute is in itself a deterrent notwithstanding difficulties of enforcing it or of adducing proof to enable the sanction behind the prohibition to be imposed.  I am satisfied that it is right to impose this prohibition in this Bill and that it is in accord with popular opinion.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose the Bill because they see it endangering public morality while they have proved their capacity to write letters are, I suspect, not numerically strong.  For they have one thing in common and have communicated it to some Deputies in this House and that is a failure to see that, as a result of the McGee case, it is not possible to prohibit the availability of contraceptives.  Our law henceforth must maintain such availability and it is futile for people to demand that contraceptives be absolutely prohibited. Such a law would be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Likewise, it is futile to oppose this Bill on the grounds that it makes <Col N="289" /> contraceptives available.  It does no such thing.  They are available as a constitutional right.  What this Bill does is to regulate their availability. Those who oppose this Bill are in effect in favour of the availability of contraceptives without let or hindrance to all ages and groups without distinction of sex or marital status.  Yet these same people pose and hold themselves out as the protectors of the morals of the nation. Surely they must see the contradiction of their position.  I suspect some of them do and this is what inspires the calls we have seen more and more recently for a referendum on the subject.</P>
    <P>The rights of an individual citizen in this country are given to him by the Constitution and guaranteed to him under it and our Supreme Court has the duty under that Constitution of defining what those rights may be from time to time.  In this case the Supreme Court has found that a married person has a right to have reasonable access to contraceptives and those who call for a referendum, in effect want to take that right away from that individual.  I cannot accept that this is a valid point of view and is, indeed, a dangerous doctrine.  There will be no referendum on this issue.  In any event, but this does not go to the merits of the argument, it would be impossible in practical terms to devise a suitable question to put to the people.  Most people on conscientious grounds would not practise artificial contraception but at the same time would not deny to any person whose conscience permits him so to do, the right to so practise. The question, therefore, for Deputies is, do they want unfettered availability of contraceptives or do they want the supply regulated as is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose the Bill because it is too illiberal do so mainly on the ground that it seeks to restrict sales of contraceptives to married couples.  They seek to argue that it is impractical to do so and any attempt to do so will bring the law into disrepute.  I have already dealt with this argument when speaking of this restriction on sales to married persons only and the enforcing of it. They also argue however, that there is <Col N="290" /> a right, a natural right in favour of single people to have access to contraceptives. I do not accept that there is any such right because that implies a right to fornicate and in my opinion there is no such natural right.  I am well satisfied that the principle of restricting contraceptives to married persons is the proper one.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with some of the particular proposals in the Bill.  Section 2 provides that, subject to section 3, it shall be an offence to import contraceptives except under licence issued by the Minister under this section and, subject to section 4, it confines the right to sell contraceptives to persons who are licensed under this section to import them.  A licence under this section may be subject to such conditions and may relate to such class or classes of contraceptives as may be specified therein. In general, licences may be issued only to chemists who are lawfully keeping open shop for dispensing medical prescriptions.  Where, however, the Minister is satisfied that contraceptives are not reasonably available to married persons in any place because it is not within a reasonable distance of the premises of a licensed chemist, he may issue a licence under this section to some other person or persons carrying on a business in or near that place.  The holder of a licence under this section may sell contraceptives only in or from his place of business and may not sell contraceptives for resale.  The licence may be revoked by the Minister where the holder is in breach of a condition thereof and may be declared forfeit by the court where the holder is convicted on indictment of an offence under the section.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the Minister may issue a licence, subject to specified conditions, to a married person to import contraceptives where the Minister is satisfied that contraceptives are not reasonably available to the person by reason of the distance of the place in which he lives from the premises of a person licensed to sell them.</P>
    <P>Section 4 makes it an offence to manufacture contraceptives except under licence granted by the Minister. <Col N="291" /> The licence may contain such conditions as the Minister considers necessary to ensure that contraceptives are supplied for sale within the State only to persons licensed under section 2 to import them.  A licence under this section may be revoked where the holder is in breach of a condition thereof.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that it shall be an offence for a person who is unmarried to purchase a contraceptive. Section 6 provides that it shall be an offence to display contraceptives for sale.  Section 7 provides that the Minister may appoint a committee of five persons, which shall include persons with medical qualifications, to advise him on whether a device or product is an abortifacient, whether or not the device or product is also a contraceptive, and it provides that he may not grant a licence for the importation or manufacture of a contraceptive which, in the opinion of the committee, is also an abortifacient.</P>
    <P>Section 8 makes it an offence to sell or to display publicly any advertisement or any document containing an advertisement for contraceptives. It also provides that unsolicited advertisements and written material advocating the use of contraceptives may not be sent through the post or otherwise delivered to any premises. An exception is made for the display of a notice of availability of contraceptives for sale in premises in which contraceptives may lawfully be sold.  An exception is also made in relation to the advertising of contraceptives in newspapers and periodical publications which does not extend beyond advertising the trade-name and type of contraceptives and indicating the premises from which they may be purchased.  A further exception is made in respect of advertising in publications intended solely or mainly for chemists or doctors. The Minister may make regulations specifying the manner of the two latter kinds of advertising.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that it shall be an offence to manufacture, import, sell, offer for sale or advertise an abortifacient.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> Subsection (1) of section 10 provides that when a person is charged with an offence under section 9, which relates to abortifacients, and it is proved that the subject matter of the charge is a contraceptive, he may be convicted of any offence under the Act of which he is guilty by reason of the fact that the subject matter of the charge is a contraceptive.  Subsection (2) has a similar provision to cover the case where the charge is in respect of a contraceptive but the subject matter thereof is proved to be an abortifacient.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides for the case where, irrespective of whether the charge is in respect of a contraceptive or an abortifacient, it is proved that the subject matter of the charge is either an abortifacient or a contraceptive, but it is not proved which it is: in such a case the person charged may be convicted of any offence under the Act of which he could be convicted if it were proved that the subject matter of the charge was, in fact, a contraceptive.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that any person entitled to appeal against a prohibition order under the Censorship of Publications Acts may apply to the Censorship Board for a review of a decision, taken before the passing of the Bill, to ban a book or periodical on the ground that it advocated contraception or abortion.  The section provides that the Board shall revoke the ban where satisfied that the book or periodical does not advocate abortion.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that the Bill does not apply to contraceptives which may lawfully be supplied only on a doctor's prescription.</P>
    <P>Sections 12, 13, 14 and 16 provide for repeals and expenses.</P>
    <P>This then is the Bill.  I look forward to the debate which I hope will take account of the realities of the legal situation consequent on the McGee case.  I anticipate criticism of the Bill and will be interested in the views of Deputies who are critical as to how they would improve it.  It is a subject which for many imposes conscientious difficulty.  All I ask is <Col N="293" /> that Deputies approach it from this point of view and not motivated by political expediency, looking over their shoulders wondering what the constituency will think.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday, 13th February, 1974 the Government issued a statement which read:</P>
      <P>The Government has decided, consequent on the recent Supreme Court decision in relation to the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, to introduce a Bill to provide for the necessary change in legislation arising out of that decision.  It is the Government's intention to provide for a free vote in relation to the passage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>That is the end of the Government's statement.  The first of the two sentences of that statement is, in my view, correct.  The Government, as a Government, had a duty and have a duty to introduce legislation which is, to use the words of the Government, &ldquo;necessary consequent on the decision of the Supreme Court&rdquo; in the case of McGee against the Attorney General and the Revenue Commissioners. I, in common with a great number of other people, was taken aback, to say the least of it, when reading the second sentence, namely, the statement that it was the Government's intention to provide for a free vote in relation to the passage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>If legislation is necessary, and there are very few of us in this House who, having studied this particular problem, do not agree that legislation is necessary, then it is the duty of the Government not alone to introduce it but to ensure, so far as they can, that it will be passed.  If they do not ensure, in so far as they can, that it will be passed they are in breach of their duty and they are abdicating their primary responsibility as a Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the situation now that we are six months after the decision of the Supreme Court which was given on the 20th December, 1973. The intention to introduce a Bill was <Col N="294" /> announced on the 13th February and the Bill was given a First Reading on 21st March.  The Bill was circulated sometime at the end of March or the beginning of April.  We were led to believe during February and March that the matter was urgent but after the Bill was circulated we heard no more about it at all until very suddenly last Friday morning our Whip received a telephone call to the effect that the House was very short of Business for this week and it was decided to order the Second Reading of this Bill for Thursday, today.</P>
      <P>One speculated as to why, at this very late stage of the Parliamentary year, this decision was so suddenly made.  One's speculation could lead one to a number of conclusions.  As always with speculation, one could not be certain that one's ideas were right but one certainly suspected that there might be a desire on the part of the Government to focus public attention on to a matter such as this and away from other matters, other matters that many people might consider were, in the last resort, a great deal more important than even this important topic.  Nonetheless for whatever reason it may be we now have this Bill brought forward today.</P>
      <P>I wonder have Members of the House adverted to the fact that on last Tuesday morning the newspapers carried the results of what is described as a survey of attitudes carried out in this State last summer by a University in Scotland.  These results were published on Tuesday and I think it is not just coincidence that they appeared two days before Dáil Éireann was called on to debate this Bill in detail.  Of course, the appearance of the results of this survey on last Tuesday was not the first that we heard of the survey.  We heard of it in <i>The Irish Times</i> of the 18th February, 1974, four or five days after the announcement of the Government of their intention to promote legislation. At that time we will recall that in the other House a number of Independent Senators were endeavouring to promote a Bill the objects of which were not entirely dissimilar to this Bill at present before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> I, in common with a number of other Deputies, raised in the House at Question Time the propriety of the actions which were carried out at that time by a civil servant.  The Chair allowed that matter to be thoroughly thrashed out at Question Time.  In my view it is no harm, in view of the sinister reappearance of this survey again last Tuesday morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair I will quote from this survey which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18th February, 1974:</P>
      <P>The Department of Politics at Strathclyde University, Glasgow, is no academic ivory tower&mdash;certainly not for Mr. Keith Wilson-Davis, whose research into attitudes to family planning in Ireland are being given serious attention by the Irish Cabinet.</P>
      <P>His survey, which was undertaken last summer, into the family patterns and fertility behaviour of Irish women has achieved political significance as a result of its timing.</P>
      <P>The survey, which was financed by the Social Science Research Council in Britain, is based on a random sample of currently married women, aged 15 to 45 years, and it was carried out throughout the Republic.  Besides interviewing 754 women, the survey also deals with replies from 200 husbands.</P>
      <P>I should like to break into the quotation to comment on two facts.  The first is that the survey was taken last summer.  That is 12 months ago. It was only published officially last Tuesday.  Twelve months ago our law in relation to this matter was totally different from what our law is now and what our law was as and from 20th December, 1974.  Therefore, calls for change in the law made last summer bear no relation whatever to the present position as, indeed, the Minister for Justice has outlined it this morning and has no validity whatever in relation to this Bill or any other proposal at this time to change the law as it now stands after the Supreme Court decision of December 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter I should like to talk about in relation to this is that the survey was financed by an organisation which is described as the Social Science Research Council in Britain. It strikes me as strange that the Social Science Research Council in Britain does not have enough social problems in Britain to investigate that it must use its hard earned money to come <Col N="297" /> over here for some reason to make these investigations.  One is entitled to wonder why.  The report I have referred to goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Last Monday as the Dublin Cabinet was about to meet to discuss its position on contraception, prior to Senator Mary Robinson's attempt to have her Family Planning Bill receive a Second Reading, Mr. Wilson-Davis received a surprise phone call from Dublin.</P>
    <P>The call was from Mr. Nicholas Simms, assistant on broadcasting to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. He asked Mr. Wilson-Davis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think we all sought at the time to avoid mentioning him by name.  The only reason why he was mentioned by name here is that his name is, in fact, in the quotation but if it appears again I will endeavour simply to refer to &ldquo;the said civil servant&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>He asked Mr. Wilson-Davis for answers to two questions related <Col N="298" /> to the survey: Should the Government repeal the ban on contraceptives&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The strange thing is that there was no ban at the time that the phone call was made.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and should contraceptives be made available?</P>
    <P>Mr. Wilson-Davis got down to working on this part of the survey and phoned that day to Dublin giving the requested information.  In particular he indicated that 57.1 per cent of the women thought that the Government should repeal the ban on contraceptives.</P>
    <P>A ban, I repeat, that did not exist.  It existed at the time that they answered the questions but it did not exist at the time that this information was given to a civil servant in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the assistant on broadcasting.</P>

The civil servant explained: &ldquo;I was very glad to have such a quick response as it came at a relevant moment in the decision-making. However, the question is likely to be debated at various levels for some time and I would be very interested in further information from the survey as it becomes available.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Mr. Wilson-Davis received a further request for further information as the Cabinet was again expected to meet to discuss the contraceptive issue.  He forwarded further information.</P>
      <P>At the Cabinet meeting that night, the Government decided to introduce its own Bill changing the anti-contraceptive laws.  This Bill was predicted to be less radical than Mrs. Robinson's Bill, which on Wednesday failed to receive a Second Reading in the Senate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> On Thursday the civil servant again wrote to Mr. Wilson-Davis thanking him for the second instalment of data.</P>
    <P>He added: &ldquo;The politics are getting very confused now.&rdquo; There were two reasons for this confusion, he continued.</P>
    <P>Firstly, he explained: &ldquo;I passed a copy of the information you gave me to Brendan Halligan, the Labour Party Leader in the Senate, with the general aim of stiffening his resolve when Mary Robinson's Bill was due for Second Reading.  I asked him not to use the figures in his speech which in the event he was not called on to deliver.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second reason cited by the civil servant was that hopefully, a Government Bill would be introduced in the near future.  The civil servant continued: &ldquo;It ain't, as the song has it, necessarily so.  In that case one can predict a free vote with a certain amount of desertion from the Government party.  The Opposition show every sign of opposing, free vote or no free vote, and while this is mainly based on a natural desire to embarrass the Government (as is their duty), there are suggestions that they consider public opinion to be more conservative than your survey would indicate.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have, of course, an older age profile in their support and politics is notoriously male dominated. From the point of view of research, helping to inform political decisions it would, therefore, be desirable to have some form of publication of your results between the first and second readings of a Government Bill.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is unfortunately not possible to say when this might be, between March and June would be my bet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The civil servant also indicated that there might be press interest in the preliminary results of the survey.  Last Friday Mr. Wilson-Davis issued a press release to that effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> Almost precisely what that civil servant predicted&mdash;he is only four days out&mdash;came to pass.  The Bill came on for its Second Reading on 4th July.  On 2nd July this unimportant survey, which is now totally out of date, was produced.  It was produced presumably for the reasons which the civil servant in question gave at that time in that correspondence with the University of Strathclyde. It is disturbing that we have a situation in which a Bill on a matter such as this is being promoted in this kind of atmosphere.</P>

It is one that has got a great deal of public attention over the past 12 months or so and particularly over the last six months, since the decision in the McGee case.  The Government's Bill has got a good deal of public attention.  There has been a lot of criticism of it, much of it for valid reasons, but whether it is valid or not the fact is that public discussion has been very considerable.  Public interest no doubt is equally considerable.  That being the position, the Bill being ordered, we are then told on the night before that there are four hours <Col N="302" /> to discuss it.  I venture to say there are many Deputies on both sides of the House who want to express their views and one might well conclude that there are a number of Deputies on the Government side of the House who want to express contrary views to one another as, of course, they are perfectly entitled to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue now with your permission and that of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I want to come now to make some comment on the provisions of the Bill itself.  In order to do that it is necessary to recount in a very brief, general way the findings of the Supreme Court because, with the greatest respect to him, I think that one statement of the Minister's this morning is not entirely on all fours with the facts.  If one examines the individual judgments, as I have, of the Supreme Court one will find that the only finding of the court was a declaration that subsection (3) of section 17 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935 was contrary to the Constitution and, therefore, <Col N="304" /> was of no effect.  Three of the judges went out of their way to say that they were not making a finding of any kind on any other matter.</P>
      <P>One of the judges dissented from the judgment of the court and held that in his opinion the provisions of the whole of section 17 were in accordance with the Constitution so his judgment can be disregarded for the purposes of examining the position as it now exists.  Another judge, Mr. Justice Walsh, who gave a much more lengthy judgment than any of the other judges, went on to deal with other topics and appeared to indicate that if he were asked to decide it he might decide (a), (b) or (c)&mdash;in particular, he indicated that in relation to any possible prohibition on the sale of contraceptives or the importation of contraceptives by single people.  It is not a correct reading of the collective judgments of the Supreme Court and of their collective decision to say, as the Minister has, in effect, said this morning, that it would almost certainly be held unconstitutional if there were a prohibition on the sale of contraceptives in this or any subsequent legislation.</P>
      <P>The position as it exists post-McGee is that subsection (3) of section 17 is gone.  That is the section which prohibited in effect the private, uncommercial, importation (1), which traceptives.  Subsection (1), which prohibits their importation for sale has deliberately not been declared invalid.  That was one of the reliefs which the plaintiff claimed in that case and she did not get it.  The judges went out of their way to say that they were only declaring subsection (3), the ban on private, non-commercial importation, invalid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government were faced with that situation and what most people would have done, if acting responsibly, in response to that situation, if you take up the clearly expressed invitation of the Supreme Court, was that while they could not totally prohibit the importation for personal use in an uncommercial fashion of contraceptives, they could control such importation in the national interests. There is not just a right in the Legislature to seek to exercise such <Col N="305" /> control but, indeed, what one might feel is a duty, is made clear from a passage in the judgment of Mr. Justice Griffin at page 14 of the typescript, unapproved copy, of the judgment in which he says:</P>
    <P>It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the entire of section 17 is inconsistent with the Constitution and that section 17(1) and (3) should stand or fall together. One of the grounds advanced in support of the argument that the entire section should fall was that contraception is a matter of private morality not public morality.  In my view, in any ordered society the protection of morals through the deterrence of fornication and promiscuity is a legitimate legislative aim and a matter not of private but of public morality.</P>
    <P>I respectfully agree with that expression of view and I feel that our duty as a Legislature is, so far as we can within the confines of our Constitution, as interpreted for us by the Supreme Court, to deter fornication and promiscuity, to promote public morality and to prevent, in so far as we can&mdash;there are, of course, clear limitations on the practicability of that&mdash;public immorality.</P>
    <P>The Government, instead of taking what to most people would have seemed to them the obvious course of limiting the now unlimited right of importation for non-commercial purposes, simply for personal use, did not do that at all.  Instead, they propose in this Bill to turn the Supreme Court's decision right up on its head. They propose to prohibit importation almost entirely, except by people who have specialised licences under this Bill to import and instead to open up a series of retail outlets for the supply of contraceptives throughout the country.</P>
    <P>All this is contained in section 2 which states:</P>
    <P>A person shall not import, sell or offer for sale or invite offers to purchase contraceptives unless he is the holder of a licence to import granted under this section ...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> The Minister may grant these licences to what are called authorised persons. Authorised persons are defined in section 1 as persons who under the Pharmacy Act, 1875 to 1962, are lawfully keeping open shop for dispensing prescriptions issued by registered medical practitioners, in other words, chemists.  Licences can be granted by the Minister to chemists to import for the purpose of sale, and chemists can sell.  I will come to this point later. One could well have reservations about a situation whereby perhaps 1,500&mdash;which I think is approximately the number of chemists' shops in the country&mdash;potential retail outlets are established.  It does not stop at that.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that the Minister for Justice can issue licences to people who are not chemists but who are carrying on what is called &ldquo;business&rdquo;.  Business is not defined and, therefore, it can reasonably be assumed that it is any kind of business.  It could be a publichouse. It could be a grocery.  It could be any type of business.  Indeed, in the context of this particular thing, one could think of a few particularly incongruous types of businesses.  The provision is there for the Minister to license these people where, apparently, there is no chemist selling contraceptives within a reasonable distance.  One can assume, therefore, that this provision for licensing non-chemists would apply, for the most part, in the rural areas, because there would probably be enough chemists selling them in the cities if this provision were to go through.</P>
    <P>One does not need a great deal of imagination to realise the difficulties that would arise in, say, a fairly remote and under-populated part of the west when a married person&mdash;it can be male or female&mdash;is forced, under the provisions of this Bill, if he wants contraceptives, to approach his near neighbour who deals in hardware, or groceries, or is fully licensed for seven days, or whatever.  It will make a splendid addition to the already often charming notepaper of traders in the west to read that, as well as being licensed for all other <Col N="307" /> things for which it is possible to be licensed in this country, they can proudly boast that they are also licensed under subsection (3) of section 2 of the Control of Importation, Sale and Manufacture of Contraceptives Act, 1974.  I doubt if they will fit it all into one line.</P>
    <P>I seriously ask Members of this House to ask themselves are we expected to allow that kind of situation to arise anywhere in the country? Do we seriously expect <i>bona fide</i> married couples who have a difficulty, and whose conscience allows them to consider the use of contraceptives, and who possibly are medically advised by their own doctor to use contraceptives, to approach, where there is no particular chemist, what, in many cases, will be the local gombeen man and ask him to sell them a packet or a bottle, or whatever it is, of some particular commodity? Are we not making the country into a total laughing-stock if we have such a situation?</P>

      <P>The section goes further.  It proposes to license chemists in the first instance.  Where there are no chemists in a locality who are prepared to partake in the scheme, if one might call it that, non-chemist traders can be licensed.  Where there are no non-chemist traders in a locality and, as a result, a married person cannot acquire contraceptives in his locality, he is still catered for by the Government. He is still catered for by this Bill.  He can apply to the Minister for Justice for a licence to import contraceptives under section 3 of such class or classes as may be specified in the licence, subject to such conditions, including conditions as to quantity, as may be so specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> That is a bit legalistic in its language. Let us, in all seriousness, look at what that means.  It means that somebody in the west, or in some remote part of the country, who does not have a participating chemist near him, and who does not have a licensed non-chemist near him, and who is advised by his doctor that he and his wife should use contraceptives in some form or another for the sake of their health, has to sit down and write a letter to the Minister for Justice.  The Minister has to consider the matter and decide to grant, or not to grant, a licence to him and, if he grants a licence, to grant it for a particular class of contraceptive and for a particular quantity of contraceptives.  Will people in this country write to the Minister for Justice of the day on a topic such as that, with a request such as that? The short answer is that I believe they will not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Mrs. McGee would have done so if the opportunity had been open to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe they will not.  Minister for Justice have rarely, if ever, been doctors.  Perhaps one or two of them were.  Even if they are, they are not in a position to decide what is a suitable class of contraceptive for any particular individual. They are not in a position to decide what is a suitable quantity for any particular individual.  I was Minister for Justice and I certainly would not wish ever to have been called on to make decisions of that kind.  If the Minister gives it a moment's thought I think he would not wish to find himself in that position either and I am sure that no successor of ours, whoever he might be, would ever wish to find himself in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably the Minister, on getting such a request, as a matter of normal prudence would have to make some sort of local inquiries, because it could well be that some chancer would apply, not a <i>bona fide</i> married couple.  The Minister for Justice conducts his necessary local inquiries, normally speaking, through the police.  Applications, for example, for naturalisation have to be investigated <Col N="309" /> carefully at local level and the police do that.  Are the police to go out now on behalf of the Minister for Justice, under section 3 of this Bill, to Mrs. So-and-So, at such an address, and find out whether she is a married woman, whether her husband is living with her or whether he has gone to England, whether she has got medical advice from her doctor, and then report back to the Minister?  If the Minister is not expected to make those kind of inquiries to find if the application is <i>bona fide</i>, he simply dishes out licences to everyone who applies.</P>
    <P>The situation seems ridiculous but we did not, I did not, concoct section 2 or section 3.  They are the Minister's and the Government's concoction. These are the kind of consequences which will flow from them.  If the Minister, in his wisdom, were to decide that Mrs. So-and-So, or Mr. So-and-So, were to get 50 items of a particular device, and Mr. So-and-So felt that the 50 were inadequate, is he to approach his local Deputy and ask him to make representations to the Minister for Justice to get the amount increased? Has Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan to face the possible embarrassment of an approach from people with a predicament like that?</P>

    <P>There are many changes that one could ring on sections 2 and 3 of this Bill.  I have not in any way attempted to exaggerate the stupidity of what would result from the enactment of this unhappy proposed legislation. There is much more in this Bill that one could go through but before I leave sections 2 and 3 I would refer <Col N="310" /> to another aspect of the total prohibition in this Bill of importation except in these very limited circumstances of someone living in a remote part of the country; everybody else is prohibited from importing unless he has a licence from the Minister which can only be got if there is no local chemist or local licensed trader, non-chemist. The aspect is this: if a married couple arrive for two or three weeks holiday in this country at Dublin, Shannon Airport, Dún Laoghaire, or whatever and have in their personal baggage a reasonable quantity of contraceptives for their personal use during the period they might be in this country they will commit an offence under this Bill as it now stands because they will have contravened section 2 (1) which says that a person shall not import unless he has a licence.  There is no provision in this Bill that a tourist coming from abroad with his wife can apply in advance from abroad for a licence to bring in any particular contraceptive. There is no provision for that and if they turn up at the customs shed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal briefly with another matter referred to in this Bill, that is, the question of abortifacients.  I cite this again as an example of the impracticability of this Bill.  It is proposed to prohibit altogether abortifacients, a sentiment with which I and this party are in total agreement but, unfortunately, the way it goes about it is entirely useless in fact because abortifacients today can take either of two forms.  They can be either a mechanical intra-uterine device which for the most part can only be fitted by a doctor and therefore would be fitted under medical prescription; or they can be one of the large variety of low-oestrogen pills which are now on the market and which it is believed, but it has not been proved conclusively, act as abortifacients.  Abortifacients within the meaning of the sort of things we are talking about here can only be <Col N="312" /> one or other of those two things but both of them can only be supplied on medical prescription and if you go to section 15 you find that the Act will not apply in relation to any substance, product or preparation the sale of which by retail, otherwise than in the dispensing, in accordance with law, of a prescription issued by a regisered medical practitioner, is unlawful.  In other words, anything which is prescribed by a medical registered practitioner is not covered by the 1935 Act or the 1935 Act, as amended by this Bill, if this Bill were ever passed, and since abortifacients can only in effect or in practice be prescribed by a registered medical practitioner the purported prohibition of abortifacients is totally illusory and of no effect.  This is just another one of the many difficulties that exist in this Bill that were not sorted out before the Bill was published.</P>
      <P>A further difficulty, if that one were not enough, in relation to abortifacients and the commendable attempt to ban them altogether, is the definition of abortifacients which is almost the same as the definition of contraceptives.  Very few words are changed.  It is defined as:</P>
      <P>any appliance, instrument, drug, preparation or thing designed, prepared or intended to terminate pregnancy which has resulted from sexual intercourse between human beings.</P>
      <P>If that definition were to stand it would be necessary in order to prove that something was abortifacient that it was designed, prepared or intended to terminate pregnancy.  There is none of these devices the manufacturers of which would admit that for one moment because the chemical abortifacients are all put on this market and sold and prescribed as contraceptives.  It is thought now that their contraceptive effect derives from an abortifacient action rather than a contraceptive action but the manufacturers, of whom there are many, of such pills, would strenuously and vehemently deny that the intention was to abort an existing pregnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any case were taken based on <Col N="313" /> that definition the company which manufactured the pill in question would produce 20 chemists from its factory in England to prove that there was no intention, design or preparation to terminate pregnancy which had resulted from sexual intercourse between human beings.  They would go to great lengths to say that what they intended their pill to do was to inhibit ovulation or to do something else which would prevent pregnancy occurring but there now seems to be a belief that it is likely that the effect of the low-oestrogen pills is to cause chemical changes in the lining of the womb of the woman which prevent the implantation of the fertilised ovum in that lining.  As a result of the prevention or inhibition of implantation, the ovum must of necessity die in a period of not less than 24 hours and not more than 48 hours after fertilisation.</P>
    <P>There are two grounds, therefore, on which the proposed ban on abortifacients is totally useless.  I agree with trying to ban them but I am afraid the Minister has approached the problem in a way that will be of no value and will have no effect.  This serious anomaly&mdash;there are many more anomalies if I chose to go through them&mdash;arose not because the Bill was sloppily prepared in the Department of Justice.  I do not think this is so.  The sloppiness of the Bill arises from an effort on the part of the Government to suit many divergent points of view and that is why we end up with a compromise that suits nobody.  We have an unhappy, sloppy piece of legislation that, if passed, would make this country a laughing-stock of the whole civilised world.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the Bill for the reasons I have given, and my party are opposed to it.  It is not our duty in Opposition, neither is it our function, to place before this House an alternative Bill.  It is the duty of the Government to produce legislation on matters such as this which, as the Government have said in their own statement, are necessary.  In so far as we can, we will stop this Bill going <Col N="314" /> through for the reasons we have given. We ask the Government to withdraw this silly Bill now because it is not capable of amendment on Committee Stage, if it ever gets there. We ask the Government to rethink the whole matter, not to allow the various conflicting interests within the Cabinet and the Government parties to have their say.  Let officials of the Department of Justice and of the Attorney General's office draft the Bill and when the Minister for Justice is satisfied with it let him go to the Government and tell them that is the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are various other ways of approaching the problems all of us want to solve in the post-McGee situation that the Government do not seem to have considered.  While it is in no way my duty to throw these out to the Government, because of the mess that has been made of the Bill and the potential dangers to public morality in the country in the post-McGee situation, I consider I should refer to them in a vague and general way.</P>
    <P>The more I think of the following approach the more attracted to it I become, namely, that instead of repealing section 17 as is provided by the Government it should be re-enacted in so far as it is possible to do that, with a proviso by adding a subsection at the end that the section shall not apply to health boards.  Let the health boards under responsible public control deal with this problem&mdash;and undoubtedly it is a problem for a large number of individuals, particularly women.  Let them deal with the matter in a responsible way, not with any profit motive built in as there is with the 1,500 or 2,000 retail outlets proposed in the Bill.  Let the health boards deal with the matter in a non-commercial, responsible fashion.  If they see fit to do so, let them set up clinics to supply contraceptives to people who are advised by their doctors or the health board doctors that it is necessary that they have them.  They will ensure that only married people get them, something this Bill cannot ensure, notwithstanding its commendable effort&mdash;on the face of it&mdash;to <Col N="315" /> confine the sale of contraceptives to married people.</P>
    <P>If health board clinics operate a system, if they are exempted from a ban on importation, supply, distribution and sale if necessary at cost price, surely everyone can be happy.  We can have much more effective control than is in this Bill and people who need contraceptives as a result of medical advice will not be denied them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They may be indicated for social reasons.  It is already the practice in health board clinics that social workers take part in the advice and assistance that is given to people who have difficulties that are quasi-social and quasi-medical.  I do not see any difficulty in that respect.</P>
      <P>Another approach to this matter which I would have thought would in conjunction with the above have been the more obvious one for the Government to take but apparently they chose not to take it, is to keep close to the ruling of the Supreme Court, to do more or less what the Supreme Court invited them to do, not turn the Supreme Court decision on its head by prohibiting importation and introducing 1,500 or 2,000 retail outlets. Allow importation by individuals for their private use, preferably married individuals if that is possible to enforce, with the proviso that they must be in reasonable quantities so that clearly they would not be for sale or distribution.  That is a feasible alternative but apparently the Government disregarded it completely.  It is likely to be more workable and more effective than anything the Government have suggested.</P>
      <P>I am not binding myself or this party to any one of these alternatives or to quite a number of other possible ways of approaching this difficulty.  I am saying they are there and that the way the Government have sought to solve the problem is very unsatisfactory.  As far as I can see, it is the most unsatisfactory of many different methods of solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> My final words to the Minister are: this Bill is a joke.  It is a bad Bill because it is being promoted for the wrong reasons by a group of people who are totally disunited in their approach to it.  Take it out of the Government entirely; give it where it should be, to the Department of Justice or, more appropriately, the Department of Health, or a combination of both. Let officials of those two Departments, in conjunction with the draftsmen in the Attorney General's office, produce a Bill that will satisfy the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health. Let them hand it to the Government and let the liberals, the conservatives, the free-thinkers and the other people in the Government keep quiet.</P>
    <P>Let us solve the problem that exists today.  One of the amazing things is that the total freedom to import which exists in the post-McGee situation has not been exploited to the extent one would have expected.  I believe that one of the side effects of this debate will be to alert people to the reality of the post-McGee situation rather than to what they thought was the situation in relation to that decision and what they thought was the situation in relation to this Bill. When unscrupulous people get to realise that the situation is as it is, we may have efforts in the next few months to flood the country with contraceptives for sale to young people and unmarried people.  There is a duty on the Government but they have neglected that duty in three ways.  They have neglected it by not ensuring that they use their Whip to have necessary legislation brought through the House.  They have neglected it also by bringing in a very inferior and totally unsatisfactory Bill.  Thirdly they have further neglected their duty by not bringing the matter forward for discussion in this House until six months and two weeks after the decision of the Supreme Court in the McGee case.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government may have their internal difficulties about a matter such as this, within the Government and within the two parties that support them does not absolve them from their duty to the people <Col N="317" /> of this country and, in particular, to the young people of this country.  The sooner the Government forget about their internal differences and get down to doing their job, the better.  And, if they feel they cannot do it, then I say to them: call an election, we will go in and we will do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have got to say will be in two parts.  Firstly, I want to offer the House my feelings about the Bill and about the situation which produced the Bill.  Secondly I want to say something about the approach of the Government in regard to discipline among Government Deputies when this stage of the Bill comes to be voted on.  That will involve me in contrasting the Government's approach with the approach of the Opposition which, by all accounts, it has decided to adopt.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I might begin by commenting on two seriously intended suggestions made by Deputy O'Malley over the last ten minutes.  He spoke for more than an hour, I think.  We were all waiting to find the headlines in this morning's papers justified which promised us that Fianna Fáil had its own plan in regard to contraception and would, at the last moment&mdash;because there was obvious danger in disclosing it prematurely&mdash;in Deputy O'Malley's speech, give the Dáil the right to answer to this problem about which so many people are in difficulty. The suggestions which Deputy O'Malley made, I accept, were seriously intended but he threw around here this morning a lot of phrases like &ldquo;laughing stock&rdquo; and &ldquo;joke&rdquo;.  All I can say is that, if the Fianna Fáil approach to this problem is fairly represented by the two suggestions he has just thrown out, they ought to keep quiet about jokes let alone elections to get them back in government to settle this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to make small beer of what I know are seriously intended suggestions but I will give the House my instant reactions to them.  On reflection, I am certain Deputies would find other weaknesses in them but I shall give my instant reactions to them <Col N="318" /> now.  If I understood them&mdash;and I had to try and write them down as they were coming across the floor&mdash;the first one was that the whole question of supplying contraceptive facilities should be in the hands of the local health boards.  Deputy O'Malley said that the health boards would, if they saw fit, set up clinics; if they saw fit! Apparently, therefore, there was to be a discretion in a particular health board&mdash;of which there are a number, as Deputies know&mdash;whether or not they would set up such clinics.  What kind of a country would we have if the Eastern Health Board saw fit and set up a clinic, or series of clinics, but the Western Health Board did not? What kind of a country would that be?  How could that be justified or stood over?  Would not that only invite a constitutional action following warnings from another Mrs. McGee?  It would have exactly the same result: humiliate and make a laughing stock of whatever Government had proposed such a thing.  And what happens&mdash;and this was the same thought which prompted the only interruption by the Minister for Justice in the course of Deputy O'Malley's speech&mdash;I commend the self restraint which he has and of which I am short &mdash;but he did say quietly across the floor to Deputy O'Malley: &ldquo;what if there is no medical indication?  Is the health board in the East, in the West, or wherever it may be, to supply contraceptives or contraceptive advice where there is no medical indication in that direction at all?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I could go somewhat further than did the Minister in the course of his brief interruptions: what will be the situation, under Deputy O'Malley's suggestion, if a married couple decide for what is often called, in theological polemic, purely selfish reasons not to have any children?  Suppose a married couple decide&mdash;and, mind you, that is at the core of the McGee judgment; the right of married people to decide for themselves without the State making up their minds on the morality or otherwise of their behaviour&mdash;for purely selfish reasons, not to have children is the Western Health Board&mdash;and Deputies here can well <Col N="319" /> imagine the kind of board that would be adjudicating on this question&mdash;to have cognisance of the problem?  Are Mr. and Mrs. X guilty of selfish conduct is not wishing to have any children?  Is this seriously suggested?</P>
    <P>Is this the best that Fianna Fáil and its publicly paid-for think tank can do &mdash;to suggest that a health board would be supplying contraceptives or advice only where it had come to the conclusion that there was either a medical reason or, as Deputy O'Malley said, as he tottered under the onslaught of the Minister's quiet interruption&mdash;a medico-social reason, or a socio-medical reason, what I presume he really meant was something like tension, or nerves, on the part of the wife or apprehension.  Deputy O'Malley had his opportunity to make himself clear; he spoke here for an hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Time will tell.  The other suggestion Deputy O'Malley made&mdash; whether or not it was his own or the think tank's I cannot be sure&mdash;was that it was wrong to have, what he called, 1,500 or 2,000 retail outlets.  We should simply stick to the McGee judgement and, if you like, let the Bill remain as it stands.  This is an independent or a disjunctive suggestion, apart from his one about the health boards.  Or, I should say, let the old Act stand with the implicit deletion of the last subsection which must fall as a result of the McGee judgement and allow, he says, married couples to import contraceptives provided they do so in substantial quantity.</P>
      <P>Now, I may not be doing him justice here because he compressed this suggestion into very few words&mdash;probably because he was not able to expand it into anything meaningful&mdash;but are we really to take it that Fianna Fáil's best idea here is that the post office is going to be the judge of whether or not a particular importer is married or single; is living with his wife or not? Is the post office to have this burden thrust on it?  Who is to check if I, or anyone else, import a parcelful of contraceptive devices is married or not? Is it seriously suggested that the post office should now have this task thrust on it?  It is a suggestion.  I realise that the Deputy meant it seriously.  It is not quite as mad as the previous one but is running at a close second.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard the Deputy with my own ears; I heard what he said.  I made the best effort I could to write it down.  What I understood him to say was that we should not go too far from the McGee judgment; we should accept it with its implications and simply allow importation by married couples through the post although I have no doubt that they could be imported personally as well but for most people a trip to the North of Ireland or Britain is not a practical suggestion. Therefore, it would have to be through the post.  The Post Office, therefore, would have to be the authority to satisfy itself that the parcels were going, firstly, to a married couple and, secondly, to a married couple living together.  That is what I understood the Deputy to say.  Deputy Colley has the look of a man who is anxious to get into this debate and, perhaps, he will put a better face on Fianna Fáil policy in this regard.  Before I leave the subject of Deputy O'Malley's suggestions which got the headlines this morning, but which, in my view, will get very few tomorrow, the idea that there will be as many as 1,500 or 2,000 retail outlets in this country for contraceptives is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my personal guess and I say it uncontentiously.  If he equates the number of pharmaceutical chemists in this country with the number of prospective outlets for contraceptive devices he is showing himself to be a very unrealistic man.  If there are 1,500 or 2,000 retail pharmaceutical chemists, I am positive that the majority of these will not wish to handle this business and they cannot be forced to handle it.  I have heard chemists say that they will not handle it.  I think the number will be very small, indeed, and that is the reason why the Minister has this provision on which Deputy O'Malley poured such scorn but for which he could suggest no alternative.  That is the reason why in districts where there is no outlet somebody else may be licensed to supply these devices.  We all know that <Col N="322" /> there are small towns and villages throughout the country where it will be very hard to get one chemist, not alone all his competitors, to do this business.  The idea that there will be anything approaching the number suggested by Deputy O'Malley is completely false.  To me it seems a wildly unrealistic guess and, in my view, if there are 50 outlets it will be the height of it.</P>
    <P>Passing from the Fianna Fáil policy which got the headlines this morning but which will barely merit a footnote in the moral history of this country to the principle of the Bill I should like to make my own position clear.  I have done so before in the Oireachtas and outside and I am not ashamed of doing so again.  I believe section 17 of the 1935 Act, in its entirety, to be an unwarranted intrusion on individual privacy.  To me the fact that this Bill has been rendered necessary by the McGee judgment is entirely secondary. I think the McGee judgment, I say this with respect, was long delayed.  I think it might have been obtained many years ago but the legislation which was in force and necessitated Mrs. McGee bringing her case never ought to have been enacted.  It was enacted in 1935 with the minimum of discussion and the reason why it got such little discussion then, in spite of the fact that there were very well qualified people in both Houses, was that this section was, as it were, smuggled through both Houses masked by a large number of other sections dealing with matters of sexual morality but of much greater immediate concern at the time.</P>
    <P>The raising of the so-called age of consent from 16 to 17, the intensification of penalties for assaults on feeble-minded girls and the creation of further penalties for offences connected with prostitution are matters which had preoccupied this Legislature and the British Legislature in previous decades and centuries.  In the middle of this Act this particular section was smuggled through.  I say that advisedly because it got next to no discussion in either House as the record shows.  I hope that Deputies on either side who are unable to make up their minds about this will remember that what is <Col N="323" /> being done here is to remove a criminal sanction.  The 1935 Act imposed a criminal sanction on a particular action, or series of actions, in this sphere of sexual morality.</P>
    <P>There are many fields of morality in which the State is not indifferent. A conspiracy, for example, to tell lies, if we can imagine such a thing, would not be, if it had a contractual dress, enforced by Irish courts.  The courts here recognise such a thing as public morality and they will not enforce contracts which tend to undermine it.  In various other ways they show their disapproval of it, but there is no attempt in many fields to enforce a particular code of morality by means of the criminal law and that is what we are talking about here.  There are many transgressions of the accepted Christian moral code on sexual matters which are not punishable by the criminal law at all.  It may come as a surprise to non-lawyer Deputies to know this but the act of prostitution is not a criminal offence.  There are various activities connected with it which are criminal, living on immoral earnings, soliciting and so on, but the act itself is not a criminal offence.  It may also come as a surprise to some Deputies to know that adultery is not a criminal offence.  There are a whole range of what I might compendiously call sins which are not criminal offences.</P>
    <P>We are not here to argue whether or not they should be categorised as sins.  That does not enter into the argument.  What we are arguing about is how far the criminal law should go in attaching sanctions: to what extent a particular moral code, to which no doubt most Deputies would subscribe, should be backed up by a penal sanction. My own belief is, and there is no infallible calculus for pointing out to an individual where his belief should lead him in this respect, that in this regard the criminal law goes too far.  It is perfectly proper for the State to have a view about sexual morality even in regard to contraception but to penalise in the way the 1935 Act did the sale and advertisement of contraceptives and their importation even in a person's <Col N="324" /> private baggage went too far.  To me that is an intrusion.  I instinctively see that as an excessive intrusion into the area of the individual's privacy where he must be allowed to make up his mind for himself between himself and his God whether he is going to do right or wrong.</P>
    <P>I hope that will not shock Deputies. The reason I mentioned the other areas of morality in which the criminal law does not interfere was that I wanted to bring to the attention of Deputies the fact that the criminal law does not attempt, and never has attempted except in Puritan England, to enforce by criminal sanctions a particular scheme of morality.  It will certainly, where it can usefully do so, enforce standards of public decency and the protection of people who are not able to protect themselves or who are in need of help if it can practicably be done.  However, there are huge areas of morality which the criminal law does not attempt to enforce, and my belief is that this particular one is an extremely intimate one.  Let me say bluntly because there has not been enough talk on this that it is an intimate one whether the persons concerned are married or not.</P>
    <P>My belief, and I hope I will not shock anyone and I am sincerely sorry if I am disappointing the people who wrote to me telling me I had no mandate to support this Bill, is that to apply a penal sanction to this particular activity or to have the concomitance in this particular activity is wrong and always was wrong.  It went too far in trying to enforce a particular form of morality which some may subscribe to and act upon but which ought not be backed up by the sanctions of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>What I have to say about the Bill itself deals with the question of limited enforceability and connected with that is the allegation that there are things in the Bill which are illogical.  I freely admit that there are things in this Bill which will not deliver up 100 per cent positive result if one applies strict logic to them.  They will not deliver up 100 per cent positive result if one applies the test of strict practicality and <Col N="325" /> enforceability but, as the Minister said, it would not be the first time that has been the case.</P>
    <P>I could keep the House here until 2.30 with examples which would demonstrate clearly that we are surrounded by such laws but I will only take one example, that is the law regarding the sale and consumption of drink.  How logical is it that it is an offence to serve drink to a person under 18 in a licensed premises but that that same 18-year-old, if he can lay his hands on drink through somebody else buying it can drink himself into a state of alcoholism and ruin his life without exposing himself or the person who has supplied him with the drink to any penalty at all?  How is it that the sale of drink is governed by certain hours?  It is an attempt to encourage people not to be always out drinking but where is the logic in a system which enforces the ejection of patrons from a public house at 11 or 11.30 p.m. but permits them then to go off to a suburban sitting room, if they live in comfortable conditions, or to a derelict site, if they do not, and drink themselves to death without incurring the penalty of the law at all?  People who connive to get them to do that, who aid them and abet them to do it in spite of their known weakness and in spite of their responsibilities to their wives and families and to society generally are not subject to any penal sanction whatever.</P>
    <P>That is an illogical system and it is one of only limited enforceability, as everybody here knows, but that does not deprive it of some usefulness.  I believe that the licensing hours, irksome as they are when you feel you would like just one more, do fulfil some purpose.  I may be wrong in thinking that but I am inclined to believe that they keep down the level of excessive drinking.  The problem about where to draw the line in practical terms is inherent in any kind of legislation which contains a value judgment.  It is inherent in anything which tries to enforce a particular moral idea.</P>
    <P>The moral idea behind the drink law is that drink is a gift of God. <Col N="326" /> Used in moderation to relax one or to enable one to celebrate or to enjoy oneself it is good but used in order to stun one out of one's wits, make one unable to do one's day's work, neglect one's duties to those who are depending on one, it is bad.  That is a moral idea.  There is a value judgment contained in that.  But the State only goes a certain way in trying to enforce that moral idea and that value judgment.  When it has gone that certain distance it stops and by so stopping it exposes itself to the charge of having only gone half the distance in logic, only gone half the distance in enforcing what it believes, but that is a necessary concomitant of any legislation which is based on a value judgment of a moral kind. Although the criticism may be well founded, I do not think it is an important criticism of this Bill that the logic of it is not complete.  It is a good deal more complete than much legislation that we have had here for many years and which has been found reasonably adequate or as good as it can be made.</P>
    <P>There is only a little over two hours left before the debate is adjourned. I want to refer to something about which the Opposition have been making great play and to great effect because, although we are popularly believed to have in our pockets not only the entire news and current affairs room of RTE but also every news editor and chief reporter in the national Press, the fact is that the Opposition line on our system of having a free vote here has travelled very well in the Press.  They can be very satisfied with the success of their spokesmen in persuading the public that the Government have been in some way pusillanimous in permitting a free vote.  I firmly believe, and I am not just making a case as a lawyer would to do the best for his client, that the Government in introducing this Bill are doing the right thing and by permitting a free vote.  I believe they are doing the right thing in the right way because there are issues of conscience here that are well-known to Deputies on the far side.  I will not mince words.  Deputy Oiiver Flanagan was over there a few minutes ago <Col N="327" /> waiting to speak.  Everybody knows he is against this Bill.  Everybody knows he will presumably vote against it although nobody can predict his inimitable eloquence and decide in advance just the form his speech is going to take.  Deputy Flanagan believes he would be committing a sin if he were to vote for this Bill.  I hope I am not annoying him by putting it that way but that is what I take to be the size of it.  The same is true of the Leader of the Government side in the Seanad.  I will betray a party secret to the House and I hope Senator O'Higgins will forgive me.  I have heard him say that, in his view, if any change is necessitated by the McGee judgment it is the Constitution that should be changed and not the law.</P>
    <P>I have heard him say, and that view is shared by others, that if the Constitution cannot accommodate the 1935 Act in its entirety the Constitution should be stretched so that it will accommodate it and that if any necessity for legislation has resulted from the McGee judgment that is where the change should come and not here.  That is his point of view.  He believes that with his heart and soul. He would sooner, I believe, leave politics altogether than be driven like a sheep into a dipping pond by me or by the whip or the Seanad to support a point of view which he sincerely in his heart thinks is pernicious and damnable.</P>
    <P>I disagree with him.  The Minister disagrees with him.  Most of us, I hope, disagree with him.  But I respect his sincerity in that and he is entitled to his point of view.  Apart altogether from the impossibility of getting Deputy Flanagan to vote for this Bill, unless I were to carry him struggling and screaming past the gate, in which case the Clerk would very properly refuse to record his vote, apart from the impossibility of getting him to vote for it, would it be right to apply discipline to him for refusing to vote for it?  I say no, it would not. Certainly if we, on this side, have anywhere some little lily liver who is afraid that he might offend the nuns <Col N="328" /> here or the nuns there if he was to vote for this Bill but has no convictions in his heart about it one way or the other, if he stays out, I will lay the lash across him and I will try to discover beforehand how many of these there are and they certainly will get no mercy so far as I am concerned and I am able to do it.  But a man who genuinely believes this Bill is wrong and that it would not be just mistaken for him to support it but wicked for him to support it, should not, apart from the fact that he cannot, be obliged to vote for it.</P>
    <P>That is my honest belief.  I have said it in public before and the Government are just going to have to go ahead, do their best, do what they think to be the right thing, and do it in the right way and if we go down and if the Bill is defeated on Second Stage so be it.  We will, at least, have nothing to be ashamed of.  I absolutely reject and am disgusted by the allegations of cowardice on the part of the Government in not applying a whip. What is the point of applying a whip to Deputy Flanagan?  We know he will not obey it in this matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan could not be made to vote for this. Even if he could he should not be made to vote for it because he believes in his heart that it is wrong.  Where is the cowardice there?  If there is cowardice there or if there is a failure to do one's duty there, which Deputy O'Malley spoke about, I would invite the House to consider the analogy of <Col N="329" /> a conscientious objector in war time. There are people who believe that in all conditions it is wrong to take human life even if one's country is threatened with extinction and who cannot be got to pull a trigger and civilised countries treat these conscientious objectors in a quite different way from the way they treat deserters or the way they treat people who show cowardice in the face of the enemy. If we were to put Deputy Flanagan out of the Fine Gael Party, because he does not propose to follow the Government's line on this Bill, that would be an act equivalent to shooting a conscientious objector and I certainly would not be party to it.  Any Deputy who has not got such a conscientious objection will be required by me to vote for this Bill.  I now want to ask the House in what respect that position, which we perhaps mistakenly and prematurely describe as a free vote&mdash;it is not all that free, I described just how free it is&mdash;is different&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Alternative Fianna Fáil move on contraception.</P>
      <P>We have seen what that was.  It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil spokesmen explained last night that the party was not, in any event, insisting on a three-line Whip.  In other words, pairing arrangements with Government Deputies would be respected. And the spokesman said that those who felt they ought to vote for change on conscientious grounds would not be disciplined for doing so.</P>

      <P>That is a report of a political correspondent in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Now, let us go to <i>The Irish Independent</i>.  This paper stated:</P>
      <P>While Fianna Fáil are not allowing a free vote on the Contraceptives Bill to be produced in the Dáil today, they are, nevertheless, not imposing a three-line Whip&mdash; the mandatory summons to attend and vote.  This provides an escape route for those who wish to abstain or who, in conscience, favour the Government's Bill.</P>

I will yield if you like to make a statement about it.  <i>The Irish Press</i> editorial this morning described the Government's attitude as slithery. What could be more slithery than what we have heard from Fianna Fáil?  They have been sneering at us for the last 12 months about a free vote which I believe in my heart of hearts is the correct thing to do.  Now, this is what they are doing.  They are not putting on a three-line Whip.  It will be a two and a half line Whip, a Document No. 2 Whip.  It will be as good as a Whip except something a little different and only the man at the top will be able to tell the difference.</P>

The free vote on which the Government have decided is intended to allow Deputies who have conscientious objections to this Bill not to support it without fear of disciplinary reprisal. That is all.

      <P>I hope I have demolished, and I hope I have got a bit of attention for having demolished, that particular myth about any difference <Col N="332" /> in the Government's approach from the approach of Fianna Fáil.  Before I leave the question I want to say this, and I hope it will bring some balm to the far side.  I believe if Fianna Fáil are allowing conscientious objections, they are doing the right thing.  I believe that is a wise and a correct decision.  I believe if there are Deputies on the other side who think that the principle of this Bill is acceptable and that it is cowardly to pretend to oppose it on the grounds which Deputy O'Malley produced here this morning, or who believe it could be improved on Committee Stage, and that the Government should not be impeded on Second Stage, they also have a conscience and that conscience should be respected.  If that is what Fianna Fáil have decided to do I commend them for it because they have done the right thing and they have shown responsibility in Opposition as I hope we have in Government.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to get back to a rancorous note in order to have to say this. I want to demolish one more Fianna Fáil myth, although by the time you have finished demolishing them you have to go back and start all over again because a new crop have grown up.  I refer to the myth that Fianna Fáil hate a free vote like the devil hates holy water.  That myth has travelled and been canvassed up and down the country by newspapers for as long as I can remember and ever since this Bill was introduced.  &ldquo;It is not in the best traditions or indeed in any traditions of the party that we should allow a free vote.&rdquo; That has been the Fianna Fáil word.  That has been the word given from the legion of the rearguard.  They are all in step, shoulder to shoulder and they will go one way or the other but they will go together.  That is the Fianna Fáil line and I am afraid that too has travelled very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the risk of being disorderly, because I know that for some absurd convention, references in this House to the other House have to be vague, I would like to draw the attention of the House to what happened in the other House on July 7, 1971 when Senator Mrs. Robinson's Bill was <Col N="333" /> refused a First Reading, after she was unmercifully trampled on, figuratively speaking, by Senator Ó Maoláin week in week out for months before that who would not even allow her to mention the thing or put it on the Order of Business.  At the last moment, without even warning her that she would be called on to make the short statement which these refused introductions permit, he told her that &ldquo;yes, it would be on today&rdquo;.  She made a short speech and the Bill was then voted on.</P>
    <P>When that Bill was voted on in the Seanad 25 Senators voted it down and 11 voted in favour of a First Reading.  I was one of them.  Of the 25 Senators, 24 were Fianna Fáil and one was the Leader of the Fine Gael group, as is well known.  There were 32 Fianna Fáil Senators in the House.  One was in the Chair.  That was Senator Yeats and I am not being disorderly in mentioning him.  I invite Deputies to consider whether Senator Yeats left to himself, would have collaborated in voting down Senator Robinson's Bill. Senators Brennan, Nash, Ryan, Ahern and Keegan did not show up at all for the vote.  Senator Sheldon, who, although he did not take the Fianna Fáil Whip, always voted with Fianna Fáil, abstained and Senator Keery sat in his place, while his colleagues marched out.  I can remember to this day the rather sheepish smile on his face as he exercised his perfect conscientious right to abstain and not go along with what the majority of his party were doing.  So much for the tradition that there is no such thing as a free vote in Fianna Fáil.  In case Deputies do not believe my recollection of that they will find it recorded in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If he is pleased to continue on the subject before the <Col N="334" /> House I would much prefer that he should do so rather than refer to the Seanad as, whether by convention or rules here it is not strictly allowable.

      <P>I am grateful to you for letting me go on as long as I did, but it was essential, in the interests of the publice life of this country, that that myth should be exploded for good.  On this very issue Fianna Fáil permitted a free vote not three years ago, and did so rightly.  If they have now decided, in effect, to permit a free vote, although masked under a 2½-line whip, with room for conscientious objections on the model of Document No. 2, masked in traditional Fianna Fáil ambivalence though it may be, they have done the right thing and I commend them for it.</P>
      <P>I hope that, when this Bill is voted on, we will all go into the lobby as our consciences direct us.  I certainly believe that, for our part, the Government have nothing of which to be ashamed.  I am not overly confident, but I strongly hope that this Bill will pass.</P>

      <P>The amount of time and vehemence devoted by the Parliamentary Secretary to trying to explain away the decision by the Government side to have a free &mdash;question mark&mdash;vote is an indication of his concern, and concern rightly felt, for the Government's position on this issue.  However, I will deal with that in a little more detail later.</P>
      <P>The first thing I want to deal with is something on which I am in total agreement with the Minister in what he said.  It may be one of the few points on which I am in total agreement with the Minister, but it is very important that it should be said, and said again.  The Minister pointed out that there appears to be a very widespread misunderstanding of what the present position is.  He spelled out correctly what the present position is, but it is worth saying it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too many people seem to believe that, if this Bill or any other Bill on <Col N="335" /> a similar subject is passed, it will have the effect of making contraceptives available and that, if this Bill is not passed, contraceptives will not be available.  As the Minister correctly pointed out that, of course, is not the position.  The position is that, consequent on the decision of the Supreme Court in the McGee case, at this very moment and since that decision, it has been lawful for people to import contraceptives.  If this Bill does not pass that will continue to be the legal position.</P>
    <P>It is grossly mistaken to imagine that the passing of this Bill will make contraceptives available, and that the rejection of this Bill will mean that contraceptives will not be available.  It is vitally important that this should be understood throughout the country, because, clearly, too many people have misunderstood the position and have based their criticisms and advice to Deputies on that misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>It is of some interest, and may be even of some importance, to examine, so far as one can, the reasons why we are having this debate now, and why it is being limited to four hours today. Of course I do not know what the real reasons are for bringing forward the Bill at this time, but I do know that the business for this sitting was communicated to the Whip on this side in writing, and that it contained no reference whatever to this Bill and that subsequently on Friday evening last, I think, it was communicated to us by the Government Whip that it was proposed to take this legislation this week. So, clearly, whatever the reason, the decision to take this legislation was a late and last minute one.</P>

      <P>It was not at all clear how much time it was intended to give to this Bill.  Certain things have happened since which indicate what will happen to the time being devoted now to the Bill.  It is quite true, as was claimed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, that this side agreed to terminate the debate on this Bill at 2.30 p.m. today in order to dispose of certain other fairly small Bills and other business before the House at <Col N="336" /> the moment.  There was, on our side of the House, repeated insistence that we should complete the debate on this Bill before the Summer Recess.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do that it simply is not possible to complete it unless the House sits quite late into the summer, an intention which the Parliamentary Secretary does not have.  He knows very well of the other business that has to be passed and, in particular, he knows of the Finance Bill.  He knows that, on any reasonable approach to the time he envisages being available, it simply is not possible to deal with this Bill, or even with the Second Stage, before the Summer Recess.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's idea of co-operation is a strange one.  What it amounts to is that, if the Government want to get any business through, the Opposition should just make some formal speech and let it go through.  That is co-operation, apparently, in the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary and also in the minds of some of his colleagues.</P>
      <P>He could not reasonably expect this Bill to go through without fairly detailed discussion, and not all from this side of the House as he well knows. To be anyway realistic about it, he must agree that it is more than probable that this Bill cannot be completed before the Summer Recess and, indeed, that the Second Stage which, presumably, could lead to a vote, cannot be completed before the Summer Recess.  I would suggest to him that whatever he may intend, the Government intend to ensure that there is no vote on this Bill before the Summer Recess.</P>

      <P>We want to complete at least the Second Stage and have a vote before the Summer Recess.  I want to make that quite clear.</P>
      <P>As to why this Bill was dragged out of nowhere on Friday evening last, one can only speculate.  There are different theories on that.  One of those most favoured is that it was done to divert attention from the failure of the Government's policy in regard to Northern Ireland.  Naturally I do not know whether that is true. There are other theories.  We would welcome some member on the opposite side, and particularly a member of the Government, indicating to us why the decision was taken late on Friday evening to bring forward this legislation, having already decided on the business for this week which omitted this Bill.</P>
      <P>One of the consequences of what appears to be happening, that is, that we will have a four-hour debate today and very probably no resumption of that debate until after the Summer Recess&mdash;that is very probably the position; of course I am not certain&mdash; is very unfortunate and it was adverted to by Deputy O'Malley.  He said that even the holding of this debate may well bring about a much greater flood of leaflets, and so on, from manufacturers of contraceptives abroad and particularly in Britain&mdash;there are some going around at the moment&mdash; and that it may well provoke a flood of them.  If it does, that is very unfortunate. It is not something that this House can do anything about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the House can do is to ensure that the position is regularised one way or the other without delay.  A situation in which we have a four hour debate which produces this result and then for many months this legislation is not disposed of, is one with which none of us can be happy and of which the Government cannot be proud and for which the <Col N="338" /> Government are responsible since the Government order the business of the House.  That that should result from the holding of this debate in this way, as ordered by the Government, is a very unfortunate consequence for which the Government will be responsible.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice said that this legislation was necessary.  I propose to show briefly that a number of the provisions in this Bill are not necessary consequent on the Supreme Court decision.  But, let us assume that the Minister for Justice meant what he said, and that the legislation was necessary, then this brings us back to the question with which the Parliamentary Secretary has been dealing at some length.  What is a Government's position where legislation is necessary?  It seems to me to be quite clear that if legislation is necessary, and I accept that some form of legislation in this area is necessary, then the Government, and any Government in power, have the responsibility to introduce that legislation and to use their majority to have that legislation passed.  That is a basic responsibility of government.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach may talk at considerable length about questions of freedom of conscience, draw analogies with conscientious objectors in war time, and otherwise try to confuse the issue but the basic issue is quite clear.  The Government, on their own say so, are introducing legislation which is necessary and the Government are at the same time abdicating their responsibility and saying: &ldquo;We are going to leave this to a free vote of both of the parties constituting the Coalition Government&rdquo;.  I suppose one should not be too surprised at this.  The Government have been running away from their responsibilities in other fields, in the economic field, in relation to policy on Northern Ireland and other areas. That is not, perhaps, quite so obvious to the ordinary man in the street but in this case there is highlighted for all to see the abdication of responsibility by this Government, the inherent weakness in this Coalition <Col N="339" /> Government, who introduce legislation which the sponsoring Minister says is necessary and then say: &ldquo;We will have a free vote and if it is not passed&rdquo;&mdash;in the words of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach &mdash;&ldquo;so be it&rdquo;.  These are his words, if the Bill is not passed.</P>
    <P>But, this legislation is necessary according to the Minister for Justice and is this the attitude of this Government when they face the responsibilities which devolve on any Government, responsibilities which frequently involve a government in doing things which are not very popular?  The Government are elected to do what is in their judgment best for the community and implicit in the mandate given to any Government is that they will in using their collective judgment, if it should be necessary, take actions which are unpopular. That is implicit in the mandate of any democratically elected Government. It is an implied term in the contract between the electors and the Government. This Government are trying to change the terms of that contract with the electors.  This Government are saying: &ldquo;Yes, here we have an issue where legislation is necessary and is clearly the responsibility of the Government but we are not going to push it through as we pushed through all the other legislation that was considered necessary or desirable and if it does not pass, then so be it.&rdquo;  That is the Government's attitude to what they say is necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>It is important that this should be clearly understood by everybody because it illustrates something very important about this Coalition Government. If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, as Chief Whip, finds himself in the position that he has people who in conscience cannot support this legislation then he describes the problem that arises there but it is his problem and it is the Government's problem.  As far as the people are concerned, if this legislation is necessary, the Government and the Deputies supporting them have the responsibility of passing it and no amount of conscientious objection by <Col N="340" /> Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan or anybody else can get the Government off that hook and it is only confusing the issue to pretend that what is involved is looking after the conscience of Deputies.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that he himself had certain doubts in this area when he said that it was only, as far as he was concerned, a free vote for members of his party who in conscience could not support the Bill but that if there were any members of his party who did not want to support it because they were afraid of a reaction in their constituencies he was going to force them through the lobby.  It is a very interesting picture that he paints; the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach examining the mind and heart of each of his Deputies and deciding whether in conscience a Deputy objects or whether he is afraid of a reaction in his constituency.  How he is going to do that he did not tell us. Nevertheless, he was at some pains to stress that it was only in the case of those who had a clear difficulty in conscience that the free vote applied and that for everybody else the Whip applied.</P>
    <P>That is very interesting but it does not alter the fact that a Government have a responsibility to pass necessary legislation.  Of course, the real answer to the dilemma in which the Government find themselves is that they apply the Whip to pass necessary legislation, to quote the Minister for Justice, or if they are unable to do that for any reason, then they acknowledge that they cannot discharge their duties as a Government and they get out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think that his party and his Coalition colleagues can go on in office not doing their duty, publicly confessing that they are unable to do their duty to pass necessary legislation, depending on the Opposition to do the job for them or, if the Opposition does not do it, depending on the Supreme Court to lay down the law of this country, the Supreme Court itself having specified and made <Col N="341" /> quite clear that it would not object and virtually encouraging the Legislature to apply limitations to the principle which it had laid down?  There is a clear obligation on the Government acknowledged by the Minister for Justice.  To suggest that the Government can run away from their responsibility by talking about Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan's conscience or anybody else's conscience is no answer.  If the Government cannot get the support of their Deputies for the legislation which is necessary, their course is clear.  If they fail to carry out that course, if they hang on unable to muster the support of their Deputies, then they are clearly in breach of any mandate they received from the electorate.  The duty of a government is to govern but in this Bill and in their announcement about a free vote on it, the Government have clearly abdicated their responsibility. The weakness of coalitions is well known but there has seldom been a more clear example of that weakness than that displayed in the attitude of the Coalition Government to this legislation.</P>
      <P>As was pointed out in considerable detail by Deputy O'Malley, this Bill is unworkable in many respects and it is illogical.  Clearly, it is a poor compromise between diametrically opposed factions.  Having compromised so as to produce what I am tempted to describe as an abortion of a Bill, the Government cannot carry it.  They cannot get the support of their Deputies.  They would have been better off not to compromise, to take a majority decision, to bring in the Bill and stand on that rather than produce this nonsense of compromise and then be unable to carry it with their own supporters.  It is a sorry performance by the Government, and it is a particularly sorry performance by the self-styled liberals in, and supporting, the Government.  None of them can be very proud of the Bill and they can be less proud of the performance of the Government parties in their attitude to the Bill in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consequence of the Supreme Court decision is that in the absence of legislation that decision constitutes the law and the consequence of that is unrestricted and unlimited right of importation of contraceptives.  In the <Col N="342" /> absence of a referendum to change the Constitution, that will continue to be the position unless this House alters it by legislation.  The Minister for Justice has made it clear that the Government have no intention of promoting the necessary legislation to enable a referendum to be held on this issue.  Even if he had indicated otherwise, we know a considerable length of time would elapse before it could take place and before any legal effect could be given to a decision of the people, whatever way this might go.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with the Minister for Justice in his approach to this matter but the practical effect is that we are now faced with a situation in which there is an unrestricted and unlimited right of importation of contraceptives. That is the legal position whether we like it or not.  The issue before the House in present circumstances and in the absence of a referendum is whether we want that to continue to be the legal position or whether we think that legal position should be restricted in some, or any, way and, if so, what kind of approach we should take to the restrictions.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier the Supreme Court in its judgment made it quite clear that while it was finding subsection (3) to be unconstitutional, it was not saying there was an unfettered right to import contraceptive with which the legislature could not interfere.  It specifically spelled out that restrictions imposed by the Legislature on this right of importation would be constitutional and in order in accordance with the public good provided such restrictions did not take away the right of married couples to have contraceptives available if they decided they wanted them.  Therefore, if we wish, there is nothing to prevent us limiting the effect of the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>It seems to me there is a very strong case for saying that we should limit the effect of the Supreme Court decision.  I do not believe&mdash;I think few people believe&mdash;that it would be satisfactory to let the legal position continue to be that there would be an <Col N="343" /> unrestricted and unlimited right of importation.  As was pointed out by Deputy O'Malley, one of the things that has been happening&mdash;perhaps on a less widespread scale than might have been expected, but, nevertheless, it is happening&mdash;is the distribution of leaflets advertising the availability of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>I have seen some of the leaflets that were delivered by hand to houses in Dublin and I have been told that they have been distributed also in public houses.  I do not have any personal knowledge of that but I have personal Knowledge of distribution of leaflets by hand in Dublin.  These leaflets wrongly state the legal consequences of the Supreme Court decision and they go on to invite people to order supplies of contraceptives from the particular manufacturers concerned. They will be supplied under plain cover, the subscriber being given a code number so that his or her name and address need not be used in further correspondence.  To me the whole business has an unsavoury air about it and I do not think it is the kind of situation any of us want to see operating.  Therefore, I am arguing that there is a very strong case for altering the legal position as it stands at the moment because of the Supreme Court judgment in the McGee case.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said he believed that if one read the Supreme Court judgment one could get the message that a prohibition on the sale of contraceptives would be held to be unconstitutional&mdash; those were not his exact words but that was the import of what he said.  With Deputy O'Malley, I would disagree with the Minister on that interpretation of the judgment.  Furthermore, it seems to be that number of provisions in the Bill are far from being necessary in the sense that the Minister for Justice used the word originally. Far from being necessary, as a result of the Supreme Court decision, in some instances, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, it really turns the Supreme Court decision on its head <Col N="344" /> because that decision was to the effect that a prohibition on the right to import contraceptives for personal use was unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>But this Bill virtually imposes a prohibition on the right to import contraceptives.  It goes on then to provide for the setting up of retail outlets for contraceptives throughout the country.  Nobody can argue seriously that it is necessary, as a result of the Supreme Court decision, to do that; there is nothing in the Supreme Court decision that obliges anybody to create that kind of network of retail outlets in this country.  It is a point of view that this is the way the problem should be tackled but certainly it is not something that is necessary as a consequence of the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>In section 4 there is a provision prohibiting the manufacture of contraceptives except under licence. There is nothing in the Supreme Court decision which makes that necessary.  Certainly one can argue&mdash; depending on what basic approach one takes to the kind of controls which ought to be introduced&mdash;very strongly that there ought not be any right to manufacture even under licence.  But whatever argument one makes, one cannot say that that is necessary as a result of the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>There is also in section 5 a prohibition on the purchase of contraceptives by unmarried persons.  I think that, by general consent, this is unenforceable and the Minister, I think, more or less admitted that in his speech but justified its inclusion on various grounds.  For myself, I would make it clear that, if such a provision could be enforced, I would favour it.  I certainly think&mdash;taking an overall view of the approach to public morality which is one of the obligations falling on us as legislators &mdash;it would be desirable that that prohibition be there.  But I do not believe it is enforceable.  There are grounds for believing that it may be unconstitutional.  I would not accept the Minister's argument that, even though it is unenforceable, it is worth including as indicating the <Col N="345" /> general attitude and approach on the part of the Legislature.  It seems to me that to legislate deliberately for something one knows cannot be enforced is merely bringing the law into disrepute.  It is a different thing if one enacts legislation one believes can be enforced and which one discovers afterwards cannot be enforced. Failure to repeal such legislation may be objectionable but, in my view, is by no means in the same category as deliberately enacting legislation which one knows, before one enacts it, cannot be enforced.  I think that that is something that is not alone futile in itself but something which is almost bound to bring both the law and the Houses of the Oireachtas into disrepute.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, amongst other anomalies in this Bill as it has emerged, the problem of married tourists coming into the country bringing with them a supply of contraceptives and thereby committing an offence.  Of course, under the provisions of the Bill, having committed the offence and paid whatever penalty was involved, then they can purchase contraceptives in the country.  Surely that is not a position which the Minister thinks is either desirable or defensible.  I would suggest that the whole approach to this problem on the part of the Government has been wrong and wrong for the reasons we have indicated.  We believe it is a consequence of a series of compromises between diametrically opposed views.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that there are other ways of dealing with this problem and, because the nature of the problem is as it is, no solution will be ideal.  But at least it is possible to approach it on a logical basis.  The start of one's topical approach to it is: what is the position now under the Supreme Court decision?  How does one apply the Supreme Court decision to the legislation of this country?  If one approaches it on that basis and does only such as is necessary or clearly consequential on that decision one will, I believe, end up with legislation which&mdash;while there will be objections to it from certain quarters&mdash;will be rational; will provide access to contraceptives <Col N="346" /> for married couples, as is prescribed by the Supreme Court to be a constitutional right but which will, at the same time, safeguard&mdash;as far as it is possible so to do&mdash;the whole tenor of public morality in this country.  We cannot deal with private morality in this Legislature.</P>
    <P>But I am not satisfied that the setting up of a chain of retail outlets for the sale of contraceptives throughout the country, as I said earlier, is either necessary or desirable as a result of the Supreme Court decision.  In fact, I think it is highly undesirable.  It does not seem to me to be at all necessary or desirable in order to implement the Supreme Court decision&mdash;while on the one hand providing the access which is a constitutional right and on the other, having regard to the general approach to public morality, in that context&mdash; to cover the country with retail outlets for the sale of contraceptives.  After all, what the Supreme Court has said &mdash;and this is the thing that one can be definite about whatever other nuances there may be in it on which one can express opinions&mdash;is this: that married couples have a constitutional right to reasonable access to contraceptives if, in conscience, they decide they want to exercise that right.  That is all that the Supreme Court has found as a matter of positive fact.  The only obligation on this House, in implementing that&mdash;if we decide that we should do something about not leaving it unrestricted and I believe we should take that decision&mdash;is to ensure that that right is available to those to whom the Supreme Court says it should be available.  Any further extension of that to the extent of producing a whole new industry, a whole new retail distribution system, which has the consequence of almost a social revolution, or could have, in the general approach to this problem of contraception is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I believe the constitutional rights of the people concerned can be well served without our producing this whole paraphernalia that seems to be a consequence of this Bill.  I believe also that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach was mistaken in the kind of criticism he made.  I know it was made quickly and without <Col N="347" /> giving adequate thought to what Deputy O'Malley has said or, perhaps, without having fully taken in what Deputy O'Malley said in regard to the making available through health boards of contraceptives.  The Parliamentary Secretary, I think, read into what Deputy O'Malley said, the making available of contraceptives through health boards to married couples and he read a lot into that. I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary will find when he looks at the record that Deputy O'Malley said that.</P>
    <P>What Deputy O'Malley was doing, having spelled out that it is not our job to provide or draft legislation for the Government, a job we do not intend to do, was suggesting that the Government might look at the making available of contraceptives, through health boards to certain categories of persons.  The drafting of legislation to do that is a matter for the Government but the point Deputy O'Malley is making is quite clear and it is a consequence of the Supreme Court decision.  Accessibility to contraceptives for those entitled to them under the Supreme Court decision must be ensured.  To do so almost of necessity involves the making available of contraceptives to people who would not otherwise have access to them. How is that done?  Is it to be done through chemists' shops or as is proposed in the Bill?  Is it possible that under the provisions of the Bill some of the family planning clinics which now exist might be licensees?</P>
    <P>I would be unhappy about the latter prospect in regard to some of these clinics.  Speaking only of some of them, they seem to be run by people who are operating on the proselytising basis propagating aims totally at variance with the ethics of the vast majority of the people of the country, north and south.  A number of them are anxious to promote abortion and euthanasia, things which are abhorrent to most people.  Therefore, I would be very concerned at the prospect of people like that being recipients of licences under this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, I am sure, will be telling the House about that.  I have no knowledge of that myself.</P>
      <P>It is clear that in so far as it is necessary for the State to make contraceptives available following on the Supreme Court decision to certain categories of persons it is desirable, and almost essential, that the machinery used to do that should be public machinery and not private.  I also believe that for many people the making available of contraceptives to them, if they wish to use them in accordance with their constitutional right, can be achieved much more simply than is provided for in this Bill and that it can be left to themselves to make their own arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I firmly believe that an approach by the Government based on the logic of the Supreme Court decision enacting only such things as are necessary to implement that decision, and consequential on that decision, is the right approach and the one which, while it will have opposition from both sides, will appeal to most people as being reasonable and rational and will serve this community best.  It will serve best to enable constitutional rights to be exercised on the one hand but not to have the exercise of that constitutional <Col N="349" /> right used as an excuse to propagate ideas of the kind I have referred to earlier, used as the thin end of the wedge.  Few of us in this House want to see that and we have an obligation to ensure that it does not happen.  We can do so if we approach the problem quite differently from the way it is approached in this Bill.</P>
    <P>For that reason I, like Deputy O'Malley, am opposed to this Bill and for the benefit of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach I can tell him that the decision made by our party was that the Whip would be applied to whatever decision we took, and it will be applied.  There would, perhaps, be more reason for an Opposition to give a free vote in this or any other circumstances but we do not think that is the right approach.  In particular, we feel that the failure of the Government Parties to apply the Whip to implement the kind of legislation which the Minister for Justice says is necessary is a deplorable abdication of responsibility by the Government.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned we believe that this Bill is unenforceable and illogical.  We believe that it is such because of the series of unfortunate compromises in the Government and that, having achieved those compromises, it is even more deplorable that the Government cannot carry it amongst their own Deputies.  The Bill, apart from what it illustrates about the Government approach, is not in the public interest.  Indeed, it has elements in it which potentially could be very damaging to the public interest of this country.  Alternative approaches are available, not necessarily the ones that we have touched on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply want to put certain things on the record because this is not a subject I have spoken on before.  Perhaps we have a talent in this country for making enormous and at times ridiculous issues of things that are neither very big not inherently ridiculous.  This is a serious issue.  The private debate, inside people's own heads and inside <Col N="353" /> families, about contraception is clearly and in a world wide sense a huge debate and one that concerns them very profoundly.  I do not think, in the second half of the 20th century, that the matter of the reasonable availability in a mixed community of contraceptives should be a big issue at all in the legal sense&mdash;huge in the private sense obviously and in many places apart from Ireland.  It is the tradition in a place like this that we debate and that means that we do not just fire off our own opinions but that we listen to what the other side says and try to react to that.  Inevitably, because I have been in the House since the debate started, these reactions will be a little incoherent. Nonetheless, we ought at least try to talk to each other and listen to each other.  We seem to have a consensus on both sides that some legislation is necessary.  Deputy O'Malley opened for the Opposition and he spent a lot of time talking about a survey of public opinion which is not an issue of much moment either way, whatever the rights and wrongs of it, and I have not the least interest in pursuing it.  Then he went on to talk about the responsibility of the Government, the matter of a free vote, why it was that the Bill was listed now.  In fact, he talked about almost everything except the Bill itself.  When he did get to the Bill he was extremely sneering.  Perhaps it is a thing he finds easy to do, I do not know.  The Bill, he said, is a joke.  When it came to demonstrating why it was a joke there was tremendous silence.  We heard from Deputy Colley afterwards that it had been given a detailed analysis and criticism by Deputy O'Malley who opened for the Opposition.  Those of us who listened to him know that is not so.  He was anxious to talk about a variety of things but not about the content of the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point I would like to make in regard to what he said.  He raised a point about the sort of availability which ought to exist, which I will come back on, although I disagree with him, and about the possibility of importation by tourists and private individuals for their own use being prohibited.  I am not an expert on the <Col N="354" /> law and I do not think that is the Bill's intention but if it is prohibited it clearly should not be.  I do not think anyone who supports the passage of the Bill would object to an amendment on that.  We could put down amendments ourselves if he has pinpointed a small defect in it.  There are defects in many Bills and in many cases they are not matters of football between the two sides of the House.  Many of them find consensus and do not have to be forced on the House or on the public at large by one side.  Many of them commend themselves as reasonable things to do.  If it is a defect it is a minor one and it is easy to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy offered us, without reading from notes and without detailed notes that I could see&mdash;this is not criticism of him being a lawyer but he is a lawyer by training and not a scientist &mdash;in the area of abortifacients and the distinction between abortifacients and contraceptives, confident and rapid scientific opinion.  I had better declare my own background in this to try to validate my criticism.  I am originally a veterinarian, an academic, one all my life.  I also have a Bachelor of Science degree in physiology and biochemistry in a British university, where I would claim in the course of that particular degree subject my study of human reproduction and the biochemistry of contraceptives and abortifacients was more detailed than in the normal medical course, the B.Sc. degree in medical science in the University of London.  I am that; he is a lawyer; each of us is our own thing.  The things he said rapidly and confidently are of a scientific kind in my view&mdash;I do not want to talk positive science without a good deal of detailed study&mdash;and, were tendentious and inaccurate in many respects.  I do not think it is fair to the House for a lawyer, not reading from a prepared brief, to offer what purports to be hard scientific opinion when we could, with two minutes notice, get scientists of serious standing who would be prepared to say he is wrong.</P>
    <P>That is not the way to conduct a debate.  When you get into an area that appears to be technical then get technical but be sure that your technicalities are right and are not the use of <Col N="355" /> big words to confuse people.  I do not want to make too much of the Opposition's speeches because there was very little in them of discussion of the Bill. There was nothing of what we ought to do in a positive and constructive sense to get out of a difficulty.  I am using the word &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; because it is not a secret that there is a difficulty. I will not amplify on what Deputy John Kelly said because I do not think it is routine for Deputies on the same side of the House to compliment each other.  However, I found him extremely effective.  He made a devastating speech of criticism of the point of view of the Opposition.  He dealt with a good deal of the difficulty both frankly and well.</P>
    <P>We certainly have a difficulty and we have people on our side of the House who hold opinions different from the majority.  The same is true of the Opposition.  Why do we have to have this monolithic pretence when we know it does violence to the fact? I know members of the Opposition who in conversation very much agree with me&mdash;I am not going to name them&mdash;and I know Deputies on the Opposition side of this House, who, before the McGee judgment struck down bits of existing law, broke that law for many years as I did.  We all know them.  There is a difficulty for the whole of this country which has already brought us some ridicule and mockery around the world as well as very serious internal difficulties.</P>
    <P>Let us talk a little about this concept of a free vote because it is not something this Government have invented and the Opposition are saying it is ridiculous and not permissible. The concept of a free vote is very deep in the whole history of Parliament, not just in this Parliament but in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, from which many Parliaments of the world are buds. There are issues which transcend the unity of parties.  I do not mean the next thing abusively.  I mean it totally seriously as I am not trying to score a point.  The thought that parties have to be totally monolithic and that they must not admit divisions among themselves and, therefore, where real <Col N="356" /> divisions exist, which cannot be resolved, you do nothing because you dare not admit they are there, strikes me as a carry-over from war and not from politics.  I think that is a civil war carry-over.  It is trying to force Irish political parties into a monolithic form which does violence to real democracy and which finds its roots in totally different parties.  It is bad for democracy to propagate the idea that parties do not have wings, divisions, conflicts that they are monolithic, that in all circumstances if you cannot put the Whip on and deliver everyone of your votes you have lost your validity or lost your mandate. That is a bad argument which is bad for democracy.  It does not correspond to the evaluation of political parties in many countries of the world.</P>
    <P>Let us take the Japanese scene, where they are not strikingly unsuccessful in managing their affairs. They do not have that concept of political parties at all.  Neither do the Italians nor does the USA.  In Britain both parties can have their pressure groups and wings.  Why should we do violence to the consciences either of this side of the House, which we are going to do, or why in the name of some monolithic thing and of a unity that was perhaps forged in much more bitter times, 50 years ago, coerce in public people we know dissent in private?  We know that across the floor of this House there is enough human communication on a frank and blunt level between Government and Opposition, whoever is in and whoever is out.  We like each other and trust each other enough to talk to each other freely.  We know there are people now on the Opposition side who, when in Government would like to have changed the law and they were ashamed of it and now that they are in Opposition would like to change the law in a progressive, generous and liberal way.  Why the myth?  Why not talk about issues that are real difficulties for us?  Why should we talk about them in the fictional way which some people have been doing?</P>
    <P>We have a difficulty and a mess.  I do not mean this abusively and I am <Col N="357" /> not trying to score a point.  We failed to take a stand on what I consider to be a basic civil right in a country that talked about bringing in the North of Ireland, that talked about national unity, that talked about 1,000,000 Protestants in the North who could trust us to build a milieu where they would not be coerced.  The failure to face that, and having legislation which was never criticised by a Government party who were in power for a long time and the failure to raise a debate on it, there is the mess, there is the difficulty.</P>
    <P>The state of our public opinion, the state of obscurantism, the state of ignorance about contraception, the false belief that it poses a threat to family life and to the fabric of society, the failure to tackle these things, is a failure over a very long period of the people now in Opposition, and they cannot escape it.  We have been in power for nearly a year and a half. We have had this decision by the Supreme Court for a little while.  The mess we are in nationally about legislating on contraception without great excitement and hoo-ha is a mess which all political parties made.  I am not saying it is a mess the Fianna Fáil Government made.  We all made it. We all failed to raise it as a debate and to educate public opinion, but the people who were in power have a greater failure than the people who were in Opposition.  That is the reality of where we are at.</P>
    <P>I am trying not to be politically abusive, but it seems to me that the statement that we have to whip our people and get this thing through and, if not, we ought to resign, makes a party football out of something which ought not to be a party football.  It is moving the debate away from what it ought to be, which is how much contraception should you have in a pluralist society, to a debate about the validity of coalition.  This is an argument we have had before and we will have it again.  The electorate will deliberate on it many times, and sometimes they will be in favour of coalition, and sometimes against it. It is an on-going thing, but it is not the core of this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> The histrionics of Deputy Colley about this ring false to me because he appreciates the complexity of the situation as well as anybody on this side. In his personal capacity he is a humane and liberal person.  I do not want to go on about the little issues, about the question of whether tourists, be they married or unmarried, can bring in packets of contraceptives for their own use.  That is a piece of small print and, if the Bill is foolish about it nobody will object to changing it.  That can be done perfectly easily.  I do not think the Bill is wrong but I should like to hear the lawyers and the experts saying whether it is.  Let us not have histrionics about something of that scale and magnitude.  We have not had a serious critique of the Bill itself.  We have not had a serious alternative to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me now briefly put my own beliefs on the line and then say something about the Bill itself.  I was interested to hear health mentioned. When Deputy O'Malley was walking this tightrope between knockabout farce and the spine-thrilling tragedy of the small gombeen man in the West of Ireland and whether he could sell contraceptives, we got ourselves into a ridiculous position.  At this moment I do not want to talk about the Bill.  I want to talk about my own convictions on the whole contraceptives issue. When we were told Deputies would be embarrassed by people coming to them for contraceptives and that people would be embarrassed to go to the gombeen man&mdash;I am not using that term abusively&mdash;or to a person who was not a chemist to get contraceptives, I wondered were we living in the same country and in the same century.</P>
    <P>I heard health advocated as a basis for having the right of access to contraceptives. A wife's nerves might be gone because of the fear of getting pregnant again, or a man's nerves might be wrecked because he could not have intercourse with his wife because she was afraid of getting pregnant.  Of course, those are grounds for contraception but the people who want availability of contraceptives want them for vastly more numerous and positive reasons than the ground of <Col N="359" /> health.  The ground of health is only a marginal reason so far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>I think that the right to knowledge about contraceptives and contraceptives themselves is a basic human right.  The practice of contraception so far as I am concerned&mdash;and I want it on the record of the House&mdash;is a positive good.  It is not something for patching up families under stress because they have too many children.  Deciding the timing of children and the size of the family, separating the act of intercourse from size of family, is a liberation of mankind.  It is progressive and desirable.  I realise that is not the generality of opinion in this country but it is my opinion and it is well that it should be said clearly.</P>
    <P>About that last sentence which I have just used, certainly there is disagreement on the Government side. Not too many people agree with me about that.  That is not a secret.  We are grown up and we can talk about the scales and nuances of this issue. I know from reasonably trusting and frank personal conversations that there is exactly the same thing on the opposite side.  I want to see contraceptives and contraceptive knowledge widely available in this country.  Not having any expert knowledge, but simply from reading about the controversy which exists in this and many other countries, I believe that inside Catholicism, as I understand it, there is a profound and genuine confusion. There are serious and expert people of great standing in the Catholic Church who differ.  I think the desire for free availability of contraceptives is widespread among Catholics.  I know it is widespread among Protestants North and South.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that, from reading about controversies I know that in Ireland and in other countries there are people of profound sincerity and great stature inside Catholicism who have differing opinions.  I therefore conclude that the problem is complex and permits of a number of interpretations.  That is all I am saying.  I am not offering my own judgment.  I am saying that is a matter of observation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, there are many Catholics who consider that this is a right.  In the case of Protestants, North and South, it is not a matter of making a territorial claim.  It is a matter of saying that if you want to talk about unity at any stage and you want to build trust, you must not pass laws that exclude one million odd people in the North, anymore than you pass laws that pressurise Protestants down here, if they are 5 per cent, or whatever they are.  There is a Jewish community in this country who have rights.  When we talk about people's rights on the basis of religion, we assume that there are no people who have no religion.  Even if people are embarrassed by writing down that they have no religion, in the census there is a section who have no religion.  There are some of them among the young, if one talks to the young.  There are many people who have no religion and they have rights, and morals, and attitudes, and rights to draw conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What made our difficulties, and what was so dangerous in our previous approach to contraception, was that there was a section of the community in the past&mdash;and I do not hear them shouting loudly for change at the moment; I wish I did&mdash;who were willing to use the law to force their moral judgments on people who were honourable, respected, valid citizens who the majority knew did not share their views.  The Parliamentary <Col N="361" /> Secretary to the Taoiseach said it was enforcing a code of morality by the criminal law.</P>
    <P>The willingness to do that seems to me to be very much of a piece with attitudes of forcing people to change their religious beliefs by law and by the power of the whole State which produced immense destruction and damage in the history of Europe and of many other countries.  This willingness to use the law against valid people whom you know disagree with you has been a source of terrible division and destruction.  So also in this country.  It is paternalistic.  It is contemptuous of individual conscience, individual dignity, the individual right to make a decision.  Therefore, what existed in the past and what was unchallenged by any of the major parties, including my own for a long time, was a fundamental denial of what I mean by democracy, and was profoundly damaging to something that I desire very much, which is national unity.  The existence of such laws was fundamentally diversive and authoritarian, anti-democratic.  I am profoundly happy that the Supreme Court struck down a piece of one of the things I find most offensive&mdash;not all of it, because the Supreme Court gave a bit of a judgment and other bits, as people in the Opposition said, were not final judgments, judgments that suggested we might have a challenge, we might get another answer.  I would not read that Supreme Court judgment with the eye of a lawyer.  Bits of it were clear, bits of it not clear, bits of it calling for action&mdash;not a final thing.  But, because we have had this radiation from the major parties and from major religious opinion in the country which I have indicated I disapprove of and think mistaken and damaging to Ireland, because we have had that position and because we have now had a Supreme Court judgment, partial, not final&mdash;Supreme Court judgments are never as final and do not solve problems in the way we would like them to do&mdash;we got a bit of progress.</P>
    <P>But we do have chaos and it is agreed that we have chaos.  I have <Col N="362" /> some evidence of advertising of the offering of contraceptives for door-to-door sale.  We all agree that we have a position where you have to do something about it because you cannot leave it the way it is.  I affirm, whether other people agree or not, that it is not easy because of our past and because of the extremist propaganda approach to the question of contraceptives from one side that has marked our country for many decades.  Deputy Colley referred to a proselytising attitude of the people in favour of contraceptive clinics.  There has been a misinformed extremist proselytising attitude on the part of the anti-contraceptive side. It has happened much more from the anti-contraceptive side than the pro-contraceptive side.</P>
    <P>That is where we are at.  What do we do?  We have a Bill to try to make some sort of sense of the shambles. If you said about any Bill that ever was that it was not totally satisfactory everybody would answer yes.  Anybody who tries as a Minister to set out the heads of what is wanted knows that it then goes off to the experts and then to the Parliamentary Draftsmen. Anybody who has looked at the process of generating a bit of legislation knows that it is temporary, partial, difficult, imprecise and that when you are finished you are not satisfied with it and you also know that its period of validity is temporary because things change.  That is taken as read by the people in the Opposition who know that better than we do because their spokesmen have a lot more experience of being Ministers than we on this side have.  That is known to everybody. OK, so, it is not perfect.  So, it makes some sense of a shambles which has to be sorted out.  There are bits of it that could be done better perhaps, in which case let us amend them and I would urge on the Minister for Justice that if real issues are uncovered in this debate, he should accept amendments and my guess is that he will do this if there seems to be anything emerging from the Fianna Fáil Opposition when it comes to the Bill itself as distinct from the inadequacies of the idea of coalition or the inadequacies of the idea of a <Col N="363" /> free vote or things like that&mdash;fine general stuff&mdash;if there is anything in their opposition, if it should not be chemists' shops, should it be health clinics?  I prefer chemists' shops because I am in favour of a wider rather than a narrower distribution. Unless there are tremendously good reasons for being restrictive on this sort of issue as we evolve into Europe it is better to be roughly comparable to other countries rather than to adopt very local attitudes.</P>
    <P>If it was to be thought that we would use the structures of the health services through the country in a positive way to promote family planning knowledge and the availability of family planning equipment in family planning clinics for those who wanted it&mdash;nothing is being forced on those who do not want it&mdash;I would have thought that was progressive thinking. I do not think it is viewed by the Opposition in that sense.  I think they view it in a restrictive sense.  I prefer the chemists' shops.  I know they will not all stock them.</P>
    <P>The knock-about of Deputy O'Malley as regards people in the West of Ireland who would have to write to the Minister for Justice for permission to get contraceptives if there was no adjacent chemists' shop neither terrified nor persuaded anybody. The application to the Minister for Justice in cases like this will be used with the same sort of judgment and wit and restraint and common sense that Government Departments and Ministers use in adjudging all these things.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of cases the application never reaches the Minister. It will be adjudged by common sense, neutral, detached civil servants in a practical way.  There is no terror there. When all the rodomontade is swept aside and the suggestion that we have somehow lost validity because we are not going to put a whip on and try to coerce people, the only thing left is should it be a health clinic or should it be a chemist's shop.  Personally I prefer both.  I would like to see the health clinic used in an active way.</P>
    <P>What I am looking for is something which makes a little sense of the situation, <Col N="364" /> which brings some legislation into existence where there is currently chaos.  I accept that this Bill does not go as far as I want to go.  I do not like the distinction between married and unmarried in this case, if people want an example of what I do not like.</P>

That is not the consensus of the advice of the Minister for Justice.  His advice is that it is O.K.  It may be that it is unconstitutional.  That would be decided in due course, whether it is or not.  I think that is a restriction which in certain instances is a denial of civil rights to people who are not married, who have a stable relationship and who want contraceptives.  I believe they have that right and for what the Opposition or anybody else can make out of that I am quite happy to declare that publicly and have it on the record of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer this Bill to the suggestions about health clinics because they would be in my conviction used in the most restrictive possible way in some instances, in the areas of some health authorities, and <Col N="365" /> it would be non-uniform in its application through the country and also since we will never have as many health clinics as we ought to have and we have chemist's shops it would be a restriction on easy availability to those married couples who want it.  I, therefore, prefer our compromise.  It is less than I want.</P>
      <P>No Bill is ever exactly what every Deputy who votes for it wants.  It is a reasonable compromise, a reasonable way out of a mess, which recognises the balance of opinion in the country and recognises that there is a strong hostile public, as I do.  I do not want to carry out what I want because I realise that it does not have a balance of support in the country but in regard to getting a practical, sensible Bill like this that will solve the problem, I think there is a consensus in the country to do it.  I think there is a majority in this House to do it if we put together the people on both sides who want it.  I think that the denial of the carrying out of what I believe to be the public will and the majority will of this House by the trick of a party political kind of suggesting that no use of a free vote is permissible and suggesting that it is the duty at all times of an Opposition to be as destructive as possible and to fish in troubled waters as much as possible &mdash; I think that denial of the majority that could exist here in acknowledging the majority of opinion in the country as a political manoeuvre by Fianna Fáil will be so seen and so judged by the people.  I believe that for the legislation now offered, giving the sort of controls now offered, though it is not perfect &mdash; and no legislation ever is &mdash; there is a majority of support in the country, and that were the real will of the elected Deputies of this House allowed to emerge there would be a majority here as well.  The thwarting of that is the thwarting of democracy.  It is the making of party issues more important than fundamental democratic issues, and it is on the way to a denial of democracy, and is anti-democratic.</P>

      <P>Apart from the Minister himself, I think I am the first <Col N="366" /> speaker in this debate to represent a predominantly rural constituency and I have no doubt that before the debate concludes many others will have the opportunity of contributing as well.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce seems to have presumed that the Fianna Fáil approach to this Bill is entirely a political manoeuvre. While I would hope he would be here to listen to what I have to say on the matter, he will have the opportunity of reading the record.  I hope he will realise that we recognise the difficulties in this question, that we recognise there are matters of private conscience involved and that there are public attitudes of morality to be taken into account also, and that it is quite difficult to reconcile the protection and promotion of the private conscience with the public morality that may be current throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless it is our responsibility here to deal with society and the standards of society to promote the standards of that society, allowing for the right of individuals to adhere to their conscience and to avail themselves of what they regard as civil rights.  It is particularly the obligation of the Government to introduce legislation in any area which will have desirable social effects.  This is done every day in this House.  It is our responsibility as the Opposition for the time being to look at the legislation which they introduce and to see whether or not, in our view, it conforms to those criteria as protecting the general standards of society whatever area it is in, whether it is social welfare or other legislation.  If we feel that it has failed to do so, it is equally our responsibility to say so clearly.  It is because we believe this legislation has failed to do so that we now say so clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I, in the first instance, deal with the matter that has been raised earlier but just from the point of view of clarifying some thoughts which seem to have been confused in the course of the debate.  Deputy John Kelly expressed what I would accept as a sincere conviction as to the difficulty which a Government <Col N="367" /> Whip would have in being placed in a position like that.  In particular he referred to the difficulty of forcing Deputy Oliver Flanagan, or someone like that &mdash; he did name him so I am sure Deputy Flanagan will not mind if I repeat the name &mdash; to vote with him on a matter that he objects to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's point.  In fact I asked the Parliamentary Secretary why he should name the Deputy, but none the less he did.  The decision of the Government for a free vote in this case was taken before this Bill was prepared and published.  I want to ask the Government if they recognise that a Bill of this nature has significant social consequences for good or ill, and obviously the purposes of the Bill must be for good.  Is it not recognised as important that the Bill as presented would be considered by the parties, that if it did not meet the wishes of the parties comprising the Government for the time being, that then they would come back and reconsider it, but that they would try to reach a consensus on a matter of such vital importance?  However, this Government announced on 13th February in a statement from the Government Information Service:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government has decided, consequent on the recent Supreme Court decision in relation to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, to introduce a Bill to provide for the necessary change in legislation arising out of that decision.  It is the Government's intention to <Col N="368" /> provide for a free vote in relation to the passage of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore the decision on the free vote was taken well in advance of the publication of the Bill, and any suggestion that it is on this Bill that the principle was determined is quite wrong and inaccurate.  Is it suggested by the Government that in relation to a Bill of this nature which is dealing with a sensitive area the principle of a free vote is desirable and would be promoted by the Government?  We on this side take the view that legislation dealing with sensitive areas like this are of such significance that they should be considered in great detail and should be promoted by the Government with all the authority that the Government have.  After all the consultations the Government should have undertaken, it should be presented to this House as being the considered view of the Government and their supporters.  There is obviously a great gap in the Government's thinking in this matter, because they seem to have come to the conclusion that any legislation dealing with this type of area should be dealt with under the free vote and that they can thereby relieve themselves of the responsibility of noting public standards of morality and, at the same time, taking into account the rights of the private individual in each particular case.  I would be interested to hear, when the Minister replies, on what basis he can justify the decision of a free vote in these circumstances in advance of the publication and the study of any Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of conscience before party.  Unless the Minister and the Deputies opposite, are prepared to say to me that this type of area is not something on which there should be full consultation in the party rooms, and on which there should not be full study before the <Col N="369" /> Bill is introduced, to enable Deputies who disagree, allowing for the information which the Minister may give them, to express their views then or through their Government members, I could not accept that there should be a free vote on such legislation.  We have an obligation placed on us here to legislate for society and we cannot run away from that in the areas that may be difficult or sensitive, which, I regret to say, seems to be the attitude of the Government in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has pointed out, differences of opinion among many individuals here. What he has said is true, that there are many people here on opposite sides who share views which are different from those of other members of their own party.  But there is and there must be a consensus about what public order is, and there is and should be also a consensus about what private conscience is, and it is because of the failure of this legislation here to cope with that that we are opposing it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce complained at some length that we did not say very much about the Bill, that we spent most of the time trying to take political advantage from the Bill.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce spent no time whatever dealing with the Bill, with the exception of saying that he preferred distribution through chemists' shops rather than our proposal.  Therefore I do not think it is reasonable or fair to imply that we are the only ones expressing what he suggests are personal views or views attempting to win political favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may have come a long way from the platonic notion of society where it was regarded as being the function of the legislator to promote virtue.  We may not be &mdash; I am sure we are not&mdash;able to distinguish between what is virtuous and what is not, but we are at least capable, and must be capable, of acknowledging broadly what the standards of our <Col N="370" /> society are and we must promote and direct those standards.  That is our function in this legislature and that is our function in this legislation.</P>
    <P>In discussing a Bill of this sort, therefore, there is great need to take a sympathetic and tolerant view of the differences of opinion that exist. Private behaviour varies from individual to individual.  We all of us come from a single stream of tradition more or less and the private behaviour of many individuals will probably conform to a large extent.  Public morality is a different matter entirely from private morality and, in that context, it is the function of the legislature to take account of the history and traditions of the State as a whole.  That history and those traditions would include religion and other things.</P>
    <P>To illustrate: what would be good law in Mohammedan society, where polygamy is traditional, would be bad law in a Christian society.  All these aspects must, therefore, be taken into account when we come to introducing legislation in an area of this kind. Our Constitution provides for freedom of religious conscience and practice and our laws must respect that provision and we must, therefore, endeavour to implement that provision in our Constitution.  The views of the minority creeds must, in other words, be respected and they must not be in any way obstructed or impeded by any legislation we may pass here.  We are not the judges of right or wrong in this or any other legislation.  Neither can we be the judges of who is or who is not a conscientious objector.  I am not now trying to make it difficult for the Government in the stand they have taken.  I believe they made a mistake months ago and the reaction has proved that.  We have now reached the ludicrous point at which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach says that only those who satisfy him they are conscientious objectors will be allowed to vote against the Bill. If the passage of legislation is to be dependent on the judgement, decision and tolerance of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach we have indeed reached a pretty pass.  If he is to decide who may or may not vote <Col N="371" /> for or against a Bill that clearly indicates just how ambiguous and untenable is the approach of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Flanagan would definitely qualify within the particular category; in fact the Parliamentary Secretary stated so definitely.  The Minister said we should make up our minds on the issues here, not by looking over our shoulders to find out what our constituents think, but by forming our own conclusions. It would be the function, then, of someone on the Government benches to decide whether or not a Deputy is voting against because he is a conscientious objector or because of his concern about his voting <Col N="372" /> strength in his constituency.  I do not think that sort of judgement is the function of any person here and we must, for good or ill, rely on the statements of the Members of this House as to their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Another statement of the Parliamentary Secretary's indicates the frustration he feels because the Government have to take this responsibility at this particular time.  I recognise it is a difficult position.  If we were in Government it would be a difficult position for us.  The Parliamentary Secretary said we &ldquo;sat on the damn thing for 20 years&rdquo;&mdash;I am quoting him <i>ipsissima verba</i>&mdash;and that demonstrates not just a sense of appreciation of the difficulty but a sense of total frustration, almost of impatience, because the Government have now to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>There is such a thing, nebulous though it may be, of the quality of life.  I am speaking now of social aspects.  It is our function to find out what the quality of life represents and to promote the standards of our society to ensure the protection of that quality of life.  There are people who will look at other countries and who will say that this is a happier country even though we may not have the same social advantages or the same resources available to us; this is a happier country because we have somehow adhered to principles, sometimes involving discipline and also involving a recognition of certain worthwhile aspects in our society.  I have met many people outside of this country who say that the consistency of our attitudes towards social and moral principles is something they find unique and strangely attractive by comparison with other countries.  I am not now making any value judgment between us and other countries.  I am not arguing that we are holier or better than any other country because of higher standards of discipline and morality.  I am merely pointing out these views are held and there may be some justification for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is the function of the Government to take all these things into account, because of the definite <Col N="373" /> cleavage of opinion, and not just on this particular Bill, and because of a difference in attitudes within the Government as to what represent desirable social standards, a clash of almost, shall I say, ideologies has emerged, perhaps unfortunately, in this legislation.  Because of that the Government have introduced what I know many members of the Opposition recognise to be a compromise.  We all cherish the fact that we do not quote what is said in private in the House, but it is a widely recognised fact that this piece of legislation is a compromise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that politics is a business of compromise.  But this legislation is a compromise in many ways between what are irreconcilable views.  That is why we have this hotch-potch which does not satisfy anybody. The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that he would prefer the distribution of contraceptives through the pharmaceutical outlets rather than through the health boards, the agencies of the State.  He said that this would lead to a wider distribution through a wider variety of outlets.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary categorically stated that it was nonsense to suggest that all 1,500 registered chemists would seek licences under this legislation.  He went so far as to say that in his view if 50 sought licences this would be the maximum. In other words, the Parliamentary Secretary thinks this is a way of restricting the sale of contraceptives.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks it is a way of widely promoting the sale of contraceptives.  Each has come to a conclusion but for two different reasons.  This is what I mean by the irreconcilable attitudes which exist in matters of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say when he replies. He may interpret what we say in a flippant manner.  The Bill contains provision for licensing traders where no licensed chemist is available.  That <Col N="374" /> is a fact.  The Bill also contains a right to get a licence from the Minister or to apply to the Minister for a licence where neither one nor the other is available.  These are the facts and they can be interpreted as one wishes.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not in the social interest. In small communities it will cause reactions between chemists, traders and others not only who will get business of this nature but because one &mdash; even though he may be a man of high standards &mdash; may deal in contraceptives, while another chemist stands firmly for what he recognises to be right.  &ldquo;It is good to have chemists who will not be used by any liberals to supply contraceptives to those who wish to have them.&rdquo;  Does the Minister think that that reaction is possible in rural Ireland?  If so, does he think it desirable to create that division between professional people, a division which the Parliamentary Secretary acknowledged must be there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Northern Ireland later, although it is not relevant here.  It may be said that we raised this point simply for the sake of ridicule.  I presume the Minister, if he is to act in accordance with the Bill, would have to seriously entertain an application for a licence from a trader in a remote part of Ireland. If there are two traders in a village and only one applied for a licence, is the Minister suggesting that there will not be a reaction in the community?  That is why we think it is a State responsibility to introduce legislation of this sort.  Equally it is a State responsibility to supervise and control the distribution of contraceptives and thereby ensure that there will be no division or reaction within society, particularly in the remote areas of rural Ireland.  This is obviously what the Minister had in mind when framing certain sections in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In a matter of this sort where people, for better <Col N="375" /> or for worse, have strongly held convictions, it comes ill of any of us or anyone who talks about what we do here, to take a flippant attitude to this.  I have often thought that it would benefit us if we travelled north more often.  We would then recognise the different attitudes there, understand a little more what they think and recognise that what they think may be a carbon copy of what we think here, but for different reasons. We might even recognise in their prejudices a carbon copy of our prejudices, but for different reasons.  It might be desirable that people from the North should travel to the South and talk to the people of rural Ireland to see just how sincerely they hold their views.  In doing so, they would recognise that they should be sympathetic to their views while, at the same time having the obligation to correct the views if they are wrong or give a sense of leadership if such be their responsibility.</P>
    <P>Many people hold a strong conviction that the dangers in the contraceptives laws will have serious consequences. Some might even go so far as to say that they will be a curse on the country.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister says &ldquo;not to look over our shoulders&rdquo; that he is not suggesting we should not take into account the views of our constituents. I presume he means that we should not look to what their electoral support will be for us.  As public representatives, one of our functions is to keep in contact with social attitudes through whatever channels are at our disposal and try to take account and give effect to the standards we meet in society at large in the legislation we introduce here.  I hope he does not think we should ignore anything we heard in our constituencies.  In fact, I believe that his speech would have been better for the omission of that particular reference, coming as it did at the very end.</P>
    <P>I should like to discuss the options open to the Government as a consequence of the McGee decision. There were a number of options but not all of them were equally desirable. <Col N="376" /> The first option was to do nothing, and allow the position as it stands at present&mdash;the free importation of contraceptives&mdash;to continue.  That could have been done.  Some people who opposed legislation in this area think that that is what they should do.  They seem to think that by doing nothing the Government will be restricting the importation of contraceptives.  Of course, the opposite is the case.  Nevertheless it was an option which, quite rightly, the Government rejected. Another option which they had was one which has been promoted from time to time.  It was to say: &ldquo;Right; it is the function of the Supreme Court.&rdquo;  They are not just lawyers who give an opinion, as was implied by someone here this morning.  They are the judges established under our Constitution to interpret whether in this instance the laws we enact are in conformity with the Constitution. Their function is as important as ours. In so far as the judges have interpreted the present law as inconsistent with the Constitution, another way of approaching the matter would be to change the Constitution or to allow the people the possibility of doing so by way of referendum.  The Government have clearly rejected that possibility. They might have said we would endeavour to conform with the general guidelines of the Supreme Court while recognising our obligation to introduce legislation consistent with that judgment.  However they did not do so.  Instead, they introduced the fourth alternative, namely, their own legislation which is a very unhappy and unworkable compromise.</P>

      <P>In the EEC Council Resolution <Col N="377" /> of 21st January, 1974, concerning a social action programme it is stated that to carry out the actions proposed in the resolution, the necessary resources should be provided, in particular by strengthening the role of the European Social Fund.  It is my expressed view that for the carrying out of these actions a greater amount of Community resources must be devoted to social expenditure, either through the medium of the Social Fund or otherwise.  The Commission however, have not to date made specific proposals in this area.</P>

      <P>Each of a married couple whose combined weekly means do not exceed £8&mdash;£10 from Friday, 5th July, 1974&mdash;would be entitled to a maximum old age (non-contributory) pension.  It is immaterial whether these means are derived from capital, a small farm, part-time employment, contributions from sons or daughters or any other source.  This is in accordance with declared Government policy progressively to ease the means test.</P>
      <P>This year's budget provided for substantial increases in the rates of old age (non-contributory) pension and, in addition, provision has been made for an increase of pension for the dependent wife or husband under pension age of a pensioner.  Further changes in the rates of pension are not at present contemplated.</P>

Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider it fair that a married couple who have an income of £9.90 should get the same level of pension as those whose income is nil?

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The determination of the title of any person to payment of unemployment benefit, in a trade dispute situation, including a lock-out or otherwise, is not a matter for me.  Such decisions are a statutory function of deciding and appeals officers appointed for the purpose under the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>Three claims to unemployment benefit recently made by busmen affected by the present shut-down of the CIE bus service in Dublin city were submitted to a deciding officer as test cases.  The deciding officer disallowed the claims on the ground that the claimants did not satisfy the provisions of section 17 (2) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, as amended, governing receipt of unemployment benefit where employment has been lost by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute at the place of employment.  One of these cases was brought to appeal in pursuance of a contention of lock-out.  The appeals officer confirmed the disqualification for benefit in that case following an oral hearing at which the claimant concerned and his trade union representative attended and gave evidence.</P>

In so far as my Department are concerned, I am aware that certificates of reasonable value were refused in respect of three different prices proposed for houses on the site concerned and that, following the third refusal, the builders informed the Department that they were withdrawing their application for a certificate.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to sort out a simple problem here.  Anyway, the Minister knows what I am getting at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that a number of builders appear to have agreed to provide houses at a price and have asked subsequently for a higher price, after a deposit has been paid and, in some cases, asked for more than one change in the price.  The Department of Local Government, on numerous occasions issued a notice.  I think the last time it appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> and the other morning papers was on the 3rd May, 1974.  I have a copy of <i>The Irish Times</i> here in which there was a fairly sizeable notice: Housing Grants and House Prices: Notice to House Purchasers.  Paragraph 4 of that notice says:</P>
      <P>New house purchasers are strongly urged also in their own interest to see the certificate of reasonable value before they enter into commitment to purchase the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And under paragraph 3 of that notice the builder must display a fairly large notice.  It must measure at least four feet by four feet stating what is the certificate of reasonable value.  This is a matter entirely between the builder and the purchaser.  I would suggest <Col N="383" /> to prospective purchasers that they should not attempt to purchase a house under any circumstances without taking good legal advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a further question.  I think he has missed the whole point of my first one, that may have been because I was cut off in the middle of it.  Would the Minister not consider that provision should be made to oblige the person selling the house to inform the purchaser when applications for a certificate of reasonable value are being made?  A situation arose here in which a person paid a deposit and an application could have been made before that date for a certificate.  Yet that purchaser was not informed and the seller is not obliged under present law to inform him of this.  Subsequent applications could be made, following the handing over of the deposit, again without the purchaser being informed that an application had been made.  Would the Minister not agree that the seller should be obliged to inform the purchaser that certificates are being applied for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not solve the problem at all because the builder could just say to somebody who had, in fact, paid a deposit that he was applying for a further certificate or had applied for a further certificate. I think the proper thing to do is for the buyer to ensure that his rights are protected.  He can do this by seeking good legal advice and having a good legal contract.  But many people are prepared to hand over large sums to contractors, when they want a house, without any protection for themselves. My advice to them is to ensure that they know what they are buying and know the price at which they are buying it.  If they do that, there will not be any repetition of what Deputy Molloy is referring to here.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that, under the law as it stands at the moment, there is no obligation on the person who is selling the house to inform the purchaser that an application has been made for a certificate of reasonable value at the time he is paying the deposit and that, even though he thinks he is buying a £7,000 house, he may, in fact, be buying a £7,600 house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not agree with that because I have read out paragraphs 3 and 4 to Deputy Molloy. Paragraph 1 of that same notice says:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government wishes to remind purchasers of new houses that under the scheme for approval of new house prices, any builder or developer constructing a house in a scheme of four or more houses, being provided for sale must obtain a certificate of reasonable value before grants under the Housing Acts, will be allocated for the houses.</P>
      <P>The position is that anybody who sells a house, as a grant-aided house, must have a certificate of reasonable value. If he tells the person who is buying the house that he has a certificate, he must produce a four feet by four feet copy of it.  I think that should be sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter primarily for Dublin Corporation.  Recently I approved the corporation's tender proposal for 298 houses in Cherry Orchard.  These houses will adjoin the large existing park at Le Fanu <Col N="388" /> Road, Ballyfermot.  I am assured by the corporation that it is their intention to make generous provision for additional recreational facilities in the balance of the Cherry Orchard site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They must take the matter up with Dublin Corporation who are responsible for this matter. Out of courtesy I am giving Deputy Lemass the information which I have available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is misleading. He has just said he has approved of a tender for the erection of so many houses at the Cherry Orchard Estate.  In the event of the corporation approving of a planning application, have the individuals the right to appeal against it?  In this case the residents are not satisfied with the recreational facilities to be provided but can they appeal about this to the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Lemass understands that approving a tender is not the same thing.  I approved a tender for the erection of 298 houses on that estate and it is a matter for Dublin Corporation.  I suggest that Deputy Lemass who might be able to make representations to the corporation should do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>A person who applies to undergo a driving test is required to provide a vehicle sufficiently representative of the class in which he wishes to be tested.  The aim of this requirement is to ensure equality of test in that particular class.</P>
      <P>Class D vehicles include all commercial road vehicles of more than two tons unladen weight, including large articulated vehicles.  As about 60 per cent of vehicles in this class are over four tons unladen weight, it has been the normal practice to require an applicant for a class D test to provide a vehicle of at least this weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that some applicants for class D tests have difficulties in <Col N="390" /> obtaining a suitable vehicle for their test and I am at present reviewing the requirement that the vehicle provided must be at least four tons unladen weight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The new scheme for the reform of the personal income tax structure announced in the Budget is a comprehensive scheme involving</P>
      <P>(a)  the abolition of earned income relief and its replacement by increases in the personal allowances and by the introduction of a reduced rate of charge of 26 per cent on the first £1,550 of taxable income, and</P>
      <P>(b)  further substantial increases in the personal allowances.</P>
      <P>The machinery for giving effect to the various income tax allowances under the new scheme does not result in any gain to the Exchequer.  In fact, every taxpayer without exception gains appreciably and the cost to the Exchequer of the scheme is £17.65 million in the nine months to December, 1974 and £32.1 million in a full year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it would be quite incorrect.  I will illustrate the problem in this way.  If income tax were to be abolished altogether, it could be said that every mortgagor was suffering a disadvantage because they would no longer be able to set off mortgage interest against the non-existent income tax.  When the rate of income tax is reduced, in a similar way it can be argued that, theoretically <Col N="400" /> speaking, the advantage is not as great as previously but the truth is that every income tax payer, including those who have house mortgages, benefit as a consequence of the changes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the greatest percentage reduction in income tax falls to people in the lower income group who are receiving up to ten times a higher percentage reduction in their previous tax load than people in the upper income group.  It may be that some people, in fact most people, have not yet received amended income tax certificates.  This is because we will have to await the passing of the Finance Bill before those certificates can issue.  Once they are issued the benefits will apply from the commencement of the financial year to the end, which will mean that towards the end of this year the reductions will be quite significant and very apparent.</P>

      <P>No.  It is very difficult to explain an individual's tax position to the individual himself and more difficult to talk in generalities across the House, but two illustrations might help to indicate how people have misread the situation.  There were two cases quoted in correspondence in the newspapers in April last.  One purported to show a tax loss to a taxpayer of £16.  In fact, there was a gain <Col N="401" /> to that taxpayer of £38.60.  In a second case it was suggested that there was a loss of £8.86 when, in fact, there was a gain of £31.39.

My question was directed to the persons mentioned in Question No. 19.

The second thing he is seeking is the subsidising of fertilisers. <Col N="403" /> He should know that there is very substantial subsidisation of fertilisers at present.  The third thing he is seeking is the de-rating of land.  There is very substantial monetary assistance being provided for the de-rating of land.  It is more than ever before.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that there will possibly be a further large increase in the price of fertilisers it is coming to the point with quite a number of farmers whether it will be economic to put fertilisers on their land in the coming years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Encouraged by the success which has attended the warble fly eradication effort over the past three years, the main farming organisations have asked for one further national dressing campaign against the pest.  I, too, am satisfied that given the full co-operation of all concerned in such a campaign the level of infestation, which in May of this year was at the extremely low figure of 1 per cent of cattle examined, could be reduced still further.  Exemption of the herds in any particular area from the statutory dressing requirement would undoubtedly lead to demands from other parts of the country for a similar concession and under such conditions herdowner participation to the degree necessary to assure the success of the campaign would be impossible to secure.  There is a further consideration of particular concern to herdowners in County Donegal and that is the requirement of the Northern Ireland authorities that all cattle entering that area must be accompanied by official warble dressing certificates. My reply to the Deputy's question must accordingly be in the negative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are consequential. The point was made by Deputy Colley, which I said I would look at and was very glad to accept, that the Bill as originally drafted would have meant that if the State participated in the development of a mine the benefit which we intended to confer on the developers to set off exploration expenditure would be denied because of the division of ownership of the development mine. It was never our intention so to provide. We, therefore, have amended the Bill in the manner set out in these two recommendations and Seanad Éireann accepted the amendments which will ensure that if the State participates in a mine the right to set off exploration expenditure against income tax liability will not as a consequence be denied to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in the Seanad, and I repeat, that the Government are most anxious to encourage and in every way to facilitate participation by the State in the development of our mines and we see these amendments as providing no disincentive but we trust they may be interpreted as being an incentive <Col N="417" /> to people engaged in the mining industry to encourage and to invite State participation which they will find will be readily forthcoming.  I therefore recommend the recommendations for acceptance by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am naturally pleased that the Minister accepted my advice on the points involved here.

We must be grateful for small mercies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that I am.  I am confining myself to what is before the House, as I know the Ceann Comhairle would want me to do.  It is important that we should make clear that not alone will we not put any obstacle in the way of State participation in mining in this country but that we want actively to encourage it because with the changed circumstances in mining over the years, to which I have adverted in the previous discussion on this Bill, changed circumstances brought about largely as a result of the legislation which was enacted by previous Governments, it seems to me to be very possible and, indeed, very desirable that the State would participate in a joint venture or joint ventures in future in mining. Therefore, these recommendations, although they do not go to the root of the whole matter, certainly do not inhibit State intervention and may, as the Minister says, encourage it.  I am quite pleased that the Minister listened to me on this point at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, one matter that I am somewhat concerned with.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to reassure me on it.  I am assuming that this matter was looked into and that the drafting before us is considered to be the best way to do what is required.  In both cases where there is a reference to the ordinary share capital of any body corporate acquired by a Minister of State on the face of it seems to mean that a Minister of State must actually acquire the capital. <Col N="418" /> I would envisage in the normal way that what would happen would be that if a State company in which, perhaps, the Minister would hold the share capital or the bulk of it&mdash;although there are cases where it is not constituted in that way; it may be under his control but it would not have share capital&mdash;is the instrument by which the State participates in mining in a joint venture with private enterprise, on the face of it that would appear to mean that the share capital of the body corporate to which we are referring here would be held by the State company and not by the Minister of State.  Of course, in a case where the State company&mdash;I am not using that term loosely&mdash;is not a a limited liability company but is a creation of statute under the control of a Minister, it would seem on the face of it again that the whole position might not be covered as envisaged in this recommendation if that body were to acquire portion of the share capital in a body corporate operating a joint venture mining operation between the State and private enterprise.</P>
    <P>It may be that the reading of these recommendations on their face gives that impression but that, in fact, if one analyses them that is not the position.  I would hope that the position is not as I have outlined it and that the Minister will be able to reassure me that in these kinds of cases which, as I say, are the most likely where one can envisage the State participating in mining with private enterprise, these recommendations as drafted will achieve what I recommended and what the Minister wants to achieve.  As I say, on the face of it, it does not appear to me to be quite clear that this wording is doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there would be any point at this stage in postulating the establishment of a State holding company, which I think is what Deputy Colley has in mind, perhaps specifically directed to mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not thinking of that.  The Minister is right; this could be, but I was thinking more in terms of Bord na Móna or some organisation like that participating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="419" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a reconstituted Mianraí Teoranta or something like that.  That, of course, is a possibility, but what we would visualise at the moment by way of State participation would be that a Minister would directly be a holder of shares in a mining company.  We do not, in relation to this matter for the time being at any rate, consider that we should set up a separate company in which the Minister for Finance or some other Minister would be the owner.  If it comes to be decided at some time in the future that there should be such a holding company or a company specifically and entirely concerned with the development of mines, we would visualise that we could meet the situation by amending legislation.  However, we should not for the time being, when we have not got such an entity in being, proceed to draft legislation on a purely hypothetical basis.  This will ensure that direct State participation will not deny to the developers the benefit which the legislation intended to confer upon people as an incentive to future exploration.  It could be said that we need not have provided this amendment at all in this Bill, that we could have awaited participation by the State and brought in legislation which could have conferred this benefit retrospectively, but I accepted the suggestion of Deputy Colley that it would be appropriate to do it at this time, and that is exactly what I have done.  It does not close the door at all to the possibility which Deputy Colley has suggested, and, as I say, that raises a much larger question which we would not be able to decide at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, pursuant to Section 5 (2) of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, Statute LXXXVIII of University College, Cork, which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 27th May, 1974, and the following parts of University College, Cork Statute LXXXV which was also laid before Dáil Éireann on 27th May, 1974:</P>
      <P>(a)  Paragraphs (1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of Chapter I of the Schedule to that Statute, and</P>
      <P>(b)  Part I and paragraphs (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of part II of the Appendix to the Schedule to that Statute</P>
      <P>be and are hereby disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this motion is that the proposed amendments to University College, Cork's pension scheme would introduce superannuation conditions which are more generous than those applicable to the public service generally.  Since 1971 there has been <Col N="422" /> correspondence and discussion between my Department and the college authorities on the matter.</P>
    <P>The existing pension scheme provides a choice to a participant between a maximum pension of two-thirds of salary at retirement without a lump sum or a maximum pension of half salary plus a maximum lump sum equal to one-and-a-half times salary.  These benefits are in line with those normally found in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Statute LXXXV proposed that a participant would receive a maximum pension of two-thirds of his retiring salary plus a maximum lump sum equivalent to twice his retiring salary, the amount of the lump sum to be reduced by 10 per cent for each year's service after age 65.  Alternatively, a participant might choose to commute a portion of his annual pension in which case he would receive a maximum lump sum on retirement equal to one-and-a-half times his salary in addition to a maximum pension equivalent to half of his salary at retirement.</P>
    <P>The college authorities were informed that if the statute were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, without amendment, the Minister for Education would feel obliged to introduce a motion disallowing the relevant provisions.  The college authorities felt that they had no option but to agree to the amendment of statute LXXXV.  The Governing Body, therefore, made statute LXXXVIII the provisions of which gave a participant a choice between a maximum pension of two-thirds or a lump sum maximum of one-and-a-half times of retiring salary plus a maximum pension of half of retiring salary, and that in either case a lump sum equivalent to one year's salary would be payable also.</P>
    <P>This provision was also contested by the Department of Education on the grounds that it exceeded the provision obtaining in the public service generally and the college authorities were once again informed that if the statute were to be laid before the Oireachtas the Minister would have to introduce a motion to disallow the parts that <Col N="423" /> were regarded as being substantially out of line with public service superannuation conditions generally.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, there has been correspondence and discussion on this matter since 1971, and the long delay in laying both statutes before the Oireachtas is due to the reluctance of the Minister for Education to introduce a motion to disallow the parts-of the statutes about which there is disagreement.  The college authorities have, however, insisted on the statutory presentation of the statutes to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I have had no option, therefore, in the circumstances but to introduce this motion.  I do so reluctantly.  Our university institutions hold a respected place in our society.  As institutions they enjoy a much prized autonomy. That autonomy, however, is not so unrestricted that they can be permitted to determine superannuation conditions which are more generous than those which apply in the public sector.  Improvement in superannuation benefits is, of course, effected from time to time but the question inevitably arises of the assessment of an appropriate contribution to be made by the beneficiaries.  The superannuation scheme in UCC is non-contributory and no provision has been made in the statutes in question for any contribution to be made for the additional benefits which the college seeks to introduce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one minor complaint that the statutes 85 and 88 were laid before the House on 27th May but until the day before yesterday I had no indication of what the Minister's intentions were in regard to them.  This side of the House fully accept the necessity for rationalisation of pensions and relating them to various allied or similar occupations. The fact that the governing body of University College, Cork, took such care in constructing statutes 85 and 88 shows that they are concerned with their pension scheme.  There must be in the governing body a conviction that the pension scheme as it exists is in some way unsatisfactory to <Col N="424" /> their staff.  Within the general principle that this side of the House accepts the necessity for a proper, rationalised system of pensions, and with due regard to allied occupations, I would suggest to the Minister that he should invite the governing body to formulate a further statute to make effective a pension scheme for the staff of University College, Cork, which will be regarded by the governing body as a suitable one.  Indeed, in the invitation, I would suggest that the Minister should state that he is inviting them to formulate a scheme that will be in no way inferior to any scheme in operation at the moment for a university or university college. The principle that guides this side of the House in this matter is the one I have already enunciated in connection with the relationship to other pension schemes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> First, I should like to thank Deputy Brennan, the Opposition spokesman, for his welcome for this Bill and for a constructive and interesting speech which ranged quite widely over quite a few areas of our economic history. I should like to add my voice to that of Deputy Brennan and Deputy Briscoe in complementing the officers of Córas Tráchtála.  I said in my opening speech that Córas Tráchtála has 15 overseas offices.  In my period in office I have had the pleasure of visiting eight of them and what we found in Córas Tráchtála, in the Industrial Development Authority, in WIRS and, indeed, in Bord Fáilte and other similar agencies, is a measure of the maturity of the country.  We all welcome the fact that we have people of real vigour and real professional expertise, people who make an extremely good impression in comparison with similar agencies in other countries.  I have had them complimented to me many times by other nationals.  It is a pleasure to record this and it is a pleasure to find the same opinion expressed on both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan and I are at one in the need for experts.  We have a small economy, in some ways a fragile economy, peripheral, delicate in some ways, and this is a major source of concern in the evolving free trade circumstances Deputy Brennan described last night.  At the same time we have real vigour.  We have in many areas people of entrepreneurial flair, courage and dash.  We have an export record which is a source of pride throughout the whole country.  When one has export success one recognises that the inputs come from very many sources and I am pleased that the general recognition of the role of Córas Tráchtála in this regard has been a successful one.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Brennan turned to the difficulties of the present he was talking about something that constitutes a headache for everyone, for people in the Government, people in the various semi-State agencies, for people in industry and for the community as a whole.  In many ways this is a quite exceptional and desperate <Col N="426" /> time.  There has been nothing quite like it economically since the end of the war.  We have a world-wide raging inflation.  I welcome, as much as Deputy Brennan, the sign that commodity prices have topped out and are now, hopefully, declining a little.  We have had the extraordinary speculation in commodities.  We have even had some material shortages.  We have interest rates at world historic high levels.  We have the uncertainties that are damaging, as one sees, very acutely, for example, in Britain, to investment confidence and, therefore, to actual investment.</P>
    <P>We have recently passed through oil shortages.  Apart from the question of price, there is the possibility that this danger may recur.  We have a whole collection of things&mdash;stagnation with inflation, with material shortages, with commodity speculation, with world high interest rates, with investment uncertainties and, indeed, with stock market collapse that has cut very deeply into the resources of many potential investors.  Now we see in the United Kingdom, which remains our biggest market although there is a welcome diversification away from a lopsided dependence on it, the danger of a recession.  Indeed, we already know that some of our exporters into that market are experiencing difficulty. We have this great difficulty of forecasting, which is not confined to Ireland but is worldwide, at a time when all the rules are breaking down and all the economists' pet theories are being put in doubt.  This also is not confined to us.  In the most recent issue of <i>Business Week</i>, an American business magazine, there was a comparison by major US forecasters between the forecasts they made six months ago and the actual outrun. The only thing common to the top 100 forecasts in regard to their economy was the extent of their error.</P>
    <P>This is an exceptionally difficult time.  In regard to our volume of exports and the tremendous efforts made to cope with these difficulties, we have had a great response from our people. This shows our economic, industrial and exporting maturity because the <Col N="427" /> people of Ireland, who are not faced with these difficulties all the time, are not even recognising to the full extent the crisis which exists in the world. It has disrupted other countries more than it has disrupted ours.</P>
    <P>It is also proper to pay tribute to an activity in which CTT participated at the worst of the time of shortage, of three-day weeks in Britain and the oil shortage.  We had a hasty &ldquo;lash-up&rdquo;, to use slang, of <i>ad hoc</i> organisation between the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Industrial Development Authority and Córas Tráchtála, both of which latter organisations had a network spread throughout the world to identify shortages of raw materials and then to use that mechanism in which CTT played a very useful part, to put our industrial consumers in contact with suppliers in world markets.  Although we got down to desperate shortages at certain moments when supplies of raw materials were at a very low level, we lost very little production because this lash-up mechanism with the Confederation and two semi-State bodies worked very well.  All of the participants are to be complimented for keeping the wheels turning and for keeping employment and exports up.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of our maturity&mdash; and I am not claiming any Government, personal or Department of Industry and Commerce credit for this &mdash;that at this moment we are coming through tremendous upheavals very well.  Inflation is savage and world-wide. Very recently one of the reporting agencies on prices, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, put out statistics for the OECD countries which include countries other than the large Community countries.  In the table showing the rate of inflation in 1971, we ranked third from the top.  For the most recent 12-month period for which figures are available we ranked eighth from the top.  In other words, instead of being the third most rapidly inflating of all their listed countries which we were three years ago, we are now the eighth most rapidly inflating country.  That is not to minimise <Col N="428" /> the terrible perils and, indeed, the hardships on the poorer sections of the community, on which inflation bears most heavily, but it is to claim that in comparison with other competitor countries our position is not remaining the same.  It is not getting worse but, in fact, is getting better when measured against other comparable countries.  This is not a cause for self-congratulation but it leaves something which one can advance as evidence that the measures we are taking in a desperate situation are having some significant and, in fact, quantifiable degree of success, though not nearly as much as we would like.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with two points which were made by Deputy Brennan and Deputy Briscoe.  Since I have been talking about inflation I will deal with Deputy Brennan's point first.  I do not purport to quote his words exactly but I understood him to say that wage demands constituted the biggest contribution to domestic inflation.  I do not want to disagree with him totally and say that is not true.  There are always a number of causes of domestic inflation from one year to another, and from one country to another. The primary cause varies from year to year and from place to place.  In other words, I do not agree that it is possible to say, in regard to Ireland for example, that in the recent past, wage demands constitute the biggest contribution to domestic inflation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is properly drawing attention to a real problem.  If we cannot continue to get a calm wages situation, and if we cannot get National Wage Agreements in the future, it is thinkable that wage demands might become the biggest single contributor to domestic inflation. I have no doubt, and I am satisfied that there are unanswerable figures to validate the point I am about to make, that in the past two years the major contributor to domestic inflation was the high cost of imported oil and other raw materials.  I hope the day will not come when wage demands in Ireland are the biggest cause of domestic inflation, but it is possible that it will come.  It certainly has not been so in the recent past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> For the record of the trade union movement and, as I see it, justice towards the sense of responsibility being shown by workers in their operating of National Wage Agreements, I disagree with that analysis. Imported inflation was due to the cost sometimes of speculation in commodities and sometimes the action of the Arab States about oil prices.  I have no doubt that over the past few years this raging inflation has been the cause of imported price inflation and not a cost push inflation as a result of workers' demands.  That is not a matter of contention but I wanted to get it on the record.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe asked if the actual sum of money recommended in the Bill was cumulative.  It is.  That sum of money dates from the first Act of 1959.  The total of £15 million has not yet been expended; £13,800,885 has been expended to date and the balance is due to be expended.  This would exhaust the £15 million.  We are adding £10 million.  We have to do that from time to time by an Act of the Oireachtas to give us the power to make an annual allocation to Córas Tráchtála.  The £10 million addition, if it is approved, will not be given to Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening speech, the actual grant-in-aid provision to be made in each financial year of this amount will, of course, be included in the Vote for my Department which will come before the Dáil in the ordinary way.  In other words, there is a double mechanism.  One has to give the general right to Córas Tráchtála to receive these moneys.  Then one has to allocate them by the annual Vote year by year.  The total is a cumulative total since the inception of Córas Tráchtála under the Export Promotion Acts.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify what I said regarding wage demands being the most important single factor in domestic inflation.  I was not including imported inflation but was referring only to conditions obtaining at home.  The Minister mentioned export prices but he was dealing with inflation in a more general way.  I was referring to matters on the domestic scene.  If wage demands on the domestic scene go beyond a certain percentage and are not justified by increased output they can result in a serious inflationary situation.  This does not always appear to be understood by employees.  When I say employees, I mean people in receipt of incomes at any level, whether professionals or otherwise.  As I interpret it, unduly high wage demands on the domestic front are the biggest single factor in domestic inflation.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the further financing of the <Col N="431" /> Shannon Free Airport Development Company, Limited by extending the limits contained in the current legislation. The Bill provides for:</P>
    <P>(1)  An increase from £17 million to £25 million in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares of the company;</P>
    <P>(2)  An increase from £10 million to £17 million in the aggregate amount of grants, voted annually, which may be made to the company, and</P>
    <P>(3)  An increase from £10 million to £17 million in the existing statutory limits on repayable advances by the Minister for Finance for the provision of houses and community services.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company, Limited, was set up in 1959 to promote the increased use of Shannon Airport for passenger and freight traffic and for tourist, commercial and industrial purposes in order to offset the prospect of the diminishing importance of Shannon as a transit airport because of the transition to longer range aircraft.  Successful industrial development at Shannon in the succeeding years and the promotion of substantial tourist traffic through Shannon resulted in the company's original aim of maintaining the airport being modified to that of using the airport as a major asset in regional economic development.  In April, 1968, the industrial development functions of the company were extended to include the adjoining Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary region (the Mid-West Region).  The company's present aim can be summarised as being the economic development of the entire region for which the continued development of Shannon is an essential feature.</P>
    <P>Share capital subscribed to the company is used for capital expenditure on the industrial estate at Shannon, on factory buildings and ancillary works in the mid-west region and a small percentage is used on projects relating to tourism.</P>
    <P>Repayable advances are used for <Col N="432" /> capital expenditure on housing and community services at Shannon.  The houses are provided by the company to rent or to purchase and developed sites are also made available for persons wishing to build their own houses and for speculative building.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid moneys are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to industries including grants towards factory buildings, new machinery and the training of workers on the Shannon Industrial Estate.  A substantial part of the company's running expenses arises from tourism promotion and this is met by a special grant-in-aid for which the Minister for Transport and Power is accountable but which, nevertheless, comes within the overall limitation in section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The finances provided to the company under existing legislation, SFADCo Ltd. Acts 1959 to 1970, up to 31st March, 1974, were as follows: Share capital £14,604,500; Repayable advances £10,000,000; Grant-in-aid £8,360,150.</P>
    <P>The balances available for further issue on 31st March, 1974 under existing statutory provision were: Share capital £2,395,500; Repayable advances Nil; Grant-in-aid £1,639,850. The existing limit of £10 million for repayable advances has been reached and there are no funds available under this heading to meet requirements for the current financial year.  The balances available in the case of share capital and grant-in-aid will be sufficient to meet anticipated expenditure under these headings in the current nine-month period to 31st December, 1974, only.  It is accordingly necessary to introduce new legislation to raise the existing limits.</P>
    <P>The normal practice when submitting proposals to increase the limits under the statutory heads is to relate such increases to the amounts required to cover the company's operations for a reasonable period ahead, so as to afford a further opportunity of reviewing the activities of the company at a relatively early stage.  The present proposals have been drawn up on this basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> It is essential that the company should be provided with the financial resources up to the limits now proposed to enable it to consolidate the progress already made and to provide for further orderly development in the future in the various activities assigned to it by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision for share capital, additional benefits by way of grants and repayable advances come under three headings.  The question of repayable advances is a matter of urgency and, according to the Minister, the items in the other headings also demand urgent attention in that the available limits are sufficient only until the end of the current financial year.  I do not propose to impede the progress of this measure through the House so that the necessary provisions may be made as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Bill comes immediately after the Córas Tráchtála provisions.  I think the Minister for Finance, later today, will be making further provision for the industrial credit operation. They are all very much in the same group; tending towards the same purpose and arising out of the same causes.  As everybody can understand, the extra money is necessary due to inflationary trends and the more costly budgeting resulting therefrom, and to provide for expansion and increased activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shannon Free Airport was a unique experiment in this country; it was one viewed by many people with a good deal of misgivings at the time.  With hindsight one can say it was justified; it was worth trying and I think we must have learned a lot from it.  I think I am correct in saying that most of the firms setting up at Shannon were foreign.  Many of them brought to this country a type of production hitherto unheard of.  We had the pleasure of being conducted on tours over the SFADCo organisation or complex of projects a number of times.  It was really revealing to see the variety of goods produced there, from textiles to pianos and various <Col N="434" /> other things far removed from anything that I would say home enterprise or any of our own entrepreneurs would have thought of, particularly in so far as we would certainly lack the know-how and perhaps the necessary capital and marketing organisation to justify their production here.</P>
    <P>Some doubts have been cast recently on the percentage of foreign industry and of foreign investment coming in. All of us were interested in Father Sweeney's publication, based on university graduate research, into foreign investment in the country and the extent to which foreign industries are rooted here.  I never really had any worries about foreign industries coming here.  The worst that can be said about them is that a certain amount of outflow of capital results from foreign investment.  That is inevitable but the important thing is that they do generate industrial activity which is bound to rub off on local enterprise.  Many of these generate a lot of ancillary industries which would not have come into being were they not here.  On the whole, I think we have nothing to worry about regarding the influx of foreign industry or foreign capital into this country.  In fact, our industrial development might not be nearly as rapid were it left entirely to our own industrial adventurers, who did an excellent job.</P>
    <P>Father Sweeney tends to argue in his publication that the fact that they were coming in here in reasonably large numbers had the effect of our own people sitting back and saying: Well that has been done; the need to expand the others was not so evident; necessity, very often, creates a good deal of activity and tends to seek answers; the necessity not being there, the void is being filled by other people coming in.  That was the line of reasoning taken in Father Sweeney's report.</P>
    <P>Professor Fogarty had a further publication on the same lines which had, I think, very much the same summing up as regards foreign investment. I think Shannon Free Airport, or SFADCo, as the company has come to be known, is a typical example of the benefit to be derived from foreign <Col N="435" /> investment.  On the whole, I think foreign industrialists coming into this country did have the effect of getting our own people&mdash;who are devoid of any industrial background or tradition&mdash;to appreciate what it was possible to do.  Irish workers proved to be adaptable in any job at which they were put and this encouraged many of our people who heretofore might not have believed it was possible for people engaged in farming to be adapted to industrial development.</P>
    <P>I never had any doubts about this. One of the wonders of my life has always been that our emigrants&mdash;I have seen it in my own county where there is perhaps a greater example than in any other; many of my own relatives, immediate and others&mdash;when they left the small farms, emigrated to the United States or Australia and went into the highly industrialised towns hardly ever settled down on land.  Few of them even took the free acreage offered to them in the bush in Australia in the old days; they preferred to go right to the heart of the industrialised cities.  They did prove they were adaptable and many of them became highly skilled.  Fortunately, most of them made good and are of tremendous benefit to the countries concerned.  I mention that merely as one of the early examples of how Irish labour could be adapted to the skills required in industrial production.</P>
    <P>But skills in industry have tended to become more and more technological as time progressed.  In setting up the AnCO training centres, we recognise the necessity for more and better training; more &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; training, as is being carried out by AnCO, in order to train people in these skills and enable them play their full part in the new industrial development of our country.  The time has long since passed when there is much place in our economy for a non-skilled worker.  I am not sure if it is in Professor Fogarty's or in Father Sweeney's monograph that there is development of the point that our educational system is based still <Col N="436" /> too much on the academic rather than on technological type training.  It has been said so often here, in other Estimate debates where it can be discussed more appropriately, that there is still over-crowding in professions; the old status symbol seems to be attached, unjustifiably, to academic training and the seeking of professional careers rather than the more profitable&mdash; much more open, and where many more opportunities exist&mdash;technological world.  I think our universities and those in charge of our educational system would be doing an excellent job were they to ensure that the slant was towards the technological rather than the academic in our training and, particularly, on the managerial side.</P>
    <P>I do not think many professional people find their way into industry and the number taking a science degree is indicative of the demand there is for that type of employment in industry.  They have not always the managerial training which is essential and which should be part of their training if they are to apply their professional training to the life they take up in industrial development.</P>
    <P>When we talk about a lot of foreigners coming in here to set up industries we should try to ensure that the executive grade is available here, as far as is possible and that the many openings which must inevitably develop and multiply as time goes on are made known and provided for in the training in our colleges and universities. It is in this way that we will have the necessary executive personnel who must be of a very high standard to take their place in the competitive world of manufacturing.  By that means only can we provide the necessary personnel to ensure that we will have the people to take over the jobs being filled by foreign enterprises at present.  I do not say that foreign enterprises are unwelcome.</P>
    <P>This country lacked an industrial know-how and they did not have the capital necessary to develop as we would like.  One of the most important things about foreign companies and they are usually companies which <Col N="437" /> are established in different parts of the world, is that they have the marketing organisation to handle any new projects which they set up.  That is a tremendous advantage.  An Irish company often has to spend a lot of money on market research although they are getting good assistance from the different agencies established here. Nevertheless the fact remains that there is a tendency to grumble about too many foreigners coming in.</P>
    <P>The two publications to which I have referred are based on the possibility of an outflow of capital by way of profits from foreign industry and foreign investment which does eventually affect our own balance of payments. If we are to reduce that to the minimum we must prepare our own personnel to take part in industrial development to the maximum extent possible.  Too frequently we hear it said rather glibly about the IDA that they are prepared to give grants to foreigners but are not prepared to give grants to locals.  This is completely wrong.  In fact, the opposite is the truth.  When a new industry is being established it has to be screened to the extent that some assurance is obtained that it will not flare up for a time and, after the value of the grants has been exhausted, it will collapse.</P>
    <P>Such industries must have a product which is saleable, be capable of producing it and have the marketing organisation to sell it.  Sometimes all these qualities are more readily available when a foreign concern moves in and for that reason they seem to get their grants and incentives easier than a native enterprise.  It is probably that which has given rise to the feeling that foreigners are treated better than our own people.  We have many notable examples of all-Irish sponsored industries doing well here.  They are sufficient in number to prove that we have reached the stage of having broken through the question of doubt that sometimes applies to our ability to deal with large-scale industry.  This was one of the features we had to fight against in the past.  That has been dispelled and there is no doubt any more about the capability of Irish <Col N="438" /> management and the skill of the personnel to make a success of an industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister, with his colleague the Minister for Labour, has a very important task and duty to ensure that skilled personnel are made available for new industries.  Apart from all the grants and tax reliefs this is one of the greatest incentives to new industries to set up here.  They should get it through to the people, young people in particular, that if they do not develop a skill there is very little place for them in the economy of this or any other country.  Whenever new centres of training were opened there was criticism from people who rather cynically asked what were we training these people for; was it for emigration.  My answer to that was that even if it came to the worst and they had to emigrate they were leaving the country skilled and able to do a better job.</P>
    <P>The more we train the better we fit our young people for life.  It would be much better than the scramble there is at present in the professions if young people directed their training towards technological training for which there are many more openings and for which many people are better suited.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Company is mainly a foreign industrial complex and speaking on this gives one an opportunity to refer to the question of training.  Those industries came to this country with good reputations throughout the world and this has encouraged others to set up elsewhere in this country.  If they were not native they came with skills which were useful.  They gave good example which resulted in the training of others here.  Generally they gave a much better industrial atmosphere than was here in the early days when we were struggling to get the industrial arm organised.</P>
    <P>The increase in industrial exports of manufactured goods has risen from a very low percentage of our total exports to take its place with agriculture and tourism as one of the most important branches of the economy we have.  We can look forward <Col N="439" /> to the time when it will fully absorb all the surplus labour that will be available particularly the school-leaving labour force which is the most in demand by new industry.  It should be obvious to the unemployed people of this country now that when a new industry moves into an area where there is a large number on the register of unemployed, the number of people signing on at the local exchange is depleted very little as a result of the new industry moving in. The younger people and the skilled and semi-skilled are most in demand.</P>
    <P>We made a lot of noises for a time about the importance of getting unemployed people to train in various skills.  I do not think we have made much progress in that direction.  I tried to get something going in my time and the present Minister has been talking about it.  One of the services we can give our unemployed is an opportunity to train in particular skills.  There is a shortage of skills in many areas.  I was often quite annoyed to find that we had to import welders from abroad for heavy engineering.  We went to the unions here, asked them to provide them and they were not available and we had to issue the necessary permits to Europeans to work here on engineering and construction work for which we did not have sufficient qualified personnel.  The question of apprenticeship is tied up with this, the number of people admitted to apprenticeship each year, and it is something in which the trade unions have a very important part to play.</P>
    <P>The success of Shannon Free Airport was most encouraging to industrail development in the country generally.  I would not expect the Minister to tell us off the cuff now but some time perhaps he would let us have information as to the effect of industrial concentration in an area like the Shannon.  The Buchanan Report recommended industrial poles and areas of industrial concentration. Many of us from the West of Ireland were not enthusiastic about that suggestion. We believe we have reached a stage where we should consider the <Col N="440" /> social aspect of industrial development just as much as getting men working, machinery moving and exports passing across the sea.  There is the question of a livelihood in the areas and environment in which people live and I always felt that, even though it might not lead to rapid development of industry, industry should be brought to the people rather than people brought to the industry. Buchanan stressed the importance of the self-generation of industry by having a concentration of industry in a particular area, that everything grows much more rapidly and the different industries tend to assist each other like a lot of people living in a shanty town where one assists the other. Some time, the Minister might tell us to what extent the Buchanan theory is borne out by the complex of industries at Shannon.  Has there been the effective generating of ancillary industries and other services that might not otherwise have come about or have the industries just existed as separate units?  The answer would not change my own conviction that industry should, as far as possible, be brought to the people rather than the people to the industry.</P>
    <P>I always thought it was a crime to see houses in the West of Ireland being closed up and the people coming into Dublin, going into the building industry here, getting married, living in flats and creating a housing problem in Dublin when many of the concerns they came to work in could have been brought to the west. Sufficient have been brought to justify what I am saying.  I was interested in publicity given recently to a scheme in Kerry where a special effort was being made to create off-farm employment. They were aiming at having small farmers coming to work, even part-time, in local industry.  If you have an industry in a rural area you can have a sufficient labour force recruited from the local small farms.  What they earn in industry, while cutting turf and doing some tillage at week-ends, makes the farms self-supporting. Wherever this is being carried out the small farms seem to improve simultaneously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> Research was done into that by two professors in two towns in Ireland, Tubbercurry and Scariff.  Their report was very interesting and enlightening showing the effect which industry has on a small rural village.  Industrial development along those lines is something which I would encourage and in which I would like the Minister to take a deep interest.  We have a culture of our own in the west of Ireland. We have a beautiful environment.  We do not want to send our people into the cities if we can bring employment within reasonable reach of them.  I know that many industries that come here must be in a particular area. Perhaps if we insisted on only the type of development I am talking about we might slow down our industrial development and the expansion of industry generally but there is no reason why both things cannot be done side by side.  Let those who insist on being in the large provincial centres and the cities remain there but as far as possible a greater incentive should be towards the underdeveloped areas. The 1945 Underdeveloped Areas Act was orientated towards doing that. After a time it was extended to cover other areas and eventually there was almost as much encouragement given to set up industries on the east coast as there was to set them up on the west coast.</P>
    <P>There has always been a drift away from the west.  The last two census of population showed that population in the east and in the south had greatly increased but while the position had greatly improved in some of the counties on the western seaboard the best we could say was that the decline was less than it had been.  This proves the need for decentralisation of industry, and greater incentives given towards encouraging people to bring industry to the west.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Scheme was a gigantic effort in that direction. The purpose was to keep Shannon Airport alive but the time may now have come when we should have a few further experiments of a similar type.  If the complex of industry is self-generating, and it has all the virtues that Buchanan would attribute to it in his examination of the problem, <Col N="442" /> then it might be worth while trying a few more experiments.  I do not wish to deny the east coast of anything they have but we would like to see industry concentrated in other areas.</P>
    <P>In many parts of the country we are a little envious of Shannon but we are delighted to see how successful it is.  We are all parochial in our outlook and we regret we have not a Shannon Free Airport Development Scheme in our areas.  I would like the Minister to let me know if any significant development in industry has been evident in the new area added to the original concept of the Shannon Free Airport area.  This takes in all the county of Limerick, Clare and part of Tipperary.  I do not know if that has had the effect of more concentration of industry in that area.</P>
    <P>The building of new towns in the Shannon area and the facilities for providing houses was a very interesting experiment.  When I toured this area I thought better planning could have gone into the siting and greater imagination could have been used in making the town and the built-up areas more attractive.  The social side of industry is very important.  We might sometimes be blinded by the need to get the wheels turning, the industry going, the exports and a better balance sheet for the nation but the family life of our people and their social life are factors which cannot be overlooked.  We have now reached the stage in industrial development where these should play a very important part in any future development of industry so long as it is not overdone to the extent of placing obstacles in the way.  As I said, we will not impede the passage of this Bill through the House which makes better provision through the three financial heads for the Shannon Free Airport area.</P>

      <P>Os rud é go bhfuil mo Dháil cheantar suite i réigiún na Sionainne is mian liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo.  Ar dtús cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo.  Bille a léiríonn go soiléir an dul chun cinn atá déanta ag Cumann Forbartha Aerphort na Sionainne ó chuireadh ar <Col N="443" /> bun é.  Tá dul chun cinn an mhaith déanta ag an gcomhlucht seo, ní amháin san tionscalaíocht ach comh mhaith leis sin san gcuairtaíocht agus forbairt go ginearálta ar fúd réigiún an mheán iarthair.  Dá bhrí sin tá an áthais orm an deis seo a ghlacadh chun Comhlucht Forbartha Aerphort na Sionainne a mholadh as ucht na dea-oibre a tá déanta agus atá á déanamh acu faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy who has the honour to represent the constituency situated in what has come to be known as the Shannon Region I feel it is only right and appropriate that I should avail myself of this opportunity to say a few words on this Bill, which has very major implications, not merely for the mid-western region but more particularly for the constituency which I have the honour to represent.  This new Bill introduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicates the progress which has been made by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, particularly in relation to the generation of industrial development throughout the region.  The scope of this Bill, of course, does not permit a discussion on the question of aviation <i>vis-à-vis</i> Shannon so I do not propose to break the rules by referring to aviation matters.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatsoever since the Shannon Free Airport Development Company was given additional responsibility for promoting industry, not merely in the Shannon Industrial Estate but also in counties Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary and Limerick city that great progress has been made. I do not know the figure for the number of jobs which have been created but I know it is several thousand.  I also understand that the projected employment targets for the five-year period between 1972 and 1977 was fixed approximately at 5,400 new jobs and all the indications now are, particularly in view of some very major industrial projects which have come on the pipeline in recent months, that this target will not merely be achieved but will be greatly exceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish very sincerely to compliment the Shannon Free Airport Development <Col N="444" /> Company on the dynamic and aggressive manner in which they tackled this additional responsibility of promoting industry in Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary.  I would particularly like to pay tribute to the Board of SFADCo, and to the management and staff, on the tremendous success they have achieved in securing the Alcan industry for the Shannon Estuary.  This is a very large industry. It is of tremendous significance not merely to the region itself from the employment point of view, but also from the point of view of the future development of the greatest natural asset in that region, the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>Now that SFADCo have made this major breakthrough in relation to the development of the Shannon Estuary, I am confident that further industry can be attracted to the Estuary and, more important still, that the Estuary as a deep sea port can be exploited and developed to its fullest potential.  I know that the Shannon Development Company are looking at the potential of the Estuary very carefully at present.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to a matter to which I referred on many occasions in this House down through the years.  There is no doubt that the Shannon Estuary, which is probably one of the greatest natural deep sea ports in Western Europe, offers tremendous scope for careful, imaginative developments.  I believe that Alcan will pave the way and will be the first step on the road to developing a major transhipment port in the Estuary.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the fact that the Shannon Development Company have been involved in another major industry.  Some days ago I had the honour and the privilege of turning the first sod for the major industrial complex at Clarecastle, of a major international pharmaceutical company, Syntex Limited.  Throughout Clare, Limerick County, Limerick City and North Tipperary there is adequate evidence of the successful work of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company backed up, of course, by the Industrial Development <Col N="445" /> Authority and the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill very sincerely on behalf of the people I represent in my constituency.  It is another milestone on the road forward for the Shannon region and the Shannon Development Company.  This Bill illustrates clearly, beyond yea or nay, the determination of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government to ensure, as the Minister put it very well in his concluding sentence, that the progress made to date will be consolidated and that further progress will be assured.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Gaeltacht I should like to avail of this opportunity to publicly thank the three members of the executive staff of the Shannon Development Company who formed part of the working group which produced the excellent report on Gaeltacht development <i>Gníomh don Ghaeltacht</i>.  I thank them for their work in the preparation of this very important report which has now been adopted as Government policy and which will take the shape of a new development authority, Udarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>The impact of the industrial development at the Shannon Industrial Estate, and the industrial development which is taking place throughout the mid-west region, has been very great. In fact, there has been a tremendous transformation in the life of the whole region, with new opportunities for employment being created, and opportunities being given to the young people in this region to obtain gainful employment which, in turn, is providing them with a decent standard of living.  It is the overall objective of Government policy, not merely to create employment, but to create employment of a kind which will ensure that our young boys and girls will be able to find a livelihood in their own region and enjoy a standard of living comparable to what they could get elsewhere.</P>
    <P>While aviation is outside the scope of this Bill it has relevance <i>vis-à-vis</i> another important aspect of the work of the Shannon Development Company in relation to tourism development. <Col N="446" /> In the field of tourism development the Shannon Development Company have displayed the same types of imaginative, dynamic approach as they displayed in the question of industrial development.  The castle tours were an imaginative concept and they have proved to be very good money spinners.  Even during the difficult period through which the Irish tourist industry has gone in recent years, the numbers attending the entertainments at the various castles administered by the Shannon Development Company have shown a continuous upward trend.</P>
    <P>I would hope that at this stage the Shannon Development Company which traditionally looked to the North American market as its main tourism market will look&mdash;as I know they did look last year and the year before&mdash;to the UK and to Europe. In 1972, in 1973 and again this year, SFADCo have been involved with the Shannonside regional tourism organisation and Bord Fáilte in operating a number of charter series from European centres into Shannon. These charter series have been highly successful and have generated a new tourism traffic into Shannon.  I would respectfully suggest that more attention might be given to developing tourism traffic from the UK and from the Continent of Europe into Shannon.</P>
    <P>The traffic figures from North America which, as I have already said, formed the backbone of the tourism traffic into Shannon over the years, continue to be of very great importance. I know that difficulties have been encountered in that market in recent times.  I am aware of the efforts made by SFADCo to counteract the various difficulties which arose.  I am very hopeful about the future of the Shannon region.  I have no doubt that the foundation for industrial development which has been laid by SFADCo, and the fact that they have succeeded in recent months in securing industries of the size of Alcan and Syntex, will lead to a prosperous future for the Shannon region.  I am sure that the prospects for the airport are quite bright.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> I have always held the view that the future of Shannon Airport depended on the development of the industrial and tourism and other potentials of the mid-western region.  It is valid to say also that the future of Shannon Airport is tied up not merely with the future of the Shannon region, the mid-western region, but also with the future of the west.  I regard Shannon as a key point and a major factor in the future development of the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Bille seo agus comhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire agus le Cómhlucht Forbartha Aerphort na Sionainne.  Tá súil agam go n-eiróidh leis an gCómhlucht an dul chun cinn céanna a dhéanamh ins na blianta atá romhainn amach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy for Clare, based on the mid-western region, I too, welcome the introduction of this Bill and I would like to express the thanks of the people in my constituency for the work that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company has done for the constituency and for the whole area.  We in Fianna Fáil have always been committed to the development of this region and I am glad that this Government are in their way showing their commitment and I hope that they will push ahead with the development which we have always stressed as important in the Shannon area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put on record the sentiments expressed by the chairman of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  He said about a year ago that the overall objective of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is clear.  It is to ensure the growth of Shannon Airport in trade, passengers and services and to create a healthy prosperity in the mid-west region through sound industrial development harmonising the necessary activities in industry, tourism and airport promotion and in town development so as to make the greatest possible contribution to the economy and the well-being of Ireland.  This sums up in a few sentences the philosophy of the Shannon Free Airport Development <Col N="448" /> Company and the commitment of this Government and of previous Governments to the development of this area.</P>
    <P>As many of the problems surrounding Shannon Airport have been resolved to my satisfaction.  I should like now to direct the attention of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to the western part of the county and especially to the western part of my constituency.  Down through the years there has been a genuine concern that many of the smaller towns in the west have been allowed to fall down and decay while a new town was being built in Shannon Airport. There are places like Miltown Malbay, Kilmihill, Curraciare, Ennistymon, Kilrush&mdash;not so bad&mdash;Crossan, Carrigaholt, which were allowed to fall down while the town was built in Shannon Airport.  I welcome the development of Shannon Airport but the development of the smaller towns could proceed simultaneously.  I would like the company to direct its attention more vigorously to the development and improvement of these poorer regions.</P>
    <P>One complaint has been that the infrastructure for the transportation and carriage of goods and telecommunications has not been good and that it is, therefore, difficult to induce industrialists to set up industries there. The shortage of a water supply was a problem.  With the completion of the West Clare regional water scheme that problem no longer exists.</P>
    <P>Many of us looked to the EEC regional fund.  It was one of the planks in our platform for entry to the EEC that grants could be obtained from the regional fund to extend the development that has taken place.  I am rather disappointed that the fund has not been available in the way that we would like.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company should consider the possibility of getting extra allocations from the regional fund. They should be in a position to make demands on that fund when the allocations are being made.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister for the Gaeltacht has mentioned the estuary because this is an area of tremendous potential.  I am glad that the Shannon <Col N="449" /> Free Airport Development Company with others have carried out a survey and have issued a report showing the areas of potential growth in the next few years.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to the problems of pollution that may arise and to ask them to keep this matter very much in mind.  We need industry and new jobs but not at any price.  The question of pollution should be kept in mind.  Every effort must be made to prevent polluting our most important waterway which could be spoiled if the problem of pollution is disregarded and if there is widespread industry from Limerick City to Loop Head.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the possibility of further development of the tourist areas.  I would like to direct the attention of Bord Fáilte and the tourist organisations to the seaside resorts on the western coast, for example, Kilkee and Lahinch.  These areas have suffered because of the decline in tourism.  There is a major hotel in Kilkee which has not been open for the past two years because it would not have been an economic proposition to open it.  I should like SFADCo and Bord Fáilte to examine these areas and to see if tourism can be developed there and to try to get tourists into the areas in far bigger numbers than has been the case in the past few years.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Brennan in regard to the training of workers. Investment in training is as important as investment in new machinery and techniques.  This is a matter which has not been fully investigated.  Money is available from the Social Fund.  I understand that AnCO have applied for funds.  If funds are available I would like SFADCo with AnCO and the other agencies to see that we get an adequate return from this fund.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, the IDA, AnCO, the regional development organisations, the county development teams and all the agencies who have played a tremendous part in the development of the area.  I would like to assure the <Col N="450" /> Minister and the Government that we will give any support they need to facilitate the development of the mid-west region, which is a pilot area which can be used as an example for other areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure to us who live in the west, particularly to those of us who live in Clare, to welcome this Bill which provides for an injection of an increased amount of capital.  We are glad that the Government have made this decision.  We welcome the initiative of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in seeing the necessity for making this provision because to date, despite the expansion which has taken place in the Shannon industrial estates and the triangular development of Shannon, Limerick and Ennis, which are termed growth areas, industrial expansion has not penetrated sufficiently into those areas where employment is needed more than in areas where the land wealth is greater.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill particularly because the imbalance which has shown itself can now be corrected.  The mass emigration from areas of high population which can now be described as areas of depopulation can now be arrested.  I welcome the Minister's intention to diversify and to permit a greater distribution of the fund which is now available to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company who are the promoting agency in this mid-western region covering Clare, Limerick and Tipperary.  The success which this company has had over the years has been noted by people outside this State and advantage has been taken of the expertise and the particular knowledge which the officers and executives of the company have in relation to the promotion of industry, the training of workers, the establishment of industrial estates and the development of factory sites and matters of this kind.  Even some of the Asiatic countries have sought the advice of the SFADCo officers and this in itself is testimony to the value placed on the expertise which these men in SFADCo have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am hopeful that this additional <Col N="451" /> money which is being made available and which the Minister is determined will be distributed fairly will penetrate into the areas to which I refer and which were referred to by my colleague, Deputy Daly.  Both of us are only too familiar with the long tale of woe which has bedevilled the western and northern part of our country over many years, resulting as I would say in a lack of confidence in agencies which heretofore have not been able to correct this imbalance and I look forward to a quick reaction to and a quick distribution of this money.  I can assure the House that the Minister has his eye on development in retarded areas and has a particular interest in seeing that undeveloped areas get their just share of moneys when they are available. The opportunity is now there. The agencies for promotion are geared and I look forward to seeing small industries, and even larger industries, in all the towns of north and west Clare, in the areas which to date have not shared in this national reindustrialisation.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that now that we have water schemes and adequate water supplies through all county Clare, and particularly to the west out to Loop Head area, there is no good excuse why industry could not be channelled right out to Loop Head. The Minister for the Gaeltacht referred to the great potential of the Shannon Estuary for industrialists. This is quite true and I would like to see that should industry come there and should industrialists decide to invest their money in major industrial development there, men in public life, men who are on local authorities, will give full necessary support to any such future developments, because I, as a member of a local authority and of Clare County Council, had the experience of looking on and seeing that where planning permission was given for industrial development in the Shannon Estuary and where adequate assurances were given by the county manager and Clare County Council that no pollution would take place and that the highest standards, higher than those demanded <Col N="452" /> by the World Health Organisation, would be observed to ensure that no pollution would occur, that planning permission was reversed. I am glad to say that the Minister for Local Government decided to see to it that that permission was upheld.  I feel it is necessary that in public life we have people who are able to decide what is for the benefit of the people, people who will not be influenced by those who sit on the fence and who are very often pretty wealthy in their own right but who dictate to those who have families and an interest in making provision for employment for these families, and who will see to it that that dictation is not listened to in future.</P>
    <P>I want specifically to make this point that, while I certainly acknowledge the right of any member of a local authority to make a protest but when members of local authorities unanimously give their views and make certain decisions, they should stick by the advice given by the technical advisers within that authority because if they do not, they are depriving their county of the benefits which are needed there.  They are definitely impeding the work which the Government, and in particular the Minister for Industry and Commerce, would wish to see channelled down to every level and every corner of the country.</P>
    <P>I am very familiar with the work of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  For some years I have been a member of the regional development organisation for the promotion of industry in Clare, Limerick and Tipperary, but even being a member, industries still seem to evade the areas I have referred to, despite the fact that time and again when the opportunity was given to me I loudly and clearly voiced my views about this imbalance.  I hope that in future I will not have to refer to this pet hobby of mine and in fact I have complete confidence in the determination of the Minister and of SFADCo to go ahead and do the job, possibly with moneys from the Regional Development Fund which <Col N="453" /> we hope will be available, and even much larger sums of money for development.  We are not yet quite certain about the amounts of money for these areas but in the meantime we have adequate funds now to do the job I suggested.</P>
    <P>The members of the executive of SFADCo have done their best over the years to attract industrialists and have gone abroad on several occasions to establish contacts and they have succeeded. I should not let this occasion pass without referring to the county development teams of the three counties which are benefiting from the SFADCo promotional efforts, Limerick, Clare and Tipperary and I refer particularly to the one I have most experience of, the team in Clare.  It is very difficult to know exactly where the work of a county development team stops and the work of a promotional agency like SFADCo starts.  I have seen the work of both bodies and I would like at this stage to see some clear guidelines set.  I would prefer to see at this stage that much greater scope would be given to county development teams who display energy to promote industry, big and small, in a particular county.  I understand they are confined to the promotion of smaller industries, but where they can make contact I would like that the work would not be restricted and that they would be given every encouragement to attract industry and developers into the county.</P>
    <P>As regards tourism, the Minister for the Gaeltacht has referred to the many advantages we have in attracting charter flights into the Shannon Airport area.  Some people whose geography might not be as clear as that of others might think that because of the troubles in Northern Ireland we were a nation at total war.  They are not aware of the fact that it is only a small corner of our country that is embroiled in that turbulent situation.  SFADCo should&mdash; and I am sure they are doing this&mdash; make it quite clear through their agents and their officers in different countries that there is perfect harmony in all areas under our jurisdiction.  SFADCo must continue to play an important part in tourism because we cannot <Col N="454" /> afford to lose our second best money spinner, as tourism undoubtedly is.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate SFADCo and all their officers on the work they have done.  However, I would like to see a complete change, that is, much greater thought being given to the smaller town within the region, particularly the areas where there is the highest emigration in Ireland, namely west and north Clare, second only to County Leitrim.  I cannot understand why this has been overlooked by previous Ministers for Industry and Commerce, and I often wonder if the Shannon Free Airport Company have the necessary scope and freedom which would permit them to spend money in the areas of greatest need.</P>

      <P>Sílim nárbh olc an rud é dá gcuirfeadh Teachta ón oirthear fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus roimh na gcuspóirí atá ag SFADCo. Is féidir a rá, is dócha, gur maith an cruthú é, an chéad iarracht a deineadh, gur féidir cuspóir fiúntach a bhaint amach má tá misneach ag daoine tabhairt faoi.  Ní fíos a riamh conas a d'éireoidh le rud mura dtugtar faoi.</P>
      <P>Rinne an Teachta Brennan tagairt don tuarascáil a chuireadh amach roint blianta ó shin ar ionaid nó ceantair fáis, mar a thiúrfá orthu, agus an tairbhe ab fhéidir teacht as ceantar a phiocadh amach agus tionscail nó monarca a bhunú sa cheantar sin, cuidiú leis, agus go dtiocfadh fás as an ghníomh féin.  Sin é an rud a thárla le blianta anuas sa cheantar atá i gceist i gContae an Chláir.  An Teachta deireanach a labhair ó Chontae an Chláir rinne sé tagairt don cheist is tábhachtaí, measaim, a thagann as seo, nuair a lua sé Contae Liathdroma. Dá ndéanfaí iarracht ar rud éigin den sórt seo a dhéanamh b'fhéidir i gcontae cosúil le Contae Liathdroma, níorbh fhios dúinn cén tairbhe a thiocfadh as.  D'éirigh leis i gContae an Chláir agus b'fhéidir roimh Chontae an Chláir gurbh é Contae Liathroma an áit ina bhfuil an gá is mó le forbairt ann.</P>

    <P>Is fiú aontú le hAire na Gaeltachta san méid adúirt sé i dtaobh SFADCo. <Col N="455" /> Tá an-ghníomh déanta acu.  Is sampla maith é den rud a thárlaíonn nuair a thugtar an t-údarás do dhream daoine agus nuair a chuirtear cúram orthu agus nuair a deirtear leo: &ldquo;Lean ar aghaidh leis seo anois.  Déan job de&rdquo;. Is íontach an tairbhe is féidir a theacht as sin.  Tá an deifríocht seo idir cad a thárla i gceantar na Sionainne agus iarrachtaí eile a deineadh nár éirigh chomh maith leo toisc nach raibh an oiread sin neamhspleáchais ag an bhfoireann forbartha agus a tugadh i gcás ceantar na Sionainne. Ag tagairt don mhéid adúirt Aire na Gaeltachta, tá fíor-mholadh ag dul don fhoireann sin agus do na stiúr-thióirí a bhí i mbun SFADCo.  Ní hé amháin gur dheineadar a gcuidgnótha go héifeachtach ach choiméadar ós a gcomhair féin na prionsabail shóisialta is fearr a bhféadfaí smaontiú orthu, sé sin, go bhfuil sé an-thábhachtach, má táimíd chun ár neart a chur i bhforbairt go ndéanfaimid é i gceantar, fé mar adúirt an Teachta Brennan go bhfuil daoine ann agus nach bhfuil obair le fáil ann, ceantar ina bhfuil fás agus forbairt ag teastáil go géar.</P>
    <P>Maidir le foireann SFADCo a chuir le chéile an tuarascáil i dtaobh na gceantar Gaeltachta ní hé amháin gur chuireadar le chéile tuarascáil an-thábhachtach ach choiméadar ós comhair a n-aigne go raibh sé tabhachtach nach ndéanfaí dearmad ar fhealsúnacht agus ar chultúr mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé tábhachtach bainisteoirí agus stiúrthóirí éifeachtacha a chur i monarchain ach, níos tábhachtaí fós, daoine go mbeadh tuiscint acu ar an fhealsúnacht agus ar an gcultúr sin agus iontaobh aca astu.  Maidir leis an Ghaeltacht, tá an baol ann i gcónaí go nginfí éadóchas imeasc na ndaoine muna mbeadh meas ag bainisteoir ar bith ar an bhfealsúnacht agus ar an gcultúr sin.  Tá sé an-thábhachtach dóchas a spreagadh imeasc mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>In a sense this Bill belongs with the one that went before it and also with the one that is coming after it, the one about CTT and the <Col N="456" /> one about ICC.  The opportunity was taken by Deputies, in an interesting and constructive way, to broaden the debate very considerably.  When I introduce my Estimate I shall have an opportunity of indicating my mind to the House in a more detailed way and in a more prepared way in relation to the fundamental problems raised on the question of the balance between the Buchanan type growth centre at one end of the spectrum and the uniform spread of industry throughout the whole area at the other end of the spectrum.  Since I present it as a spectrum with two things at each end that is an indication of my thought and optimism coming in the middle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies expressed a great deal of interest and confidence in SFADCo and approval of what it has done and is doing.  It is a pleasure for me to hear this because it supports my own opinion.  I was asked about the growth of the industrial estate at Shannon. Up to 31st March, 1970, there were 25 industrial projects.  Four years later the figure has risen to 33.  Warehousing services have risen from 17 to 28. The total has risen from 42 to 61.  That is a growth in round figures of practically 50 per cent in four years, a growth of half as much again.  That seals something which gave us a great deal of worry on both sides of this House, something which is now a thing of the past.  It seals a difficult patch for the industrial estate in the period between the middle of 1970 to the middle of 1972.  In that period there was a decline in jobs of between 600 and 650.  There was a decline from 4,500 to less than 4,000.  Happily that decline has been halted and the position has recovered in terms of total employment.  Indeed, it is a little better than it was, though not markedly better.  There has been fair progress.  The job loss has been taken back and there is consequently a small net gain because employment on 31st March, 1974, was 4,580, whereas it was 4,508 four years previously.  That is a small net increase on 1972.  The growth is resuming.  If one takes the difference between exports and imports, the export surplus rose from £13.7 million in 1969 to £23 million in <Col N="457" /> 1973.  I am merely fleshing out the picture with some figures.  It is, indeed, a source of pride and pleasure to everyone and I am using these figures to show agreement with the assessment that it was the correct thing to do.  Happily, it is a successful enterprise. The original decisions must have been taken with much heart searching.  There were, as usual no doubt, plenty of people to say one should not take such a risk but, none-the less, the risk was taken and the decision was the correct decision.</P>
    <P>The same sort of growth is evident in the mid-west regions, if we take new firms and expansions of existing firms, and deduct some losses, because there are no risks taken without some of them coming unstuck. In the five years up to the end of March of this year 43 new firms were established; there were 90 expansions and 12 ceased to exist.  In that five years, in the three months from the end of March-April, May and June &mdash;there were four more firms.  That is an annual rate of 12 firms a year.  If you spread that over a five-year period it would be 60 firms a year.  I know that sort of arithmetic is extremely perilous, but it does indicate the rate of progress is not declining. There has been a very gratifying creation of 3,785 new jobs in the mid-west region in the five years. One could go on with figures but I do not propose to do that.  I refer Deputies to the annual reports of the activities of SFADCo which are packed with information, most of it heartening but also indicating that there was the down turn and a perilous time but we are on the up-grade again.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to enter into a lengthy speech on the interesting and fundamental issues raised by Deputy Brennan and others.  Firstly, I should like to say something about foreigners and foreign industry in Ireland.  It has been suggested that there are too many foreign firms in Shannon and too many foreigners coming here. The core of our industrial progress over the last decade or so has been the attraction of foreign capital, foreign marketing know-how, foreign <Col N="458" /> designs and so forth.  We have a consensus that that was desirable and produced a good result.  I have been continuing that policy wholeheartedly and, I hope, with some success.</P>
    <P>I do not think the issue is: is it desirable to have foreign investment? Of course people will grumble.  That is to be listened to but perhaps not too much notice need be taken of it. The question for the future is: how does that foreign sector of our industry slot into our total industrial development?  At a time when the only industry we substantially had was the very old food or drink industries or the industries which had developed behind protection walls which were not very competitive or efficient we had to get expertise quickly and this worked for us.</P>
    <P>We must all be concerned about the role of multi-national companies world-wide.  This is one of the great problems for nation States and for the European Economic Community, which is much bigger than a nation State, as to how you see that these great multi-national companies are made aware of the susceptibilities, responsibilities and, indeed, even the identity and sovereignty of nation States.  There is a conflict between the multi-national and the nation States, but it is not impossible to resolve.  The multi-national companies are welcome but they must accept the rules of the ball game and fit in with our aspirations. We will not chase them out; we will not penalise them; we will not vilify them; we will not give them complete <i>carte blanche</i> to behave as they wish.  One of the great objects of inviting overseas industry was to get skills on the factory floor, management skills with money, management skills with marketing and management skills in the general sense, into the brains and the hands of Irish people, hopefully that they would then have the entrepreneurial flair and courage which they are developing to do their own thing.</P>
    <P>The whole problem about foreign industrialisation is not that it is there, or whether it is desirable, but to slot it into a long-term general industrial <Col N="459" /> development where our particular identity, genius, sovereignty, history and culture are not swept away under global considerations or decisions which are made on economic grounds 3,000 or 10,000 miles away.  In fact, small, distinct, very proud and individual countries are able to go on being themselves in the face of the huge concentration of what is happening in modern industry.  There is a potential for real conflict there.  If we spot it, think about it and strengthen our own indigenous industry, skills and sense of identity and confidence, then it can be contained and made fruitful.  But there are also dangers in letting what was once necessary become the most important part of our industrial development.  We have to balance it.</P>
    <P>I will say more about that another time.  Perhaps I am prejudging a speech which might be more appropriate on my Estimate.  I merely wished to show some reaction to the interesting comments made by Deputy Brennan.  With regard to job training and our traditional balance between academic and economically useful subjects, I agree with what has been said.  Deputy Brennan knows more about AnCO than I do because he was in the Department of Labour during its formative times.  I do not want to make comments on what are properly the responsibility of the Minister for Labour but I know it is the attitude of the Government to expand training in the industrial sector as fast as the structure can be made to grow without actually breaking down and without having the defects of mushroom growth.  We recognise the immense value of skill; we recognise the potential bottlenecks which can so quickly and so damagingly occur through lack of skill and training; we recognise even the defensive quality that if our people have to go away they will not be doing unskilled work around the world as they have been condemned to do for so many generations.</P>
    <P>The balance between academic, university and other third level subjects, has been distorted in the past by the desire of newly emancipated <Col N="460" /> people to get doctors and lawyers into their families.  They did not respect skills whether it was of the engineer, the agriculturalist, the technologist.  That is changing as, indeed, the relevant social standing as reflected by the income of these different sectors is changing too.  As we develop, our industrial experience is curing that distortion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan also referred to the Buchanan Report and a book about industrial development in Ireland. While that book dealt with Scariff and Tubbercurry we have not an analysis like that on Shannon.  I am not going to enter in detail, or with any prepared text, into a discussion of Buchanan versus an even spread of the butter over the whole slice of bread.  It seems to me that the economic arguments of Buchanan have truth if you define the objective of development as to maximise profit and maximise industrial efficiency.  I do not believe in private enterprise. We have a mixed economy and we must moderate the exigencies of modern capitalism with social considerations, especially in a country like Ireland.  On the other hand, if we do not have some growth centre benefits, we can saddle ourselves with industry which is not profitable or, at least, breaking even in boom times. Transport costs may be high and a lot of the infrastructure is dear, and with the support services of the kind high technology industry needs, we may saddle ourselves with a cost structure that will not be competitive in bad times.</P>
    <P>Simply saying that there are two ends to the spectrum, let me indicate that I think we need growth centres. If there is a town which is already developed with houses which are not fully utilised, with roads that are there for historical reasons that could take more traffic, with water and sewerage that is not fully utilised, it is obviously cheaper to put a factory there than to have to build new houses, new infrastructure and new everything to cater for that factory.</P>
    <P>It is also a very good mix to get people who have small farms starved for capital into industrial jobs.  There <Col N="461" /> have been beneficial results from this all over the world.  What do these people do with their pay packets? They put them into the farms to make them better.  That is done uniformly around the world with great benefit.</P>
    <P>That is a way of getting capital into capital-starved agriculture.  Many small farmers who go into factories have proved to be flexible and adaptable workers.  Most countries have too many people.  We do not.  We have half the population we had a century ago.  We can stand growth centres. We can stand a big influx of population. We can stand to have a major city grow in Shannon.  I agree with everyone who has spoken about the tremendous potential of the Shannon Estuary.  We can stand putting little factories with low infrastructural costs throughout the countryside, provided we do not say that every little town must get one.  Then it can really be spread too thinly.  Nowadays the catchment area with four or five fellows getting into a motor car can be bigger than it was 30 years ago when a car was a rarity.  The purely economic argument that says growth centres are the best and tell us to forget the rest is inhuman and ridiculous&mdash;not that there is much advancing of it in that naked form&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, what might be called the totally political argument that says that every aggregation of houses at a crossroads is entitled to a factory is mistaken and is wasteful of resources. One can get a balance between the two points given some planning and forward thinking.  Regional planning is a great need.  I share the regrets of Deputy Daly and others who were sad and disillusioned about the Regional Fund.  Personally I never thought it was going to be as big as it was held out to be and I said so.  However, it does not remove my disappointment that there is not any of the fund.  As someone who attends the Council of Ministers meetings and has participated in the discussions on the <Col N="462" /> Regional Fund, it would not be right to say there is no hope of it.  It will be later and smaller than we thought. If we are going to get an ongoing social democratic community with a social conscience as well as business ethics, let us take what regional fund we can get in the near term as an indication of the will of the Community to have a regional policy.  Let us not take it as the end of the road or the final fund.  There will be some money, and structures such as SFADCo are extremely useful for expenditure of those regional moneys. Deputy Brennan spoke about the success of Shannon producing some jealousy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be but they are natural sins and they are the most sincere compliment the non-advantaged areas can pay to the advantaged districts.  May I say with enormous pleasure that recently on the front cover of <i>Business and Finance</i> the characterisation that was given to what was happening in the north of Mayo was &ldquo;too much, too soon&rdquo;.  That kind of characterisation of industrial development gives me intense pleasure because we have had decades when it was a case of &ldquo;too little, too late&rdquo;. I do not look on Shannon as a specially favoured growth centre.  What is happening in North Mayo will provide another major pole of this kind. Hopefully, if our industrial development goes on we can spread them out on the west coast.  I listened to Deputy Brugha on this point with pleasure.  I also speak as a representative of an eastern constituency but I do not think either of us would yield place to anyone from a western constituency in our concern for the health of the west of Ireland and the culture it embodies.  It is something of which I am well aware.  If industrialisation is humane and controlled, it will be a stabiliser of regional culture rather than a destroyer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Alcan, it is a source of personal pleasure to me that, at a <Col N="463" /> time when the whole project was at an uncertain stage, I was able to meet the Alcan people in Ireland, Canada and the United Kingdom and I hope I made an intervention that was relevant in regard to their decision to reactivate the whole project and to go ahead with it.  I am happy it is in Shannon partly because there are jobs, although it is a tremendous investment in relation to the number of jobs, and also because it will generate the infrastructural investment that can begin the lift-off of the entire area of the Estuary.  Money will be spent there that will benefit not only Alcan and their production but other companies also.</P>
    <P>I have indicated broad outlines but not detail.  I am pleased with the general welcome this Bill has received and by the general approbation the efforts of SFADCo have received Mention was made of different agencies, SFADCo, the IDA, county development teams and so on.  I do not have strong opinions at this moment but we must examine structures that grow up at a particular time in particular circumstances to see that there is not duplication or competition and to keep them rational. I do not purport to know whether, for example, the county development team/IDA/SFADCo relationship is an optimum one or whether we could make it better.  It is something that needs continuing and ongoing scrutiny not only from the Government but also from the Opposition whose relations at Deputy and local representative level are just as intimate as the Government's relations. They would be just as aware of anomalies and duplication if they were to arise.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see the growth of the town of Shannon.  It has been a bit piecemeal.  There is some lovely architecture; it is a good location with little hills, the water nearby, and it also has some trees.  Perhaps some things could have been done better and I agree with Deputy Brennan on that.  I hope we will get the stability that will enable planning to be carried out, not in a piecemeal fashion but coherently.  It is nice to build a city in <Col N="464" /> an agreeable place.  I am convinced it will be a major city but it will be nice to have it a beautiful and non-polluted one and it is quite possible to do that.</P>
    <P>With regard to conflict between Shannon and the smaller towns on the periphery of the mid-west region, there will always be a bit but the effort of SFADCo is spreading and is producing results.  On the other hand, while I affirm my commitment to spreading industry, that does not mean that every place that asks for a factory will, or should, get one.  One has to balance social need on the one hand with the building of structures that will not be viable in bad times. It is a delicate balance.  It means a commitment to pushing industry into areas where it is not in existence, but in the end the growth and future of our industry and our exports and the things growing industry buy for us&mdash; our whole structure of social welfare and growing wealth&mdash;depends not just on industrial volume but on industrial viability and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>We exist as a mixed economy in a world where most of the countries near us have mixed economies.  We cannot depart too radically from the rules of the ball-game as it is evolving in the EEC, in the United States and elsewhere.  That means we cannot violate the ordinary rules of competitiveness, of efficiency, of unit costs and so on.  Therefore, our decisions have to be a balance of commercial hardheadedness and social concern. That does not mean growth centres to the exclusion of all else, but neither does it mean that it will be possible to locate a factory every place where 50 people could benefit by employment in it.  It is necessary to have a balance and that is the way it will continue to evolve.</P>

When this Bill was being drafted the reference to section 2 of the 1970 Act was omitted.  In order to provide for SFADCo's administration costs in the region&mdash;that is, the expanded area which includes more than the old airport region; the whole mid-west region&mdash;it is necessary, therefore, to refer to the relevant section of the 1970 Act.

We might have been seeking information more appropriate to another time which could be broadened with regard to the amount of money invested generally in the company and the approximate relationship it would have to similar investments in other concerns.  This is <Col N="468" /> something which one could probably elicit by way of parliamentary question or on the Minister's Estimate.  I would not expect the Minister to have details of these things here today. Generally, we are glad that the continuing provision is made.  So far I have refrained from trying to score political points but some speakers welcomed this as a piece of new legislation; as if the Minister had thought out some piece of brilliant legislation. It is an absolutely essential, continuing, Bill to make provision for an excellent company which has done credit to the many pioneers of industrial development and which I have no doubt the Minister will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to increase the statutory limit on the borrowing powers of the Industrial Credit Company and also to increase the limit on the extent to which the Minister for Finance can guarantee the company's borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing statutory limit on borrowing by the Industrial Credit Company is £30 million.  Actual borrowing is now £22 million and is rising rapidly as the company's business continues to expand.  On the basis of firm commitments already entered into by the company it is probable that the statutory limit will be exceeded in the second half of 1974.  It is essential, therefore, that the limit on borrowing be raised to enable the company to <Col N="469" /> procure additional resources.  The new limit proposed in section 2 of the Bill is £75 million.  Deputies may consider that an increase of £45 million is very large.  Industrial Credit Company business is, however, growing at an unprecedented rate and it is likely that the upward trend will continue.</P>
    <P>In the period April to December, 1974, the company have budgeted to provide financial facilities totalling £14.6 million for industry.  In the previous 12 months the company disbursed £13 million which was in itself a record figure.  Of the £14.6 million which the company will advance up to December next, £5.5 million relates to their subsidiary company, Shipping Finance Corporation, which provides loans for new shipbuilding.  The balance will be disbursed by the Industrial Credit Company for the benefit of industry in general.  Most of the capital used by the Industrial Credit Company for their own purposes is secured from non-Exchequer sources and it is hoped that this position will continue.  The capital required for the operations of the Shipping Finance Corporation is provided from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has power under the existing legislation to guarantee borrowing by the ICC and it is proposed in section 3 of the Bill to raise the limit on his power of guarantee from £30 million to £75 million to correspond with the new limit on borrowing.  At present the total amount borrowed under guarantee is £6 million and it is unlikely that the Minister will be called on to guarantee all borrowing by the company. It is the usual practice, however, to fix the same limits for borrowing and guarantee powers.</P>
    <P>Over the last decade the ICC have considerably expanded their activities. The company's main activity is the provision of longer-term loans but they also offer a wide and sophisticated range of other investment facilities to meet the complex demands of industry.  These include share investment in industry, capital underwriting and issuing house services, hire purchase facilities for plant and machinery, equipment <Col N="470" /> leasing and finance for distribution. In addition to the provision of capital they have also a subsidiary company, Mergers Limited, which specialises in the field of mergers and takeovers by undertaking share evaluations and by advising in negotiations for mergers between firms.  As I have already mentioned, they are also concerned with shipbuilding finance through its other subsidiary company, Shipping Finance Corporation.</P>
    <P>Since our entry into membership of the European Economic Community the demand for ICC facilities has expanded rapidly.  Given the trading opportunities now open to us and the need for increased industrial investment to sustain economic growth, there will be a continuing demand for the facilities provided by the company.  I am most anxious, therefore, that the company should be in a position to contribute to industry the financial and organisational expertise which they have built up over the years in addition to financial assistance.  The present legislation, when enacted, will enable the company to maintain a reasonable flow of funds to industry.</P>
    <P>Because of the high demand for industrial finance and the capital intensive nature of modern industry it will not be easy for the company to provide all the funds which industry is likely to require.  In seeking funds from the Exchequer the company's requirements will have to be balanced against demands on behalf of other important services.  It is hoped, therefore, that the commendable initiative shown by the company in the past in raising capital from non-Exchequer sources can be maintained.  In the past few years the company have made significant advances in tapping sources of capital abroad.  They have established a very valuable association with the World Bank with which they have negotiated a loan.  It is also confidently expected that our membership of the EEC will redound to the company's advantage by enabling them to draw on the resources of Community institutions such as the European Bank and to make contact with the national development banks <Col N="471" /> and other financial institutions in the other member states.  In this regard I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the company have completed negotiations with the European Investment Bank for a loan of £2½ million the full details of which will be announced in the near future.</P>
    <P>For over 40 years the ICC have been to the fore in the financing of Irish industry.  At present the company have over £30 million invested in industry. Many of the successful industries established over the past 40 years started from modest beginnings with the assistance of finance provided or arranged by the company.  Facilities are provided for the establishment of new industries as well as the expansion of existing firms and the company have a tradition of giving special attention to proposals in regard to small projects. The continuing increase in the demand for the company's facilities is proof that their importance has in no way diminished with the enlargement of the industrial and financial sectors of our economy.  The present legislation will enable the company to continue their important role in the development of the economy and I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>As far as we are concerned on this side of the House we readily accept the necessity for this Bill and we will not impede its progress in the House.  There are, however, a few matters on which I should like to comment.  First, since this is the first opportunity I have had of saying this in public I would like to pay a very sincere and public tribute to the work of Dr. J. P. Beddy who was chairman of the Industrial Credit Company for quite a number of years and was associated with various activities of the Industrial Credit Company since their foundation.  It is appropriate that a tribute should be paid to the work of Dr. Beddy for the Industrial Credit Company and the country in general.  This work, while, perhaps not as widely recognised as that of other people, was no less appreciated by those who were aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> The Industrial Credit Company were set up in 1933 by the first Fianna Fáil Government and their activities have been of very great importance in the industrialisation of this country. While I have not got up-to-date figures I have one percentage figure which illustrates the important part this company have played.  Between 1933 and 1968 the Industrial Credit Company accounted for 54 per cent of all the capital raised by industrial companies in the State.  In my view that is a fair indication of the important role the company have played in the industrialisation of this country.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that since then there has been a very substantial increase in industrialisation accompanied by a very substantial increase in the involvement both by way of the amount of money and sophisticated know-how input by banks and other financial institutions.  Despite that I believe that the Industrial Credit Company will continue to have an important role to play and that they did to a great extent pioneer the provision of capital for Irish industry at a time when the ordinary financial institutions were not all that keen to get involved.  In recent years the Industrial Credit Company have increased the sophistication of their service to the community so that they are now fulfilling many of the functions of an investment bank and a merchant bank.  This is as it should be.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Company have some subsidiary companies one of which is Mergers Limited.  I note that on page 8 of the company's report and accounts for the year ending 31st October, 1973, the following statement occurs:</P>
    <P>Mergers Limited had a busy year and its income went up by 50 per cent.  In conjunction with some other financial institutions representations were made to the Department of Industry and Commerce concerning the legislation to be introduced by the Minister for the control of mergers.</P>
    <P>It is only right that that should have been done because clearly Mergers <Col N="473" /> Limited will be affected by any legislation introduced in that regard.</P>
    <P>The whole area of that legislation is somewhat of a mystery.  It will be recalled that the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lalor, had prepared legislation dealing with mergers and takeovers.  It will also be recalled that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, after he assumed office, said he was scrapping that Bill because it was not strong enough and that he was going to introduce stronger measures.  It may also be recalled that the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, shortly before the last election, apparently gave semi-secret undertakings to certain groups to the effect that nothing untoward would be done in regard to legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>Whatever may have happened at that time, the fact is that we are now into July 1974 and we have not seen that legislation and only within the last week or so, in response to a supplementary question of mine, the Minister for Industry and Commerce became very upset apparently and sought the protection of the Chair when all I was asking was when he was going to produce the legislation. We do not seem to be able to get any information from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and since the legislation in question is not only of very great importance to the whole community but is of direct importance to Mergers Limited, a whollyowned subsidiary of the company for which we are being asked to agree to substantial increases, would the Minister for Finance, when he is replying, throw any light on this increasingly mysterious situation in regard to the legislation on takeovers and mergers which is badly needed, the previous Bill having been scrapped by the present Government as not being strong enough.  We are now left with no legislation.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us as to what is happening about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that it might be thought that the proposed addition of £45 million to the statutory limit on borrowing, with the corresponding increase in the statutory <Col N="474" /> limit on guarantee power of the Minister, was excessive.  I would agree with him that perhaps a few years ago such a figure might well have been thought excessive in a case like this.  As the Minister is well aware, an effort is made in legislation of this kind which has to be brought in periodically in regard to the Industrial Credit Company and many other State companies to try to measure the amount of additional money to be provided in such a way as to reach a figure which will enable the body concerned to operate effectively but nevertheless will ensure that at reasonable intervals new legislation will be needed so that the operation of that body can come under periodic review in this House.  On the basis of what the situation would have been a couple of years ago, say when I was Minister for Finance, this figure would certainly have been considered excessive and as stretching the interval for review by this House too far. However, I agree with the Minister in this case that it is not in fact stretching it too far.  I say this for two reasons.  One is that the activities of the Industrial Credit Company are expanded and, secondly, and it is tied in with the first, at the rate inflation is going now and with the prospects for the fairly immediate future, this figure of £45 million is not nearly as much as it may seem.  Indeed the Minister may have to come back with further legislation on those lines at least as soon as would be equivalent to the last interval and maybe even in a shorter term.  For that reason I have no objection to the amount proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the activities of the Industrial Credit Company, admirable as they are, I believe that there is built into these activities a form of subsidy to Irish industry.  I say this not in any carping spirit because I believe that what is being done is correct and that it should be done. Nevertheless it should be recognised that there is involved in it a significant form of subsidy for Irish industry and this because the rate of dividend paid by the company on its share capital is 2½ per cent which, in ordinary commercial terms, would <Col N="475" /> not normally enable it to retain that capital.  Secondly, to the extent that the Government guarantee loans to the company&mdash;though the Minister has said this is relatively small I think the figure will increase&mdash;there is a form of subsidy which is not easy to measure but it is there.  I say this because there are occasions when certain people with an interest, not by any means all of them but some of them who have an interest in industry, tend to think that they are operating wholly in a competitive field without any assistance from the Government of the day and rather tend to think only of interference by the Government of the day.  There are many other areas where the same thing could be said but in this particular area there is a form of subsidy available in the activities of the Industrial Credit Company in so far as it assists Irish industry.  I repeat that I would not change this, I am merely recording the fact that subsidy exists.</P>
    <P>The Minister has adverted to the fact that the Industrial Credit Company has raised most of the capital it requires from non-Exchequer sources and has expressed the hope that that will continue.  I would certainly concur in that hope.  I know, from the activities of the Industrial Credit Company, that the concerns from which it raises money tend to be bodies like the World Bank and the loans tend to be of that kind.  Nevertheless, I am posing the question, and perhaps the Minister will be able to tell me whether it is practical but one cannot help wondering when one sees the activities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the very effective advertising campaign which it embarked on some years ago to attract deposits, whether a similar kind of campaign is possible or would be worthwhile in regard to the Industrial Credit Company.  I can see certain difficulties in this but perhaps the Minister could tell us whether he thinks they are insuperable or whether this ought to be initiated.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression, which is somewhat shaken by the wording of <Col N="476" /> what the Minister said in his speech, that the Industrial Credit Company had joined an association of development banks in the EEC.  The Minister's wording leaves me in some doubt so perhaps he would tell us, when he is replying, whether, in fact, they have joined an association of development banks.  I would believe that if this is so it would be a necessary preliminary step to an adequate implementation of a regional policy of the EEC, something that we have not yet seen, to our regret, but I am confident that we will see it.  In so far as the Industrial Credit Company have taken or are taking a step of this kind it is, I believe, a step in the right direction.  It should be borne in mind that the Industrial Credit Company by the statutory provisions under which they exist have no obligation whatsoever to have regard to regional policies in this country.  They have no specific obligation to help the west more than the east under any statutory obligation but if they are about to join in such an association, as I have mentioned, I would regard this as a step on the road towards implementing regional policy for the European Economic Community in this country.  Therefore, while they would not have the statutory obligation to engage in that it would indicate they were about to engage in such activities which, of course, they are not prohibited from doing by their statutory set-up.</P>
    <P>The Minister in what he said answered a question I was about to ask.  I intended to ask if any money had been received or any negotiations were in progress with the European Investment Bank.  He said that the company had completed negotiations with the European Investment Bank for a loan of £2 million, the full details of which, he said will be announced in the near future.  This is satisfactory but on the face of it it seems to me to be a very paltry figure to be the subject of a loan by the European Investment Bank with the EEC.  I hope that it is merely a preliminary arrangement and that we can expect considerably more substantial loans from the European Investment Bank to the Industrial Credit Company in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> The European Investment Bank is, and should be, one of the very important sources of finance for us in the European Economic Community for the purpose of the development of our economy and, in particular, for the purpose of industrial development. I do not think there is any better instrument available to the State for industrial development, particularly development of native Irish industry, than the Industrial Credit Company.  For that reason I am anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is got from our membership of the European Investment Bank to further the activity of the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>One other matter, to which I wish to refer, may not appear to be relevant but I believe it is.  The Minister may recall on a previous occasion I asked some questions about the position concerning Fóir Teoranta.  He will recall, when that company was set up originally, arrangements were made whereby the Industrial Credit Company supplied the staff and management for Fóir Teoranta but it was open to Fóir Teoranta to decide at a later date whether they wished to continue this arrangement or set up their own staff and management structure. When I enquired about this last the Minister told me that the Industrial Credit Company were continuing to supply this.  I would like to know if that is still the position and if it is intended to continue it.  If it is the position I would like to know if any progress has been made on a matter which I, as Minister for Finance, discussed with the board of Fóir Teoranta and in which I was considerably interested, that is the development of a nucleus of management expertise in Fóir Teoranta, provided as of now by the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in this because experience shows in many cases where industries get into difficulty while, of course, the immediate problem is financial&mdash;there may be others&mdash;in many cases the root cause is lack of management expertise. Very often where the money is available to remedy some problems <Col N="478" /> other problems cannot be remedied. Unless management expertise can be supplied it is throwing good money after bad for Fóir Teoranta to invest money in the proposition.  I spoke on this before and I am aware of the various difficulties which I outlined then but will not outline now.  I am very interested to know if the Industrial Credit Company are still providing the management structure for Fóir Teoranta and if any progress has been made in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are various other aspects of the activities of the Industrial Credit Company which I believe are admirable and are well worthy of accommodation and perhaps of more detailed comment.  However, I do not intend at this stage to go into any great detail on this.  I want simply to say that, subject to the information I hope the Minister will be able to give me on the various points I raised, I unhesitatingly support the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by Deputy Colley concerning Dr. Beddy, who was a very good man in the setting up of the Industrial Credit Company.  He was originally the secretary and then became chairman but is no longer chairman.  I am speaking as an ex-pupil of his.  He gave me my first lectures in education on industry, like a lot of us, in UCD. The Industrial Credit Company carry the hallmark of his good, careful and proper planning and thinking in the growth and development of that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many industrialists today who can be deeply grateful for the help they received from Dr. Beddy and his colleagues.  It was not just a question of going in and getting financial assistance.  Expertise and know-how were freely given, no matter what the trouble was, no matter how small or difficult the problem was.  Many of the men on the staff of the Industrial Credit Company on their own account did a lot of travelling and foraging to find information to help early industry in this country.  Our present industrial structure can be very grateful for the work those men did in the <Col N="479" /> past.  We are talking about an ongoing operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that Deputies may consider that an increase of £45 million is very large.  There is no fear of it being regarded as very large. From a professional point of view and knowing the amount of money that is now involved in any industrial project I can say that figure of £45 million is by no means very large.  It is just keeping pace with requirements. I would regard it as a short-term review of requirements because since our entry into the EEC one can see one is now dealing in today's terms with much larger figures than one dealt with two years ago.  There is an increasing demand for considerable and heavy capital requirements in industry.</P>
    <P>I note that the real object and prime purpose of the Industrial Credit Company is to deal with possibly longer-term loans than one would obtain from the normal industrial sector.  The Industrial Credit Company can be described as the banking arm of modern industrial policy.  It is a State body.  It is very necessary. We all know that there are ups and downs in the money market.  Private banking concerns possibly view things with the prime motive of profit and a certain amount of selfishness when it comes to lending money.  That is their nature and their shareholders require that sort of approach.  The Industrial Credit Company can very often forget about those requirements and fill a necessary gap in industrial finance.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the implications of the EEC will bring great changes in our industrial fabric.  One must remember that the Industrial Credit Company was formed in an age which shortly became one of very severe and closely protected home industrial enterprise, protected by tariff barriers and by quotas.  It grew out of a rather unreal situation.  We are now living in an age when these barriers are being torn down rapidly and an industrialist has to stand on his own feet in the market place.  This is not easy for an industrialist in a small <Col N="480" /> country like ours when we are dealing with large European and international commercial concerns who can, at the stroke of a pen, set up in or withdraw from a country.</P>
    <P>When native people in this country want to start a project they must be assured that they will not be made the victims of financial withdrawal, the withdrawal of financial support.  I regret to say&mdash;and we can all instance this&mdash;that certain American banks withdrew money in the past and caused considerable industrial embarrassment to people in this country.  We are all aware of that.  It is only right that one should say it in this House, so that we can now look at the necessity for having our own State industrial bank which will first of all look at things from a national viewpoint, a properly measured and properly tuned viewpoint, but one with a national outlook.</P>
    <P>The scope for the Industrial Credit Company is large and progressive.  I regret that when this Bill comes into the House it does not appear to attract all that much attention from Deputies.  It may be a small Bill at first glance, but its implications are very large and extremely important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to a nucleus of management expertise.  It is only right to say&mdash;possibly I can say it easier, and Deputy Colley will probably agree with me&mdash;that one of the great problems is that we have an institution like the Industrial Credit Company which trains able young men but, right outside the door are other financial institutions offering a bigger carrot to these men when they are qualified and when they have this expertise.  I have a feeling that, although it has not damaged the company, this has caused considerable difficulties for the higher echelons of management and personnel.  They have lost many good men who have gone into private banking and merchant banking.  This is one of the symptoms and one of the results which must follow in a very well-run institution.  It is of running concern to an institution like the Industrial Credit Company.  It has to deal with it as a continuing problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> I hope that those people who go into the Industrial Credit Company will stay there and see that there is a good future for them.  I know that many of my contemporaries went into that institution and did well and worked well there.  Many others were enticed away into private business.  I hope that the emoluments and the attractions of service in a State institution like this, will induce people to stay there.  They have obtained valuable practical experience and, in the years they have been there, they have done very good work.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the fact that the legal department of the Industrial Credit Company has done very good work and has educated many members of the legal profession in how to go about dealing with industrial finance.  I know also that there are very good relations between the Industrial Credit Company and the deposit banks, the larger banks, and that they work very well in tandem in many businesses.  It is good to see that.  It means that the Industrial Credit Company has integrated itself fully into the financial structure of our nation.  Overall the most important aspect of the company is that it is there when others funk going into the market to give assistance.</P>

      <P>Well deserved tribute has been paid from both sides of the House to Dr. Beddy and those who participate with him in the functions of the Industrial Credit Company. It comes as a bit of a shock to learn from Deputy Colley that 54 per cent of all the capital raised for industrial purposes from 1933 to 1968 came through the efforts of the company. That indicates how terribly important this organisation is and what we, as a community, owe to the efforts of those people.  One would not like to think of what our stage of industrial development would be today if this body had not been founded in 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned Mergers Limited.  As a Deputy I would be very curious to hear one or two examples of what it has done, if that would be proper.  Deputy Colley rightly raised the question, which is not in the Minister's <Col N="482" /> province, of what is to happen about the Monopolies Bill.  We have not seen any sign of it.  The Minister mentioned that £30 million is invested by the company in industry.  I should like to ask where this is invested, and whether it is in shareholdings. Can the Minister enlighten me as to whether there has been much recoupment over the years of finance provided to enable industries to continue in existence?</P>
    <P>I am also curious to know in relation to the non-Exchequer sources of capital, excluding the forthcoming money from the European Investment Bank, as to where the Corporation has got these non-exchequer capital amounts.  I would refer to the matter mentioned by Deputy Colley which I think is important, that the Industrial Credit Company does not have in its terms of reference a social policy direction in relation to the eastern or the western part of the country.  It seems to be desirable that consideration should be given to this in the future.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which they have received this proposal that the Bill should receive the support of the House.  I am glad that Dr. Beddy has been mentioned by Deputy Colley and Deputy Esmonde as a person deserving of the thanks and congratulations of the Irish people for his immense contribution in this vital sector of our economy.  He is a giant amongst many great men who have served Irish industry very well in its earlier struggling years and he has done so successfully against the forebodings of Doubting Thomases.  It is obviously very much to his credit and the credit of his colleagues who had such great confidence and who look so optimistically on the future of Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we are today seeking to increase the borrowing powers of the Industrial Credit Company from £30 million to £75 million in one stroke is a further monument to the foresight and the good management of Dr. Beddy and his colleagues.  It may seem extraordinary to Members <Col N="483" /> that we are jumping by £45 million in one Bill, a Bill which is tailored as all previous Bills have been which sought to increase the borrowing powers of the Industrial Credit Company for a period of four years, but an indication of the need for this very rapid and significant growth can be obtained from the performance of the Industrial Credit Company over the past couple of years.  For instance, in the 12 months ending March, 1973, the capital offered by the Industrial Credit Company to industry was £4.61 million, but for the 12 months ending March, 1974, that figure had virtually trebled, to £13.02 million and in the 12 months to March, 1975, the figure will be between £18 million and £19 million, a growth from £4.61 million to nearly £20 million in a matter of two years and that is far more than a reflection of inflation, thanks be to God.  Bad and all as world inflation is at the moment&mdash;and there are places worse than Ireland&mdash;we have not reached the situation and please God we never will reach that multiple but it is a fair indication of the massive demand which industry now makes upon our total resources, a demand which we should welcome because it is an indication of the great growth potential of industry, without which we would be in very serious economic straits.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry estimates that in comparison with the total requirement of £125 million for industrial development last year, the current year's requirements will be about £300 million and it will be required in each year for a number of years to come, in order that Irish industry may be able to avail itself of the opportunities open to it.  It is interesting enough that the multiple which the Confederation of Irish Industry and ourselves have in mind here more or less coincides but it is not an easy thing to service such a colossal demand.  The Government, however, consider the provision of capital for industry as a top priority because it will generate wealth, will generate the moneys required to improve our standard of living and in <Col N="484" /> so doing, will also be generating employment which is so vital for happiness and contentment, the maintenance of our standards and the attainment of even better standards in the future.</P>
    <P>The sources of capital to the Industrial Credit Company are several, and the position as of 31st October, 1973, indicates the sources.  The issued share capital of the company is £8.8 million, Exchequer advances are £12.4 million, bank loans as of last year were £1.3 million, deposits and shortterm loans, £2 million, which incidentally at the moment is almost £2.5 million, showing a very commendable increase in a comparatively short time, bank overdraft £100,000, reserves and surplus £2 million and other accounts, £1.2 million.  As I mentioned in my opening speech, we will shortly be receiving a further loan of £2.5 million from the European Investment Bank.  Deputy Colley thought that was a very small sum. It, of course, is not the end of what we shall be borrowing from that source, one has to be in the position to offer to the lenders a suitable scheme or plan to absorb the money offered.</P>
    <P>The European Investment Bank usually invests no more than 40 per cent of the total required for any particular project.  The money being offered on this occasion which we are taking up is to be made available for small projects rather than large ones, and, of course, the Industrial Credit Company by its behaviour in the past, shows that it is particularly concerned in giving support to small enterprises, so that that £2.5 million represents 40 per cent of what will go into the small industries in the very near future and we would be hopeful that this would be a recurring advance from that particular source.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of increasing the deposits which the Industrial Credit Company could attract from Irish sources or, indeed, from anywhere else.  Like all other deposits, they are in very keen competition at present and the Industrial Credit Company have certainly no reason to be ashamed of their success in this <Col N="485" /> particular field, when one has regard to the fact that the number of offices they have is only three, in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, but they have shown a very commendable growth against other agencies which have multiplied the number of their offices to attract deposits and in some cases are running offices far beyond the capacity of the deposits they attract to pay for them.</P>
    <P>One of the great merits of the Industrial Credit Company is that they have never overstressed themselves, have never been interested in prestige for its own sake.  They have never taken improper risks but have had the courage to take risks where other people were not prepared to step in.  As Deputy Esmonde said, they have invested money and taken risks where other people funked them but the Industrial Credit Company have always very sensibly measured the potential of projects put before them and as I emphasised at the beginning and, indeed, as Deputy Colley, Deputy Esmonde, and Deputy Brugha said, one of the great virtues of the Industrial Credit Company is that it has provided not merely money, which of course is very useful at any time, but it has also made available management and advice without parallel.  As Deputy Esmonde said, a great deal of it is rewarded at a rate much less than would be offered in the private sector.</P>
    <P>That is a very difficult problem to solve.  Our predecessors set up the Review Body to examine the top salaries in the public sector.  The Devlin recommendations were made several years ago, and these were referred by our predecessors to the Employer-Labour conference and have subsequently been processed through the Labour Court.  Recently the Government have indicated to boards of semi-State bodies that, as the boards of semi-State bodies should observe the Devlin limits and the national wage agreements where they are applicable, they should exercise their responsibility of fixing remuneration for their top executives responsibly and should justify any increases which they give, subject at all times to the right <Col N="486" /> of the Review Body to review any rate which may be fixed.</P>
    <P>People in the public sector have not been in the past, and I suppose for a long time in the future may not be, rewarded at the same very generous rates as the private sector would sometimes offer.  But there are awards for serving in the public sector which are not available in the private sector, including the reward of serving the community.  I think we should be extremely grateful to all people in the Industrial Credit Company and elsewhere who have accepted the disciplines and the passing disadvantages which may seem to be there while they are serving in the public sector. We should not, however, regard as a total loss any drain from the public sector into private industry and private commerce, because the discipline, the understanding of both the public and private sectors, which people get when they are serving in the public sector is something which rubs off to the advantage of the whole economy and generates co-operation and understanding on both sides which is very much to the benefit of our community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley asked whether the Industrial Credit Company was a member of the Association of Development Banks.  It is, but of course membership of that does not of itself yield immediate and concrete results, although a great deal has been learned from membership of that association.  Its main function is to invest in trans-national projects, and the company itself has not to date been involved in any project of that kind, but it is not unlikely that it will in the future be involved in such a project.  If and when that arises it may well be necessary to give the company further legislative powers beyond those which it has at present, but until such time as the requirement would be known we would not be in a position to tailor the legislation which might be required.  The rate of dividend which the State receives in respect of its shareholding with the company is only 3 per cent, which is negligible by current standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I referred to it as 2½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it used to be 2½ but it has now been increased to 3.  As I say, by current rates it is negligible, but the State investment in share capital is about £8.8 million, and if the State is taking less on that investment than might be justified were it now to lend them money, on the other hand, the Industrial Credit Company offers a number of loans at rates less than the market rate, including a very important field in which a subsidiary of the company is involved, that is, in the provision of shipping finance, where finance is made available to the shipping industry at rates which do not exceed 7½ per cent, again a dramatically small figure compared with current rates.  Some of the loans which are made available also to smaller companies are at rates less than they would be if they were receiving them from the private sector.  But all in all, we should not feel that this is in any way a measure of lack of efficiency on the part of the company, that they are either paying such a small dividend on the share capital or lending at such small rates; it is simply a measure of the social content which the State and Oireachtas Éireann consider should be in both the capital holding and in the lending made by the company.</P>
      <P>There was also a query about the management team which might be available to Fóir Teoranta and to any organisations assisted by Fóir Teoranta. The position at present is that which I previously outlined, that is, that the Industrial Credit Company provide the staff and the management advice for Fóir Teoranta.  It is a very beneficial arrangement, benefiting both the Industrial Credit Company and companies that are assisted by Fóir Teoranta.  Fóir itself has advertised for management specialists but to date have not been able to recruit people of sufficient calibre in this field.  The search is being pursued and it may be possible to succeed in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that information, but just to <Col N="488" /> clarify it, are they seeking people whom they would put in temporarily to a business which they are assisting or for the running of their own business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be part of their responsibilities, that they would service the industries that are being assisted by Fóir.  However, I suppose it is because of the fact that Fóir has to move into a situation where confidence is lacking that there has been some difficulty in recruiting management&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the correct calibre, but I would like to emphasise that people who would offer their services here have nothing to fear, because they would have a total State guarantee behind their employment and their future prospects.</P>
      <P>This is not the occasion to debate whether or not Fóir and the IDA should be amalgamated, but it is pertinent, as the matter has been raised here, to pose the question as to whether or not the Department of Finance is the proper Department to, as it were, supervise Fóir Teoranta. By its nature it must be a very dynamic group involved directly in the day-to-day management of industry, and Deputy Colley, I am sure, will agree with me that first-class as are the advisers to a Minister for Finance from the Department of Finance, they have not just got that day-to-day experience.  This is a matter we are closely examining, because we see the need to provide first-class, dynamic management to rescue industries which are in trouble.  As Deputy Colley and others have said, they are oftentimes in trouble, not merely due to the inadequate financial control or perhaps some passing difficulties in trade and commerce, but simply due to some defect of management.  If we can develop the right kind of management team and recruit the correct personnel it should be possible to remove this difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brugha was anxious to know where the finance is invested. <Col N="489" /> He will appreciate that it would be invidious to name companies, but I can give a breakdown of the general sectors in which the investments have been made.  In the food and food processing industry there is just £3 million or 11 per cent of the total; in textiles £3.6 million or 13.3 per cent of the total; in footwear and clothing £480,000 or 1.8 per cent of the total &mdash;perhaps that is a disappointment to Deputy Brugha&mdash;in furniture, fixtures and wood products £1.8 million or 6.7 per cent. in printing, publishing and allied industries £1.5 million or 5.5 per cent; in chemical and chemical products £1.4 million or 5.2 per cent; in non-metallic mineral products £4.3 million or 15.8 per cent; metal products £1.7 million or 6.3 per cent; machinery £875,000 or 3.2 per cent; shipping construction £4 million or 15 per cent.  Then there are miscellaneous industries £1.3 million or 4.8 per cent; distribution and other services £3.1 million or 11.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>In relation to the last figure there, one of the recent developments of the Industrial Credit Company has been to provide money for the distributive trades.  This is a new departure because originally the concept was to put money into manufacturing industry. We know all too well now, though everybody does not perhaps yet appreciate it, that the distributive trade is critically important to both industry and commerce and that is why the company has very properly in latter years invested money in the distributive end of our economy.  I trust that information may be of assistance to the House and I again express my gratitude to the House for the way in which it has dealt with this legislation.</P>

An amnesty was announced at the beginning of last month allowing illegal immigrants, who are apparently very numerous there, two weeks to declare themselves and leave the Bahamas.  The amnesty was later extended by a further period of two weeks.  I understand that this step was taken because of rising unemployment in the Bahamas.</P>

    <P>My information is that the Bahamas Government are prepared to consider financing the departure or repatriation of those illegal immigrants who are unable to do so themselves.
