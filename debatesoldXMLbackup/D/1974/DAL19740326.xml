    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of this country's increasing dependence on tourism from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, he will consider the introduction of duty-free facilities for visitors from such places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Liberal duty-free allowances apply to goods in the personal luggage of travellers between EEC member states, including, of course, Ireland and Britain.  The allowances are set out in notices published by the Revenue authorities&mdash;copies of <Col N="692" /> which are in the Dáil Library&mdash;and they have the effect of freeing certain non-commercial imports from the incidence of double-taxation.</P>
      <P>What the Deputy appears to envisage is the introduction of facilities for the purchase by travellers between this country, Britain and Northern Ireland of duty-free supplies of goods such as tobacco, alcoholic beverages, perfumes and toilet waters.</P>
      <P>I do not favour such a move for several reasons.  First of all, a significant revenue loss would be involved. Next, I do not think that the change involved would effect any significant increase in tourist numbers.  As well, it would call for additional customs staff and for more stringent control of passengers' baggage to minimise abuse. Finally, a development of this nature would run counter to EEC thinking which is orientated towards ultimately having access to duty-free facilities closed off to intra-Community travellers while continuing to be available to travellers to destinations outside the Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that several complaints have been made and people have decided not to spend their holidays here owing to the incidence of high prices, particularly of intoxicating liquor, which if they go in the other direction they can get cheaper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. If the Deputy has any information in the matter we would be very pleased to hear it.  The prices of several brands of intoxicating liquor are, in fact, cheaper in Ireland than they are in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he was correctly reported in the Press as stating that the estimated amount of revenue which will accure from the proposed new systems of capital taxation outlined in the recent White Paper will be approximately the same as that derived from the present system of capital taxation; and, if so, the statistical basis for this estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed new system of capital taxation, when in full operation, is designed to yield not less than the same amount as the present death duties.  This estimate is based on existing death duties statistics and information obtained in the <Col N="695" /> administration of such duties, suitably modified to take into account the differences in scope, incidence and rates of the proposed system.</P>
      <P>A number of factors make it difficult at this stage to estimate precisely the yield from the new system.  For example, the new taxes may after the existing pattern of gift-making and inheritances, and may afect the realisation of gains made on capital assets.  Additional revenue, which it is difficult to quantify at this stage, may accure because large amounts of capital on which tax is at present avoided should be liable to tax in future.  The yield in the initial years may not be a good indicator of the potential yield since there may be initial starting up problems, and the yield from the capital gains tax will be comparatively low in the early years of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting the qualifications which the Minister has outlined to any estimate that may be made, nevertheless, the question asks the statistical basis for the estimate. The Minister has, I think, outlined the general approach to the estimate but he has not given the statistical basis. Would he be prepared to make that available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistical basis would be those statistics which are contained in the annual reports of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister appreciates that that is an indication of the present yield of death duties but it is not any indication whatever of the yield or the manner of estimating the yield from the proposed forms of capital taxation and that is what the question sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also an indication of the known size of estates but that relates only to those estates which at the moment are subject to estate duties.  It is no indication of property accumulations which, by being distributed more than five years before death, do not come within the existing estate duty net, a point which Deputy Colley as a solicitor will appreciate.</P>

      <P>No, the estimate which has been made is based upon existing knowledge and, as I have again and again indicated, one of my greatest disappointments on becoming Minister for Finance was to discover that my immediate predecessor and his predecessors had done little or nothing to collect information which would be a guide as to where wealth lay in this country.  The only information we had was in relation to property which passed on death and not to property which was held and distributed during their lifetimes by the extremely wealthy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in connection with the preparation of the White Paper on Capital Taxation, any estimate was made of the effect of the proposals on grant-aided industries at present enjoying export tax relief; and, if so, the result of such estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is expected that the effects on grant-aided industries at present enjoying export tax relief from the proposals contained in the Government's White Paper on Capital Taxation will be nil or minimal. <Col N="697" /> The relief given to export profits is, of course, an income or profits relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is presumably aware that the White Paper issued in his name proposes to apply some forms of capital taxation to industries set up here with the aid of grants and availing themselves of export tax relief.  If that is so, how does the Minister say that the effect will be nil?  Does he not intend to apply the proposed forms of capital taxation to those industries in the way indicated in the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are at cross-purposes.  I am well aware of the fact that the relief is applied to income but the question asks the Minister whether any estimate was made of the effect of the proposals on those grant-aided industries.  Some of the proposals are to apply to those industries and the Minister says the effect will be nil.  Could he explain that, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is exactly that.  I am not sure whether Deputy Colley wants to encourage those companies, which have come over here for a variety of reasons, one of them being the relief given in respect of income&mdash;to sell out and make a capital gain.  If they were to do that they would, in future, be caught but if we did not do this they could sell out and, having made profit here, being exempt from income tax, they could then get off scot free.  We are certainly closing that.</P>

    <P>A further project which will employ 200 workers, mainly men, is due to commence in the town in about three months.

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a complaint, generally, on the inefficient and, not to use a stronger adjective, the indeterminate manner in which Government business is being ordered before this House.  I refer to that, in particular, in relation to Government business ordered for today. At the end of last week, as is usual, the business to be brought before the House for the ensuing week was notified to the Opposition.  On that occasion, last Friday, we were informed that the Health Services (Regulations) Bill would be taken on Tuesday and that the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, would follow.  That was confirmed as late as yesterday but on mid-day Friday the Government Chief Whip, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, called on the Opposition Whip and told him that it was intended to finish the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill and the budget debate before Easter.  The Government Chief Whip asked for agreement <Col N="731" /> for the three items, the Health Services (Regulations) Bill, the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill and the budget debate.</P>
      <P>The Opposition Whip was informed that unless agreement was given by us the guillotine would be used to complete the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill before the recess.  On my instructions the Opposition Whip informed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that as there appeared to be no special urgency about the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill we would not agree to finish it, whereupon the Government Chief Whip informed our Whip that the guillotine would have to be enforced.  We have no way of avoiding that but I want to point out that there are other matters that could easily have been brought before this House.  For example, the Agricultural Estimate was introduced and debated in this House as early as the second week of November and since then has been adjourned.  I can readily understand that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has been busy in recent days and in recent weeks but it is an inordinate delay that this Estimate has been allowed to stand without being finalised over that period of two or three months.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Justice was left in abeyance for almost three weeks and not resumed. I can well understand the Government's reluctance in present circumstatnces to having the Department of Justice Estimate debated but it is unnecessary, certainly not urgent, legislation before the House to the extent that the Government propose to do. The Minister for Health undertook to Deputy O'Malley on 28th February that the Health Estimate would be debated before the House in the &ldquo;next couple of weeks.&rdquo; In other words, it should have been up for debate last week or should be up this week.  I understand now that as a result of a certain proposition put to the Government Chief Whip the Minister may be in a position to introduce his Estimate next Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> There is another matter.  On 6th February, the Minister for Finance prematurely asked for the First Reading of the Finance (Taxation of Profits of Certain Mines) Bill, 1974.  On being asked why he was taking this unusual course on the opening day of a new session&mdash;the most unusual part of the unusual course being that that Bill was not then ready for circulation, I believe not even drafted&mdash;the Minister said they were working on it and he anticipated that this matter would be before the House in a month.  It is almost the end of the second month and this important legislation has not yet appeared before the House.</P>
    <P>Coming to the present day, we were informed definitely that the Health Services Regulations would have to be debated and completed in this House today so that they could go to the Seanad tomorrow and certain statutory publications could be made by Friday pending the implementation of the new health system.  We were informed at 4.30 p.m. on Friday that this was still the intention, but ten minutes later we were informed that the Department of Health were not ready.  Our Whip had been sent out on the basis that this debate would continue all day today and if there was to be a division it would be taken this evening.  Certain of us had made special arrangements and commitments, allowing for this situation.  I entered a commitment on that basis that I now cannot avoid&mdash;at any rate, not with easy grace.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as soon as the Order of Business has been forced on the House, we will be committed to debating the Electoral Bill, at any time during the course of which a guillotine motion will be introduced.  I do not know what the urgency of this Bill is, unless the Government are now feeling the fury and anger of the electorate in relation to their pre-election promises and want in some way to insulate themselves in office before they are faced with defeat in this House.  I have made my protest.  I know I have no way of enforcing it other than to challenge the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat unusual to have such a lengthy statement as the Leader of the Opposition has made.  However, I had no desire to curtail it.  I should like to say, however, that the Electoral Bill has now been before the House for a total of 46 hours of parliamentary time, compared with 39 hours for the last Electoral Bill&mdash;that was for the whole of the time of that Bill.  Deputies who were in the House at that time will recollect that it was one of the most protracted debates that ever took place.  There were many long distance speakers on the then Government side and the debate lasted 39 hours, but was completed in that time.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been before the House since before Christmas and it was expressly deferred to facilitate the Opposition, who at the time criticised the fact that Estimates were taken in preference to legislation.  We have now so many Bills before the House that they cannot be reached because the Opposition are deliberately dragging out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition was not interrupted once, and whether the Opposition like it or not I will make my statement.  The fact is that the Electoral Bill has <Col N="734" /> been dragged out at inordinate length with Deputies arguing one way and voting another for political party purposes.  The fun must stop.  It is not too much to ask that once in 50 years, five decades, we should have the right to determine the shape of the constituencies.  On every other occasion since 1923, Fianna Fáil have done it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to the alleged protracting of the debate on the Electoral Bill, the time taken on the last occasion and now is not so very much different.  May I remind the House that during the last Dáil, a Bill to prevent forcible entry to houses was before this House for five months before it was ultimately passed, a Bill far more important, as has been proved in the event?</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach where on earth is the great volume of legislation to which he has just referred. Item No. 7 is before the House; No. 8, the Trade Union (Amalgamations) Bill, 1974, we have not seen yet; No. 9, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, has been debated on Second Stage; No. 11, the Misuse of Drugs Bill, is it before the House?  Item No. 12, the Finance (Taxation of Profits of Certain Mines) Bill, is that before the House?  Where is the plethora of legislation of which the Taoiseach has spoken?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 1, I should like to establish at the outset that the counties and constituencies under discussion are the following, which is a broader list than has been indicated to us by the Chair or by the Minister&mdash;Carlow/Kilkenny; Dublin City, Dublin County, Dún Laoghaire, Kildare, Wicklow, Wexford and Meath.  Each of those counties or constituencies is referred to in amendments Nos. 1, 8, 9, 12 and 20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>If the Minister will allow me, while he gets a chance of obtaining a better briefing than he has had already&mdash;amendment No. 1 refers to Carlow/Kilkenny constituency. It refers also to the county of Wexford, where it refers to the district of Enniscorthy, certain electoral divisions in that rural district, and also to the county of Wicklow.  Therefore, I take it the Minister stands corrected.</P>

Amendment No. 12 refers to the constituency of Kildare and part of Meath.  Again, I take it the Minister stands corrected&mdash; that Meath must be under discussion here.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;the part thereof which is comprised in the constituency of Meath&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reference to the constituency of Meath there.  I do not see how we can discuss it without including reference to it.  I have indicated to the House already that Wicklow is also involved, in the constituency of Carlow/Kilkenny.  To all intents and purposes, any discussion on amendment No. 1, or group A&mdash;which is on amendments <Col N="741" /> Nos. 1, 8, 9, 12 and 20&mdash;covers the counties or the constituencies of Carlow/Kilkenny, Dublin City, Dublin County, Dún Laoghaire, Kildare, Wicklow, Wexford and Meath.

      <P>The Chair wishes to point out to the Deputy that the grouping of the amendments was the best available grouping that could be arranged and was agreed to at that stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity to waste too much time on this point because, in discussing a Constituency Bill, we all know that one constituency affects all of the other 42 or 43.  Our reference to Meath may be very slight but it will be very difficult to avoid making any reference to it when part of it is involved in an adjoining constituency which comes under this group.  It is referred to in one of the amendments.  We shall not labour the point.  We will leave it to the discretion of the Chair; if he thinks we are referring to it he can pull us up on it.</P>

I would agree with the Chair that any detailed discussion on the constituency of Meath would not be fully in order. But it is difficult to lay down a hard and fast rule on this matter because the constituency of Meath is referred to in one of the amendments under discussion.  I do not wish to delay the House on this at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should bear that in mind and ensure that brevity will be the order in regard to the matter when we come to that one.  Amendment No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Our proposals are amendments to the Bill as presented to the House by the Minister.  We recognise that there are few limitations on the Minister in drawing up electoral areas or carrying out a revision of constituencies.  The few limitations are, of course, constitutional ones which state that the minimum size of a constituency shall be three seats.  Of course, the Constitution does not lay down a maximum size.  Therefore, in drawing up these amendments or in re-drawing the constituencies, the Minister is obliged to pay heed to that fact, that he cannot <Col N="743" /> have a constituency smaller than three seats.  Of course, he can have a constituency larger than that, of any size; there is no limitation.  He could have a constituency of 148 seats. That would be constitutionally allowable. Of course, all of us on both sides of the House recognise that such a situation would be ludicrous. That is not being proposed by the Minister nor, indeed, would ever be by anyone on this side of the House. The other limitation&mdash;not a constitutional one&mdash;is the interpretation of the Supreme Court decision allowing a tolerance of plus 1,000, or minus 1,000 from the national average of the population per Deputy.  As we have already established in this debate, the national average to which we shall be referring is a figure of 20,123 persons. Therefore, one can vary above that figure by 1,000 or below it by 1,000 provided that the number of Deputies&mdash;148, which has been decided in earlier sections of the Bill&mdash;will not exceed the figure I mentioned and that the national average works out at 20,123.  It cannot be lower than 20,000 so the Minister has gone as low as possible.  The greatest number of Deputies is being allowed under the Minister's proposals.</P>

    <P>With these few limitations on the Minister and because of the important effect the actual constituency size and boundary can have on the election of Deputies from different parties, we feel, in the Opposition benches, that the community are entitled to expect that decisions on these matters are made on a fair basis and that all can see that they are being done fairly.  Because of the lack of pre-determined criteria to guide a Minister in this task, one has to examine the Bill presented to the House by the Minister and see what criteria he has followed in drawing up his revision.  I submit that, from an examination of the Minister's proposals in this Bill, one can see immediately that the Minister has determined that it shall take less persons per Deputy in the densely populated areas, for instance in the Dublin area, than in the sparsely <Col N="744" /> populated ones, for instance the western areas.</P>
    <P>If one studies the table in the explanatory memorandum one sees the difference in the deviation from national average population per member in the Dublin constituencies of North County Dublin, Clontarf, Finglas, Cabra, North Central, South East and South Central.  In the western area the constituencies of East Galway, West Mayo, Roscommon-Leitrim, Sligo-Leitrim and Clare exceed the national average substantially. One can immediately draw the conclusion that the Minister has acted most unfairly to the sparsely populated western areas.  We do not accept that the Minister has demonstrated any fair or logical reasons for doing this and in drawing up the amendments we have not accepted that practice.</P>
    <P>In the Bill the Minister has set about establishing three-seat constituencies in the densely populated Dublin area and generally the four-seat and five-seat constituencies are in rural areas.  No attempt has been made to justify having the smaller constituencies generally in the densely populated areas and having large four-seat and five-seat constituencies in rural areas.  We feel a strong case can be made for the creation of larger four-seat and five-seat constituencies in the larger urban areas.  It would be fairer if three-seat constituencies were general in the rural constituencies.</P>
    <P>In drawing up amendments to the Minister's Bill we have recognised his intention of creating three-seat constituencies in the large urban areas. Allowing for the type of criteria which the Minister has laid down for himself we feel that the distribution of the seats could have been done in a fairer manner.  At the present moment 30 Deputies are elected from the western area, that is Connaught plus County Donegal and County Clare.  The Minister proposes to reduce to 28 the number elected to that area.  He has already indicated in the discussion on the sections of the Bill that he proposes to increase the number of Deputies elected to this House <Col N="745" /> by four, from 144 to 148.  That means he has four new seats which must be distributed, in a new constituency or added to existing constituencies.  As well as that, by reducing the number elected to the western area by two he has another two seats to distribute. One can see the way these six seats have been distributed.  Five of them have been given to Dublin and one to an area in North Leinster, not far from Dublin&mdash;in fact the Minister's own constituency of Meath.  This cannot be justified on any reasonable grounds.</P>
    <P>There have been pleas from some of the Minister's colleagues during the debate here for a reasonable attitude on the part of the Opposition. We deem it an insult to the Opposition for the Minister to expect us to accept these proposals from him and the Government as being reasonable. They are not reasonable.  They are drawn up in such a manner as to bring the maximum possible advantage in an election to the Government parties if this Bill is passed.  The Bill pays no heed to the difficulties of rural areas, sparsely populated communities, the size of the constituencies and the easier accessibility of Deputies to people living in large urban areas.  It would have been reasonable to have four-seat or five-seat constituencies there.  We have had no argument from the Minister or from the few Deputies from the Government side who have spoken to justify the creation of three-seat constituencies in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Our amendments are designed to show to the Minister, this House and the country that, allowing for the limitations which are placed on any Minister carrying out this revision of the minimum of three-seat constituencies and the deviation from the national average, the fairest thing would have been to have allocated an additional seat over and above what the Minister is proposing to the western area.  I showed during the Second Stage debate that it would have been possible to retain the number of seats in the western area at 30 but, allowing for the very slight drop in population in that area against the huge increase <Col N="746" /> in population in Dublin and in Cork, a fair distribution of seats would have been one more than the Minister is giving to the west, that is 29.  The Minister could also give an extra seat to the Munster area where the population has increased around the Cork County area.  Dublin could be granted the three extra seats.  That would have been a fairer way of distributing the seats.  That is the point of drawing up these amendments.</P>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate Deputies from the Government side tried to create the impression that there was not sufficient population in the west to retain 30 seats or even have 29 seats.  It was stated that the Minister had no choice in relation to the western areas.  They said his hands were tied but I have shown quite clearly that is not the case.  Within the interpretation of the Supreme Court ruling and within the limitation of the Constitution the Minister could easily have allowed the retention of 30 seats in the west or at least could have given them 29 seats.  He has reduced representation from that area to as low as he can and has given those seats to the area which we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>In the explanatory memorandum the Minister has broken up the country into five areas which he calls Munster, the West, South Leinster, North Leinster and Dublin.  The Munster area is being given 40 seats. In the amendments I propose that area would be given 41 seats.  The extra seat is justified due to the increase in population in the area.  It is extraordinary that the Minister did not concede there was an increase in population there and that an increase in seats was justified.  There is justification for an extra seat in the Cork County area.  My amendment proposes 29 seats for the western area.</P>

      <P>In the South Leinster area the Minister proposes to have 17 seats and the amendment before the House also proposes 17 seats.  The Minister proposes to have 20 seats for the North Leinster area and the same figure is proposed under the amendment. In the Dublin area the Minister proposes to have 43 seats and the amendment proposes 41.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the amendment an extra seat is given to the west and to Munster and the Dublin area is reduced by two from what the Minister proposes.  I do not believe that the community in Dublin want any advantage in this matter.  The people of Dublin are very fair-minded and are not seeking any advantage over other parts of the country.  They enjoy many advantages as it is, because of their happy economic situation and the general industrial development that has taken place here.  A better way of life generally is enjoyed by the community in Dublin already and I do not think they seek any advantage over their country cousins and that is what the rural community are.  Dublin is populated in the main by first and second generation Dubliners and many of them will have very little sympathy with what the Minister is attempting to do here and will readily see through it.  The Minister may get his answer in the ballot box.  No matter what gerrymandering or changing or mucking about with the constituencies the Minister may carry out the people have the final say.  At the same time, the <Col N="748" /> game should be played on a fair basis. Nobody would accept that it would be fair to hold an all-Ireland with one team playing against a hill in both halves.  That is what the Minister is trying to do in arranging the constituencies as he has done.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone on the Minister's side would attempt to deny that this was the overall influencing factor behind the drawing up of the constituencies.  This has been well recognised outside.  It is our job as an Opposition to make sure that those facts are fully known and understood by the people and that no underhand methods are used.  The guillotine with which we are threatened is something which has been used very seldom in this House.  We are threatened with it in order to stifle debate on this Bill in case too much information about what the Government are doing in this Bill would get out to the people.  We are threatened that this debate will be cut short and that our opportunity to expose the wrongdoing of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is very similar to the tactics used by other Governments and the Minister will find that it brings disaster to Governments eventually rather than benefit.  It is a jackboot tactic, something which cannot bring credit on any Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Bill proposes 26 three-seat constituencies and the amendment proposes 30.  One must again come back to the creation of three-seat constituencies in the Dublin area.  We have, in drawing up the amendments, accepted that if that is what the Minister wants then we will draw up our amendments within those limitations.  We have deliberately drawn up our amendments on three-seat constituencies to show that even by doing what the Minister wants to do, you can still have a fair distribution of the number of additional seats.  The number of four-seat constituencies in the Minister's <Col N="749" /> Bill is ten and there are seven proposed in the amendment.  The number of five-seaters in the Bill is six and there are six proposed in the amendment.  It might be no harm if I got what is in the amendments on to the record in some form.  We are discussing amendments 1, 8, 9, 12 and 20.  Amendment No. 1 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 4, in the second column of the entry relating to the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, to delete all words after &ldquo;divisions of:&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Moyacomb, Newtownbarry, St. Mary's in the former Rural District of Enniscorthy;</P>
    <P>and in the administrative county of Wicklow the district electoral divisions of Cronelea, Coolboy, Coolattin, Shillelagh, Aghowle, Killinure, Rath, Money, Carnew, Ballingate in the former Rural District of Shillelagh.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 reads:</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 9 deals with Dublin constituencies and No. 12 deals with the constituency of Kildare, with a reference to the constituency of Meath.  Amendment No. 20 deals with the constituency of Wicklow, part of which under amendment No. 1 has been placed in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our principle objection to the Bill is the manner in which the new seats have been distributed.  I should like to make some comparisons between what the Minister has done in some Dublin constituencies and what he has done in western constituencies.  I shall quote the population figure for the Dublin (Cabra) constituency where there are 59,314 persons in a three-seat constituency, according to the table published by the Minister.  In the Dublin (Clontarf) constituency there are 58,592 persons in a three-seat constituency; in Dublin North Central there are 58,357 in a three-seat constituency and in Dublin South-East there are 57,875 in a three-seater.  The total population in the four constituencies is 234,138 per 12 Deputies and the average population per Deputy is 19,511.  This is in respect of Dublin constituencies that <Col N="752" /> come under the amendments we are discussing.</P>
    <P>Let us compare that with a group of constituencies in the west which elect 12 Deputies: Donegal, 5; Roscommon-Leitrim, 3; East Galway, 4.  In Donegal there are 105,509 persons for a five-seater; in Roscommon-Leitrim the Minister proposes 63,358 in a three-seat constituency; in East Galway there are 83,176 persons for a four-seat constituency.  The total number of persons required to elect 12 Deputies in the western area is 252,043, giving an average population per Deputy of 21,003.</P>
    <P>If one picks more than four areas it is possible to enlarge those figures.  It can be clearly demonstrated that it takes 17,905 more persons to elect 12 Deputies in the west than in the Dublin constituencies I have mentioned. The average per Deputy in the Dublin constituencies is 19,511 while the average in the west is 21,003, a difference of 1,492 persons.  Where is the reasonableness and the fairness in this?  How can the Minister logically argue that what he has done is fair or can be justified on any grounds other than political expediency which we and the community will not accept as justifiable grounds?</P>
    <P>If one takes the entire area east of the Shannon one realises that in that area there are 2,403,994 persons electing 120 Deputies and the average per Deputy is 20,033.  West of the Shannon the total population is 574,254 electing 28 Deputies but the average per Deputy is higher, being 20,509.  Why should it take an additional 500 persons to elect a Deputy in the west than in Dublin?  There are no arguments to justify what the Minister has done.  The deviation of a tolerance of 1,000 below the national average&mdash;which is 20,123&mdash;would give 19,123.  If that average had been applied in the western areas it would have allowed 30 Deputies to be elected.  This is a fact despite what has been said by the Minister's spokesmen who said there was no way in which the Minister could have retained 30 seats in the west.  The full constitutional requirements could be complied with while retaining 30 seats in the west.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> In the general area of South Leinster my amendment proposes 17 seats: Carlow-Kilkenny five; Laois-Offaly five; Wexford four; Wicklow three.  The Minister's amendments generally comply with that.  In the general area of North Leinster, including Cavan-Monaghan, the amendments propose 20 seats while in the general area of Dublin we propose 41 seats as against the 43 seats proposed by the Minister.  These are Dublin North-Central, three seats; Dublin North-East, three seats; Dublin (Artane), three seats; Dublin (Finglas), three seats; Dublin (Cabra), three seats; Dublin South-Central, three seats; Dublin South-East, three seats; Dublin (Rathmines West), three seats; Dún Laoghaire, five seats; South County Dublin, four seats; South West County Dublin, three seats; North County Dublin, five seats.  This makes a total of 41 seats.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have seen that we have attempted to apply the same kind of thinking as he applied when drawing up constituencies when he tried to have three-seaters but we have shown that even then 41 seats would have been a fairer number to have allocated.  In the three areas I have mentioned there are a total of 78 seats in 22 constituencies.</P>
    <P>Even though the Minister tried to ensure that three-seaters would be the norm, this was not done when it came to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown which, the Minister proposes to call Dún Laoghaire.  Four seats were allocated to this constituency but no explanation was given.  One suspects it is that the Taoiseach was elected in that area and will probably stand there at the next election.  It might be the case that he would prefer a safer seat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We suggested that in those densely-populated areas it would have been more practicable for the Minister to have made Dún Laoghaire a five-seater and to have four five-seaters in the Dublin area. People may argue that, to a certain <Col N="754" /> extent, four-seaters negative the whole purpose of proportional representation and that the only opportunity there is of getting a positive result under PR is to have constituencies comprising uneven numbers, for instance, three, five or seven, This has been ignored to a certain extent in creating four seats in this constituency.  We do not know why this exception was made and we would like to hear from the Minister on the matter.</P>

      <P>Where the Dublin constituencies are concerned, Mid County Dublin has a population of 61,000; North County Dublin has a population of 59,514; South County Dublin, 62,119; West County Dublin has a population of 63,037; Dún Laoghaire 80,864; Dublin (Artane) 61,037; Dublin (Cabra) 59,314; Dublin (Ballyfermot) 62,997; Dublin (Clontarf) 58,592; Dublin (Finglas) 60,102; Dublin North-Central, 58,357; Dublin <Col N="755" /> (Rathmines West) 60,972; Dublin South-Central, 60,216; Dublin South-East, 57,875.  These were all three-seat constituencies except Dún Laoghaire. Doing something similar&mdash;that is, creating three-seat constituencies but using a higher number of population per Deputy and not exceeding in any way the interpretation put on the Supreme Court's decision&mdash;I have shown what can be done while striving to achieve a population figure in each constituency closer to the maximum allowable, to the plus 1,000; it is possible to reduce the number of seats.  It can be done in the following constituencies: Dublin North-Central, three seats, 61,764; Dublin North-East, three seats, 61,944; Dublin (Artane), three seats, 61,206; Dublin (Finglas), three seats, 60,708; Dublin (Cabra), three seats, 61,415; Dublin South-Central, three seats, 62,600; Dublin South-East, three seats, 62,846; Dublin (Rathmines West), three seats, 62,046; Dún Laoghaire, five seats, 105,248; South County Dublin, four seats, 83,954; West County Dublin, three seats, 62,709; and then North County Dublin with five seats.  By tending to move towards the maximum population per Deputy allowable one can determine pretty closely the number of seats to be allocated.</P>
      <P>Our argument can be stated quite simply.  It would have been fairer for the Minister to use the maximum allowable in the Dublin areas and the minimum figure&mdash;minus 1,000&mdash;in the sparsely populated rural areas, mostly the west and parts of the midlands and south.  We are anxious to know why the Minister has not adopted this approach.  I was about to say when I was interrupted that I hope this is the last occasion this House will be asked to debate a revision of contituencies carried out by a political party, or political parties, or by the Government in power.  It is an unfair task to thrust on the Minister&mdash;I have that much sympathy with him&mdash;in one respect; it is wrong in principle.</P>

The cynic is entitled to say: &ldquo;It is easy to see you are in Opposition now.&rdquo; The Minister said they want to have their bite of the cherry.  We suggest that it should at least be a fair bite.  The size of constituencies can determine the number of Deputies returned by any party. That has been elaborated on considerably by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald.</P>

It makes my position here as Opposition spokesman on local government very difficult because I am inhibited by the threat of the guillotine.  Normally one has a reasonable expectation that amendments tabled will be seriously considered and possibly accepted.  We had a clear indication before this debate started at all that no amendment would be accepted, that amendments would not even be debated and neither would time be allowed to argue why such and such has been done in any constituency and why no changes will be accepted.  The Government intend to drop a guillotine motion and pass the Bill holusbolus.</P>

If none is going to be considered what is the point in discussing them?  It took me many more hours to draw up the amendments than the debate has taken so far.  I think the Chair said 40 hours.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make a special plea to the Minister to reconsider the attitude obviously adopted by the Government to these amendments. I think I have submitted reasonable amendments.  Deputies from the various constituencies will be able to speak in greater detail about their own constituencies, if the Minister will allow them.  I spent long hours drawing these up for the purpose of showing how the revision could be done with a fair distribution of population. It can be done by granting a preference in the tolerance range, by going above in densely populated areas and below in the sparsely populated areas.  That is the whole principle underlining my amendments.  I do not think the people in Dublin will thank the Minister for what he is trying to do because he is giving with one hand and taking away with the other.  This is something to be regretted. By keeping with the Supreme Court ruling I have shown that you can have these three-seat constituencies going slightly over the 20,123. In North County Dublin my amendment shows a deviation from the national average of plus 950.  We have a population of 105,367 electing five Deputies and the average is 21,073.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the South-West County Dublin three-seat constituency which I propose, the deviation from the national average population per member is plus 708.  The total population within that proposed constituency, as amended, is 62,709, and the population per Member is 20,093.  In the South County Dublin constituency, as proposed, the population per Member is 20,988; in the five-seat constituency of Dún Laoghaire it would be 21,049; in the Dublin (Artane) constituency it would be 20,402.  In the Dublin (Cabra) constituency the population per Member would be 20,471; in Dublin South-Central constituency it would be 20,866 per Deputy; in Dublin South-East it is 20,948; in Dublin South-Central it would be 20,588; in Dublin North-East it would be 26,048.  In the Dublin (Finglas) constituency, as proposed <Col N="759" /> in my amendment, the average population per Deputy would be 20,246.  In the Dublin (Rathmines West) constituency, as proposed in my amendment, there would be an average population per Deputy of 20,682.  The average population per Member according to these figures varies from 20,236 to 21,049.  They are still a long way from the figure of 21,123 which is the maximum allowable as one interprets the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court never said that one could not deviate by more than 1,000.  The Bill presented to them following their first decision did not deviate more than 1,000 above or below. That Bill was accepted as being constitutional and has been accepted as the norm since by us when in Government and by the Coalition Government now in office.  Let us not create any illusion that the figure of 20,000 is a constitutional figure or that it is a direction from the courts as a specific interpretation of the Constitution.  It is not.  They could not do that.  They could only decide what was reasonable.  They have not stated a figure as being specifically the allowable figure.  By taking the figure of 20,000 per Member and going above or below it, one can bring about a fair distribution and that is what we have done in these amendments.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister done to the Dublin constituencies?  Why has he chosen three-seaters?  Why has he chosen in so many of them to go below the national average of 20,123? Why has he not given an extra seat to the Cork County area which, on the results of the population census taken in 1971, was justifiable?  Why has he dealt so harshly and severely with the western areas by reducing the number of seats from 30 to 28?  These factors are inter-related because if the numbers in the western area had not been reduced, as the Minister did, five extra seats could not have been added to the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>I hope what Deputy Molloy said is repeated on the BBC. We will then find out what Fianna Fáil say here and what they say when they get out into the country.  A Leas-Cheann Chomhairle, I am sorry to have chased the hare which Deputy Molloy introduced.</P>
      <P>The Constitution provides that the population/Deputy ratio shall be, as far as possible, the same throughout the country.  Deputy Molloy should know this.  It does not say that representations shall be biased in favour of rural areas or against urban areas.  It simply requires equality of representation throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy while he was correct, left out one point.  I should like to have this quotation in the official record:</P>
      <P>Dealing with this question in 1961 the High Court was quite explicit. The Court declared that there is &ldquo;no direction whatsoever contained in the Constitution that these matters of difficulties of communications, differing economic interests, differing modes of life or the convenience of constituents or the difficulties of deputies or any of the other matters relied on by the defendant, should be taken into consideration when the legislation is performing its functions in enacting the electoral laws&rdquo;.  The Court concluded that in determining constituencies the legislature was required to aim at the achievement of as near an equality of the parliamentary representation of the population as can be attained.</P>
      <P>They did not make it part of the ruling but they considered that 1,000 up or down would be reasonable.  That is why it was put in the last Bill and in this one too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy has told us of all the trouble he went to and all the time he took in preparing his amendments. Those amendments bear no resemblance to what he was doing while Minister for Local Government. I have copies of his files and have offered to show them to him.  In them he made a number of <Col N="762" /> proposals which, with the exception of possibly Carlow-Kilkenny, do not go anywhere near the proposals which he has in his amendments.  He is continually changing his mind.  I am sure if he sat down again to draw up other amendments that the spirit would move him in a different direction. Because Deputy Molloy puts something on paper that does not make it very important or something which we should accept.  I should like Deputy Molloy to understand that.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out a couple of things to him.  I found that the Ballymun area was divided among three constituencies.  In this Bill I put the three of them together in one constituency.  Deputy Molloy again proposes to divide them into three constituencies.  If you can find justification for doing something like that, you can find justification for doing nearly anything.  In the Bill, Ballyfermot is a constituency in its own right.  According to Deputy Molloy it should be divided between two County Dublin constituencies, North County and South-West County and the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny would be made up of areas drawn from four different counties, all of counties Carlow and Kilkenny, together with parts of Wexford and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I described some of his efforts before he left office as trying to have a dog's breakfast.  Nothing else could describe what he was trying to do with the Bill.  I never saw anything so bad in my life as his efforts.  He did not seem to have the foggiest notion of what would be acceptable. He threw a bundle of areas together and asked somebody to draw up a map showing what they would look like.  Having done that&mdash;according to himself he had nothing prepared before he left office&mdash;he now comes in here with amendments which he tries to justify by using very selected statistics.  Deputy Molloy knows as well as everybody else that, provided you select the right figures, you can prove almost opposite things by just moving them around.  Deputy Molloy selected his figures and his areas.  He was discussing the Dublin <Col N="763" /> areas and Carlow-Kilkenny, but he proceeded to talk about the effect on the areas west of the Shannon and east of the Shannon, and he went round and around.</P>

      <P>To me it would appear that Deputy Molloy was doing this because whoever drew up the constituencies, whether it was himself or somebody else&mdash;the backroom boys&mdash; he was not aware of what they meant to do.  He had his amendments here and he was not able to explain them. Instead of trying to explain them, he roamed all over the country and pointed out what was wrong with various constituencies, and he made an occasional fleeting visit back to Dublin.</P>
      <P>The question was posed: why three-seaters in Dublin?  There is one very good reason for having three-seaters in Dublin.  Deputy Molloy said something which is quite true.  He said that odd numbers, three or five, represent proportional representation much better than even numbers.  That is one very good reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another reason why I decided on three-seaters in Dublin.  This is very remarkable. Shortly after the change of Government when the constituency changes were being talked about, Deputy Lemass was the Fianna Fáil representative on a radio programme.  He advocated three-seaters for Dublin.  I will not say he made up my mind for me but he agreed that the fairest representation in Dublin would be achieved by having three-seaters.  On that programme he was speaking for Fianna Fáil.  I know they can change their mind and say one thing here and another in Galway and another on RTE or the BBC.</P>
      <P>We must come down to facts.  I got the job of drawing up the constituencies. For 40 years Fianna Fáil divided the constituencies to suit themselves.  I challenge them to deny that.  Now they are yowling like old women when, for the first time, somebody else is changing the constituencies. In my opinion the Dublin constituencies are very fair.  On one occasion an effort was made by one of my predecessors to amend the Constitution and to have regard to the extent and accessibility of constituencies and the need for securing convenient areas of representation and the desirability of avoiding the overlapping by constituencies of county boundaries.  He felt at the time that about one-sixth would be a better way of doing it rather than the 1,000 or thereabouts about which we have been talking.  This constitutional amendment was beaten.  There were 656,803 against and 424,185 for the proposal.  That would not worry Fianna Fáil now.  They would say it did not mean a darned thing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy should remember that, according to his proposal, he would have a population of 20,776 per Deputy in Dublin but in Cork he would have a population of 19,414 per Deputy and every Dublin Deputy would represent 1,300 more people than a Cork Deputy would represent. Then he talks about equal representation and about doing things fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> There is no doubt that if every Deputy, including yourself, Sir, had the opportunity of drawing up a Constituencies Bill there would be 144 different Bills before the House because each person has his own idea of how it should be done.  I have got the job of doing it and I have a Bill here which I consider fair.  When we come to County Meath on the other amendments I will explain fully why it is proposed to have four Deputies in that county.  As the Bill stands the areas which are covered by these amendments are fairly drawn and will be fairly represented.  It is only somebody like Deputy Molloy who wants to find something to complain about who will find a reason for objecting to them; changing them around and introducing what Deputy Molloy suggests would make them different.  It would certainly make them no better and, in my opinion, it would make them a whole lot worse.  I am satisfied that the Bill before the House will be accepted by the general public as being a fair Bill.  As one who suffered severely from the activities of people in Fianna Fáil who wanted to gerrymander and put people out of this House I believe this is a fair effort to give fair play to everybody.</P>
    <P>It is rather interesting that in the suggested amendments Carnew was to be removed from Wicklow.  Would the fact that the former Deputy Paudge Brennan lives in Carnew and would, therefore, have extreme difficulty in getting back here if it were removed from Wicklow have anything to do with the idea of moving it out and, if not, what was at the back of it?</P>

      <P>The Minister made an attack on Deputy Molloy's motives and his ability and then he proceeded to talk about PR and how fairly it works in three and five-seat constituencies, conveniently forgetting his own constituency of Meath which was a three-seater and which he is now making a four-seater to suit himself. The Minister did not attempt to speak about Deputy Molloy's amendments. I will speak about the Dublin area, the one I know best.  With the exception of one area, Deputy Molloy's suggestions are all uneven numbers.  The North County would be a five-seater whereas, as proposed by the Minister, it would be a three-seater.</P>
      <P>The Minister made great play of the fact that in his proposal the whole satellite town of Ballymum will be put into one constituency compared with the division of it into three previously. What the Minister forgets is that in putting Ballymun into one constituency he has divided another part of Ballymun into three, this being at Collins Avenue.  Part of Collins Avenue will be in the new Finglas constituency, another part of it will be in the Dublin (Artane) constituency and the other part will be in the North County constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they have similar problems but the Minister conveniently forgets he is doing this.  We are speaking about amendments proposed by Deputy Molloy but we know from the threat of the guillotine which we are living under, and surviving under, that none of these amendments will be accepted irrespective of what is proposed or said.  In my view it is an indication of the fact that the Minister is ashamed of this legislation.  I do not blame the Minister completely for this legislation because in a coalition system both parties have to have their bite of the cherry and take a bit of what is going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> This can be seen in the Dún Laoghaire area where the Minister has proposed a four-seater constituency. The Minister has told us that proportional representation works much fairer in constituencies with an uneven number of seats, but how does he stand over the Taoiseach's constituency of Dún Laoghaire which has been left a four-seater?  Deputy Molloy, using the Minister's yardstick of uneven membership in a constituency, suggested that Dún Laoghaire should be a five-seater.  The Minister, when he was speaking, did not try to answer this question.  He spoke of the fact that one can take selective statistics and prove practically anything. There is no better man in this House than the Minister to be selective in his use of statistics and figures.</P>
    <P>Nobody in Dublin wants to take anything away from their country cousins, and most of us are only first or second generation out of the country, but the Minister is proposing a complete annihilation of the representation in the country and moving it all within the boundaries of the greater Dublin area, an area which he knocks in his own White Paper.  We can see his efforts at building up this area by the membership he proposes and by the geographical positioning of the Cabinet. They are mostly from the Pale and the Minister is trying to ensure that the next Cabinet will be from the Pale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Minister's job to reply to the amendments but in his usual manner he refused to reply to them or to the proposals put forward by Deputy Molloy.  He became abusive, as he is now.  I cannot say that I blame him because I would be ashamed of this Bill if it was left to me to introduce it.  This is why he is trying to guillotine this debate.</P>
      <P>The constituency of North County Dublin was for many years a five-seater. In his proposal the Minister is suggesting a three-seat constituency for the Fingal area together with selected parts of the city.  Deputy Molloy's proposal is for a five-seater in North County Dublin.  That is far more desirable because it would involve a constituency of approximately two county council electoral areas which work very closely together and would give the people of the county the numerical representation they are entitled to.  A five-seat constituency for North County Dublin would benefit the people of the area.</P>
      <P>The Minister has butchered the constituency of North County Dublin to such an extent that he has to go chasing into parts of County Kildare for a west county constituency and has to go to parts of the city and parts of Wicklow to get himself a mid county constituency.  The Minister referred earlier, when replying to Deputy Molloy's proposal in relation to Carlow-Kilkenny, to the fact that it was breaking various county boundaries but the Minister's own proposals in mid-County Dublin would take in part of the city, part of the county and part of Wicklow.  Is that justice?  In the part of Wicklow he goes to he has to go through West County Dublin.  The Minister is trying to bring in Saggart and Rathcoole into West County Dublin in order to copperfasten the position of my true friend the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Clinton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Saggart and Rathcoole are natural places for mid-County Dublin if we <Col N="769" /> were to go by the Minister's rules. To get from part of Mid County Dublin one has to drive through Tallaght, through west county Dublin and practically into Wicklow in order to get to what the Minister politely calls, &ldquo;another part of Mid County Dublin&rdquo;.  Who does the Minister think he is kidding?  It is no wonder that the Minister, when he got up to reply to Deputy Molloy's reasoned and well-thought out amendments, was abusive. I am surprised that the Minister is treating the proposals of Deputy Molloy in such an off-hand manner.</P>
    <P>We now have the pleasure of the company of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who represents the Ballymun area as I do.  The situation is that the Minister for Local Government claims that it is the great benefit of his Bill to bring all of Ballymun into one constituency.  However, that is not the case.  It is one section of Ballymun, and he is forgetting the section of old Ballymun, around the church, which is being divided in three.  Deputy Molloy's proposal in relation to this area would be of greater benefit to the people.  The overall picture of the Dublin region, as suggested by Deputy Molloy, is much fairer on a national basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister when he sat on this side of the House spoke about gerrymandering Bills, <i>et cetera.</i> When the Constituency Commission Bill, 1968, was before this House, he said, at column 1136 of the Official Report for 26th November:</P>
    <P>I will be brief.  I do not want to embarrass the Chair and I thank him for giving me the opportunity to speak.  The action of the Minister for Local Government is typical of a man who not alone wants to stamp on the whole country but to walk on this House as well as on the Chair.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go bhfuil Dáil Éireann míshásta nár fógraíodh fós ón Rialtas aon pholasaí maidir leis an nGaeltacht nó i leith na Gaeilge agus go n-iarrann sí láithreach é.</P>
      <P>Chuir mé an tairiscint seo ar chlár na Dála mí ó shin mar go raibh imní agus eagla orm nach raibh an Rialtas nua seo chun a chíon féin a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge agus ar son na Gaeltachta.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé liomsa ní féidir ná ní ceart dom deighilt a dhéanamh eatorru: brathann an Ghaeilge ar an nGaeltacht, brathann an Ghaeltacht agus forbairt na Gaeltachta ar mhuintir na hÉireann uile.  Marach suim a bheith agam sa Ghaeilge ní bheadh níos mó suime agam sa Ghaeltacht mar cheantar nó i muintir na Ghaeltachta ná mar atá agam i muintir Chontae Liatroma, i muintir Chille Dara nó in áit ar bith in Éirinn nach bhfuil suite i Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Tá sé ar intinn agam mo chuid smaointe a nochtadh ar an dtairiscint seo chomh maith in Éirinn agus is feidir liom é, chomh réasúnta agus is féidir liom é agus geallaim go ndéanfaidh mé é chomh fada agus is féidir liom é.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal liom&mdash;déanfaidh mé iarracht chomh fada agus is féidir liom é&mdash; dearmad glan a déanamh ar an méid adúirt ball amháin den Rialtais mí ó shin.  Déanfaidh mé iarracht dearmad a dhéanamh gur tháinig sé anseo um thráthnóna.  Is cuma liom ar tháining sé chun mo dhúshlán a thabhairt nó ar tháinig sé&mdash;agus tá súil agam gur mar sin atá&mdash;chun éisteacht liom agus go mbeidh sé sásta ag deireadh na díospóireachta na rudaí a dúras a chur i gcomórtas leis na rudaí adúirt sé fhéin agus, dá bharr sin gur fearrde an bheirt againn agus gur fearrde muintir na hÉireann uile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ó tháinig Fianna Fáil i réim, agus chun a bheith faeráilte caithfear é seo a rá freisin faoin Rialtas a chuaigh rompu, bhí sé mar aidhm acu an Ghaeilge a aibheochan.  Níl éinne a thuigeann stair na tíre seo nach ndéarfadh <Col N="771" /> go raibh sin ceart agus cóir agus iontuigthe mar aidhm ag páirtí polaitíochta nó ag Rialtas ar bith sa tír seo. Chuireadar chuige chomh maith in Éireann agus ab fhéidir leo.  Bhí deacrachtaí ann.  Cheana féin bhí iarracht déanta ag an Rialtas a chuaigh rompu idéal na Gaeilge a chur ar inneal nó machine nach raibh in ann chuige agus, dá bhrí sin, tharla go mór-mhór sna scoileanna agus in áiteacha eile nárbh iad, gur cheap dream áirithe go raibh cinéal áirithe deachtóireachta ag baint leí nó go raibh cinéal míréasúntachta ag baint leis an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios ag gach duine atá anseo, sinne go raibh orainn an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim ar scoil nó a rinne iarracht ar í a fhoghlaim, gur in aghaidh an chórais a rinneamar é. Rinneadh iarracht an aidhm sin a chur ar aghaidh agus níor ghlac lucht an oideachais nach raibh múinteoirí na tíre oilte go maith ná a ndóthain chuige.  Ba é an módh céanna a chuireadh i bhfeidhm i dtaobh na Gaeilge a chuireadh i dtaobh na classics&mdash;an Laidin agus an Ghréigis.  Níos measa ná sin, níl a fhios agam cén fáth, shílfeá gur le sibhialtacht a bhí caite a bhain na ceachtanna agus gach rud eile a bhain le múineadh na Gaeilge. Chuir sin éadóchas ar dhaoine.</P>
    <P>Raghainn níos fuide ná sin; chuir sé saghas múisc ar mhicléinn agus ní thógfainn orthu é.  Bhí daoine, go mór-mhór muintir na cathrach, ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim tré mhéan na scríobhnóireachta agus na gramadaí.  Bhí oiread pléisiúir á fháil ag na daoine as na ceachtanna agus a ghebhaidis as cuairt a thabhairt ar on bhfiaclóir.  Ní raibh a fhios agam go bhféadfadh an oiread sin ceachtanna bheith ann a bhain leis an módh coinníollach, an aimsir fháistineach, an ginideach uatha, rudaí atá tábhachtach i gcóras theanga ar bith ach nach raibh feiliúnach do theanga a chur á labhairt ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Níl me ag cur milleáin ar éinne.  Ag an am ní raibh tuiscint níos fearr ag éinne ar an scéal de réir dealraimh. Is deacair liom a thuiscint cén fáth nár thuig na daoine sin gurbh é an rud is mó a bhí ag teastáil muintir na <Col N="772" /> tíre a chur ag labhairt na Ghaeilge chomh maith agus ab fhéidir leo é agus gur ar labhairt na Gaeilge ba cheart an bhéim a chur i n-ionad ar an scríbhneóireacht nó ar an bpeannadóireacht. De réir a chéile tá an ceacht foghlamtha agus tá a fhios ag chuile dhuine anseo go bhfuil anchreidiúint ag dul don Teachta Pádraig Faulkner faoin curriculum nua a thug sé isteach sna scoileanna. Anois tá an bhéim ar labhairt na Gaeilge go mór-mhór san mbunscoil.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam gur ag feabhsú agus ag láidriú a bhéas an bhéim sin amach anseo agus cé go ndearnadh roinnt mhaith botún ar an dtaobh eile is íontach an dul chun cinn a rinneadh maidir leis an eolas a chuir daoine ar an nGaeilge.  Is íontach ar fad an méid Gaeilge atá, abair, i lár na cathrach anseo ach nach bhfuil na daoine á labhairt.  Admhaím é sin agus tuigim go maith é mar níor foghlamaíodar í mar theanga le labhairt.  D'foghlamaíodar í mar theanga le scríobh nó le léamh.</P>
    <P>Tá imní orm nach mbeidh an Rialtas seo sásta leanúint leis an obair atá déanta go dtí seo.  Chomh fada is a bhaineann sé liomsa tá cead ag chuile dhuine a rogha rud a dhéanamh nó a rá ach is deacair liom a thuiscint cén fá nach nglacfadh duine ar bith de Rialtas na tíre seo go n-aithníonn furmhór mhuintir na tíre nach bhfuil aon chomhartha náisiúntachta níos fearr acu ná an teanga, go n-aithníonn siad go bhfuil sé intuigthe go mbeadh sé mar aidhm agus idéal acu go mbeadh an teanga sin mar meán cumarsáide sa tír amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Nílim á rá go bhféadfainn a chruthú go mbeadh sé mar theanga labhartha taobh istigh de chúpla mí nó de chúpla bliain nó roimh dheireadh an chéaid seo ach ba cheart go mbeadh áthas orainn go léir go bhfuil sé mar aidhm agus mar idéal againn an Ghaeilge a bheith á labhairt ó Bhéal Féirste go Corcaigh uair éigin.  Measaim nach bhfuil sé sin mí-réasúnta agus admhaím, ag breathnú ar an nGaeilge, gur rud é atá romhainn.  Tagann ceo ar an bpeictiúr sin uaireannta ach is é peictiúr <Col N="773" /> ba cheart a bheith ag chuile dhuine ná peictiúr den chaoi ab fhearr do mhuintir na hÉireann a bheith ag maireachtáil lena chéile uair éigin.  Sílim go bhfuil ceart ag mo ghasúirí an aidhm sin a bheith acu agus sílim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go dtuigfeadh siad gurbh í sin tuairim an Rialtais is cuma cén Rialtas atá i réim.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine ann adéarfadh go bhfuil sé éasca go leor ag Fianna Fáil a bheith ag caint anois agus iad sa bhFreasúra.  Tá mé ag smaoineamh an t-am ar fad ar an snaidhm atá idir an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht.  Bheadh sé tráthúil tagairt a dhéanamh do leabhrán eolais Roinn na Gaeltachta a foilsíodh i 1970.  Ar leathanach 52 tá litir ón Taoiseach dár dáta an 27 Samhain, 1968, litir a chuir sé chuig gach Aire maidir le forbairt na Gaeltachta.  Níl mé chun í go léir a léamh ach ba mhaith liom, le do chead-sa, a Cheann Comhairle, an chéad alt a léamh.  Dúirt an Taoiseach:</P>
    <P>A Aire, a chara,</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol duit, tá leagtha síos ag an Rialtas nach foláir an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú agus a neartú cun go bhféadfar an Ghaeilge a shlánú.  Is aidhm atá le beartas an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht gníomhaíochtaí oiriúnacha eacnamaíochta a spreagadh agus a fhairsingiú agus cúrsaí sóisialacha a fheabhsú ionas go mbeidh deiseanna leormhaithe ag na daoine a chónaíonn sa Ghaeltacht agus arb í an Ghaeilge a ngnáthurlabhra, chum fostaíocht shochrach a fháil agus caighdeán réasúnta mhaireachtála a bheith acu.  Leagadh síos an méid sin ceithre bliana ó shin nuair a bhí an Páipéar Bán um Aibheochan na Gaeilge á ullmhú againn.</P>
    <P>Níl imithe ó Fianna Fáil maidir leis an méid atá ansin agus tagairt eile nach iad don Ghaeilge.  Tá sé mar aidhm ag Fianna Fáil an Ghaeilge d'athbheochan.  Dá n-imeodh an aidhm sin d'imeodh mise agus tá mé cinnte go n-imeodh gach ball de Fhianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag trácht ar na deacrachtaí <Col N="774" /> a bhain leis an Ghaeilge maidir leis na scoileanna.  Theastaigh uaim trácht ar na deacrachtaí a bhain leis an Ghaeltacht féin, maidir le deis mhaireachtála ann.  Nuair a tháinig Fianna Fáil isteach ní raibh morán sa Ghaeltacht ach an bochtaineas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Más sampla den bhochtaineas an Rúnaí Parlaiminte, bail ó Dhia air.  An fhaid a leanann sé féin agus a leithéidí ag caitheamh anuas ar Ghaeilge Bhaile Atha Cliath, ní bheidh aon dul ar aghaidh i leith na Gaeilge, agus b'fhéidir go smaoineodh a chara, a bhí ag rá go rabhamar ag éileamh úinéaracht ar an Ghaeilge, caint a thabhairt ar chúirt éigse áit a thugtar le tuiscint nach raibh cead ag éinne taobh amuigh de Dhaingean an Ghaeilge a labhairt, agus tuigfidh sé cuid des na deacrachtaí atá le sárú.</P>
      <P>Ní raibh ann acht an bochtaineas nuair d'imigh Fine Gael.  Ní thógfainn orthu é.  Bhí deacrachtaí ann; bhí bochtaineas in áiteacha eile sa tír seachas an Ghaeltacht an uair úd, agus dob é an gad ba ghoire don scórnach iarracht a dhéanamh na daoine a choinneáil beo.  Bhunaigh Fianna Fáil an dole agus bhain sé leis an Ghaeltacht.  Bhí imirce ón Ghaeltacht agus go dtí lár na dachaidí bhí saol bocht anróch sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Diaidh ar ndiaidh&mdash;agus níl mise ag rá gur Fianna Fáil amháin a rinne é &mdash;tháinig feabhas ar an Ghaeltacht. Bunaíodh Gaeltarra.  Bunaíodh miontionscail i dtosach agus níos déanaí ná sin, bhrú mór-thionscail isteach. Cuireadh feabhas ar na bóithre agus ar na tithe, agus tá mise sásta anois go bhfuil slí maireachtála chomh maith ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus atá in áit ar bith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá mé sásta a admháil chomh fada is a bhaineann sé leis an Aire nua go bhfuil seisean chomh dúthrachach faoin obair sin is a bhéinnse nó mo leithéid nó éinne a chuaigh roimhe. Ach tá imní orm go bhfuil an Rialtas seo chun deighilt a dhéanamh idir an Ghaeltacht agus an chuid eile de mhuintir na hÉireann, gurb é meon <Col N="775" /> an Rúnaí Parlaiminte a thiocfaidh i réim, agus go mbeidh an Rialtas sásta cuidiú leis na daoine atá sa Ghaeltacht fanúint ann agus an Ghaeilge a labhairt ansin, ach gur cuma sa diabhal leo muintir na hÉireann atá fágtha.</P>
    <P>Arís chun feabhas a chur ar an scéal, bhunaigh Aire Airgeadais Fhianna Fáil Comhairle na Gaeilge i 1968 nó 1969.  Chuala mé uair amháin, dá mba rud é go raibh sé ar intinn agat rud a dhéanamh agus gur theastaigh uait leithscéal, d'fhéadfá coiste a bhunú.  Ach má tá sampla ar bith a chruthaíonn, mí-fhírinne an ruda sin, is í Comhairle na Gaeilge í. Bhí ar an gComhairle sin suas le 30 de na daoine ab fhearr sa tír seo chun an scéal a bhreithniú agus chun moltaí a chur os comhair an Rialtais maidir leis an chaoi ab fhearr chun an Ghaeilge a chur in úsáid mar mheán cumarsáide geinearálta agus mar chomhartha féiniúlachta agus comhartha ionannais mhuintir na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Ní gá dom cur in iúl d'éinne go bhfuil suim aige sa cheist cé chomh tábhachtach is atá na tuarascáil sin atá curtha os ár gcomhair ag Comhairle na Gaeilge.  Cuireadh ar fáil dúinn freisin&mdash;is trua liom nár tháinig sé níos luaithe ná 1972&mdash;<i>Gníomh don Ghaeltacht.</i> An chuid is mó des na moltaí atá ansin, tá siad ar eolas ag muintir an Tí seo.</P>
    <P>Moladh go mbeadh údarás faoi leith ann don Ghaeltacht.  Táim lán-cinnte go raibh sé ar intinn ag Fianna Fáil an moladh sin a chur i ngníomh&mdash;go mbeadh údarás ag muintir na Gaeltachta, go mbeadh ionadaíocht ag muintir na Gaeltachta ar an udáras sin.  Ach níos tábhachtaí ná sin fós, sampla den dlúth-bhaint atá idir an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge&mdash;tá moladh ansin go mbeadh bord faoi leith ann, Bord na Gaeilge.  Dá mbeadh Fianna Fáil in oifig anois, chuirfidís an bord sin ar bun, ghlacfaidís go h-iomlán le moltaí Chomhairle na Gaeilge agus ghlacfaidís le <i>Gníomh don Ghaeltacht.</i> Má tá an tAire is ann a rá liomsa gur mar sin atá beidh mé sásta ansin go bhfuil an Rialtas seo chomh dúthrachtach, chomh dáiríre <Col N="776" /> maidir leis an nGaeilge agus maidir leis an nGaeltacht agus atá mé féin.  Tabhair faoi ndeara, a Cheann Comhairle, an caoi ina gcuirimíd an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht le chéile.  Nuair a bheidh an tAire ag caint tá súil agam go mbeidh sé in ann é sin a rá.  Ó chuir mé aithne air mar Aire caithfidh mé a admháil nach bhfuair mé uaidh ach an fhírinne ach muna mbíonn sé in ann a rá go bhfuil an Rialtas seo chomh dúthrachtach maidir leis an nGaeilge agus maidir leis an nGaeltacht is a bhí Fianna Fáil agus na Rialtais eile atá imithe tuigfidh mé uaidh é agus ní airsin a chuirfidh mé an milleán.</P>
    <P>Scaití tarlaíonn sé go mbíonn comhluadar ag duine nár chuir sé fios orthu nó nach iad an comhluadar is fearr go mba mhaith leis féin a bheith aige ach ina dhiaidh sin is uile measaim go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go dtiocfadh sé ó Aire na Gaeltachta, go dtiocfadh sé ón Aire Airgeadais, sé sin, nuair nach bhfuil sé tagtha cheana féin ón Taoiseach go bhfuilid i ndáiríre maidir leis an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Sul a chríochnóidh mé, ba mhaith liom rud nó dhó eile a luadh.  Le bliain nó dhó anuas tá an-chuid cloiste againn faoi seo nó faoi siúd&mdash; faoi cheartanna an duine, ceartanna faoin mBunreacht.  Cuireann sé íonadh orm go bhfuil roinnt mhaith daoine sa tír seo agus, de réir mar fheicimse é, níl an meas céanna acu ar cheartanna an duine chomh fada a bhaineann sé leis an nGaeilge faoin Bhunreacht agus atá acu ar cheartanna an duine chomh fada is a bhaineann sé leis an &ldquo;contraception&rdquo;. A chead féin agus a chiall féin ag chuile dhuine ach léigh mé sa <i>Tribune, Tribune</i> na seachtaine seo caite, go raibh fear os comhair na cúirte ar An Spidéal.  Tá riail ann, gan trácht ar na ceartanna atá ag an duine sin faoin mBunreacht go bhfuil dualgas ar ghardaí ansin a gcuid fianaise a thabhairt i nGaeilge.  Tá sé iontuigthe go dtuigfeadh muintir na h-áite é.  Dúirt breitheamh nach dtabharfadh sé an cead sin agus nach raibh sé chun an riail sin a chur i bhfeidhm.  Ní fhaca mé gur tháinig <Col N="777" /> éinne ón Rialtas seo i gcabhair ar an nduine sin.  Ní fhaca mé go ndearna aon Aire nó aon Teachta, is cuma ón chathair nó ón Ghaeltacht féin é, aon tagairt do cheartanna an duine sin faoin mBunreacht seo atá againn.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir gurab amhlaidh a thuigeann siad go bhfuil iarracht á dhéanamh go n-imeoidh nó go ndéanfar leasú éigin ar an gceart sin atá ag Éireannach faoin mBunreacht agus go bhfuil daoine san Rialtas nua seo agus gur &ldquo;embarrassment&rdquo; dóibh a leithéid a bheith ann nó go gceapann siad gur fearr a bhéas muintir Shasana i ngrá linn má thréigimid an Ghaeilge. Ní féidir liom labhairt ar son na Sasanach ach measaim go dtuigim men ghnáth-dhaoine na tíre seo.  Má tá faoi dhuine ar bith san Rialtas nua aon athrú a dhéanamh maidir le staid na Gaeilge maidir le h-aithint na Gaeilge mar theanga náisiúnta na tíre seo mholfainn dó an dara tuairim a bheith aige.  Mholfainn dó nó dhóibh nach nglacfaidh muintir na tíre uathu é.  Is cinnte nach nglacfaidh muintir Fhianna Fáil uathú é.  D'fhéadfá bheith ag trácht ar an gceist seo go maidin agus ní bheadh ráite agat a mba cheart duit a rá.  Tá súil agam nach gceapann an tAire go ndúirt mé rud ar bith nár bhain ar a laghad an fhírinne leis.  Tá súil agam go dtuigeann sé go dteastaíonn ó mhuintir na tíre seo an Ghaeilge a bheith acu.  Aontaíonn siad liomsa agus aontaím féin leo.  Thánamar timpeall air de shlí contráilte b'fhéidir ach níl rud ar bith níos luachmhaire againn ná an Ghaeilge.  Ní ghlacaimse gur rud í a sháitheann tú isteach le na rudaí go léir atá san dtimpeallacht.  Ní ghlacaim leis an dtuairim sin ar chor ar bith.  Tá sí ann agus í níos tábhachtaí ná rud ar bith eile.  Ní fhásfaidh sí ná ní bheidh toradh uirthi muna bhfaghaidh sí cúnamh.  Ní bhfaghaidh sí an cúnamh sin mura mbeidh polasaí nó plean leagtha amach agus faoi láthair tá plean na Gaeilge níos tábhachtaí fós ná plean na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>Go scriosfar na focail uile i ndiaidh &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; agus go gcuirfear an méid seo a leanas ina n-ionad:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;ag aontú lena bhfuil fógraithe agus déanta ag an Rialtas le bliain anuas ar mhaithe le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus leas na Gaeilge.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Ar dtúis, ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Teachta Tunney as ucht é a cheapadh mar phríomh-chainteóir ón bhFreasúra ar chúrsaí na Gaeltachta</P>
      <P>Táimse ag iarraidh ar an Teach aontú lena bhfuil fógraithe agus déanta ag an Rialtas le bliain anuas ar mhaithe le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus leas na Gaeilge.  Tá cúiseanna maithe ann go ndéanfaí é sin agus tá beartaithe agam, sa mhéid ama atá ar fáil dom sa díospóireacht seo, tuairisc ar a bhfuil déanta agus á dhéanamh againn a thabhairt mar léiriú ar na cúiseanna sin.</P>

      <Col N="779" /> Taispeánann an soláthar méadaithe atá againn i Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta don bhliain airgeadais 1973-74 £3,828,000 san iomlán i gcomparáid le £2,784,000 a caitheadh ar na seirbhísí céanna sa bhliain airgeadais 1972-73.  Chomh maith leis an soláthar sa Vóta cuirtear airleacain ar fáil do Ghaeltarra as an bPríomh-Chiste: £2 mhilliún atá i gceist sa bhliain 1973-74 i gcomparáid le £1.17 milliún sa bhliain 1972-73.  Is léir mar sin gur thug an Rialtas seo méadú mór&mdash;beagnach 50 faoin gcéad&mdash;don Roinn agus do Ghaeltarra chun leas na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn le bliain anuas.  Más fíor gurb é an t-airgead a labhraíonn i gcúrsaí mar seo, ba chóir go mbeadh deascéalta le cloisteáil ar fud na Gaeltachta&mdash;agus creidim go bhfuil. B'fhéidir nach fearr rud a dhéanfainn ná tuairise ghairid a thabhairt ar an obair a rinneadh ó mhí Aibreáin seo caite go dtí tús na Márta i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Faoi na scéimeanna tithíochta críochnaíodh cásanna mar a leanas:</P>
    <P>180 teach nua</P>
    <P>200 feabhsú tí</P>
    <P>180 seomra folcaidh</P>
    <P>150 soláthar uisce</P>
    <P>180 saoráidí séarachais</P>
    <P>50 feabhsú uisce agus séarachais</P>
    <P>35 mhéadú speisialta do chuairteoirí agus</P>
    <P>16 shealla saoire</P>
    <P>Tá Bille nua Tithíochta á ullmhú faoi láthair agus tabharfar isteach sa Dáil é a luaithe is féidir.  Tá a fhios agam go mbíonn deacrachtaí ann uaireanta le foráil na Gaeilge sna hAchtanna sin agus tá machnamh á dhéanamh agam d'fhonn teacht ar bhealach éigin chun na deacrachtaí sin a shárú agus labhairt na Gaeilge a chothú agus a neartú ag an am céanna.</P>
    <P>Foilsíodh, le déanaí, eagrán 1974 de leabhrán na Roinne <i>Tithe Iostais do Chuairteoirí Gaeltachta.</i> Beagnach 900 teach ina bhfuil breis agus 3,000 seomra leapa atá sa liosta i mbliana agus tá sé ag dul i méid ó bhliain go bliain.</P>
    <P>I gcás na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin rinneadh obair mar seo a leanas:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> 100 feabhsú bóthair áise 650 foirgneamh feirme 1,450 feabhsú plásán féaraigh, agus 1,100 feabhsú thionscadal talún</P>
    <P>Tá feabhas á chur i gcónaí ar áiteanna calaíochta beaga ar fud na Gaeltachta agus, ar ndóigh, bíonn muirobreacha móra á ndéanamh chomh maith.  Tá oibreacha i gcuan an Daingin a chosnóidh breis agus £160,000 beagnach críochnaithe agus tá tús curtha leis na hoibreacha i Ros an Mhíl a chosnóidh £500,000.</P>
    <P>Tugadh tuilleadh cabhrach do chomharchumainn Ghaeltachta agus tá spéis an phobail sa chomharaíocht ag dul i méid i gcónaí.  Is dea-thuar é sin don Ghaeltacht.  Le bliain anuas ceadaíodh deontais don chéad uair do thrí chomharchumann i nGaeltacht Chiarraí, dhá cheann i nGaeltacht Chorcaí agus ceann i nGaeltacht Mhaigh Eo.  Ceadaíodh deontas speisialta do Chomharchumann Forbartha Acla chun aonad beathaithe uan a thógáil.  Is mór agam an obair atá ar siúl ag na comharchumainn Ghaeltachta agus tá súil agam go leanfar de níos treise fós feasta.  Faoi mar atá ráite go minic agam, is é mo thuairim láidir go bhfuil an-tábhacht sa chomharaíocht chun brostú le dul chun cinn rathúil sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha, is eol don Teach gur shocraigh an Rialtas deontas na mban tí Gaeltachta a dhúbailt i gcás na ndaltaí a dhéanann freastal ar chúrsaí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Tháinig de sin gur íocamar beagnach £320,000 leis na mná tí i leith breis agus 13,000 dalta a d'fhreastail cúrsaí an tsamhraidh seo caite.  I rith na bliana freisin chuir mé gearrscannán daite Gaeilge <i>An Ghaeilge Bheo</i> á dhéanamh chun cabhrú le gnóthaí cuartaíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus, go háirithe, leis na coláistí Gaeilge ann.  Tá an scannán á thaispeáint faoi láthair i scoileanna ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Tá socraithe agam freisin cabhair a chur ar fáil do choláistí áirithe a bhíonn ag gabháil don Ghaeilge go speisialta lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus a chuireann cúrsaí ar siúl do dhaltaí i rith an tsamhraidh.  Tiocfadh an socrú sin i bhfeidhm an samhradh seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> Tá scéim ar láimh agam chun scoláireachtaí a chur ar fáil do dhaltaí a dhéanann freastal ar chúrsa trí Ghaeilge sna coláistí réigiúnacha teicneolaíochta.  Cúrsa amháin den chineál sin atá ar siúl faoi láthair&mdash; i nGaillimh&mdash;agus beidh tairbhe na scéime ar fáil do dhaltaí oiriúnacha atá ag freastal ar an gcúrsa sin.</P>
    <P>Mhéadaíomar na deontais do na heagrais Ghaeilge freisin.  Ach cur chuige i gceart tig le heagrais dheonacha a lán a dhéanamh chun an gnáthphobal a thabhairt tuilleadh i dtreo na Gaeilge agus nós labhartha na teanga a leathnú ina measc.</P>
    <P>Thug mé scéim nua isteach chun iriseoireacht áitiúil a spreagadh i gceantair Ghaeltachta.  Tá deontais á dtabhairt againn faoin scéim d'irisí áitiúla a fhoilsítear go tráthrialta sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá dóchas agam agus táim cinnte de go gcabhróidh an scéim seo le scríobh agus le léamh na Gaeilge i measc mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin.</P>
    <P>Bhí áthas orm le déanaí freisin nuair a fuair mé deis teacht i gcabhair ar lucht Siamsa Tíre san obair thábhachtach atá ar siúl acu ar mhaithe leis an teanga agus leis an gcultúr dúchais.  Tá deontas £50,000 geallta agam ar choinníollacha áirithe don amharclann agus do na tithe siamsa atá le tógáil acu i gCiarraí agus beidh tacaíocht den mhéid céanna le fáil acu ó Bhord Fáilte Éireann.</P>
    <P>Is ábhar sásaimh dom go bhfuil dul ar aghaidh maith déanta ag Gaeltarra Éireann ó thosach na bliana airgeadais.  Tabharfaidh mé samplaí don Teach:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  I dtús na bliana airgeadais cheap mé cúig chomhalta nua ar an mbord ar a raibh triúr ón nGaeltacht&mdash;thuaidh, thiar agus theas&mdash; feidhmeannach ceardchumainn agus feidhmeannach sinsireach ón Údarás Forbartha Tionscail.  Rinne mé é sin chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a thabhairt isteach i mórshruth na forbartha náisiúnta agus chun teagmháil níos dlúithe a choimeád le pobal na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>(2)  Chuir mé in iúl do Ghaeltarra go bhféadfaí uasmhéid an deontais <Col N="782" /> do mhiontionscail a ardú ó £20,000 go dtí £40,000.</P>
    <P>(3)  Thug Gaeltarra an idirbheartaíocht do 17 gcomhthionscal nua chun dea-chríche.  Chabhraigh siad le 60 miontionscal&mdash;nach mbíonn siad féin páirteach iontu&mdash;a bhunú agus thug siad breis cúnaimh d'fhonn 28 miontionscal a bhí ann cheana a mhéadú.  Cuirfidh na tograí sin ar fad, idir bheag agus mhór, fostaíocht ar fáil do bhreis agus míle duine ach iad a bheith faoi lánseol.</P>
    <P>(4)  Tá Coiste Ceardaíochta bunaithe ag Gaeltarra chun oiliúint agus beartas ceardaíochta a fhorbairt.</P>
    <P>(5)  Bhunaigh Gaeltarra caidreamh níos dlúithe leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta agus Iascaigh agus leis an bhForas Talúntais.</P>
    <P>(6)  Tá staidéar déanta ar a mhéad is féidir calafoirt iascaireachta a fhorbairt agus tá Gaeltarra tar éis cabhair a thabhairt do mhonarchan éisc in Ailt an Chorráin agus sa Daingean.</P>
    <P>(7)  Ar iarratas uaimse rinne Gaeltarra staidéar speisialta ar na hoileáin Ghaeltachta agus cheap siad oifigeach speisialta chun freastal ar na daoine agus cúrsaí a fheabhsú agus a fhorbairt.  Ba mhaith liom a rá ag an bpoinnte seo go bhfuil dul chun chinn an-mhaith déanta maidir le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus gur cheadaigh bord Ghaeltarra Éireann an Luan seo caite tionscal mór do Oileán Inismór.</P>
    <P>(8)  Chuir Gaeltarra ionadaí ar an gCoiste Cuartaíochta a bhunaigh mé sa Roinn agus atá ag cabhrú chun beartas cuartaíochta a fheidhmiú a rachaidh chun tairbhe do phobal na Gaeltachta agus don Ghaeilge chomh maith.</P>
    <P>(9)  Is faoi scáth Ghaeltarra a cuireadh an Taispeántas &ldquo;An Ghaeltacht Bheo&rdquo; ar siúl i mBaile Átha Cliath i dtosach an tsamhraidh seo caite&mdash;rud a chabhraigh le saoire sa Ghaeltacht&mdash;agus cuireadh taispeántais eile ar siúl i dTrá Lí agus i Luimneach ó shin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> (10)  Cuireadh cúrsaí nua traenála ar siúl san aonad oiliúna atá á reachtáil i nGaoth Dobhair ag AnCO.  Cúis áthais dom a rá go bhfuil deontas suas le £100,000 ceadaithe ag Ciste Sóisialach na hEorpa chun cabhrú le cúrsaí oiliúna sa Ghaeltacht agus tá iarratas eile curtha ar aghaidh chuig an gciste.</P>
    <P>(11)  Rinneadh staidéar speisialta ar chúrsaí iompair agus cumarsáide agus thug mé cead chun go nglacfadh Gaeltarra páirt le hAer Árann i gcomhlacht nua aeriompair chun cúrsaí cumarsáide a fheabhsú i gceantair Ghaeltachta.  Ní gá dhom a rá go gcabhróchfaidh an aer seirbhís nua go mór chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a bhrostú.</P>
    <P>(12)  Cuireadh tús le sraith seimineár forbartha d'fhonn an pobal i ngach ceantar Gaeltachta a ghríosadh chun páirt a ghlacadh i bhforbairt eacnamaíoch, shóisialach agus chultúrtha.  D'fhonn tacú leis an gcuspóir sin chuir mé tús freisin leis an gcomórtas forbartha&mdash;comórtas a bhfuil duaiseanna fiúntacha ar fáil dó.  Tá sé beartaithe ag Gaeltarra seimineár mar sin a chur ar siúl i ngach paróiste ar fud na Gaeltachta. D'éirigh go han-mhaith leis na seimineáir a chuir Gaeltarra ar siúl i dTuar Mhic Eadaigh agus i gCorr na Móna.  De thoradh na seimineár sin táthar tar éis comharchumann nua a bhunú i nDúiche Sheoigheach i gConamara.</P>
    <P>(13)  Rinne Gaeltarra socrú leis an nGníomhaireacht Foirgníochta Náisiúnta (NBA) chun 72 theach a thógáil i nGaoth Dobhair&mdash;an chéad uair a bhfuil togra á chur i gcrích ag NBA sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá comhchainteanna are siúl faoi láthair maidir le roinnt scéimeanna eile.</P>
    <P>(14)  Rinneadh teagmháil nua le Comhphobail na hEorpa agus tháinig ionadaithe ón gCoiste Sóisialach agus Eacnamaíoch dhá uair ar chuairt chun na Gaeltachta le sé mhí anuas.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar atá fógraithe go poiblí agam cheana féin tá socraithe ag an Rialtas Údarás nua Gaeltachta a bhunú. Beidh cumhachtaí leathana ag an <Col N="784" /> Údarás agus rannpháirtíocht ag pobal na Gaeltachta ann chun clár uileghabhálach don Ghaeltacht a chur i ngníomh.  Beidh eagrú, structúr, feidhmeanna agus cumhachtaí an Údaráis nua ag teacht leis na príomh-mholtaí atá i <i>nGníomh don Ghaeltacht.</i> An tÚdarás nua, a mbeidh bord naoi gcomhaltaí acu, glacfaidh siad chucu feidhmeanna forbartha atá faoi láthair ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ag Gaeltarra Éireann agus tabharfar dóibh freisin aon fheidhmeanna nua is gá ar mhaithe le forbairt eacnamaíoch, shóisialach, theangaíoch agus chultúrtha na Gaeltachta.  Táthar i mbun oibre chun an reachtaíocht a bheidh ag teastáil a ullmhú chomh tapaidh agus is féidir lena tabhairt faoi bhráid na Dála.</P>
    <P>Tá sé fíor-riachtanach i gcás an Údaráis go mbeidh guth díreach ag pobal áitiúil na Gaeltachta&mdash;agus áirím go sonrach muintir na n-oileán&mdash;ina fheidhmiú agus go mbeidh tionchar láidir acu ar mhúnlú a chuid beartas agus gníomhartha, dá gceantair féin chomh maith leis an nGaeltacht ina hiomláine.</P>
    <P>Chuige sin bunófar trí bhord chúigíocha d'ionadaithe phobal na Gaeltachta agus ainmneoidh gach ceann de na boird sin duine lena cheapadh ag an Aire ar Bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Níl i gceist ag an bpointe seo coistí Gaeltachta de na comhairlí contae a bhunú sa chóras rialtais áitiúil.  Trí Údarás na Gaeltachta agus na boird chúigíocha cuirfear bealaí soiléire cumarsáide ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus cabhrófar chun obair riachtanach a chur i gcrích go héifeachtach agus ag an am céanna comhplé iomlán agus aontacht cuspóra agus gníomhaíochta a bhaint amach ar an mbonn áitiúil.</P>
    <P>An taithí atá go dtí seo i gcúrsaí forbartha sa Ghaeltacht cruthaíonn sí gan amhras dá laghad gur trí chomharchumainn de chuid an phobail is féidir an gníomh is éifeachtaí a dhéanamh ar an mbonn áitiúil.  As pobal-fhorbairt trí ghníomhartha comharaíochta is fearr a thiocfaidh forbairt na Gaeltachta <Col N="785" /> agus beidh an chéad tosaíocht le tabhairt dó sin i gclár oibre an Údaráis nua.</P>
    <P>Tuigeann an Rialtas gurb í an Ghaeltacht foinse agus tobar ár dteanga agus ár gcultúir.  Beartais fhorbartha, dá fheabhas iad, a laghdódh úsáid na teanga aithnímid go dteipfeadh orthu dá dheasca sin a mbun-aidhmeanna a bhaint amach. Dá bhrí sin caithfidh an clár forbartha nua aire speisialta a thabhairt do neartú agus do mhéadú úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Ná bíodh amhras ar aon duine: tá aigne an Rialtais leagtha go daingean ar chlár bríomhar oibre a fheidhmiú ar mhaithe le forbairt eacnamaíoch, shóisialach, theangaíoch agus chultúrtha na Gaeltachta.  Tá a chruthú sin tugtha go maith cheana againn sa chéad bhliain i gcúram oifige dúinn.</P>
    <P>Anois nuair atá an beart is gá á dhéanamh chun go mairfidh an Ghaeltacht, tá an Rialtas ag díriú ar cheist thábhachtach na Gaeilge feasta sa chuid eile den tír.  Léiríodh sa ráiteas faoina gcuspóirí a d'eisigh páirtithe an Chomhrialtais roimh an olltoghchán gurb é an beartas a bheadh ag an Rialtas ná meas ar an nGaeilge a chothú agus an teanga féin a chur chun cinn.  Faoi mar a dúirt an Taoiseach tamaillín ó shin, is é aidhm an Rialtais an Ghaeilge a bhuanú trí bheartais réalaíocha a bheith ceaptha chun tacaíocht an phobail a fháil leo. Féachfaimid chuige go mbeidh gach cabhair le fáil dóibh siúd a dteastaíonn uathu an Ghaeilge a bheith mar theanga acu ag baile agus ina saol poiblí.  Táimid, sé sin an Rialtas, ag iarraidh teacht ar an tslí is fhearr chun a áiteamh ar an bpobal i gcoitinne suim a chur sa Ghaeilge.  Le cúnamh Dé agus le cabhair mhuintir na hÉireann éireoidh linn go léir i dteannta a chéile chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Bhí an-áthas orm go raibh deis ag an Taoiseach cuairt a thabhairt ar Ghaeltacht Chonamara le déanaí agus breathnú ar chuid den dul chun cinn atá déanta ann.  Faoi mar a dúirt sé ar an ócáid sin tá dóchas aige&mdash;agus tá súil agam go bhfuil dóchas againn go léir ar gach taobh den Teach seo&mdash;<Col N="786" /> gur féidir, taobh istigh de réim chultúrtha na Gaeltachta, saol eacnamaíoch a fhorbairt a bheidh chun leasa na muintire a chónaíonn ann agus arb í a dtoil fanacht ann.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairim féin gurb é an lánfhostaíocht sna seachtóidí do phobal na Gaeltachta an rud is tabhachtaí ar fad.  Ní beag a bhfuil déanta sa treo sin i rith na bliana.  I dtionscail a bhfuil cabhair tugtha ag Gaeltarra dóibh agus i dtionscail Ghaeltarra féin, tá thart faoi 2,500 duine ag obair agus is le bliain anuas a thosaigh os cionn 500 díobh.  Is fuirist a rá go mbeidh lánfhostaíocht ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta sna seachtóidí ach ní fuirist é a dhéanamh. Tá deacrachtaí móra ann.  Ach tá dul chun cinn an-mhaith á dhéanamh ag Gaeltarra agus tá súil agam go leanfar leis an dul chun cinn sin nuair a bheidh an t-Údarás nua bunaithe.  Na tograí go léir a bhfuil cabhair ceadaithe ag Gaeltarra dóibh, meastar go gcuirfidh siad fostaíocht ar fáil do suas le 4,000 duine nuair a bheidh siad faoi lánseol.  Is ábhar misnigh na figiúirí sin agus is tuar dóchais gur tháinig méadú ar na tograí sin le déanaí.  Is cúis sásaimh comh maith é go bhfuil níos mó de na mórthionsclóirí sa tír seo agus thar lear ag glacadh páirte i bhforbairt tionscail sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil sprid na fiontraíochta ag fás i muintir na Gaeltachta féin.  Tá gach iarracht á déanamh d'fhonn an ráta forbartha a mhéadú tuilleadh agus chuige sin beidh lámh chúnta de dhíth orainn ó gach aird.</P>
    <P>Is mar chuid bhunúsach inmharthana dár náisiún a fhéachaimse ar na ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Féachaim romham ar thionchar na gceantar sin ag leathnú amach agus ag dul i bhfeidhm ar na réigiúin Bhreac-Ghaeltachta agus ar na réigiúin neamh-Ghaeltachta i gcaoi go mbeidh an tír iomlán páirteach ar ball in oidhreacht luachmhar chultúrtha na Gaeltachta.  Mar fhocal deireannach ba mhaith liom an méid seo a leanas as <i>Gníomh don Ghaeltacht a léamh.</i> Agus traoslaím do na daoine san Údarás Saoraerfort na Sionnaine agus sa Ghaeltarra a chuir an tuarascáil sin le chéile.</P>

      <Col N="787" /> Ar leathanach 8 tá ráite:</P>
    <P>Beidh rathúnas na Gaeltachta ina chuid den rathúnas náisiúnta, agus ag brath air.  An clár agus an eagraíocht a mholaimid, cuirfidh siad ar a cumas don Ghaeltacht an sciar iomlán is dual di a dhéanamh, agus an sciar atá dlite di a fháil, maidir le cur chun cinn an rathúnais náisiúnta.  Thairis sin, cuirfidh sé ar a cumas don Ghaeltacht cúnamh a thabhairt, as a teanga agus as a cultúr ina iomláine, i bhfás phobal a bheadh muiníneach as a náisiúntacht.</P>

      <P>Sílim go dtiocfadh liom a rá nach bhfuil mórán cuidithe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta sa mhéid atá ráite ag an Aire anseo inniu. Taobh amuigh den mhéid atá ráite aige faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta is beag atá nua san óráid a thug sé.  Ón taithí atá agam féin ar Roinn na Gaeltachta is beag rud úr atá le feiceáil sa mhéid atá ráit ag an Aire thar an méid a bhí ann nuair a bhí muidne i gcumhacht.  I leith Údarás na Gaeilge níl ráite aige ach amháin go mbeidh cumachtaí leathain ag an Údarás, ach go fóill níl a fhios againn cad is ciall le sin agus caithfimid fanacht go dtí go bhfeicimid an chéad uair eile a thagann sé os comhair na Dála go díreach cad atá i gceist aige.</P>
      <P>Deir sé sa ráiteas anseo fosta nach bhfuil sé i gceist ag an bpoinnte seo coistí Gaeltachta de na comhairlí contae a bhunú sa córas Rialtais Áitiúil.  Thiocfadh liomsa a rá nach é amháin nach bhfuil sé i gceist sin a dhéanamh ach sa mhéid atá dhá dhéanamh ag an Aire Rialtais Áitiúil faoi láthair i leith na ceantracha ins na contaethe éagsúla faoi chóras na gcomhairlí contae tá sé&mdash; má tá an rud a léigh mé mésa pháipéar fíor&mdash;tá sé ag déanamh dhá chuid den Ghaeltacht i nGaillimh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Baineann an tairiscint seo atá curtha síos ag an Teachta Tunney le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus le h-aibheochan na Gaeilge agus tá dlúthbhaint idir an dá rud mar aithníonn achan duine a bhfuil suim aige in aibheochan na Gaeilge gur beag an <Col N="788" /> seans a bheadh againn ins na laethe atá ann inniu go mór-mhór an Ghaeilge a aibheochan mar mheán cumarsáide sa tír seo gan an Ghaeltacht ní hamháin a bheith beo acht a bheith ag neartú agus ag leathnú.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil daoine ann adéarfadh go dtig teanga aibheochan is cuma an mbeadh an teanga sin á labhairt mar teanga labharta na ndaoine nó mar gnáth-theanga na ndaoine agus tugann siad an Eabhrais mar shampla dúinn ar sin.  Acht bhí toscaí ag cuidiú le h-aibheochan na hEabhraise nach bhfuil i gceist i leith aibheochan na Gaeilge agus, ar an ábhar sin, ní thig linn comparáid a dhéanamh idir an dá chás a bheadh cruinn.  Caithfidh muid mar sin ar an gcéad dul síos gach ar féidir linn a dhéanamh leis an Ghaeltacht a neartú agus a fhorbairt má tá muid dáiríre fá aibheochan na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tig liom a rá fosta go bhfuil, mar adéarfá, an taobh eile den bhonn fíor chomh maith, sé sin, nach bhfuil i mo bharúil-sa seans ar bith ann go mairfidh agus go leanóidh an Ghaeltacht mura bhfuil sé soiléir do mhuintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil na daoine sa chuid sin den tír taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht dáiríre fá aibheochan na Gaeilge.  Mura raibh sé seo fíor tá sé cinnte de réir a chéile go n-imeoídh an Ghaelacht as.  Ar an ábhar sin, tá muintir na Gaeltachta ag braith orainne ó thaobh na Gaeilge a fhoghlaim chomh mór agus atá muide ag braith ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta leis an teanga, mar adéarfá, a thabhairt dúinn.  Ar an ábhar sin, tá sé fíor go bhfuil súile mhuintir na Gaeltachta dírithe ar na daoine atá ina gcónaí sa Ghalltacht, ar an Rialtas agus ar achan duine go mba cheart dófa a bheith ag cuidiú agus ag cur suime i n-athbheochan na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá rud amháin cinnte faoi dtaobh de pholasaí an Rialtais seo agus sé sin nach dtiocfadh leat a rá go bhfuil ganntanas briathar, nó ganntanas focal, nó ganntanas geallúintí ann acht beart de réir a mbriathar sin ceist eile agus, mar adúirt mé, níl mórán de sin le feiceáil go fóill agus ní híonadh go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ag éirí rud beag tuirseach den rud uilig.  Sí an Ghaeilge gnáth-theanga <Col N="789" /> mhuintir na Ghaeltachta. Leagaim béim ar an bhfocal &ldquo;daoine&rdquo; mar gan daoine ní thig teanga ar bith a bheith beo.  Go ginearálta tá an talamh go holc sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh de áiteacha áirithe go mór-mhór ins na laetha atá inniu ann ní thig leis na daoine a bheith beo ar an dtalmhaíocht amháin.  Bhí an imirce i gcónaí go tiubh sa Ghaeltacht go dtí na blianta deireanacha seo agus gí go dtiocfadh leat a rá gur galar nimhneach a bhí san imirce ó áit ar bith in Éirinn ba sheacht mheasa an galar í ón Ghaeltacht chionns go raibh sé ina chéadchodán níos aoirde ná mar ba ghnáthach sa tír ar fad ach go mór-mhór chionns go raibh an aos óg a raibh an Ghaeilge mar ghnáththeanga acu ag fágáil na tíre seo agus gur cailliúint sin nach dtiocfadh a shárú.</P>
    <P>Tá gnéithe aiceanta sa Ghaeltacht gur féidir iad a fheabhsú agus obair a chur ar fáil do na daoine dá bharr sin.  Dúirt mé nach féidir slí bheatha gur fiú le rá a bhaint amach as an talamh ach ag an am céanna is féidir feabhas a chur ar an talamh ins an dóigh gur féidir leis an feilmeoir níos mó a shaothrú.  Tá portaigh sa Ghaeltacht agus leis an athrú atá tagtha ar an saol ó thárla na deacrachtaí fán íle is luachmhaire iad anois ná mar bhí siad ariamh.  Tá an fharraige thart ar an Ghaeltacht uilig agus tig forbairt a dhéanamh i gcúrsaí iascaireachta.  Tá áilneacht nádúrtha ag baint leis an Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil a shárú le fáil i n-áit ar bith agus tig forbairt a dhéanamh sa turasóireacht.  Dóigheanna iad seo uilig le obair a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus caithfidh achan duine a chuir suim ariamh ins an méid a bhí dhá dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht a aithint go ndearna Fianna Fáil, nuair a bhí siad i gcumhacht, sár-obair leis na cúrsaí seo a fheabhsú agus, mar adúirt mé, is beag atá ins an mhéid atá ráite ag an Aire inniu acht tagairt a dhéanamh do na scéimeanna sin a bhí ann agus cuireadh tuilleadh airgid ar fáil dófa.  Acht ní thiocfadh leat óráid Aire na Gaeltachta ar bith a léiriú ag cur na meastacháin os cómhair na Dála nach mbeadh níos mó airgid <Col N="790" /> curtha ar fáil bliain indiaidh a chéile don Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé féin den bharúil i gcónaíagus bhí an-taithí agam ar an Ghaeltacht sul a dheachaigh mé isteach i Roinn na Gaeltachta&mdash;gurbh é an dóigh ab fhearr le hobair a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ná fríd an tionsclaíocht a fhorbairt&mdash;na mór-thionscail agus na beag-thionscail.  B'shin an dóigh go dtiocfadh leat deireadh a chur leis an imirce.  B'shin an bun-chloch a thiocfadh leat a rá a bhí faoi pholasaí Fhianna Fáil i leith na Gaeltachta agus tá cruthú éifeacht an pholasaí sin le feiceáil sa mhéid go bhfuil ní é amháin stop curtha leis an imirce ach go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ag teacht abhaile arís le tamall, le roinnt blianta anuas agus ag socrú síos sa Ghaeltacht.  Is cuimhin liom féin an t-am nach raibh ach páiste amháin i Rann na Feirste a bhí faoi bhun-aois scoile agus sa lá atá inniu ann tá scoil trí oide ann agus ní dóigh liom gur gá dhom mórán eile a rá faoi dtaobh de sin.</P>
    <P>Tá an Rialtas seo i gcumhacht anois ar feadh bliana agus goidé atá déanta acu i leith na Gaeltachta? Taobh amuigh de roinnt rudaí a bhí réidh againn sul a dtáinig siad sin i gcumhacht is beag rud íontach atá le feiceáil déanta.  Chuaigh Aire na Gaeltachta thart ar an Ghaeltacht ag gabháil chuig cruinnithe agus ag caint leis na daoine, rud a rinne Airí agus Rúnaithe Parlaiminte a bhí ann roimhe.  An t-aon rud amháin a dtiocfadh leat a rá ná gur sháraigh an tAire seo iad uilig ó thaobh an méid poiblíochta a d'éirigh leis fháil ins na páipéirí.  Ní chuireann sé sin íontas orainn mar sin an saghas foirm Rialtais, mar adéarfá, atá ag cuid mhaith de na hAirí ins an gComhrialtas. Tá gealltanaisí tugtha ag an Rialtas atá chomh tiubh le míoltógaí ar an Caorán Mhór ach is beag, mar adúirt mé, gur fiú le rá an méid atá déanta.</P>
    <P>Do lua an tAire nuair a bhí sé ag caint fá go ndeachaigh an Taoiseach go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Tá sé sin fíor ach shíl muid uilig agus shíl muintir na Gaeltachta go mbeadh fógra thar an choitiann le déanamh aige nuair a bheadh sé ann.  Bhain sé fód le tús a <Col N="791" /> chur le scéim Fianna Fáil i Ros a' Mhíl agus tháinig sé ar arais go Baile Átha Cliath agus sin an méid a chuala muid ó shin faoi dtaobh do. Tá dearfacht go ndeachaigh an Taoiseach go dtí an Cheathrú Rua leis an bhfógra sin a thabhairt ceart go leor ach nuair a chuaigh sé ann b'fhacthas dó go raibh i bhfad níos mó dhá iarraidh ag muintir na Gaeltachta ná mar a bhí seisean réidh lena thabhairt dófa agus chinn sé a theacht abhaile gan a dhath eile a rá agus, mar adúirt mé tamall ó shin, tá muintir na Gaeltachta ag eirí tuirseach de na cineál geáitsí sin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire fosta faoi dtaobh de na coláistí samhraidh.  Tá sé cinnte go ndéanfaidh an cinneadh faoin Ghaeilge sna scrúdaithe dochar dófa sin.  Tá fhios agam go dtig leis an Aire a rá má ghlacann tú na figiúirí go ginearálta nach dtáinig laghdú ar bith orthu i mbliana.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire go maith go raibh an Ghaeilge á foghlaim ag na daltaí ag an am a chuireadh deireadh leis an Ghaeilge éigeantach ins na scoileanna agus, ar an ábhar sin, nach raibh seans ann go dtiocfadh laghdú orthu go luath acht amach anseo tá sé cinnte go mbeidh an difear le feiceáil nuair a éireoidh cuid de na scoláirí as an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim ins na scoileanna agus an Ghaeilge a ghlacadh mar ábhar scrúdú.  Caithfidh mé a rá mar bhí cleachtadh agamsa ar na coláistí Gaeilge ar feadh na blianta gur cuidiú an-mhór a bhí iontu sin d'eacnamaíocht na Gaeltachta agus go mór-mhór le breis airgid a chur ar fáil do na mná tí.</P>
    <P>Tá athrú eile déanta ag an Aire fosta faoi dtaobh de an méid páistí a dtig leo a bheith i leaba amháin. Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil mé go mór i bhfabhar le sin ach bheinn i bhfad níos sásta dá shílfinn gurbh é an fáth a bhí leis an athrú ná cúrsaí sláinte agus nach ag déanamh réidh le leithscéal a bheith ann má thagann laghdú ar na huimhreacha sa Ghaeltacht. Do lua sé freisin go raibh sé socraithe aige cabhair a chur ar fáil do choláistí áirithe a bhíonn ag dul don Ghaeilge go speisialta lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Ní abródh mé faoi <Col N="792" /> sin ach gur cuireadh brú mór ormsa nuair a bhí mé san Roinn sin an chabhair sin a thabhairt agus gí go n-admhaím go gcuidíonn na coláistí sin go mór leis an nGaeilge agus go bhfuil na daoine atá ina mbun íontach dáiríre, bhí eagla ormsa i gcónaí dá dtabharfainn deontaisí dóibh sin go rachadh na páistí chucu i n-ionad dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus shíl mise gurbh é an rud is tábhachtaí ina leith sin ná go smaoiteodh Aire na Gaeltachta i gconaí ar an Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Anois tá cultúr dá gcuid féin againn cultúr atá bunaithe ar theanga ár sinnsir.  An teanga in mo bharúil-sa an gné is tábhachtaí de chultúr ar bith agus ba mhaith liom a rá nach &ldquo;bog culture&rdquo; ar bith é.  Sin an rud ar mhaith leis an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa a chur in iúl ach cultúr uasal saibhir a rinneadh a fhorbairt ar feadh 2,000 bliain dár stair.</P>

      <P>Beidh seans ag an Aire labhairt más mian leis i gceann tamall.  Tá sé ag caint.  Fear éirimiúil é an tAire agus fear go bhfuil deis a labhartha aige ach níl Éireannaigh muiníneach as agus tá áthas orm go bhfuil sé anseo agus nach bhfuil mé ag rá na rudaí atá le rá agam fhad is atá sé taobh amuigh den Teach.  Tá sé le feiceáil níos soiléire ná ariamh nach bhfuil muinín acu as má éisteann tú leis na barúlaí atá ag na gnáth-dhaoine don pháirt atá á ghlacadh aige sin i gcursaí idirnáisiúnta.  Tá siad íontach imníoch faoi cé go gcónaíonn sé ina measc ní ghlacann Éireannaigh leis mar dhuine díobhtha féin é agus tá a fhios acu go rí mhaith dá mba gurbh é an &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; é an lá atá inniu a bheith ar mhaithe leis an críochdheighilt go mbeadh na rudaí searúsacha céanna le rá aige faoi dtaobh de sin agus atá le rá aige faoin nGaeilge agus má tá cruthú a dhíth ar dhuine ar bith fá sin tá sé le feiceáiil sa leabhar úd a scríobh sé fá <i>The States of Ireland.</i> I mo bharúil féin ón méid atá ráite ag an Aire, in intinn an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa is &ldquo;bogmen&rdquo; muid uilig ach é féin agus scaifte beag daoine eile a shiúilfeadh thart mar adéarfadh sean-mhúinteoir a bhí agam fad ó shin ins na ciorcail is fearr.  Caithfidh mé rá go raibh a <Col N="793" /> leithéid ann i gcónaí in ár stair. B'fhéidir in achan glún.  D'imigh siad sin agus bhí na &ldquo;bogmen&rdquo; ann go fóill.</P>
      <P>An rud is mó ar mhaith liomsa fhios a bheith agam faoi ná an n-aontaíonn an Rialtas agus baill an Rialtais leis an méid atá ráite ag an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa.  An ionann an polasaí atá curtha ar aghaidh aige sin sna hóráidí atá tugtha aige ar na mallaibh, an ionann iad sin agus na barúla atá ag, cuir i gcás, Aire na Gaeltachta? Níl a fhios againn agus, mar adúirt mé, ní fhaca muid óráid ná a dhath ó dhuine ar bith díofa le fáil amach goidé an dearcadh atá acu. Chonaic mé ar na mallaibh an tseachtain seo caite, sílim, píosa in <i>Inniu</i> faoi dtaobh de rud adúirt Liam Mac Cosgair &ldquo;ár gcúltúr i mbaol&rdquo;. Indiaidh domsa é léamh dúirt mé féin caithfidh go bhfuil an Taoiseach ag labhairt anois i n-éadan an méid adúirt an tAire Poist agus Telegrafa ach nuair a d'féach ar an bhun chonaic mé go ndúirt an Taoiseach sin thart faoi ceithre fhocal.  Cé mhéid bliain ó shoin?  I 1968.  Beidh muid ag fanacht air go bhfeicfidh muid an n-abróidh sé an oiread arís.  I mo bharúilsa ní féidir linn neamhshuim a dhéanamh den tionchar a bhí ag 2,000 bliain dár stair ar aigne agus ar mheon ár ndaoine.  Fiú amháin an cultúr a d'fás imeasc an tromlacht ins an Iar-Thuaisceart tá lorg aon chultúr Gaeilge air a bheag nó a mhór.  Tá sé le tabhairt faoi deara ina cheolta tíre. Bhí suim ag cuid mhór acu sa teanga go bhfacthas dóibh go raibh cúrsaí polaitíochta ag dul i gcion ar an ghluaiseacht aibheochana.  Cé nach féidir a shéanadh go bhfuil difríochtaí mhóra idir an dá dream tá cosúlachtaí sa dhá chultúr a bheireann dóchas dúinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ó tháinig an Rialtas seo i réim tá dochar déanta do chúis na teanga. Tá an rud a thugtaí Gaeilge éigeantach air imithe gan aon chóras éifeachtach curtha in a áit a chinnteodh go múinfí an Ghaeilge do gach páiste Éireannach.  Le linn domh bheith in oifig rinne mé smaointiú ar an cheist seo&mdash;caidé mar a thiocfadh liom deireadh a chur leis an Ghaeilge éigeantacht agus ag an am chéanna <Col N="794" /> córas a chur in a áit a thabharfadh seans d'achan páiste an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Níor tháinig mé ar réiteach na faidhbe agus níl a réiteach ann go fóill.</P>
    <P>Nuair a rinneadh an polasaí i leith na Gaeilge a athrú gan córas fiúntach a chur ina áit céim mhillteanach síos don Ghaeilge a bhí ann.  Rinne an Comhrialtas éacht mhór&mdash;fosclaíodh scoil Dhún Chaoin do chúigear dalta agus choinnigh sin na daoine a bhí ag déanamh callán in a dtost. Tuigeann siad anois an droch-mhargadh a rinneadar nuair a dhíoladar a n-oidhreacht ar shon praiseach gan mhaith.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that the proposals in Deputy Molloy's amendments were just not only to the people of the Dublin region but also to the people of the country.  The people of Dublin do not expect favoured treatment. Under the Minister's proposals the country areas are getting reduced representation.  Deputy Molloy's amendments would redress the balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned my own constituency of North County Dublin and the effect the Minister's proposals will <Col N="795" /> have on it, and I contrasted them with Deputy Molloy's proposals.  At present the North County Dublin constituency is represented by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Seán Walsh and myself.  It stretches from Balbriggan to Walkinstown.  The Minister proposes to change this to a three-seater in an area from Santry and Ballymun to Balbriggan.  Under the Fianna Fáil amendment it would be a five-seat constituency.  It is publicly known that the Coalition Party members from that area and prospective candidates favour the idea of a larger constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They feel that the people of North County Dublin would be better represented in an area electing five Deputies rather than three. West County Dublin is a completely wrong name for a constituency stretching out into the middle of County Kildare, out to Maynooth, and taking in Leixlip which everybody knows is not in County Dublin.  It should be Dublin-Kildare rather than West County Dublin.  The Minister proposes that this should be another three-seater. Then he goes around the country again to a place which he calls Mid County Dublin.  If ever there was a mis-titled constituency this is it because Mid County Dublin as proposed by the Minister is not in County Dublin at all.  There is one portion of County Dublin and quite a large portion of the city.  I am sorry to see the Parliamentary Secretary leaving the House because he is known to be involved in this area.  It also involves portion of County Wicklow.  Even the title &ldquo;Mid County Dublin&rdquo; should be amended because nobody in his wildest imagination could describe Rathfarnham, within the city boundary, as being in Mid County Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Who could <Col N="796" /> describe Wicklow as Mid County Dublin? In his reply to Deputy Molloy the Minister said that constituencies represented by uneven numbers of Deputies were ideal having regard to the working of the PR system.  He conveniently forgot his proposal about Dún Laoghaire.  He suggests that it should be a four-seater.  I was thinking about this during Private Members' Time.  I had thought of making the point that the Minister decided on this because it is the Taoiseach's area and the Minister has a colleague in the area, and it was probably his intention to make sure that the Taoiseach would have an easy ride together with a Labour candidate.  I thought that would be implying improper motives to the Minister so I decided I would not say it.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes that Dún Laoghaire should be a four-seater whereas every other constituency in County Dublin and in the greater Dublin area is to be a three-seater.  I wonder why the Minister picked this constituency out of all the others in the Dublin region?  Mid County Dublin is to be a three-seater.  North County Dublin is to be a three-seater.  South County Dublin is to be a three-seater. West County Dublin is to be a three-seater. Dún Laoghaire&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;is to be a four-seater.  Dublin (Artane), Dublin (Ballyfermot), Dublin (Cabra), Dublin (Clontarf), Dublin (Finglas), Dublin North-Central, Dublin (Rathmines-West), Dublin South-Central and Dublin South-East are all to be three-seaters.</P>

      <P>It would be appropriate for the Minister to say that.  Obviously this is the attempted gerrymander of the century, without putting a tooth in it.  When the 1969 Bill was going through the House there were accusations that it was a gerrymander Bill purposely designed to keep Fianna Fáil in power.  It has been shown that this was not so because, if it were, the Minister would be sitting over here and we would be sitting over there.  It was a democratic Bill designed to give the people a choice.  The Minister does <Col N="797" /> not even attempt to justify his decisions. This is a bald attempt to copperfasten the present regime in power.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister had a problem and that he would like to have seen a three-seater in Dún Laoghaire but, being a member of a Government comprised of two parties, he has to bow to the wishes of the other party on certain occasions and in particular to the Leader of the other party.  That is fair enough.  Earlier on in the debate Deputy Molloy made points in a spirit of fair play and spoke about the representation that the people in the country and in the city were entitled to.  The Minister should justify some of the decisions rather than attack Deputy Molloy and what he stands for and the amendments he proposed.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke a lot about fair play.  He is recognised and likes to think of himself as a person who considers the rights and interests of others.  This could be seen in the Minister's own statement when he mentioned the constitutional situaation, something which I should like to deal with with the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  In 1968 when the Constituency Commission Bill was introduced the present Minister said, and I quote from column 1136 of the Official Report for 26th November, 1968&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to point out the fairness of the proposals as outlined by Deputy Molloy compared with the Minister's own proposals.  In 1968 the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Bill introduced by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) which, according to the Minister for Local Government would have been proposed if his previous proposal had been carried by the country, is the proper way to draw up the constituencies for the country.  We believe also that if we do not do that we will have what both he and the Taoiseach desscribed <Col N="798" /> as the danger of gerrymandering. We want the danger of gerrymandering eliminated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I agree with the views expressed by the present Minister in 1968 when he was speaking on behalf of the Labour Party.  I hope this is the last occasion on which we will ever see this type of legislation being introduced in this House irrespective of which side it comes from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister is getting one bite of the cherry should be sufficient.  I believe that immediately after the passing of this Bill the Minister should establish a Constituency Commission which would mean that this type of legislation would not come before the House again.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that his main aim in the Dublin area was to have as many constituencies represented by an uneven number of Deputies as possible.  This is desirable but Deputy Molloy also considered what the Minister said and took him at his word in submitting these amendments.  Deputy Molloy has proposed that North County Dublin should be a five-seater while the Minister has suggested it be a three-seater. There is still there the desirable uneven number which the Minister hopes will bring in a Labour man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>The amendments proposed by Deputy Molloy meet the same requirements considered necessary by the Minister when he introduced this Bill.  The principle enshrined in the Bill, if legislation of this type can be described as a Bill, was that the Dublin area, and most constituencies in the country, should be represented by an uneven number of Deputies.  However, we have had the glaring exception of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking a lot of nonsense.  Deputy Molloy has proposed five seats for Dún Laoghaire and I am giving four.  The Deputy is killing his own time and he should not forget that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister proposes three seats for North County Dublin while Deputy Molloy has suggested five seats.  For the Dún Laoghaire area Deputy Molloy is proposing five because he believes that this number, an uneven number, meets the requirements and the wishes of the Minister.  Deputy Molloy has proposed nine three-seat constituencies which are roughly the same as the three-seaters suggested by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituency suggested by Deputy Molloy, and now represented by me among others, would be a much more fairly designed one than that proposed by the Minister.  Take, for example, the Minister's suggested constituency of Mid County Dublin. It has nothing whatsoever to do with mid-County Dublin.  It includes part of the city, part of the county and <Col N="800" /> part of County Wicklow.  In his proposed constituency of West Dublin you have part of County Dublin and part of Kildare.  There is my own area of Fingal.  It should be called &ldquo;Fingal and the City of Dublin&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then there is the butchery which the Minister has done on the city constituency which is now known as Dublin North-East.  It is now to be Dublin (Clontarf), Dublin (Artane) and Dublin (Finglas).  One of the professed aims of the Minister was to preserve the new town of Ballymun as a single unit.  What he has done is to move the boundary there out a few yards and he has succeeded very well in splitting Ballymun. He may be preserving part of Ballymun but he is cutting up another part of it and, of course, his reason for this is to shore up the Labour Party in that constituency. He will not succeed.  It is common knowledge that the Minister's party are a lost cause in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not know what he is talking about.  He wants to give five seats there and I want to give three seats.  How, then, could I be shoring up the Labour Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is moving the satellite town of Ballymun into one constituency with the misconception that the people in that town will vote Labour.  On the contrary, the people in that area are among my strongest supporters and I look forward to being their representative in the next Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not mean the Minister's gerrymander will succeed. The Minister has shown in his White Paper on Local Government that he does not have any concern for the people of greater Dublin.  The people in the city, apparently, are far superior to and more equal than those outside.  All of us in the greater Dublin area are first or second generation countrymen.  My people originally came from Mayo.  The Minister <Col N="801" /> did not touch that particular constituency except to add a little of Roscommon to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want anyone to be in a position to accuse this side of the House of wasting time.  We have had one set of amendments on which we had two speakers, Deputies Molloy and Burke.  Deputy Molloy spoke on the Second Reading for more than an hour.  Neither of them has been prepared to come anywhere near the amendments.  I do not know who drew up the amendments for them, but certainly they know very little about what the amendments propose to do.  Deputy Burke's efforts were particularly puerile.  Having accused me of putting four seats in Dún Laoghaire for the purpose of saving the Taoiseach's seat&mdash;I do not know how he expected the Taoiseach would lose his seat&mdash;he then said it was because I wanted to ensure that the Labour man would be all right. Deputy Molloy's proposal was to give five seats to Dún Laoghaire.  How are we supposed to follow that kind of logic?  I cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to North County Dublin, Deputy Burke spoke about shoring up the Labour Party there.  I propose to give it three seats, he suggests that we give it five seats.  He tries to give the impression that Ballymun is one big area and that everyone in Ballymun is affected in the one way.  In <Col N="802" /> case Deputy Burke does not know, the last breaking up of constituencies resulted in Ballymun&mdash;the Towers, the new area&mdash;being put into three constituencies.  I put them into one. The fact that the area, portion of which is known as Ballymun, the old area of Ballymun, is put in two other constituencies does not mean there is anything wrong with it.  I have arranged for compact constituencies with local names which are easily recognisable all over Dublin.  Nobody need have any doubt that the areas in this Bill are easily recognisable and will be well represented by three Deputies.</P>
    <P>A sugestion has been made here that we are trying to do what Fianna Fáil Minister Kevin Boland attempted to do for Fianna Fáil and for which he got little thanks from them.  He attempted to cement Fianna Fáil in power.  He could not do it and nobody can do it.  I want to make it very clear &mdash;I said it on the Second Reading and I repeat it&mdash;that in four years' time when the next general election comes along the result will depend on whether the Government have been doing well or ill.  Anybody who attempts to get a crystal ball now to forecast what will happen then is not being realistic.  The situation is that we have set up three-seat constituencies in Dublin and for the third time may I explain that since there were 43 seats in the area in 14 constituencies, I do not know in what way we could divide them except into 13 three-seaters and one four-seater, unless Deputies Molloy and Burke know some way of dividing a seat between three or four different constituencies.</P>

For 50 years Fianna Fáil had the right to change constituencies but <Col N="803" /> now that right has been taken from them and, consequently, they are wailing like banshees.  They must grow up.</P>

Had not Fianna Fáil a sufficient number of years in which to make up their minds?  The first occasion on which such a possibility was referred to favourably by a member of that party was when Deputy Jack Lynch, who, having conceded grudgingly that he had lost the general election, said almost in the next breath that it might be a good idea to set up a commission to decide on constituency changes.

First, though, I am endeavouring to undo 50 years of Fianna Fáil's gerrymandering.  That is what is being done here.  The Bill before us is designed to give a fair deal to everybody in the country.  For 40 hours Fianna Fáil have discussed <Col N="804" /> the dots and commas of the first few sections of the Bill.  They thought they were being clever and that in this way they were putting off indefinitely the day on which the Bill would be passed.  For their information let me tell them that any time they waste now is their own loss because the more they discuss the Bill and the more they continue to bring in matters which are not relevant to it, the shorter will be the time for dealing with aspects of the Bill which they might consider important.</P>

      <P>My amendments were tabled for the purpose of showing that, having regard to the additional four seats which the Constitution allows by reason of the change in population as shown in the 1971 census and taking into account the Minister's proposal to take two seats from the west, his distribution is unfair and illogical and cannot be justified.  Here we are on Committee Stage asking the Minister who introduced the Bill to make even one statement justifying his proposal to <Col N="807" /> add five new seats to the 38 already in existence in Dublin while depriving the west of two and not paying any attention to the population increase in Cork.</P>
      <P>This is an extraordinary measure. It is outright gerrymandering; it is unbelievable that it should even have been attempted.  There is no effort being made by the Minister to justify it.  We are being told it will be rammed through this House by the use of a measure which is used very seldom and used very judiciously by any Government, the guillotine.  We are going to see it in operation for the second time in a few short weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering these amendments one has to bear in mind what was the thinking applied by the Fianna Fáil party in drawing them up.  We shall go through them individually if that is the way the Chair wants the debate to proceed.  In the Minister's proposals the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny is made up of the administrative counties of Carlow-Kilkenny and part of County Wexford.  We are saying in the amendment that there was no need for the Minister to put such a large slice of County Wexford into the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency.  We have shown here that a much smaller part of the county of Wexford could have been transferred to Carlow-Kilkenny than the Minister has taken. We propose transferring only the electoral divisions of Moyacomb, Newtownbarry and St. Mary's, in the former rural district of Enniscorthy. That is only three electoral divisions as compared with the Minister's proposals to transfer also from Wexford into Carlow-Kilkenny, Kilrush, Kiltealy, Rossard and Tombrack, and Ballybeg, in the former rural district of Gorey.  Also in amendment No. 1 we propose adding to the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency, as well as that very small piece of Wexford&mdash;because taking those three electoral divisions away still leaves the constituency of Wexford within the <Col N="808" /> tolerance range and the constitutional limits for a four-seat constituency&mdash;part of Wicklow, because the constituency of Wicklow as it stands is a three-seat constituency.  Its population now is in excess of the figure for a three-seat constituency, and it would have to cede some of that figure, but the Minister decides that it would cede into Dublin, which we feel is an extraordinary decision and shows urban-orientated thinking on the part of the Government.  If anything needed population support, it should have been outward from Dublin not inward towards Dublin, and we propose ceding that part of Wicklow which is in excess of the maximum figure for three seats to the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny which can absorb it along with the small part of Wexford.  We feel we have left a tidier Wexford constituency in taking away only three electoral divisions and that we have made the right decision in relation to Wicklow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had to make a decision in putting down the amendment, and that was our decision.  We believe our decision was right and showed a greater recognition of the difficulties of rural areas as against urban areas, and the Minister's proposal displays very clearly the urbanised thinking of the Government.  I am surprised that the Minister has succumbed to this, because he himself is one of the few to come from a rural constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At no point in all the discussions that takes place here will I claim that what I have put down by way of amendment is an absolutely perfect solution.  What I am anxious to show is that the overall distribution of seats could have and should have been done in a fairer manner.  To prove my point I had to do a revision of the constituencies of the whole country.  There could be small changes or even major changes in any proposals I have made.  The important thing is that, in accordance with the over-riding principle the <Col N="809" /> population increase in the south, and in Dublin, and the population differences in the western area, it would have been fairer to have granted three seats to the Dublin area, one to Munster, one to North Leinster, and for Connacht to lose only one rather than two; even though it could have retained the two, but it would have involved dividing the county of Leitrim into three, and I do not think any of us would want to see that done again.</P>

      <P>There were no proposals when I left office.  We are not saying amendment No. 1 is absolutely perfect but generally, we think it is fair.  If there is a fairer way to do it that still allows the overall allocation of seats, we shall be happy to accept any arrangement of the size of the constituencies within the overall limit of the number of seats, whether it be three, four or five, I do not think we would have any serious complaint with the Minister, because this is a point on which opposing sides would always hold different opinions; even members of the same party will have different opinions as to whether it <Col N="810" /> should be three, four or five.  Our disagreement is in regard to the lumping of five new seats into the Dublin area, which does not even want this special treatment.  Not alone is this being foisted on the people of Dublin but it is being done at the expense of other areas, where it now takes more persons for a Deputy to be elected than in the Dublin area.  There is no sense or logic to that state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on amendment No. 1, but I shall move on in a moment.  This attitude is very surprising, especially for a Government who held out some ray of hope when they went into office that they would act in an enlightened manner.  This is positive proof of the depths to which the Government have sunk.  The next amendment, No. 8, proposes certain changes in pages 5, 6 and 7 of the Bill. It proposes deleting the entries relating to the constituencies of Mid County Dublin, North County Dublin, South County Dublin, West County Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, and replacing them with new constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituencies proposed by us in our amendment are : a three-seater in South-West County Dublin; a five-seater in North County Dublin; a four-seater in South County Dublin and a five-seater in Dún Laoghaire.  There is nothing sacrosanct about the size, the names or the areas of those constituencies or about the areas included in each of the amendments I propose. I am not saying this is the most perfect way in which it could have been done. I am saying that changes similar to these would have allowed for the allocation of three of these new seats to the Dublin area rather than five.  That must be borne in mind in all our thinking in drawing up these amendments. I have no strong feelings as to whether <Col N="811" /> North County Dublin should be a three, four or five-seater; whether South County Dublin should be a four, a three or a five-seater, or Dún Laoghaire a three, four or five-seater. I have shown that by availing of the tolerance allowed by the Supreme Court decision the Minister could have topped up these Dublin constituencies, still stayed within the constitutional limit and allocated three new seats to Dublin.</P>
    <P>That is amendment No. 8.  There is not much point in delaying the House with the actual details.  My own words will indicate that I do not see much point in listing them here because I do not hold that it is the most perfect way in which to do it or that there is anything sacrosanct about the exact areas, names and sizes.  But it is a way which, overall, would have meant a fairer result.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 refers to changes in pages 7 and 8 of the Bill and reads:</P>
    <P>... to delete the entries relating to the constituencies of Dublin (Artane), Dublin (Ballyfermot), Dublin (Cabra), Dublin (Clontarf), Dublin (Finglas), Dublin North-Central, Dublin (Rathmines West), Dublin South-Central, Dublin South-East....</P>
    <P>and then proposes to substitute the constituencies proposed in my amendment. Those constituencies are: a three-seater in Dublin North-Central; a three-seater in Dublin North-East; a three-seater in Dublin (Artane); a three-seater in Dublin (Finglas); a three-seater in Dublin (Cabra); a three-seater in Dublin South-Central; a three-seater in Dublin South-East and a three-seater in Dublin (Rathmines West).  If one takes a closer look at my amendments one will see that, as far as possible, I have tried to apply what I imagined was the criterion the Minister was applying.  He laid down the criterion that he wanted three-seater constituencies.  He has not explained satisfactorily or adequately to the House why he choose a three-seater constituency in a densely-populated area like Dublin.  But I have accepted that as the premise on which <Col N="812" /> I have made my amendments; that we draw up the amendments on the basis he has laid down, on his own criterion of three-seaters.  By comparing the Minister's table in his explanatory memorandum, the population per Member, and the deviation from the national average population per Member as shown in that table, one can see that all I have done is to add further electoral areas&mdash;or wards as they are called in the county borough area of Dublin&mdash;to the constituencies and in that way, brought them above the population per Member that the Minister laid down in his Bill but still did not exceed, at any stage, the maximum number per population allowed by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This shows the clever, devious means used by the Minister to try to boost the number of seats in Dublin by taking a lower figure than was allowable.  My amendments show clearly that by going for the higher figure per population per Member, staying within the maximum allowable by the Constitution and the decision of the Supreme Court, we could have ended up with something similar to the Minister's own constituencies, only slightly larger, but having the great difference that overall, we would end up with 41 under my amendments, which is 38 plus three new seats being created in those various constituencies and which we claim is the only fair way of doing it; fair to the people of Dublin and fair mostly to the people in rural Ireland.  This has not been done.  That was the thinking behind my amendments and I have shown that it can be done.</P>
    <P>Marvellous statements and claims were made by speakers behind the Minister in the Second Stage debate on this Bill.  It is quite obvious they made no study of the figures whatsoever. They got up, like good little boys, behind the Minister&mdash;as marshalled at that stage&mdash;supported him, told him he was doing a marvellous job because that is what they were told to tell him.  But some people on the Minister's side made some stupid statements.  Saying that there was not adequate population in the west to retain anything more than 28 seats <Col N="813" /> was an outright untruth; was a device used by Government members to try to justify what the Minister is doing here; to try to cover up what he is doing and cloak over the discrimination contained in this document.</P>
    <P>The next amendment is No. 12 which proposes changes in page 9 of the Bill and reads as follows:</P>
    <P>In page 9, in the second column of the entry relating to the constituency of Kildare, to delete all words after &ldquo;except&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the part thereof which is comprised in the constituency of Meath&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's Bill he proposes that the constituency of Kildare be a three-seater. I have followed that in my amendment.  The Minister proposes that the constituency of Kildare shall comprise the administrative county of Kildare except the parts thereof which are comprised in the constituencies of West County Dublin and Meath. Therefore, we see that the Minister has put portion of Kildare into County Dublin and has put another portion into County Meath.  According to the Minister he has been striving in this revision Bill to maintain county boundaries.  It would be much wiser for the Minister to drop that claim because any reading of the Bill will show that that has not been done. Indeed, I accept that it would have been very difficult for the Minister to have complied with county boundaries, but it is rather ludicrous to continue to make the claim that he did make great efforts to maintain them. I suppose the Minister did make some effort but it was not very great because the crossing of county boundaries is quite substantial.  The Minister's proposal is that there should be three seats in County Kildare, excepting the portions going into Counties Dublin and Meath.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the counties of Kildare and Meath have very similar population figures.  In fact, in the 1971 census, there were more persons recorded as being resident in County Kildare than in County Meath. One could argue that if one or other <Col N="814" /> of these was to be made a four-scater constituency, on the grounds of fairness and justice, it should be Kildare. But the Minister choose to cut down Kildare by putting one portion of it into County Dublin and another into Meath, and made the four-seater constituency in County Meath which has not as high a population as County Kildare.  When one sees something like that one has to look behind it and one wonders: why did he do that?  Then one suddenly realises that that is the Minister's own constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with amendment No. 12 which comes under group A.  I think I have shown to the House that the proposal in our <Col N="816" /> amendment is a fair one and one which would be much more acceptable to the community at large than what the Minister is proposing.  Our arguments are somewhat negatived by the Minister's and the Government's indication of the use of the guillotine which implies that none of these amendments will be considered seriously.  We can only act as any democratic Opposition can, make our case and explain why we are proposing certain changes.  We can continue to debate this Bill in the fashion that is normally acceptable in any democratic parliament building in the world.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made this debate exceptional by hanging over it this threat of no consideration being given to amendments and threatening to close the debate with one fell swoop whenever he so wishes.  We will ignore that threat and continue to make our contributions in an orderly fashion despite no contribution from the Government benches and no justification from them for any of the provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The last amendment in this group is amendment No. 20, which proposes certain changes in page 11 of the Bill.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>In page 11, in the second column of the entry relating to the constituency of Wicklow to delete all words after &ldquo;except&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the part thereof which is comprised in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes that Wicklow be a three-seat constituency, and that it should comprise:</P>
      <P>The administrative county of Wicklow, except the parts thereof which are comprised in the constituencies of Mid County Dublin and South County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all accept that the total population for County Wicklow is in excess of the maximum figure for a three-seat constituency and that it either has to be topped up by the transfer from the surrounding area to make it a four-seat constituency or <Col N="817" /> it must concede some of its area to surrounding constituencies to allow it to continue as a three-seat constituency. The Minister has chosen to retain Wicklow as a three-seat constituency. Our amendment also proposes that it be a three-seat constituency. The only difference is that the Minister chose to transfer out of Wicklow, in order to bring it down to the required maximum figure for a three-seat constituency, an area to Dublin.  He transferred part of Wicklow to Mid County Dublin constituency and another part to South County Dublin constituency.  Our amendment clearly illustrates our endeavour to give fair play to rural Ireland, the areas where there are the greatest problems in this country. Our thinking is outward from Dublin, not inward as is evident in the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to amendment No.  20 which deals with the constituency of Wicklow.  I pointed out that the population in the constituency of Wicklow is in excess of the maximum figure for a three-seat constituency.  As the Minister has indicated that he wants to retain Wicklow as a three-seat constituency some of its area had to be transferred to another area.  Our amendment follows the Minister's criterion in this in that it proposes that Wicklow be a three-seat constituency, but instead of the area the Minister proposes to transfer to Dublin we propose that part of Wicklow be transferred to the adjoining constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny which, as it stood was within the tolerance range but sufficiently below the maximum to allow for the absorption of part of an adjoining constituency.  In accordance with our philosophy of assisting weaker areas we thought it would be preferable for Wicklow to cede to Carlow-Kilkenny than to tie part of Wicklow up with part of County Dublin.  That is what is proposed in the group of amendments we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> To illustrate the overriding factor which determined our attitude to the Minister's Bill and which influenced our thinking in drawing up those amendments&mdash;the unfair distribution of the new seats&mdash;I should like to quote some figures.  The county of Carlow has a population of 34,237. Kilkenny has 61,473.  The county of Dublin has 852,219.  Kildare has 71,977 and Wicklow 66,295.  Those five counties make up a grand total of 1,086,201.  In the Minister's Bill he proposes to allocate 54 seats to that area.  Our amendment proposes allocating 52 seats to that area.  If 54 seats are allocated to those five counties, as the Minister proposes to do it, it works out at an average population per Deputy of 20,114.  I do not need to remind the House that the national average is 20,123, so the Minister has gone below even the national average, whereas he had a tolerance range of 1,000 above that again.  Our amendment proposes allocating 52 seats to that area, which would work out at a population of 20,888 per Member. The figure of 20,888 is nearer to the type of average that the Minister has been applying in rural areas than the figure of 20,114.</P>
    <P>The one big flaw in the Minister's proposals is that it requires fewer persons to elect a Deputy or to create a seat in the area under discussion than it does in the rural constituencies with which we will be dealing later.  That is a bad philosophy on the part of any Government.  It is extraordinary that any Government should attempt to give such electoral advantage to an area which is already advantaged <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the country anyway.  There is some strange thinking behind it which requires clarification and elaboration. We ask for some explanation of this discrimination against rural areas. We ask why the tolerance range has been applied to the advantage of Dublin and to the disadvantage of rural Ireland.  We pose these questions in all sincerity.  We have no wish to prolong discussion of this Bill in any way but we feel that it is a Bill that requires full and adequate consideration because there is quite a lot behind this Bill which the ordinary <Col N="819" /> public will not become aware of unless these facts are highlighted in this House.  I would ask the Minister to reply to some of these points.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy must be making a mistake.  There was a Second Reading in this House.  He made a number of points on the Second Reading and they were replied to.  In fact, I went into great detail in telling Deputy Molloy the reason when introducing and when replying to the Second Reading.  I also went into great detail in pointing out to Deputy Molloy what he had in mind when he was Minister. He has introduced amendments which he first told us he had worked on for hours himself, more hours than we have spent on the Bill in the House, and we have had 40 hours already.  He subsequently said the Fianna Fáil Party prepared them.  I think he is not quite sure who prepared them.  They do not seem to have been too well prepared anyway.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy has queried the justification of giving 43 seats to Dublin.  The simple answer is that this number is justified by population. From time to time I have heard the argument being made that a large area, irrespective of population, should be entitled to representation in the House.  For instance, Deputy Cunningham spoke about the length of Donegal and what a large area that county covered.  In some peculiar way he thought we should do better but he did not put down an amendment.  He is quite satisfied that five seats make him safer and I am not quarrelling with that.  He is satisfied to talk about other areas.</P>

      <P>The Dublin area is entitled to the number of seats it has got.  If Deputy Molloy felt as strongly about this as he now claims, is it not extraordinary that since the census of 1971 he did not make any move except to doodle in his office and to have four different proposals drawn up regarding the constituencies?  Was it a case that he could not get agreement with the rest of his Cabinet? He got the chance to introduce a Bill if he wanted to but he did not do so despite the fact that the onus was on the Government to do so before the last election.  They did not do so because they could not get agreement.</P>

The Deputy has asked me to explain certain matters.  Is it any wonder I do not pay much attention to what he says when five or six of his party, Deputies Cunningham, Haughey, Faulkner and Lalor and himself said that there should be at least 148 Deputies in the new Dáil and that they would support that view.

      <P>My question is a follow-up to those asked by Deputy Molloy.  The Minister has said that Fianna Fáil are attempting to give representation to areas rather than to <Col N="824" /> populations.  Can the Minister tell me why it takes 1,718 more people to elect a Deputy for Sligo-Leitrim as against Dublin South-East?  Why does it take 1,772 more people to elect a Deputy for Sligo-Leitrim as against the Meath constituency while in Donegal it takes 1,864 and in Roscommon-Leitrim 1,881 more people to elect a Deputy.  People in the north-west are being deprived by the Minister of fair representation.  In the Dublin constituencies there are areas of less than two square miles. We have areas in the north-west stretching from 75 miles up to 130 miles.</P>

      <P>If I am to make my point in relation to the Dublin South-East constituency I must exemplify the area deprived of representation as a result of this revision in the north-west of Ireland. The Minister has accused us of not making a logical approach.  The fact is that the population of the north-west is being deprived of fair and proper representation.  I would like the Minister to clarify this because people are entitled to know why they are being deprived of representation here.  Goodness knows, they have been deprived of much already and now they are being deprived of this also.  Why does it take so many more people, as against the Dublin South-East constituency, in Sligo-Leitrim 1,718, in Donegal 1,864 and in Roscommon 1,881, to elect a representative to this House as compared with the Meath constituency, which is on the east coast and therefore in a more advantageous position?  I am very concerned about this.  I could not care less what Minister for Local Government reorganises or revises constituencies because it is the people eventually who will decide what representatives they will have here.  Let no Minister for Local Government think and this has been proven, that any constituency revision will copperfasten any political party or combination of political parties in control in this House.  That has been proven. The Minister asked today why should he accept this amendment since it would take 1,000 more people to elect a TD in Dublin than it would in Cork and that was his reason for not accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that it was illogical for Deputy Molloy to make the point about Dublin while at the same time suggesting that Cork would require the reverse.  I think that was a logical argument.  Remember, I put five seats in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister put four in Meath for himself.  I am amazed that rural Deputies on the <Col N="826" /> other side of this House have not made this point or sought the clarification to which they are entitled on behalf of those they represent.  This large section of the rural community should not be deprived of representation and let no one think that public representatives will get away with it. We are entitled to clarification.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed tolerance areas constituted of two square miles in the cities will be over-represented and it will take many more people to elect representatives for a great many more square miles in the north-west. The Minister has categorised this argument as cynical and foolish.  He said we were seeking representation for acres of land.  The Bill shows that the Minister is depriving 1,864 people in north-west constituencies per Deputy of proper representation here. The Minister must explain this.</P>

Deputy Molloy's proposal would give 22 seats to the same population which would be an average of 20,888.  Fianna Fáil cannot have it both ways.  We stuck close to the national average.  We stayed within the Constitution.  We have done everything correctly and the only thing worring Fianna Fáil is that they may possibly lose a seat.  How can they lose any more seats in the west?  They lost them the last time and they cannot lose them again.  What are they moaning about?</P>

I was never in favour of a commission because I think it is the duty of the Minister to do what he is doing and stand over it whether we like it or not.

      <P>Amendment No. 9, dealing with Dublin South-East.  I do not even know whose constituency it is. To enforce our arguments about the population of the west, and the north-west in particular, we must give these examples.  The Minister can call them what he likes, selective or otherwise, but the facts are there.  The general public should be made fully aware and his own backbenchers from the same area will, I hope, make the public fully aware of the fact that they are being discriminated against.  As I said, it takes 1,718 fewer people to elect a Deputy in Dublin South-East than it takes in Sligo-Leitrim.  I am entitled to make that point on these amendments.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that we were stupid enough to be looking for representation in this House for areas or tracts of land and that we were not putting forward the case for giving fair representation to the population.  I gave the Minister specific examples taken from his own Bill.  They cannot be denied.  They prove that the Minister is not giving fair and equal representation to the rural population.  This can be pointed out not in one or two selected constituencies <Col N="832" /> but in nine or ten.  The basis of all our amendments is that the constituencies are being revised to favour the east coast rather than the west.  That is fundamental to our argument.  The Minister still has not answered my questions and I am entitled to an answer.  Our amendments, stupid and all as the Minister may describe them, virtually give the answer.  They are proving now the embarrassment entailed in this constituency Bill for the Government.  To a large extent this was evident when the Government itself was picked and the west was left without any Minister. Here again the west is being further deprived of representation by not giving it the number of Members it is entitled to.</P>

      <P>It is possible that there are reasons which can be put forward why the Minister will not accept our amendment in relation to the constituency of Dublin South East because it has been re-arranged and one of his colleagues is in that constituency.  However, we have no fear for the member who represents us in that area and it is possible that he will bring in another Member for our party, but the Minister's colleague had to be copperfastened <Col N="833" /> there.  It is possible that this is the reason why we see such deviation in Dublin South East as against the north western constituencies of Donegal, Roscommon-Leitrim or Sligo-Leitrim. I must give these examples or otherwise I would be talking nonsense in relation to the amendment. It is possible that the Minister, when I conclude, will say that I have been talking nonsense but this is his way of getting out of the embarrassment he finds himself in.  These are the Minister's own figures and they prove discrimination in relation to the population of the west, the north-west in particular.</P>

      <P>May we have the answer to this, although the Minister almost gave it when he spoke a short time ago?  He stated that even the Constitution did not oblige him to give this representation that the west is entitled to.  On several occasions the Minister put forward the excuse that for 50 years we did this job, but as I was never here before when such a job was being done I do not know what he is talking about.  The Minister is doing this job now, and obviously he is going to do it his way. The procedure being adopted by the Minister is discriminating against the population of the west and north-west and the figures are here to prove this.

The Deputy cannot deny that.  I have also taken a group around Dublin and a group in an other area in the country and again the same thing applies.

      <P>Roscommon-Leitrim is plus 996; Sligo-Leitrim is plus 887, which is almost the same as West County Dublin.  Do not let us have all this crying over there about the country. Of course there are areas where this does not apply but I should like to point out one other matter.

      <P>I feel it obligatory to <Col N="836" /> clarify some misconceptions which have been promulgated by the Minister. Two very simple figures will prove my point.  The Minister has tried to create the impression that the revision of constituencies has been done in a fair way and we are arguing on the basis of population per Deputy. The two simple figures I wish to refer to and which may have been lost when I mentioned them earlier concern the area west of the Shannon.  In all the area west of the Shannon, in the Minister's Bill, it requires 20,509 persons per Deputy but in the whole of Ireland east of the Shannon which includes Dublin, Ulster, Munster and the rest of Leinster, it requires only 20,033.  We are asking why there is discrimination west of the Shannon and why it takes nearly 500 more persons to elect a Deputy than in the area east of the Shannon.  There is sheer and utter discrimination there.</P>

Now I again appeal to the Minister to take the view that the proposed amendments are very reasonable and can only improve the provisions of the Bill.  I urge him to accept these amendments, not to reject them out of hand.  He could even give us the hope that he would reconsider the amendments.

      <P>I must pay tribute to Deputy Molloy in respect of the amount of trouble he took in producing each of these very reasoned amendments.  Amendment No. 12 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 9, in the second column of the entry relating to the constituency of Kildare, to delete all words after &ldquo;except&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the part thereof which is comprised in the constituency of Meath&rdquo;.</P>

If the Minister was sitting over here&mdash;and it will not be long before he will be sitting over here&mdash;I think the Minister for Local Government in charge would pay him a tribute.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews has asked me to pay tribute to Deputy Molloy.  I remember a previous occasion when I introduced 182 amendments to a Bill.  I got no tribute from this side for doing it; I got abuse, although they were reasonable amendments. As far as I am concerned, Deputy Molloy, or whoever helped him to do the job, did a job with which I do not agree at all.  I do not propose to pay tributes for something I do not agree with.  I have been accused of threatening the guillotine here and of being unreasonable.  However, <i>The Sunday Press</i>, March, 24th, contained the following:</P>
      <P>The Revision Bill has been a big factor in delaying the passage of other legislation, some of great economic and social importance, through the Dáil.  We therefore might not worry about who wins the tussle over the constituencies, but we have real worry over this distraction from work we are entitled to have done.  So from our narrow viewpoint and without bothering about the merits of the political clash, we should be happy with the use of the guillotine or anything else that puts a quick end to the in-fighting.</P>

Everybody is satisfied that this playacting has gone on too long, indeed, as stated by <i>The Sunday Press.</i> If Fianna Fáil suddenly find that the game is over and that they cannot continue it any longer, there is no use in blaming us and saying we are jackbooting or anything else.

      <P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 affect different constituencies in different ways.  When I come to West County Dublin I find that Ballyfermot H and Crumlin West are now linked up with Blanchardstown, Castleknock, Clondalkin, Clonsilla, Lucan No. 1, Lucan No. 2, Newcastle, Palmerston No. 1, Palmerston No. 2, Rathcoole, Saggart, Terenure No. 1, and, in the administrative county of Kildare, the district electoral divisions of Celbridge, Donaghcumber, Leixlip, Maynooth, in the former rural district of Celbridge No. 1, and the following wards from the county borough of Dublin&mdash;Ballyfermot H and Crumlin F.  I cannot see how those areas can be linked with one another and justify the Minister's claim on Second Stage that he intended to respect county boundaries.  This is beyond my comprehension.  In the amendment the Ballyfermot areas are being linked with Tallaght, Saggart, Clondalkin and so on, which are now becoming&mdash; if they cannot claim already to have become&mdash;urban areas.  This has always been a problem for Deputies whether rural or urban&mdash;to represent the best interests of the whole country and that is what we are all elected to do.  Naturally, there are pressures on Deputies which would apply differently to urban than rural Deputies.  For that reason I would seriously urge the Minister to examine this movement of South Dublin into Kildare.  Indeed, I think amendment No. 9 deals with that in regard to Mid County Dublin&mdash;there is Mid County and West County&mdash;Blessington, Kilbride, Lacken being mixed with Rathfarnham, and so on.  In other words, it is a complete and absolute break-up of urban and rural types of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should accept amendments Nos. 8 and 9.  Amendment No. 9 is completely urban; the two areas, Dundrum and Milltown, as far as I am concerned, are urban areas.  They are the only two in it that could be <Col N="848" /> classified as being in a county area. Dundrum is now an area of massive housing and shopping centres.  Indeed, the problem now is for the local authorities to cope with the traffic going through the area.</P>
    <P>What I would like the Minister to explain is why we have to bring rural Wicklow into Dublin city areas and why we have to bring rural Kildare into Dublin city areas.  It is very difficult for me to understand.  I am not at all concerned about three-seat constituencies.  As is quite clear from Deputy Molloy's amendments our amendments are based on three-seat constituencies in the east of the country.</P>

In fairness to the House, if a Deputy comes in here&mdash;particularly a Deputy like Deputy Lemass who has been a Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and speaks on an amendment to the Bill, at least he should know what amendment he is talking about and the House should be able to follow.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Molloy is not able to get his troop behind him to follow what he wants to do that is not my fault and he certainly will not blame me for it.  The situation is that Deputy Lemass proceeded to quote, for nearly ten minutes, sections of amendments and related <Col N="849" /> them to sections of the Bill to which they had no relation. What he was talking about bore no relation to the amendments. It is not good enough for Deputy Lemass or anybody else to come in to this House and attempt to put across a bluff like that.  I will listen with patience to anybody who has a point.  Deputy MacSharry is a typical example.  Indeed, earlier Deputy Molloy and Deputy Burke made their points&mdash;whether or not I agreed with them&mdash;and related them to the amendments before the House. But it is not enough to come in at this hour, talk about amendments and try to relate them to sections of the Bill when, in fact, Deputy Lemass had not the foggiest notion what it was all about.</P>

As far as the county boundaries are concerned, might I point out to Deputy Lemass that, in the Bill there is a far smaller number of fractures of county boundaries than in any of the proposals Deputy Molloy was working on, in the amendments he laid down here and, indeed, in one particular group which has not even been put down but about which we hear a lot of talk where we would have to take bits of every county in the west and stick them together in an effort to give an extra seat to it.</P>

      <P>The Minister speaks about the crossing of county boundaries.  I am inclined to treat that with a certain amount of cynicism.  The Minister speaks of the county I have the honour to represent, the county of Dublin.  The present constituency of North County Dublin stretches from Balbriggan, right within the county boundary, the whole way down to Walkinstown with one crossing of the city boundary to take in the Baldoyle ward, an area which for many years was part of county Dublin and is not so much a new crossing of county boundaries as bringing back to county Dublin people who were with us in the past. The Minister, in his proposal, has crossed the county boundary, by moving into the city area in Ballymun; by moving into Kildare with his <Col N="851" /> West County; by moving into the city in his Mid County and by moving into Wicklow with his Mid County. I am delighted to see Deputy McMahon here because I know he is very anxious to speak about the proposal.</P>

      <P>The Minister's proposals suggest that in this constituency we cross the county boundary to bring in that part of Rathfarnham in which the Parliamentary Secretary assumed he got a few votes in the last election and also the section around Tallaght where Deputy Seán Walsh is very strong and in which Deputy McMahon lives.  This constituency passes through part of West County Dublin, the area which is designed to reinforce the position of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Mark Clinton.  I had the pleasure of standing with him in the last general election.  He is an honourable, decent man.  One could not hope to find a more honourable candidate and colleague.  The Minister for Local Government, in order to copperfasten the position of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, has brought in the towns of Rathcoole and Saggart.  He has ensured, by <Col N="852" /> this piece of gerrymandering, that if Deputy McMahon or one of the other candidates from the Mid County area wants to get from one end of the constituency to the other he must travel through parts of County Wicklow.  I am sure any reasonable man who compares this with the amendment put down by Deputy Molloy will admit that Deputy Molloy's amendment is the better proposal.  Deputy Molloy's proposal is much more constructive than the Minister's.  The Minister has indicated that he will guillotine this debate if not during the next four minutes, tomorrow or sometime later.</P>

      <P>The amendment I am referring to deals with the attempted gerrymander of the greater Dublin area plus parts of Kildare and Wicklow.  The Minister had a very difficult job because in drafting this Bill he had to attend not only to the needs of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party but also to the individual needs of the Coalition Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries <Col N="853" /> who are residing within the Pale. We on this side of the House have a duty not only to the greater Dublin area, which deserves fair representation, but to the country at large.  The Minister looked at this situation in the light of the Dublin mind and the Leinster mind rather than that of the country at large.  He should look at the proposals put down by Deputy Molloy, reconsider his situation and at least accept the principles involved in the amendments.  People in the country would have equal representation and a fair share of the national cake, to which they are entitled.  I am speaking as a North County Dublin man.  We do not expect unfair representation. We asked for fair representation for the country as well as for the constituencies in the Dublin area.  We are not asking for favours which the Minister may be inclined to pass on to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy David Andrews has given me notice of his intention to raise a matter as follows:</P>
      <P>The propriety of having an inquiry into the escape of two prisoners from Mountjoy Prison on 11th March, 1974, carried out by officials of the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Justice the following question on Thursday, 24th March, 1974:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if he will make a statement on the escape of two prisoners from Mountjoy Prison, Dublin, on Monday 11th March, 1974, in view of the inquiry held into security after a previous escape and the reassurance then and subsequently given by him.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>The circumstances surrounding the escape are being inquired into in detail and I am not in a position to make a statement at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> On pursuit of the Minister, by way of supplementary questions, I asked who was conducting the inquiry and the House was informed that the Minister's own Department were conducting the inquiry, presumably ordered by the Minister.  The whole issue is one of prison security and I am sure the Minister in his reply to this debate will include his views on what the terms of reference of the Department's inquiry will be.</P>
    <P>We elicited from the Minister that the inquiry was being conducted by his Department and questioned the propriety of such an inquiry being conducted by the Department officials into the Minister's competence.  The Minister then stated in the second part of the reply to my question that he was not in a position to make any statement at present.  In further pursuit of the Minister we discovered that not only was the Minister not prepared to make a statement at present but that even when the findings of the inquiry are made known to him that will be the end of the matter and the Minister will not make a statement, as we understand it, at any time so the people and this House will be as much in the dark as ever they were.  That would appear to be the position.</P>
    <P>I stated that prison security is the issue and we charge the Minister with failure in his duty to the people in this respect.  We say that he has completely undermined the confidence of the people in relation to his Government's capacity and the Minister's capacity to deal with the security of this State, more particularly in relation to the matter of prison security.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle in very kindly allowing this question made the point that the propriety of the Minister's own Department in examining their own Minister raised eyebrows on the Opposition side of the House.</P>
    <P>What the Minister's Department are doing, as we understand it, is adjudicating on the competence of their own Minister to do his duty in respect of the failures which we allege have occurred in the area of security. The Department inquiry is being conducted, <Col N="855" /> we assume&mdash;because we have to assume and to speculate&mdash;into the matter of prison security.  The Minister is examining himself and that is a practice which we consider wrong. We are told that we are not to receive the result of the Department's inquiry.</P>
    <P>Equally in relation to the propriety of the Minister's Department examining the very serious matter before them, the mechanics of the workings of this House must also come into serious question.  I will not in any way question the Ceann Comhairle's ruling in any matter during my short contribution on this question but the Ceann Comhairle is aware, and the House is aware, that I attempted to raise this matter by way of Private Notice Question some 24 hours after those two criminals escaped and the Ceann Comhairle ruled out of order my attempt to raise the question.  He gave me two reasons for ruling the question out of order.  One was that the incident was now over and the second that the question on proper notice would enable a more considered reply based on a full consideration of the security position in Mountjoy.  I have&mdash;again not in any way questioning the ruling of the Chair&mdash;brought this ruling to the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because I felt I had a duty to do so and to ensure that matters of public importance, like the escape of those two inmates, should be brought up as a matter of urgency in this House and that I should not have to wait an excessive seven days to have my questions answered.  In fact, I did not receive an answer to the question at all.  What little information we did receive was elicited arising out of supplementaries asked of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I shall quote now from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, March 12th, 1974, what the Minister said about security. I quote:</P>
    <P>Three days after the Taoiseach's announcement of a judicial inquiry into the State's security system, following the helicopter escape of three Provisionals from Mountjoy <Col N="856" /> Jail last November, the Minister for Justice, Mr. Cooney, said that the inquiry would be wider in terms of security than the helicopter incident.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;should be foreseeable.  Some things could not be foreseen, but that did not excuse them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>End of the Minister's quotation.  It continued:</P>
    <P>The security failure at Mountjoy was first apparent on October 31st last when Seamus Twomey, J. B. O'Hagan and Kevin Mallon escaped from the jail in a hijacked helicopter from under the eyes of the guards.  The helicopter landed in the exercise yard...</P>

      <P>I am asking that the Department of Justice officials take these matters into consideration during the course of their deliberations and when they are arriving at their conclusion to present to the Minister himself.  The matter would be so extraordinarily comic if it were not such a serious matter.  The idea of the Minister investigating himself.  I shall quote the Minister's own words again from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12th March:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Quite frankly, this type of operation was not foreseen,&rdquo; he said.</P>

      <P>I shall continue with the quotation:</P>
      <P>Whether it should have been foreseen is a matter which is receiving attention, but I think it would be difficult to say, even with the benefit of hindsight, that it should have been foreseen.</P>
      <P>The contributor to <i>The Irish Times</i> said:</P>
      <P>The day after the escape the Taoiseach announced in the Dáil that a judicial inquiry into the State's security system would be set up. Meanwhile, security in prisons was to be tightened as a matter of urgency, he said.</P>
      <P>These are the Minister's own words. I would ask that the Department's officials, during the conduct of this inquiry, would take the quotations into consideration when they present the Minister with their findings.  We know the Minister will not make public the findings and this is the tragedy of the situation.  In view of the fact that information is not forthcoming from the Government on the matter unfortunately we have to speculate. I would ask the Minister to ask his officials to take into consideration an article in the <i>Sunday World</i> dated 17th March.</P>

      <P>There are a few other points the Minister might consider, or ask his officials to consider. Will the Minister say that this party were correct at the time of the helicopter incident when we said that Garda strength within and outside the prison was reduced at that time and that on this occasion there was only one garda at the main entrance to Mountjoy?  Can the Department officials inquire into that?  Can the Minister say if a visit by a member of the British Embassy staff a few days before the escape was investigated <Col N="860" /> and, if so, the result of that investigation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has been most patient and I shall obey the ruling.  Why does the Minister not refer this latest escape to a judicial personage for investigation?  Have the Finlay Commission reported on security arising out of the helicopter incident and, if not, does the Minister intend asking the Finlay Commission to examine the latest incident?  If the Minister is to be consistent, surely an independent body should have inquired into this latest escape?  All these points need immediate arising and reply.  We hope that the Minister, even at this late stage, will relent in relation to his own officials examining himself and his inadequacy as Minister in charge of the security of prisons and the State generally.</P>
      <P>An important fact which the Department officials might take into account is that a new visiting committee have not been appointed since the previous committee's term of office expired on 31st December, 1973.  Will the Minister explain why a new committee have not been appointed?  If he intends appointing a new committee, who will be the members?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that a visiting committee are not in existence at the moment is a breach of the statute.  We must put a final question to the Minister although we do not wish to be unduly harsh on him.  There was a general feeling inside and outside the House that the Minister should resign in view of his overall handling of the security of the State.  Did he at any stage offer his resignation to the Taoiseach on account of the escape by the Littlejohn brothers from Mountjoy on 11th March?  I know the Minister's Department will not discuss the matter of the Minister's resignation during their deliberations on the escape of <Col N="861" /> these two criminals from Mountjoy Prison.  The Opposition have made a very fair case questioning the propriety of the Minister's own officials inquiring into his competence or otherwise to do his job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the criteria the Minister established in his previous statement after the helicopter escape that the test was one of reasonable foreseeability, does the Minister now not acknowledge that in so far as this attempt and its success was entirely foreseeable it is obvious that an inquiry is not necessary to establish the fact that this escape should not have been allowed to take place?  For that reason, in setting up the inquiry the Minister is trying to cover up his total incompetence in this area and, to that extent, the inquiry is being used as a smokescreen for the Minister's incompetence, even by his own stated standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter the Chair allowed to be raised on the Adjournment was the question of the propriety of having an inquiry into the escape of two prisoners carried out by officials of my Department.  This is the net question and a very net question it is.  In the few minutes at my disposal I want to indicate to you, Sir, and to the House, for the edification and knowledge of Deputy Andrews, that it was appropriate that such an inquiry should be carried out by my Department and that it was in accordance with well-established precedent for it to be so carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, Deputy Andrews in his suggestion that officials were really inquiring into me, was either being malicious, or mischievous, or both because he knew quite well that that was not the purpose of the inquiry.  The inquiry was to ascertain the facts surrounding the escape of these two prisoners, to see how it happened and why it happened and to find out where the system went wrong, to see was it a fault in the system or was it a human error.  The implication in the question that it was an improper task for officers of my Department in the sense that they would not bring an unbiassed <Col N="862" /> view to bear on the inquiry is something that I must reject.  It shows a lamentable lack of knowledge on the part of Deputy Andrews, who is the spokesman for Justice, of the functions of the Department and the officials of the Department in relation to the administration of prisons.  I thought that the reason he failed to appear here the last day when he was granted leave to raise this Adjournment debate&mdash;this is what occurred to me at any rate &mdash; was that, when he discovered the very net question he proposed to raise, he found himself berefit of ideas on it and he did not appear to give himself an opportunity to consult his &ldquo;think tank&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As a result of whatever briefing he got from his &ldquo;think tank&rdquo; to try to expand the dimension of the very net question he chose to raise we have had here tonight a mish-mash of newspaper quotations in an endeavour to make an alleged case. But this clearly does not cover up Deputy Andrews' ignorance of the administration of the Department of Justice, something he could have ascertained from my predecessor and something that he, as spokesman for Justice, should have known.  He should know that the headquarters officers who conducted the inquiry have themselves no direct or indirect responsibility for the safe custody of prisoners.  On the other hand, by reason of the fact that they are attached to the prison section of the Department, they have a knowledge of prisons, of the physical layout of prisons, of the prison régime, and of the day-to-day activities of the prison. Deputy Andrews should know that, because of that knowledge, they were peculiarly well qualified to sift the facts and investigate the position in order to ascertain what happened. This, as I say, was in accordance with long-established precedent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrews strayed off the motion and I am, I think, a Cheann Comhairle, entitled to stray off also in reply to Deputy Andrews; if I so stray it is as a result of Deputy Andrews straying.  Deputy Andrews suggested there was something seriously wrong with security because two prisoners escaped from <Col N="865" /> Mountjoy.  Since 1970 there have been 50 escapes or serious attempts to escape&mdash;27 actual escapes and 23 attempts&mdash;and these did not all occur in the last year.  About twenty occurred in the last year.</P>
      <P>Our prisons were not designed as high security prisons and they depend for their security to a large degree on a human factor and Deputy Andrews has exemplified in the standard of his contribution here this evening the fact that the human factor is very, very variable indeed.  I just want to make that point clear.  Again, there is a distressing tendency on the part of the Opposition to come in here and criticise the Forces of the State, whether they be gardaí, members of the Army or prison officers.</P>

That was <Col N="866" /> something that did not get the headlines it deserved to get and it is an indication of the alertness of the security forces.  I reject completely any suggestion that there has been any lack of security on the part of this Government and I also reject any suggestion of any impropriety in having this inquiry conducted by officials of my Department.
