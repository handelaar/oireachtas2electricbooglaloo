      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the action he proposes to take regarding the crossing of the Border by British helicopters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations are made to the British authorities, and an explanation is sought, in those cases in which it is clear that there has been an unauthorised crossing of the Border by British helicopters.</P>
      <P>Some crossings have, however, been authorised following consultation with the Minister for Defence.  The overriding consideration in taking a decision in such cases has been the need to save human lives.  It is not intended to change our policy in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking into account the frequency of crossings is it not a reasonable assumption that the pilots flying at low levels in daylight must be guilty of either rank carelessness or of making those crossings as part of a deliberate policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, under the conditions which prevail, risks of unintentional crossings.  There may also be other kinds of crossings. Unauthorised helicopter overflights over our territory are extremely regretted. Representations are made and will continue to be made to the British authorities whenever it is clear that such an incident has occurred.  Unfortunately the risk of such overflights will remain high as long as illegal organisations continue to put lives at risk on both sides of the Border by acts of terrorism. People who deplore the overflights would do well also to make clear that they condemn the terrorist activities which give rise to these dangers and others which are even more serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a fair comment.  The question is whether the Minister is satisfied that the British authorities are taking reasonable precautions regarding those crossings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In a number of cases we have made representations. The representations imply that we are not necessarily so satisfied in relation to those particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister in cases where overflights have taken place without the authority granted by the Irish Minister for Defence and where representations have been made by the Irish Government what response has been received from the British authorities to these representations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Four replies were received in recent months.  In three cases there was a denial that the incident took place.  That is to say the British authorities contested the view of the facts.  In one case they expressed doubt that an incident occurred.  Further replies are promised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The division of the Continental Shelf between neighbouring countries is not necessarily determined by the median line however defined.  The primary rule of customary international law is division in accordance with equitable principles.  As yet we have not concluded any such agreement but, of course, both our neighbours and ourselves are aware of the need to negotiate such an agreement and we are preparing our position for these negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some of our neighbours are already operating near what might be regarded or could justifiably be anticipated as the median line?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the Government being conscious of the need, could the Minister indicate what positive action has been taken so that that which might rightfully be taken within our jurisdiction will not have gone to somebody else?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will be conscious of the need that any statement made here should not be of a nature that would prejudice Ireland's position in relation to pending negotiations.  Therefore, it is not possible for me to reply with the degree of explicitness in this whole area that the Deputy would wish and as I, normally, would wish.  This is understood generally in relation to negotiations pending.  I trust the Deputy will accept my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O Brien Dr. Cruise-O Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O Brien</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Departments of Defence and Social Welfare administer the relevant licence schemes.  The question of extending the existing scheme, if there is a case for that, to provide for the issuing free of charge of licences for colour sets would be a matter for those Departments.  Of course my Department would be prepared to co-operate with the two Departments concerned in any arrangements that they considered proper to make in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped to provide service for the applicant in question within the next four months. The delay has been due to pressure of engineering work in the area.  A refund in the meantime of the advance payment is being arranged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the reason for the other telephones being installed earlier was that they represented earlier applications. There are considerable arrears of work in the engineering area, including the provisions of urgently needed trunk conjunction circuits and the installation of service for applicants who <Col N="1000" /> applied earlier than the applicant to whom the Deputy refers.  These earlier cases and the work of meeting this applicant's application have had to be fitted into a revised works programme following the disruption of the normal programme as a result of the January storms.</P>

      <P>The production target of Bord na Móna this year is the maximum possible output from their bogs and briquette factories.  Given favourable weather conditions, production could show an increase of 0.7 million tons on 1973 production.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna have recently announced general plans for the substantial development of the bog areas which had previously been considered unsuitable for economic development in face of low cost imported fuels. These plans will result in a considerable saving in fuel imports but will, of course, take some years to implement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the convenience of Deputies, I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with <Col N="1010" /> the Official Report a statement made by the Minister on this matter.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>Statement of the Minister for Education to the Teachers' Union of Ireland in Dún Laoghaire on 17th April, 1974.</i>
      </P>
      <P>Because of the growing pressures on students for high grades and competitive success educational systems are becoming, increasingly, academic tread-mills.  Increasingly, too, because of these pressures the school is losing contact with life outside and the student has little or no opportunity &ldquo;to stand and stare&rdquo;, to discover the kind of person he is, the kind of society he will be living in and, in due course, contributing to, its shortcomings and its good points.  The suggestion was made that perhaps somewhere in the middle of the course we might stop the tread-mill and release the students from the educational pressures for one year so that they could devote that time to personal development and community service.</P>
      <P>The suggestion appeals to me and perhaps you will allow me to put before you some thoughts I have had as to how that year might be spent.</P>
      <P>It would be the year immediately succeeding the intermediate certificate course, say between 15 and 16 years.  Up to one-half of the school-week would be given over to community service in the religious lay apostolate, social, environmental or other fields.  This would require skilful organisation but I am sure that the National Youth Council and its youth organisations and indeed other voluntary bodies would be able to give substantial help here.  For the student this experience would be his initiation into society and would give him an insight into community needs and aspirations.  One could hope that he would develop into a more mature and useful citizen because of this experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other half of the school week would be devoted to the student's development and exploration of his <Col N="1011" /> own person.  I should like to see about five hours devoted to studying the development of human thought, by way of an introduction to logic and philosophy.  I would devote three hours of the week to religious belief and practice and three hours each to the appreciation of music and art and media criticism.</P>
    <P>This year would be for everybody&mdash; for those about to leave full-time education as well as those continuing into senior cycle.  But it seems to me that, though flexibility and diversity would be essential in regard to all the activities of the year, it would be eminently desirable that certificate recognition be given to the course if for no other reason than to maintain the student's interest.  I would see therefore a school assessment on general performance with some form of written examination of the philosophy/logic syllabus and of religion, as appropriate.  I would suggest a weighting of 60/40 as between school assessment and written examination, resulting in the award of a certificate of general education.  I would expect that employers would look for this certificate from all young persons seeking employment.</P>
    <P>I regard this proposal as being of such fundamental importance to the future education of our children that given a positive and favourable response I would be prepared to put proposals to my colleagues in Government as to financial and other incentives which might be offered to schools to undertake the course&mdash; managers, teachers, pupils.  Such inservice training and re-training as might be necessary would be provided. If any school is interested in pioneering such a course I should like its authorities to accept this statement as an invitation to contact me on the matter.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Moore</b> asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the grave public disquiet and resentment regarding the imprisonment of Dómhnall Uas Ó Lúbhlaí; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of making a statement about a matter that has been the subject of a considerable amount of misunderstanding. A picture has been presented that Mr. Ó Lúbhlaí had to go to prison because gardaí or court officers refused to use his correct name.  That picture, as will be seen, is a distortion.</P>
      <P>In the answer, I shall be referring to the English and Irish forms of Mr. Ó Lúbhlaí's name.  This is for convenience of reference only, and I fully recognise his right to use one name exclusively and to repudiate any attempted translation or other modification of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case in question began nearly two years ago, in June, 1972, when a traffic warden noted an alleged parking offence.  This was followed in the normal course by an inquiry to the relevant registration authority, namely the Westmeath County Council, as to the name and address of the registered owner.  I understand that the registration authority do not keep a record of such queries and that, in accordance with the normal practice of the Garda Síochána, the <Col N="1021" /> query form was scrapped when the subsequent court proceedings had finished.  However, I am informed that, in a book kept by the registration authority for recording new registrations, the name of the registered owner of the car in question is given in an English form and only in that form.  Moreover, the garda who dealt with the case states that he is quite satisfied that he did not alter the name as supplied by the registration authority, and it would have been contrary to explicit instructions for him to do so.  In addition, the Garda have in their possession a corresponding query form that was completed in regard to a later alleged parking offence in which the same car was involved, and in that case an English form of the name is used in the reply by the same registration authority.</P>
    <P>All the indications are, therefore, that it was the English form of the name that was given to the gardaí by the registration authority.  I am not, of course, answerable for registration authorities but, for the information of the House, let me say that I understand that the application made to the registration authority for the registration of the car bears the Irish form of the applicant's name and is so signed, but that the other particulars, including the address, are given in English.</P>
    <P>These communications which I have mentioned between the Garda and the registration authority took place in July-August, 1972.  Subsequently, in accordance with standard practice, a formal note concerning the fine-on-the-spot was sent to the registered owner as named by the registration authority and, when that note was ignored and the fine-on-the-spot not paid, a summons was issued in the normal way and, of course, the same name was used.  The summons, too, was ignored and a fine was imposed by the District Court. This was in December, 1972.  The fine was not paid and in due course a warrant was issued and Mr. Ó Lúbhlaí was committed to prison.  A few days afterwards, the outstanding fine was paid.</P>
    <P>Arising from this narrative of <Col N="1022" /> events, there are a couple of points I would like to make clear.  Firstly, it has been hinted, and even directly alleged, that the fine was paid anonymously and that in reality it was paid surreptitiously by my Department. As was stated in a Press release issued by my Department, the fine was paid by a person who identified himself.  As the accuracy of this was challenged, Mr. Ó Lúbhlaí was informed by my Department, by letter dated 30th April, of the identity of the person who paid the fine.</P>
    <P>The second point is that, as far as can be ascertained&mdash;and I understand that Mr. Ó Lúbhlaí accepts this&mdash;he did not at any stage, either orally or in writing, get in touch with the Garda or the court office to say that anything was amiss.  It was only when the warrant of arrest was being executed, that is to say, when he was actually being arrested, that he raised any point and even then the arresting garda clearly understood him to be referring to the warrant being in English rather than to the form of his name.  The garda concerned rightly concluded that he was not entitled to refrain from executing the warrant at that stage.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it will be clear that at no stage was there any attempt, direct or indirect, by the Garda or by court officers, to deny Mr. Ó Lúbhlaí's right to have court documents addressed to him in the only form of his name that he wishes to have recognised.  It follows that the suggestions that have been made that it was necessary for him to go to prison to vindicate that right are without any foundation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has established that Mr. Ó Lúbhlaí was registered with the Westmeath County Council as Domhnall Ó Lúbhlaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, what I said was that the application form for first registration, having being completed in English, was signed Dómhnall Ó Lúbhlaí, but the reference book that was apparently used by Westmeath County Council and from which they supply the names to the <Col N="1023" /> Garda contained the name &ldquo;Donal Lovely&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It all would have been avoided if Mr. Ó Lúbhlaí had indicated at an early stage of the proceedings that they were amiss because of the wrong form of the name being used.  With regard to the other part of the Deputy's query, one officer went to arrest him; when Mr. Ó Lúbhlaí indicated that he was not prepared to go, this officer summoned help, and I understand there were two other members of the Garda together with the original officer, three in all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am afraid I cannot accept that.  However, in saying that, I concede without any cavil whatever, any citizen's right to have documents from the State in Irish. The documents in this case were not in Irish because, the name as furnished by the registration authority to the Garda was the English form of the name.  The Garda were entitled to accept that and to carry on from there on that premise.  The Garda did that, and, I submit to this House, are not in any way blameworthy as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask if the Minister is satisfied that a person cannot be imprisoned because he insists on having his name in Irish on any document.  Whether it is in <Col N="1024" /> respect of a parking fine or anything else?  We were a bit uneasy about this man being imprisoned when he protested very vehemently.  The fact was that he insisted upon the charge being made in Irish and his name being written in Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first time that Mr. Ó Lúbhlaí made any protest was at the very final stage of the legal procedure, on the execution of the warrant.  He had received two documents earlier than that, the form C.P. 62 drawing his attention to the illegal parking and subsequently a summons asking him to attend at the district court.  He ignored both of those documents.  If he had chosen to make his protest at either of those stages the matter could have been rectified.  Without in any way taking from his right to have his name in Irish at all stages, he brought a lot of this on his own head by not taking the necessary steps when he got the first and second documents.</P>

      <P>I would not think so but, as I said, I am not answerable for what goes on in motor registration offices.  The only reason I can suggest why this happened was that the person in question, being a local, may have been known locally under the two names and some person entering the name into a second book may have used one of the alternative versions of his name.  It was unfortunate that the wrong version of the name came to the Garda but that is something over which I have no control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned last evening we were dealing with this section of the Bill.  Under the Bill as it stands at present, a vacancy in a local authority can be filled by an order of the court or by casual vacancy by co-option.  Only when the number declared to be validly elected is less than the quorum can a new election be held.  I want to put it to the Minister that a council constituency comprises a number of electoral areas.  For instance, there could be four electoral areas, each electing seven or eight councillors&mdash;say, eight with a 32-member council in all.  What I am suggesting to the Minister is that surely if in one of these electoral areas a majority of the councillors elected &mdash;say, five in the case of an eight-member electoral area&mdash;are subsequently disqualified from membership a new election should be held.  It seems extraordinary that a new election shall be held only if there is less than a quorum of qualified members remaining on the council and that, in such circumstances, a new election has to be held in every electoral area. One could deem that reasonable on most counts.  Where an election in one electoral area&mdash;subsequent to a court order&mdash;resulted in the disqualification of a majority of the members elected, why not provide in the Bill in such circumstances that a new election be held?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, this is simply a re-enactment of the 1941 legislation. The position is that the only occasion on which a new election will <Col N="1029" /> have to be held is if there is not a quorum remaining.  If there is a quorum remaining, then vacancies are filled in the normal way of casual vacancies.  Therefore, it is not proposed to have a special election for one electoral district.  It never was the practice and I do not think anything has occurred which would encourage the House to change that.  It is most unusual.  As a matter of fact, I cannot bring any circumstances immediately to mind in which everybody in an electoral area would be disqualified. It has never happened and provision is made for the situation if there is not a quorum remaining.  But, apart from that, the situation is that people are co-opted to replace them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is using as the argument, against what I am suggesting, that it has never happened. I would suggest that the same argument could be used against the provisions of this section because I am not aware of such a large number of councillors being disqualified from membership as to leave a situation in which a quorum did not exist on the local council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But existing legislation lays that down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems always to adopt the position that if something is in existing legislation, that it is gospel and can never be improved.  What we are working on here are suggestions on how to improve legislation.  Surely, with time, the Minister's mind must be opened to further improvements of existing legislation.  To say that because it is in existing legislation and that, therefore, it is perfect and need not be changed is something I could not accept.  All of these provisions, when they come before the House, are open to full critical examination.  If there are reasonable suggestions put forward as to why they should be changed or improved, then I think we are being reasonable in doing that. But to say that because what I suggested earlier may never have happened in the Minister's memory and, for that reason, what we are asking should not be seriously considered <Col N="1030" /> for inclusion in the Bill is not at all acceptable to my mind.  I would say to the Minister that the same argument could be used by me against the inclusion of this section because what this section is covering has, to my memory and probably also the Minister's, never occurred either&mdash; where all the members were disqualified&mdash;so many members were disqualified that there was not a quorum remaining on the council. Surely the Minister accepts that four or five separate elections are held to arrive at a situation where one has a complete complement of elected councillors, there being a differing number of electoral areas comprising each county council constituency.  If, in one of these electoral areas, there are eight members to be elected and subsequent to the election a petition is brought before the court and an order made by the court disqualifying five of those persons, a majority of them, surely, in such circumstances, one could not deem the election held to have been a fair and proper one and that the right thing to do, in such circumstances, would be to order that a new election be held.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting that this be included in the Bill only in circumstances where the court did not direct the filling of those five vacancies with specified persons.  Obviously, the specified persons in such cases would be persons deemed by the court to be entitled to election had not those other persons been elected, probably those next in line on the ballot paper on the count, those with the next largest number of votes as deemed by the court.  I think that the suggestion is reasonable and should receive serious consideration by the Minister.  The circumstances with which the section is trying to deal would be of a much more hypothetical nature than the one I am suggesting.  We are fully justified in asking that a provision be included here to cause a new election to be held if a majority of the elected members in any electoral area are subsequently disqualified and the court does not declare any specified persons to fill those five vacancies.</P>

No matter what their political affiliations we all know it is not unusual to find all of them travelling together if they have any distance to go.

Deputy Lalor says that this section decides there should be a new election. It does.  Therefore this matter does not arise on this section at all.  I am trying to follow Deputy Molloy's line, which is that it would be better in any case where a whole group out of an area had been disqualified that there should be a new election.  I do not think that is right and I have said that if they were killed in an accident there would not be a new election. This section does not deal with this sort of thing at all.  It simply deals with where there is no quorum.  If there is no quorum there must be a new election.  Deputy Lalor is right there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the example the Minister has given as being a basis for refuting my argument. We do not dispute the right of a council to fill vacancies occurring due to death of members, whether it is one, five or six, by co-option.  Those are what are called casual vacancies in the Acts.  What we are referring to is a vacancy which is caused by an order of the court arising out of a petition which seeks to disqualify certain members because in the opinion of the petitioner and subsequently in the opinion of the court those persons were not lawfully elected to that council at all.  Where a majority of the elected councillors in an electoral area have been disqualified the electorate who voted in that area should be given an opportunity of filling the vacancies through a new election.</P>
      <P>I am not interested in what is in the present law or what is not.  I am interested in what is not in this Bill, and this is our opportunity to bring the facts before the Minister.  I am suggesting that in such circumstances, in order to ensure that democracy operates in a true fashion and that the wishes of the electorate in an area are reflected in the persons who sit on the council to represent them, a new election must be held.</P>

First, <Col N="1033" /> the court can decide to have the runners-up deemed to be elected but if five are disqualified and there are only four runners-up the court cannot decide to have the runners-up deemed elected.  There are then the other two methods.  There is the method of co-option to fill casual vacancies.  I agree with the Minister that if five councillors are killed in an accident this is how the vacancies are filled.  This does not apply here.  This arises out of illegal practices.  The only solution I can see is the third one, the method put forward by Deputy Molloy.  It is the only logical, reasoned method of doing it.  I suggest when something happens such as the case described by Deputy Molloy the only sensible way of dealing with it is to give the electors of that area the opportunity of a new election.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy said that there would be four areas in a 32-member council, four eights.  What Deputy Molloy is saying now is that if a majority of those in an area were not properly elected there should be a new election?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the quorum is ten or 12 and there is a group of eight who have been legally elected, just because there is not a quorum would the eight councillors in that particular area have to go before the people again even though they were all legally elected?  In the case which Deputy Molloy is putting up now he is only referring to an area where more than half of them would be illegally elected.  At the present moment a quorum would put the whole council out.  Even though one area was properly elected the whole council of 32 would have to go out to be re-elected.  That is not fair.  If an election is carried out properly in one area and nobody is disqualified, it should stand.  If the majority of them are disqualified in any particular area there should be a new election there. I would like clarification on the other matter because it would be grossly unfair on the quorum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The law as it has stood right down the years states that <Col N="1034" /> where there is a quorum they can co-opt.  Deputy Molloy takes one particular area and says : &ldquo;Suppose in one area everybody has been disqualified and not replaced, why should there not be another election for that electoral area?&rdquo; The position about it is this.  Deputy Cunningham spoke about only four being left.  It does not matter if there is any one at all left.  If only the number who went up got elected it makes no difference because they are not being replaced by the court so the council would not be confined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point of this section is that where they are not replaced by the court then the council have the right to co-opt if there is a quorum left.  If there is only one area disqualified then there would be a quorum left and they would not be confined to those who contested the election.  In fact, if they needed people outside and they decided to have them they would co-opt them.  Local authorities, as I know them down the years, have certain rules.  One of the things they have carried out very fairly&mdash;there may be exceptions I am not aware of&mdash;is that, if a man or a woman, who has been elected to represent one particular group or party, goes out, that person is replaced.</P>

I want to let all of us have the fullest discussion on this but we are in the position that there has not been since 1961 any court of petition.  I should like to ensure that there is a court before the local elections on the 18th June.  The only way we can do that is if we are able to get this Bill through this House today and through the Seanad tomorrow. If not, we will be late.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a personal explanation.  The situation is that I made reference to a Press conference which the Minister is to have on Friday.  I think (1) to line up a Press conference without the Bill being through the House is an insult to this House; and (2) the Minister wants to <Col N="1036" /> rush this Bill through the House unquestioned so that he, with the assistance of the Government Information Bureau, can get his ideas about these new regulations across to the Press and not give the Opposition a chance to put their views across.  We are the people who have the practical experience of operating at local election level. We know what many of the snags are. The Minister does not want to give us the opportunity of having a straightforward discussion on it.  He is in a great hurry now.</P>
      <P>My information, as Whip for the Opposition, is that this business was ordered for yesterday.  We could have had a debate on it from 4 O'clock until 10.30 p.m.  This was curbed yesterday for governmental reasons. Three and a half hours were taken off the time yesterday and now the Minister comes along and tells us this Bill must be through today.  If the Minister gives us an explanation of the reasons for this, it will be acceptable to us.  I believe the Minister is going round in a circle on this section.  Deputy Molloy cited the case of a particular electoral area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We must get back now to the section.  There should be no further reference to extraneous matters.  We must get back to section 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the section.  The situation is that under section 14 (1) (b) the court can decide that they are unable to determine the correct result of an election.  I presume that deals with a particular election in a particular electoral area.  For example, in a particular electoral area which returns say, seven seats to a county council, the court can come to a decision and declare, the election void.  Now we are looking for the way to make the replacements.  In view of the fact that the court have decided they are unable to give a result of that election, those seven vacancies have to be filled.  The case Deputy Molloy is making is that those seven vacancies should not be filled as casual vacancies.  A provision should be included to state that there should be a fresh election in that particular electoral area to elect the seven <Col N="1037" /> councillors.  If there are four electoral areas, we all know of cases where in three of them you could have an overall majority of one party as against another.  They could actually co-opt the seven people from their own party to that electoral area.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that this is no change from previous legislation, that it is something we have inherited. If it has been there for a long time we now have a new Bill, we have a collection of 15 geniuses in a new Government and surely they should be able to come up with an amended Bill which could cater for that type of eventuality.  The Minister says a lot of things have never happened.  Thank God, the electoral system in this country, a system that is much criticised, is straightforwardly operated in a democratic fashion and we have very few electoral abuses.  I am thinking specifically of abuses creeping in in a particular area in the next election and having a situation in which the court decides under section 14 (1)(b) that it is unable to determine the correct result; in that situation it would be very wrong for the other 17, 18 or 19 councillors to have the right to co-opt seven members.  The electors in that area would not have any opportunity of sending in the six or seven people whom they would like to see elected and Deputy Molloy is quite justified in making the point he has been making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The eventuality the Minister suggests is that the court might deem such a number of elected councillors to be disqualified from membership of a local authority as to leave less than a quorum on the council. Suppose the total number of elected councillors was 33 and 23 councillors were disqualified by the court, then, and only then, would the Minister's provision in this section come into operation because there would be less than a quorum and there would have to be a new election. I suggest the possibility of that ever happening is much more remote than the possibility of what I suggest happening, but the Minister casts that aside on the grounds that what I suggest is most unlikely to happen.  Some electoral areas are as small as four members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where four members are elected and three are subsequently deemed to be disqualified through an order of the court, following a petition, I do not see any justice in allowing the remaining member to fill the three vacancies by co-opting other members.  This is a direct insult to the electorate in the area and I do not see how the Minister could claim in such circumstances that democracy was operating or seen to be operating. Remember, in order to bring a petition, one must do so within 28 days of the result of the election being announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The petition is brought at the commencement of the term of life of the council and, if the term is five years, this petition is brought in the early weeks and months of the life of the council, and the Minister is suggesting that the other councillor should have the right and the authority to co-opt three members to fill the three vacancies in the particular area.  He is suggesting the three co-opted members would represent the electorate in that area for 5 years.  The persons co-opted might not reside in the electoral <Col N="1041" /> area; they might come from a district 50 or 60 miles away.  In effect the electoral area can be seriously disenfranchised and lose its representation on the council through the operation of the system the Minister wants us to allow.</P>
    <P>We do not agree with that system. We consider it is most undemocratic and we are making an appeal to the Minister, who has taken time on a number of occasions to tell us how urgent it is that he should have the Bill by a certain date.  We would point out that we were not the cause of the Bill being introduced at the last minute, nor were we the cause of the postponement of the debate yesterday evening to allow for a debate on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works, for which there was no urgency whatever. We could have debated the remaining provisions of the Bill from 7 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.  More than likely we would have cleared it had we got some indication from the Minister that he was prepared to listen to and to act on our reasoned arguments.  As the leading spokesman on this side of the House in this debate, I put it to the Minister that if he gives us some indication he is prepared to accept the points we are making he will not be long delayed in the House.  However if he persists in adopting a stubborn, not-an-inch attitude, he is leaving us no option but to take further time to explain our points in greater detail so that he may understand exactly what we are asking him to do.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give us some indication that he accepts we are making a valid point, that the situation which could arise in the circumstances I have set out could be serious.  We accept the Minister would require time to introduce some changes to correct the situation.  We do not accept as a valid argument that because a point we are discussing was not included in previous legislation consequently there is no need for it, especially when we remember that the previous legislation about which the Minister spoke is the Municipal Elections (Corruption and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884, and the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882.  We should like the House to adopt legislation <Col N="1042" /> that would fit the circumstances of 1974.</P>

In 1961 the way in which petitions were carried out was ruled to be wrong and from then to date there has been no system of petition whatever.  I am trying to get this measure through now. While I agree there is a valid argument in that we could have spent more time on this yesterday, that is the only part of the argument that is valid.  We are dealing with section 16 but what we are discussing has no relevance to it.  The item we are talking about deals only with a situation where there is no quorum.  The Deputy is making a case for amendment where there is a quorum and where co-options are taking place in a certain way.  Section 16 deals with a situation where there is no quorum, good, bad or indifferent.  I suggest what the Deputy has said is out of order and I do not propose to pursue it further.</P>

      <P>I should like to point <Col N="1043" /> out why and how the suggestion is relevant.  Section 16 is the only section that provides for a new election. All the other sections provide for a filling of the post by the court, by a declaration that a specified person be deemed the elected person in place of the individual who is disqualified, or provide for the filling of the vacancy by co-option.  Section 16 is the only section that deals with the filling of the vacancy by an election.  Am I correct in this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to consider the inclusion in the Bill of a provision that where all members, or a majority of the members, in an electoral area are deemed to be disqualified, in such circumstances there shall be a new election. Under section 16 the only time a new election can be held is when there is less than a quorum on the old council.  I suggest it is granting less than full democracy to people when their councillors can be deemed disqualified and their places filled by co-option.  As we know from practical experience, the co-options could involve persons who are not residing in the electoral area concerned, who may have no knowledge of the problems of that area, or who may not know any of the people in the electoral area.  An anomalous situation could be created because of the Minister's provisions.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister, as a practical politician, to accept what I am suggesting could happen.  I am asking him to accept my proposition that it should not be allowed to happen.  I am also asking him to accept that now is the only time when he or the House can provide against such an eventuality. Finally I am asking him to concede that it should be done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not arise on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the place to legislate and not anywhere else.  It is our duty to ensure that legislation passed by this House has as few flaws as possible.  In this section there is a definite flaw.  What the Minister is providing for is that, if an election in all the county council electoral areas of a county is declared illegal, a large number of those elected are declared to be illegally elected and are therefore disqualified, this leaves a situation where there is less than a quorum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> We are trying to ensure that the same would apply to each individual electoral area.  Take the case of Donegal where there are five electoral areas.  If there is illegality in each one of them and certain councillors elected in each electoral area are disqualified and there is less than a quorum, then the Minister is providing for a new election.  That is fair enough.  We are not quarrelling with that.  We agree that is the correct procedure. If it arises that in one electoral area the overall situation covered by this exists and all councillors elected are disqualified, or a majority of them are disqualified, then the Minister is denying the people of that electoral area the right to remedy something for which they were not responsible.</P>
    <P>We are saying that, if in an electoral area the situation described by Deputy Molloy arises, the wrong way to remedy it is by co-option and the right way to do it is as has been advocated, suggested and pleaded by Deputy Molloy: an election in that particular electoral area.  I do not want to see legislation go through this House which can and will give rise to a situation in which, after the council elections on 18th June, there may be an electoral area where people who genuinely set out to do their national and local duty to elect their own representatives are subsequently deprived of that right.  Unless the Minister agrees to what Deputy Molloy has suggested, he is asking the representatives of the electors in the other parts of the county, in the other electoral areas outside this electoral area, to decide who should represent the electors and the people generally of that electoral area for the next five years or, as has been the case since the last council elections, the next seven years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation envisaged in section 16 is so hypothetical that I am sure it will never arise.  In section 16 the Minister is legislating for a situation which is very unlikely to arise.  In the case of a county like Donegal which has five electoral areas, I do not think electoral illegalities would be so widespread as to create a situation in each of those five electoral areas which would result in the number legally elected in that county council being less than a quorum which, I understand, is one-third of the members: 30 plus one; 11.  Although it may never happen he is right to legislate for it as he is doing in section 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not doing it in section 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not opposing that although it is fairly unlikely to happen.  It is more likely that, in a county where there are five electoral areas, you could have that situation in miniature.  Take, for instance, an electoral area where there are four councillors and three of them are disqualified by the court, or even four of them.  I admit it is not necessary that there should be a quorum in that one electoral area.  But sub-committees could be set up or an area roads committee and there would have to be a quorum.  There could be county development team operations in the area.  However, I will not go into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is section 15, as Deputy Cunningham has suddenly realised.</P>

    <Col N="1047" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to reinforce the argument.  This is the only place we can legislate and this House should not pass a Bill which would provide that the people of that electoral area would be dependent on the grace and goodwill of those elected by the electors in the other electoral areas.  I should not like the people in that area to be dependent on my party or any other party to carry out a co-option which would exactly represent the decision of the electorate and which was found to be illegal through no fault of the electors.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not provided in the Bill that if the situation described by Deputy Molloy arises in any electoral division the people to be co-opted will have exactly the same representation from a party point of view as was given by the electorate.  Perhaps it would be an improvement if he would include that in the Bill, but I would not press it too far.  He said it happens, but there is no legal provision that it should happen.  Therefore, it is not binding and if it does not happen there is no way of remedying it.  It does not happen in a very large number of counties. The tidiest and best method of dealing with it is that put forward, propounded and explained by Deputy Molloy, and as a legislative body this House would be doing the right thing in providing for this.</P>

      <P>I did not hear it at first. I heard it later on, coming towards the end of the argument, but I will not argue over that.  Suppose Deputy Cunningham and one of his friends in his own party were the first two elected out of five and it was subsequently decided by a court that the other three&mdash;the majority&mdash;were not properly elected and the court did not decide who should replace them, does Deputy Cunningham suggest that there should be an election in that area for all five seats?</P>

      <P>The whole stake of five seats.  Deputy Cunningham agrees that he should contest the seat which he has already fairly won and his friend should contest the seat he has also fairly won.  Lest there be any doubt, I am proposing that, since there is at present no appeal court to which a petition can be submitted under the electoral law, one should be made possible under this legislation. The appeal court set up under the 1941 Act was declared illegal in 1961 and since then there has been no such court, and I do not think we should allow that situation to continue. In drawing up this Bill I have used the sections of the 1941 Act which I considered were ample to deal with the situation and this is one of them.  What has been suggested here is that a whole new set of circumstances should be thought up.  If it is done in this way we should have a by-election or an election for a particular electoral division with three, four or five seats and if all, or the majority of the members elected are declared to be invalidly elected, we should have an election even though some of them have been properly <Col N="1050" /> elected.  They should all have to throw in their lot&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think the situation should arise at all.  I do not think there should be any such election.  If the council, through the years, had the right to co-opt, as section 15 of the Bill says we have, we should stick to that.  The situation is amply provided for under section 15 and I see no reason why we should change the law because of a peculiar sort of thinking which has arisen here.</P>
      <P>I should like to advise Deputy Molloy that this would mean not alone changing part of the Bill which has already been passed through the Committee Stage but would also mean that certain other portions of the Bill would have to be drastically altered.

What I do consider peculiar thinking&mdash;to use the Minister's own words&mdash;is for the Minister to say that he disagrees with our proposal that there should be a new election in an electoral area if all, or a majority of the members elected are subsequently deemed to have been improperly and unlawfully elected.</P>

I have pointed out to the Minister that the persons co-opted could come from an area far-removed in the county from the area for which the disqualified people had been elected.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Galway County Council consists of a number of electoral areas.  The smallest area elects four councillors and the largest nine members.  Other areas elect five <Col N="1054" /> or seven members.  There are various sizes of electoral areas electing various numbers of councillors.  Connemara returns four.  If following an election a petition was brought before the court and it was decided that three of those people had been elected through some means which the court deemed unlawful, we say that the vacancies thus created should be filled by a new election in that electoral area where more than a majority has been disqualified. The Minister is saying that, where three out of four are so elected, those three places can be filled by co-option. That is not satisfactory.  It would lead to a situation where the persons co-opted to fill those three vacancies could come from a place 60 or 80 miles away in the area of Connemara about which I am talking. They would have no knowledge of the problems of the area and might never have visited that area except on holiday. They might know nothing about it.</P>
      <P>This is not democracy.  It is not local government.  It does not give power to the people.  It does not give representation on the local councils to the people.  It is defranchising these people.  It is the same as telling them that in the event of such a situation occurring they are not entitled to vote again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the Minister is satisfied that three people, one from Gort, one from Loughrea and one from Ballinasloe could represent the community in the Connemara electoral area which area, as the <Col N="1055" /> Minister may not know, consists of a community that is approximately 50 per cent Irish-speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the Deputy's poor opinion of the Galway county councillors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no logic in that question because I would not know who the county councillors might be following an election.  Consequently it would be hypothetical on my part to express an opinion in relation to a council that did not exist.  All I am saying is what they could do, that we should anticipate loopholes of this kind and that we should legislate to avoid the position that people in such an area as the one to which I am referring might be left without any representation. The most distressing feature of this whole question is that this disenfranchising, this depriving of the people of their representatives, must according to the terms of this Bill occur in the early months of the council.  It is more than likely that that is the time when it would occur because petitions would have to be brought in the first place within 28 days of the result of the council election.</P>
      <P>There could be a situation in which three strangers to an area could be co-opted to represent an area such as the Connemara electoral area for a period of five years and they would have to be tolerated by the people in that area for that entire period.  Apart from the question of the lack of representation for the people in any such area there is also the counter-effect of such a situation, that is, the over-representation of other areas.  As a member of a county council I have experience of situations where expenditure of money was brought before a meeting by the manager but where, by the votes of those members present a decision was made as to whether certain moneys would be spent.  Therefore, one can understand how an area such as the Connemara electoral area would be left without any support at times when financial matters were being discussed at county council meetings.  I would deplore such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> What is amazing about this debate is that the Minister indicates his preparedness to accept that sort of situation and that he asks the House to allow it to continue.  I appeal to him to be reasonable and to accept the validity of my argument.  I hope he will give us some indication of his intention to make the changes that are necessary to avoid the type of situation I have envisaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the Buncrana county council area and the Buncrana urban area.  We shall begin with the urban area in respect of which the Minister is legislating in section 16.  There are nine seats on the Buncrana Urban Council and if after the June election the validity of the election is queried in court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That could not happen unless this Bill were passed.  It could not have happened since 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would cease interrupting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to make the Bill a better one and this is the place in which to do that.  If, say, six of the nine urban councillors in Buncrana should be deemed after being elected to be disqualified, the Minister would order a new election in that area.  This is the provision of section 16.  The Minister is seeking to legislate in such a way as to provide that in the event of there not being a quorum, in other words if <Col N="1057" /> only three members are elected legally and the others are disqualified, there must be a new election.</P>
      <P>In the Buncrana county electoral area there are six seats but, say, because of electoral abuse, four members who were elected are deemed to be disqualified, those four seats would be filled not by the people who on the 18th June had done their national and local duty, but by councillors elected in areas as far away as 100 miles&mdash;for example, in Bundoran or Killybegs.  I am sure that the councillors in those areas would not wish to interpret the decision of the people who elected the four people who had been disqualified.  Of course, the electorate in the urban area would be the electorate also of county councillors in the county electoral area.  Therefore on the one hand the electors of Buncrana would be given an opportunity of electing urban councillors after the disqualification of a number of members but the people of that town would not be given the opportunity of electing replacements for county councillors.</P>
      <P>The whole situation is illogical.  It is unreasonable and is not fair.  All the Minister has to do is to make provision to cover this very valid point.  If this is not done now I do not know when it could be done but, as it is here, it would give rise to grievances, because the situation which is sought to be remedied in section 16 would happen less frequently in local elections than would the situation which we have described could happen in one electoral area and which is unlikely to happen in all of the electoral areas throughout a county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Outside the House, the Minister is at all times a reasonable man.  When he comes in here he undergoes a change of personality and must oppose everything that Fianna Fáil put forward.  To adopt an attitude of fairness is the <i>sine qua non</i> of this whole operation.  Supposing there are four or five people elected in an electoral area and they are deemed to be ineligibly elected for some reason, the Minister proposes <Col N="1058" /> that they be replaced by a system of co-option, I presume, in the same ratio of party representation as happened in the invalid election. Am I right about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision for that in the Bill or any Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that that would be the spirit of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we do in County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>We do that also in County Cork.  But how do we know that that might have been the ratio prevailing if the election had been conducted in the proper fashion? That kind of representation may not have emerged.  Suppose Fianna Fáil got two seats, Fine Gael two and Labour got one seat in the invalid election, how can we decide that that would have been the ratio had the election been conducted properly?</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to act fairly, he must consider having another election in that electoral area.  I know that this will present difficulty. I can understand the time and the technical difficulties presented for this type of amendment to be put in at this stage.  As I said before, it is not alone the Minister who is responsible for legislation passing through the House, but it is the responsibility of every Member.  If we pass shoddy or loose legislation, it is not alone a reflection on the Minister but it is also a reflection on all of us for not at least attempting to tighten up and bring in proper legislation.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is reasonable, I do not think that he can deny the legitimacy of the case put forward from this side of the House.  Co-option is a very handy, easy and simple way of filling a vacancy.  Where there are a number of vacancies and they are being filled in the ratio of an invalid election, we are then treading on very dangerous ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is a Member of a Government which preaches local representation, open government and accessibility to public representatives <Col N="1059" /> at all times.  Yet by this Bill he could be denying to a certain section of the people the right to elect their own members and in the ratio that they so determine.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any political kudos for the Minister and our side to have the type of argument we have been having here all evening.  If I were in the Minister's place I would be very amenable to this type of amendment.  Unless he wants to be accused afterwards of acting in a biased fashion, he will have to ensure in this section that fair representation occurs.  While he may have been a member of a county council&mdash;I was also a member of a county council&mdash; which acted in the main fairly, and allocated various positions in proportion to party representations, we know of other county councils where this did not happen.  It is to preserve that type of democracy that we are asking the Minister seriously to consider the amendment put forward by Deputy Molloy.</P>
    <P>I cannot fathom the reason for the Minister's opposition.  He is a politician and must realise that elections are always the fairest and the best way of hearing the proper voice and wishes of the people.  If we are to have this system of co-option where members can be co-opted so far away from the electoral area concerned, and who have absolutely no interest or ambition to serve the people in that area, we are taking a very serious retrograde step in relation to the democratic set-up here.  There is no excuse for the Minister saying that this has not occurred since 1941. There are many things which did not occur since 1941 but that does not mean that they will not occur again. The Minister, therefore, should give serious consideration to our amendment.</P>
    <P>My main feeling in this regard is one of fairness, of proper representation, and of the ability of every section and every member of our community to exercise the franchise in a proper manner.  If he insists on going ahead with the co-option idea he will be doing a very serious disservice. <Col N="1060" /> Perhaps the Minister has good reasons for not doing this.  Perhaps he is under pressure from the Government or his own party not to change a line.  Perhaps he is of the opinion that anything put forward from this side of the House should not be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me interrupt the Deputy, please.  I am not anxious to hold up this Bill.  I do not believe the amendment suggested is required.  As a matter of fact, I am not quite clear how it could be done but I am prepared to consider this matter and see if I can get an amendment before Report Stage.  I do not like to do something which might not be necessary. In a brief discussion I had off the record with Deputy Molloy we cleared more points than we did in the last couple of hours across the floor.  I am sure there is a moral in that about Committee Stages.  I am very anxious to help if I can.  Because of what the Deputy said, I feel he has a genuine fear which I did not appreciate.  I said that I could not see it happening but he said it could happen in his county.</P>
      <P>As far as the exact wording is concerned, it will be very difficult to ensure that it does exactly what Deputy Molloy and his colleagues feel should be done.  Perhaps Deputy Molloy would be prepared to say what amendment he wants because if we put down an amendment now and on Report Stage he says that that is not what he wants, he can appreciate the difficulty there would be.  I would like to meet him on this point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has asked us to give him time to consider how he can put down an amendment and he suggested it might not be as simple as it looks. I should like to cite a precedent to him on a Bill which I had before the House when I was Minister for Local <Col N="1061" /> Government.  During the course of the debate a point was made by a Fine Gael Deputy and I accepted in my own mind that he had a valid argument and that my Bill as it stood did not meet the point he was making. I was prepared to withdraw from the House to enable consideration to be given to an amendment to meet the point made.</P>

      <P>There is just one point of clarification I should like to mention. The section states:</P>
      <P>Where a local election is not questioned by a petition within the period of twelve months beginning on the day on which the result is declared, as on and from the expiration of that period the election shall not be questioned on any grounds and the election shall be deemed to be valid for all purposes.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to section 4 which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  A petition may be presented by any person who has reached the age of eighteen years and shall be presented by being lodged in the office of the county registrar for the county in which is situate the principal office of the local <Col N="1063" /> authority to which the petition relates.</P>
    <P>(2) Subject to subsection (3) of this section, a petition shall not be presented save within the twenty-eight days next after the result of the election is declared.</P>
    <P>If in section 4 it is specified that such a petition must be made in 28 days, why is a period of 12 months mentioned in section 18?</P>

      <P>Section 19(2) of the Bill provides that a witness may not be excused from answering on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate him or on grounds of privilege.  This provision simply repeats the provision which was contained in the former law relating to local election petitions.  A similar provision is contained in the law relating to parliamentary election petitions.  The Referendum Act, 1942, also has a similar provision in relation to referendum petitions.</P>
      <P>It is not correct, therefore, to say that we are introducing a new concept into our law.  What the section does, in fact, is to repeat a provision which has always been a feature of the law relating to petitions.  Neither is it correct to say that it is an old, out-dated provision which has been copied from an enactment passed in the last century.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister to look into and see if it was necessary to include such stringent provisions in this Bill because is seems to be in conflict with what is accepted in ordinary law.  Whether it is contained in a previous enactment holds no great sway on this side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in 1942.  It should be noted that the section contains a built-in protection for a witness in such a situation.  If the court is satisfied that he has answered truly he will be entitled to receive a certificate from the court and his answer cannot then be admitted as evidence against him in any civil or criminal proceedings.  The only exception to this is criminal proceedings for perjury in respect of the evidence itself, in other words, if it turns out that he did not, in fact, answer truly.</P>
      <P>It should be emphasised that the witness is entitled to this protective certificate as of right.  He is not, therefore, in effect being required to incriminate himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better take it subsection by subsection.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>(1)  The court shall be entitled of its own volition, at any time during the trial of a petition, to direct that a particular person shall be brought before the court and shall give evidence at the trial, and where the court so directs the costs of bringing the person before the court (including any moneys payable to him as witness's expenses) shall be regarded as part of the costs of the petition.</P>
      <P>I am informed this is most unusual in ordinary law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am now asking is why it is included in this Bill. I am advised its inclusion seems rather harsh and Draconian.  In ordinary law this is an unusual provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told it is very important that the Bill should contain a provision of this kind in order to <Col N="1065" /> assist the court in its task of determining the matter at issue in the petition and ascertaining the correct result of the election.  It is obviously very important in a democracy that elections should be free from any shadow of doubt or suspicion.</P>
      <P>The Deputy would agree that it is right to give the court this assistance particularly when there is no new principle involved.  The witness will be fully protected by the certificate of the court. I would not agree at all that is Draconian, or that it is new, or that there is anything unusual about it.  If the evidence is given truthfully the certificate issued prevents the witness from being prosecuted.  If the witness does not give truthful evidence he can be prosecuted for swearing false evidence and that can happen in any court.  There is nothing unusual or wrong about this.  We checked with the Attorney General's office and we were informed that it was the correct wording for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from subsection (2) (b) of this section that what a person says at the trial of a petition would not be privileged and that he could be sued in a civil court for slander.  I am suggesting to the Minister that that might be deemed to be an undesirable situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not; it is the direct opposite.  The subsection states:</P>
      <P>An answer by a witness who has received such a certificate to a question put at the trial of a petition shall not, except in the case of any criminal proceeding for perjury in respect of the evidence, be in any proceeding, civil or criminal, admissible in evidence against him.</P>
      <P>That in fact means the direct opposite to what Deputy Molloy has said.  The only time it can be used against him is if he is being tried for perjury as a result of the evidence he has given.  In any other case the evidence which he gave cannot be used against him.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to check on that matter.  It seems remarkable that we go out of our way to ensure the fullest possible evidence but, having given that evidence a person could, subsequently, be prosecuted even though his own evidence cannot be used against him.  It appears that he can be challenged in another court.  The Minister stated that once a witness obtains a certificate, irrespective of how guilty he is, he cannot be prosecuted and that sounds rather peculiar to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That it not quite correct. The witness either gives true or false evidence.  If he gives true evidence he can be prosecuted but the evidence he has given cannot be used against him because he has a certificate to certify that his evidence was accepted as true evidence.  That is as it should be.  If a witness gives false evidence that is his funeral.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be noted that the section has a built in protection for a witness in such a situation.  If the court is satisfied that he has answered truthfully he will be entitled to receive a certificate from the court and his answer cannot be admitted as evidence against him in any civil or criminal proceedings.  The section assumes that he is open to criminal or civil proceedings but the evidence he gives cannot be used against him and he has a certificate to that effect.  It does not give him <Col N="1067" /> complete immunity but his evidence will not be acceptable in the court because he has obtained this certificate. The witness is entitled to this protection as a right and he is, therefore, not being required to incriminate himself.</P>
      <P>The query is whether a witness, by giving evidence which he was required to give, would incriminate himself and my reply is, no.  He cannot incriminate himself.  If he tells the truth he obtains a certificate saying that the evidence which he gave cannot be used but if he tells an untruth he can be prosecuted for perjury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The court has to decide whether the evidence given is truthful and the court will not issue a certificate if it is not satisfied that the evidence is truthful.  That is the opinion of the court and, no human being being perfect, the court can only give the best decision of which they are capable.</P>
      <P>If evidence which the court was prepared to accept as truthful from a witness who was obliged to appear before this petition court had slanderous implications for an individual in the community who was so irate at the statements made that he subsequently decided to bring a civil case against the petitioner for slander, how would he succeed or how would the case get off the ground if the evidence given at the petition court was deemed privileged and truthful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something on which I would not like to comment because what I would be asked to do if I were to decide on that matter is whether or not the court was competent to decide if the evidence given was true or false.  We must accept that the evidence is either true or false.  If it is false I imagine that in every case proceedings will be taken against the person for perjury.  There can be no protection for him against that.  If the evidence is accepted as true, and it does annoy people as it almost certainly would it is possible that people would attempt to sue a witness for slander or defamation of character.  If his <Col N="1068" /> evidence was accepted by the court as being true he would receive a certificate to cover him.  We must accept that the court is competent in each case in which they say the evidence is true or false before the certificate is issued.</P>
      <P>It is possible that somebody, even though he did not tell the truth, would be protected but this is highly unlikely. I do not think there is anything we can do at this stage and I feel that adequate precaution is being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all subscribe to the principle that all citizens are equal before the law and we are guaranteed that under our constitution. However, I question how a citizen could be deemed to be treated equally by the law if a witness in a petition court uttered slanderous remarks against him and the court subsequently deemed these remarks to be true by issuing a certificate of truth but he has no recourse in law against such slanderous statements if this person is protected by this privileged certificate.  We are creating a situation exactly similar to that in this House in which any statements uttered by a Dáil Deputy in the course of debates here are under privilege.  I was not aware that such a privilege was extended, in the case of slander, to anybody else outside the House.  I am referring only to slander.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is saying is that the court would have issued a certificate to a person who had sworn falsely.  This is the only way it would happen, if they had been so convincing that what they said was accepted.  It is a thousand to one against that sort of situation arising.  I would not like to say it could never arise, but I believe the protection given is necessary and adequate.  If this protection were not given, it would, perhaps, be unfair to ask a person to go before the court to give evidence, and then the whole question of having such a court at all would break down.  We all want to ensure that the election is run fairly and that undesirable practices are not allowed.  The only way to prevent it is by having a court in which the <Col N="1069" /> matter can be investigated.  We must give protection to the witness who swears truly; if he swears falsely, that is his funeral.</P>

      <P>Most people would be upset if a remark had been made which involved some slander on their character, but a person would be entitled to be doubly upset if not alone a remark was made involving his character but that the person who made it was subsequently given a certificate that he had, in fact, spoken the truth.  It seems to place the person in an invidious position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the law and his right to redeem his character in the eyes of the community. It is a tricky point and one about which I would have serious reservations. The Minister is saying we should accept this action as it is and accept that while what we suggest could happen, there is no way out of it.  I do not know whether that is good law.  We are obliged to pass legislation which could have an effect on a man's character and have repercussions for his family for his lifetime and for generations.  Such a thing could have a greater effect on a person's whole life than stealing £1,000 from him; that he could get over, but slander on a person's character is a most serious thing in many people's minds.  I am not happy about this, and I just record my displeasure at the wording of it.  I think it is undesirable as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Molloy's view on this.  He has dealt with the civil aspect of it, where a third party is deprived of a right.  The Bill also visualises depriving the State of its right, in that a witness who is brought before the court turns out to be guilty of a number of electoral offences.  Maybe this provision is good from the point of view of getting at the truth in relation to a petition, but when a person makes a clean breast of everything and then gets the certificate, it is impossible for the State to use any of the evidence, however incriminating, he has given to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that can be got over by bringing in outside witnesses <Col N="1070" /> afterwards to testify that this person was involved in electoral offences and that he can be criminally charged for doing wrong.  No matter what evidence is presented by the State against this man, a good counsel acting on his behalf can always raise the objection: &ldquo;This man admitted in the petition court that he did this and he was guaranteed under legislation that this could not be used as evidence against him.&rdquo; This provision is too much of an inbuilt protection whereby the Minister, in a civil case is giving away the right of a third party individually and, in a criminal case, giving away the rights of the State and the Attorney General on behalf of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The alternative to this is that the person is not brought in to give evidence and the whole sorry mess cannot be cleared up at all, because the person, if brought in, would incriminate himself.  Unless they are given a guarantee of immunity on their own evidence, they will not come forward.  However, that does not stop them from being prosecuted, but it does mean that the evidence they give in this particular court cannot be used against them.  Either we have this court to deal with witnesses in this way or we have no court.  Maybe the provision is not perfect.  Legislation like this is very difficult, but we are assured by the Attorney General's office that the phraseology is correct and that there is nothing wrong in law; as a matter of fact, that it is the right procedure to adopt.  As I said today, I am not a legal man.  Therefore, I cannot say what the particular points of this are, but Deputy Molloy suggested the last day we should ask the Attorney General's office, and they said: &ldquo;Yes, this is the correct procedure&rdquo; and I think we had better stand by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My request the last day dealt with the power to direct that a person should be brought before the court and obliged to give evidence.  The other point was in regard to subsection (2): &ldquo;...on the ground that the answer thereto may incriminate or tend to incriminate <Col N="1071" /> him or on grounds of privilege.&rdquo; What I was getting at was this obligation to give evidence.  I accept that the Minister does not seem to be able to go any further in explaining the situation of a person by whom a civil case for slander could be brought, because he feels he has been slandered by this privileged evidence.  In the circumstances, I would ask the Minister to get some opinion from the Attorney General's office on the question of slander.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, in fact, asked him and the general advice which I have just mentioned is that this is the correct phraesology.  As far as the question of slander is concerned, there is nothing to prevent the action being taken by somebody outside.  But the evidence which the witness gives at this court cannot be used for the purpose of proving anything outside; in other words, it is not evidence.</P>

      <P>First of all, subsection (1) talks about the costs awarded against a returning officer being paid by the local authority concerned.  Subsection (2) says that where the court is satisfied that the returning officer&mdash; on a sort of personal basis&mdash;has been grossly negligent, the court may make an order against him.  Subsection (3) refers to orders being made&mdash;I presume under subsection (2)&mdash;and costs being awarded against an officer which are paid out of moneys provided by the local authority and so on.  If the order is made for gross negligence by the returning officer under subsection (2), why should the local authority pay it at all?  Subsection (3) provides that if the order is made against the returning officer, arising from his <Col N="1072" /> own personal incapacity, he is supposed to pay the costs himself.  If he is supposed to pay the costs himself, why should subsection (3) arise?  Why should the local authority pay it on his behalf?</P>

      <P>Actually, the reason is quite simple.  On the face of it I thought it to be the same as Deputy Lalor.  But the person may at an early stage have used local authority money to pay certain funds and this is what is recoverable from him in addition to whatever expenses arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whoever the court decides is responsible for the costs is another question.  The court, of its own volition, may decide to refer something to the Supreme Court for clarification on a point of law.  If that clarification is such as can be shown subsequently that it was unnecessary to refer it to the Supreme Court and their decision proves that it was irrelevant as far as the person who is eventually charged with the costs was concerned, why should the cost of that referral fall on a person who, in the <Col N="1073" /> first instance, was not responsible for its referal to the Supreme Court and, in respect of whom the Supreme Court deemed his conduct was in no way involved in the point so referred?</P>

      <P>The court will have the right to decide on the costs themselves.

But the court will decide and, if we agree that the court is ruling fairly, surely this would be a point which would have to be taken into account.  The only reason it is inserted here is to ensure that there will not be a separate way of dealing with these sorts of costs.  The costs of the case, whether at the original petition court or at the High Court, will be the one responsibility.  The court will decide what way the costs will be paid and who will pay them.</P>

The whole lot has been put to <Col N="1074" /> the court and they must make the decision as to how the costs will be paid.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2) to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  An order made under this section shall not exclude an employee who is a member of the administrative staff from the operation of section 21 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his introductory speech and subsequently in a document which the Minister circulated there were proposed orders under section 24 of this Bill.  In other words, he was giving us an indication of the classes of employees of local authorities, of vocational education committees or committees of agriculture who would be allowed to stand for local elections in the future and also specifying those who would not be so allowed.  The Minister proposes that all administrative staff down to but not including the rank of clerical officer and all town clerks shall be excluded.  In excluding certain members of the administrative staff he allows clerical officers and anybody below that grade who is a member of the administrative staff to stand for election.  My amendment would prohibit the inclusion of clerical officers.  The Minister is proposing that rate collectors will not be allowed to stand for local elections. Neither will rent collectors, rate inspectors, rent inspectors, housing welfare officers, means investigation officers and social workers. I should like to make a comparison between the clerical officer and the rate collector.  The Minister proposed to allow a clerical officer to stand for election and to prohibit a rate collector.  I have some difficulty in understanding the logic of the Minister's thinking here.  How can one argue that a clerical officer is <Col N="1076" /> entitled to stand while at the same time a rate collector is not?  On the other hand, if one argues that a rate collector is not entitled to stand why then allow a clerical officer?</P>
    <P>A clerical officer would find himself in a position where there was a real conflict of interests if he were to be elected to a local authority&mdash;a local authority, mark you, of which he is an employee.  He would, if elected, find himself having to serve two masters.  He would have to serve the electorate who elected him to the council to represent their best interests.  As <i>The Farmers' Journal</i> says about being fearlessly on the side of the farmers, any elected councillor is expected to be fearlessly on the side of the electorate.  The electorate would be one of his masters.  The other one would be the county manager and his superior officers in the local authority to whom he would have a duty as an employee.  We in the Fianna Fáil Party have given some thought to this since the Minister circulated these documents.  We would ask him to reconsider his decision in relation to clerical officers. We think this may not be a good thing for local government or for local democracy.  A clerical officer elected to a council would immediately find that he was not an independent person. He would be greatly inhibited in all his actions.  His superior officer, the county manager, would be sitting beside the chairman at the county council meetings and he would be in a very awkward position in pressing the manager to do something when he owed an allegiance to that manager as an employee.  Though there may be some enthusiastic clerical officers who would stand for election I do not imagine there would be very many. If there was one foolish enough to try it and to get elected he would be placing himself in an invidious position. We, as a Parliament, should try to ensure when passing legislation that such invidious situations are not allowed to arise and that such conflicts of interest are not tolerated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come before the House with a long list of grades.  He is <Col N="1077" /> excluding all professional staff, all library staff down to and including the level of assistant librarian, certain officers of fire brigades&mdash;we are in some doubt as to what exactly that means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Chief officer, first officer, second officer, third officer. The people who would be administering it would all be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not catch all that but I take it we could agree to them anyway.  Clerks of works are excluded, inspectors, including inspectors of weights and measures, assistant inspectors and analogous grades.  If they are analogous to those grades we would agree with their exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A rate collector is not to be allowed to stand.  The Minister has said that a clerical officer should be allowed to stand.  We think there is a definite conflict here.  A clerical officer works inside the county council building having daily access to files and in constant touch with other members of the council staff at various levels. He is in a position of authority and privilege and we feel he should be above politics and should not be invited to be biased in his dealings with the public.  If he is to be an elected councillor then he would be less than human if he were not to take advantage of the information available to him as an officer with access to files in the county council building.  The community having dealings with the council would within a short time come to realise that it was a waste of time approaching any of the elected members other than the member who worked in the county council office.  This person's work load would reach such proportions that it would interfere with his work in the county council.  How would he divide his day between people who called to the office to see him as a councillor and the people who called to the office to see him as a clerical officer?  One could go on arguing this but I would ask the Minister to agree to the amendment and exclude all administrative staff.  We accept that what the Minister has done in respect of the other levels of <Col N="1078" /> employee is good but we think it is wrong in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister has excluded a rate collector.  He does not have access to files.  He does not have daily contact within the county council office.  I am now referring, of course, to outside rate collectors.  In some authorities rate collection is done by an officer of the council and certainly I would agree with their exclusion, but in the case of the traditional outdoor rate collector I cannot see the justification for excluding him if the clerical officer is to be included.  He would not have the conflict of interest to the same extent as a clerical officer would.</P>
    <P>The Minister used the argument the last day that a rate collector is involved in the compilation of the register of electors and for that reason it would be improper to allow him to stand for the local elections.  That is not a very solid argument because the rate collector can stand for the Dáil which is a much more important elected office.  It carries much greater responsibilities.  I cannot see how the Minister can argue that a rate collector, because he is involved in the compilation of the register of electors, should not be allowed to stand for the council but that he should and is allowed stand for the Dáil when it is, to all intents and purposes, the same register that is used for both elections.</P>
    <P>I feel a rate collector should be allowed to stand for election to a council and the arguments against allowing clerical officers to stand are very strong.  I appeal to the Minister to amend his proposed order allowing clerical officers to stand and prohibiting rate collectors from standing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Deputy Molloy's amendment states:</P>
      <P>(2)  An order made under this section shall not exclude an employee who is a member of the administrative staff from the operation of section 21 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is too general and too restrictive. It is too general in that one interpretation could include a lot of people and <Col N="1079" /> go much further than I think Deputy Molloy would intend.  It is too restrictive in that it would not apply to professional staff such as engineers, town planners and law agents.  One must be specific in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to accept that.  We talk about workers' democracy.  The only reason I have decided not to include more people is that I do not want to include people who can take decisions.  This is one of the things that caused a certain amount of trouble.  The Deputy is probably aware that at least one member of his own party, who is anxious to be a candidate, has said that he is prepared to take certain steps in order to do so.  I would not like to restrict him from taking those steps in order to qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who he is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might not know who he is.  I believe that clerical officers who have not the same responsibilities should be included. They do not take decisions.  Therefore, they are entitled in my opinion to stand for election and, if elected, to take their seats.  My only regret is that it has not been possible to include people further up the ladder.  It is right that those people should be entitled to go into a council chamber and argue their points.  While there may not be many of them, at the same time if they go in there the county manager, or whoever is in control of them, is not God.  Those clerical officers are entitled to look on the face of those who employ them.  The question of staff will not arise because it is not a matter which can be discussed at council level.  The ordinary day to day matters which clerical officers deal with will not impinge on their duties as public representatives if they get elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as rate collectors are concerned there are good reasons why I would like to say they should not be <Col N="1080" /> appointed.  One concerns the compilation of the register of electors.  Deputy Molloy says they can stand for the Dáil.  That is so but the position is that rate collectors draw up the register of electors and in doing that they can, if they so desire, leave people on and off.  While the majority do not do that, I had the experience&mdash;I am quite sure Deputy Molloy might have a similar experience if he goes through the areas&mdash;of finding a group of people, who are known supporters of mine, not on the register at the last election.  I think there were 11 of them altogether.  Those people were living in the area all their lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate collector could have been a candidate for the Dáil.  He is not excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He could have been but he was not.  At local level this could be very much more important because of the number of votes involved.  The rate collector is in touch with the local authorities and with the local people.  He will be deciding whether or not rates can be demanded now or extended over a period.  Many rate collectors have to do certain things, particularly those working on poundage. The same applies to rent collectors. It is not fair to anybody to allow people who have the right to bestow such a privilege on the public to be members of a local authority. Rate collectors are in all parties, as, indeed, are clerical officers, and it is right to leave rate collectors and rent collectors out and put clerical officers in.  It is at least putting the clerical grade one step on the way to a workers' democracy, the right of a worker to sit on the board that employs him. We are all in favour of it, Fianna Fáil as well as the National Coalition, and I think this small step should not be turned down.</P>

      <P>One might accept the Minister's argument if he was prepared to include rate collectors but one could not reject out of hand the weakness in the Minister's argument against the inclusion of rate collectors. I am greatly surprised at the trifling reasons the Minister has given for his <Col N="1081" /> proposal to debar them from standing for local authorities considering the arguments he has used in favour of allowing clerical officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If a clerical officer is operating a housing section, for instance, he has day to day information about what is happening in that office. In most cases he will be dealing with the documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can he influence any decision which would favour any member of the public?  Can a clerical officer take a decision which would favour the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that situations create circumstances and that in the circumstances it would be quite possible for such an officer to be in such a position of influence, particularly when one is now encouraging them to participate actively in political matters in the authority in which they are working.  The Minister is trying to adumbrate an extraordinary principle.</P>
      <P>We are all in favour of workers' democracy and local democracy and we are anxious to ensure that as many persons as are reasonably possible should be allowed to offer themselves for election and to place the minimum of restrictions on such people.  It is stretching it a bit far to expect that a person working in a county council office as a clerical officer could actually go forward for election to that council.  I thought the Minister would have some strong argument against allowing a rate collector when he was prepared to include a clerical officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> We are all well acquainted with rate collectors and I do not think any honest appraisal of the involvement of a rate collector in council affairs and the involvement of a clerical officer in council affairs could result in a conclusion that a rate collector was in a more important or more ifluential position than a clerical officer.  I do not see how anyone could come to that conclusion.  Rate collectors spend most of their time out of doors.  They operate from their own homes.  Their visits to the council offices are irregular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not in the council offices they would be able to work influence.  Surely the Deputy is not that native.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is confining it solely to the fact that they draw up the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a second reason, quite a valid reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The collection of rates.  The Minister is well aware that a rate collector has no power to waive rates.  That is the responsibility of the council.  He has only one obligation and that is to collect whatever demand is handed to him.  That is his only obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is questioning my innocence I, in turn, would seriously question his innocence in the arguments he made in favour of the clerical officer.  I do not know why the Minister should expect us to be so naive as to accept these arguments.  It is obvious the clerical officer is in a very real position of influence.  There could be a very real conflict of interests and his independence would be greatly restricted. He would be seriously inhibited in all his activities because of his dual allegiance.  He would be asked to serve two masters and, in the circumstances, because of the political implications, it is a bit much to expect us to accept this.  The Minister is excluding the rate collector and he <Col N="1083" /> says the exclusion is only because the rate collector compiles the register. I do not see how the Minister can hold that against him when a rate collector can stand for the Dáil. If he can stand for the Dáil, why can he not stand for the county council?  He compiles the register for both elections and the same register is used for both elections.  If he can stand for the one, I do not see why he should not be allowed to stand for the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is the rate collector for the area in which he is standing the number of votes there would not put him into the Dáil but they could put him into the county council.  I grant you he may not be the most popular man in the area, but that is beside the point.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to object to the principle.  The same argument would apply if he were a collector in an area which was in his Dáil constituency.  That would probably be the area in which he was best known and it would have a serious influence on whether or not he would be elected.</P>

We are surprised that the Minister deems it necessary to exclude rate collectors and to include clerical officers. The Minister states that the wording of my amendment may be too broad and, because of that, might include other categories which we might not wish to include.  He may be right in that.  All I am anxious to include is clerical officers.  The amendment could read &ldquo;all administrative staff down to and including the rank of clerical officer&rdquo;: It would be a simple matter to change the wording.  It could be done by agreement.  The Minister fully understands the thinking behind this and the only purpose of the amendment is to exclude persons employed in administrative capacity.  I would ask the Minister very seriously to reconsider his stand on this.  We feel rather strongly about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to change this.  I already explained the position fully.  Clerical officers do not take decisions.  They work under supervision. We are reaching a stage at which we shall have to give a great deal more say to workers in the running of affairs generally.  We talk about this and when I take one tiny step forward by including the lowest clerical grade&mdash;I particularly wanted to include a clerical grade&mdash;I am told that clerical officers practically run county councils; it is not the county manager who does it.  That is the argument. Deputy Molloy did not use those words exactly, but he certainly suggested that clerical officers take decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but my experience is that clerical officers are people who are not in a position to either take decisions or influence decisions. There are people who are paid to take decisions and it is they who take them.  I believe clerical officers should be included and I am including them. As far as rate collectors are concerned, <Col N="1085" /> rate collectors are entitled to stand for the Dáil, and so are rent collectors, but no one would suggest that the area in which they operate is big enough to get them elected to Dáil Éireann, but it could get them elected to a local authority and, because they have to deal with the public in a certain way, I believe it would be wrong to give them the right to stand for local elections. This is a question of representation and I have been approached&mdash; I will be quite honest about it&mdash;by representatives of the three parties who asked why not include rate collectors, rent collectors and a whole lot of other people.  These people are collecting money from the public.</P>

They are not in a position to say: &ldquo;If you have not got the money now, I will come back in a week's or a month's time.&rdquo; The rate collector can do that.  I should hate to put him in that position.  I do not believe either rent collectors or rate collectors should be in.  I do not believe home assistance officers should be in.

      <P>A rate collector is not a clerical officer.  He goes around from house to house in a certain area.  I have two reasons for not including rate collectors.  First, they are the people who draw up the register.  They are responsible for putting people on or off the register&mdash;maybe they do that in error.  My second reason is that they can say to people that they do not have to produce substantial amounts of money for a certain time. It would be wrong to put temptation their way.  Perhaps some of them would not be bothered with it but if votes were involved they might decide to take a certain course.  Therefore I decided to leave out rate and rent collectors and I think I took the right course.</P>

      <P>The Minister is somewhat confused about the real meaning of industrial democracy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate principles involved.  The Minister is taking a small step with regard to clerical officers but he tries to indicate that if he had his way he would allow all the staff to stand for election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This could be the start of the rot so far as local government is concerned because people can be put off standing for local elections. They will say that it should be left to the staff, that they should be the councillors who will talk with the county manager.  What is the point of a person putting himself forward as a candidate at an election to represent his area if the staff in the council, to whom he will be making representations on behalf of the people, will be the people sitting beside him on the council in exactly the same position as far as being elected is concerned but in a different position so far as their access to files and information is concerned?  Their standing with the staff would be on a different level than that of an ordinary councillor or a member of the public.  The Minister is introducing a completely new principle which will be to the detriment of local government. It will discourage good citizens of the community who are prepared to make the sacrifice of going forward on to the councils in a voluntary capacity where they will not be paid but where they are prepared to give their free time in the service of the community.  This service is given on an unpaid, voluntary basis and it is one of the most admirable services in the country.  The Minister is breaking away from that principle, and in the long run it will be to the detriment of local government and local democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be consistent.  If he goes down to a certain grade, he should not start picking and choosing after that. The clerical officer in a county council, which deals with a variety of services too numerous to mention, is where the action is.  He knows what is happening, he has access to information and files passing through the various offices.  While he is not the person who makes a recommendation to the county manager that Mr. X should be given a housing grant or loan, he is familiar with the matter. If he is elected to the county council he will have certain information even before a decision is taken.  A county councillor will write to the county manager or county secretary on behalf of an individual but the clerical officer, if he wishes, may notify the individual concerned of the decision recommended to the county manager.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the duty of a county councillor to find out the facts and to make recommendations. He must go to the office and discuss it with officials.  The person at the office counter who will discuss a routine inquiry may be a clerical assistant, a clerk-typist or a clerical officer. More often than not it is not the principal officer or the staff officer who deals with the inquiries.  There is nothing wrong in a councillor getting information on the progress of a particular case but behind the counter there may be a person who has been approached on the same case.  Why should he not give the information if the man outside is trying to get as much information as he can?  Why should the man inside the counter not be at liberty to give information?  Is <Col N="1089" /> the Minister going to elect councillors who will be hamstrung because they are officials of the council?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not hamstring them by any legislation passed in this House.  There is as good a case to be made on behalf of allowing a rate collector to stand for election. The Minister has said rate collectors are not popular, that they would not have much chance of getting elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said that normally rate collectors might not be very popular.  I did not say they would not stand a chance of being elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Rate collectors were popular enough to become Members of this House.  In the Minister's constituency there were rate collectors who got a considerable number of votes, even in areas where they collected rates.  If I were a rate collector and a county councillor, when compiling the register I would do my very best to ensure that it was perfect, that there could not be any allegations made against me.  It would be an encouragement to the rate collector to ensure he was above reproach.</P>
      <P>Allegations are made against rate collectors that they left out names here and there.  This happens.  With the best will in the world a rate collector or anybody else can leave names off the register.  The rate collector is not the only person who is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the register is complete and accurate. The Garda have the same job.</P>

      <P>The Minister must be very innocent.  If a rate collector returns a certain proportion of the rates before certain dates in the collection year, he gets a bonus.  Can you picture a rate collector saying to people: &ldquo;Because I am a county councillor I will allow you a month to pay your rates.&rdquo; He may do that in the case of one person, and does.  I know that.  He will not make a practice of it because it hits him where it counts, in the pocket.  If there are soft rate collectors in County Meath that is another matter.</P>

      <P>None of the arguments which the Minister has put up holds water.  The rent collector who collects weekly rents is responsible for taking the money and lodging it.  What difference is there between him and a motor taxation clerical officer who does the same thing with even larger sums of money?  The sums of money involved in motor taxation are very much larger than the weekly amount collected and lodged by the rent collector. The Minister has also excluded home assistance officers.  They do not handle money and they do not handle the register, so why are they excluded?</P>

      <P>This could have a good deal to do with a speedy conclusion of the whole debate.  We completely reject the argument that we are up against the wall and that by a certain time and a certain day this Bill must be passed.  We should not be asked to debate it on the basis that there is no time left and that it must become law.  We do not agree with it as it is worded.  We are making it quite clear to the Minister now that he can have the Bill with the amendments he has agreed to take from us and with the amendment that he has put in following the tabling of my amendment, if he accepts an amendment prohibiting clerical officers. We do not agree that administrative staff at that level should be involved as candidates in local elections.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ours is a very reasonable request.  The Minister has laid down a principle whereby he has excluded rate collectors.  Yet he has <Col N="1098" /> included clerical officers.  We see no logic in that.  If the Minister wanted to include rate collectors very strong arguments could be made in favour of that.  He proposes to exclude them. We question whether that is right or not but to get the Bill through we are prepared to settle for an amendment excluding clerical officers.  If the Minister accepts that, the debate can be over in ten minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>You can repeat them as long as you like.  They carry no weight.  I have made the case that clerical officers are a very minor grade in a local authority, do not take decisions and are therefore eligible as candidates, in my opinion.  I think if we speak of workers' democracy we must give them that right.  Deputy Molloy tries to give the impression that he knows all about workers' democracy.  I worked as a trade union official for 25 years and I know more about workers' democracy than the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not suggest it.  He has just now thought it up. <Col N="1099" /> Rate collectors are (a) the people who compile the register and (b) they have the right, as have rent collectors and home assistance officers, of dealing with the public and being involved financially with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason I am not prepared to agree.  I am putting in the very minor grade of clerical officer because I believe that grade should have a right to be on a local authority somewhere along the lines. They cannot affect their own decisions because those are a matter for the county manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, it is suggested that because they are councillors they might get promotion but if they did they would immediately promote themselves out of their right to be a member of a local authority. Can Deputies opposite not be logical? As regards making decisions I think it was Deputy Cunningham who said that while they do not sign documents recommending something to the county manager they deal with ordinary routine clerical work under supervision.  I do not know why this great argument against clerical officers has grown up in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I thought they were liberal in their outlook.  Indeed I thought the argument would be the other way, that they would be suggesting we were not going far enough and should allow other grades in.  Instead, they have changed and now say they should not be allowed in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I came into the House to speak about this because I <Col N="1100" /> could not understand the Minister insisting on going through with something for which there is no demand from the people concerned.  I have done homework on it and feel this will be an embarrassment to them. Administrative staff and voluntary members of public authorities are two separate groups.  Surely the Minister is not thinking of putting people who are working in the local authority offices in the position of being representatives of the people?  I cannot understand this.  It would not be fair to the officials concerned.</P>
      <P>I was on a local authority for 14 years.  Apart from the administrative work of going to meetings and discussing the agenda, the major part of a councillor's work consists of making representations with regard to housing grants, the building of specific houses, the repair of cottages and looking after roads and various grants. The staff in the office know all about these things.  These people live in different parts of the county and a stage could be reached where the clerical staff would be on the council. That is an extreme case.  They could say &ldquo;Now we will have a meeting&rdquo;. They would be excellent councillors. They could give information to various individuals about getting houses and supplementary grants. They could bring the grants themselves to the people on a Friday night. They could tell a man why his cottage was not being built and what to do in order to get the work done. They could point out the errors in the original applications.  They would be idiots if they did not use the firsthand information available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe county councillors should learn more about their business.  This is the first time I heard the argument about them knowing too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You might as well ask the Secretary of the Department of Finance to become a Member of this House.  It is much the same.  There are a few county council staff officers in <Col N="1101" /> this House, including the Leader of the Minister's party.  They had to relinquish their posts when coming in here. We are paid for being here.  It is a wholetime job.  A county councillor is in a voluntary position.  He is representing an area and is elected from an electoral area.  He has certain work to do.  Under the Minister's proposal he would have an unfair advantage.  He might succumb to the temptations which are inevitably there for him.  He would be a superman if he did not do so.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that we are attacking the standards of officials of county councils.  Men are human.  In political life one finds that you go to bed as an ordinary citizen and rise an elected representative.  Therefore, as a politician, you are suspect.  That metamorphosis would take place in so far as a clerical officer is concerned too.  He would be a clerical officer one day and a politician the next day.  He would be a poor member if he did not use the information available to him and his inside knowledge in order to get things done.  He would not be human unless he used his position.</P>

      <P>No Minister with respect for what a local authority should be would press for the acceptance of this section allowing clerical officers to be members of local authorities. None of the arguments advanced is valid.  There is no analogy whatever when you talk about workers' democracy.  The duties of a local authority member concern those who elected him.  There can be no comparison with a person working in a firm who is entitled to have a share in the business for which he is working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see why this Bill has been delayed so long in the House.  There are a certain number of representatives in each council. They represent everybody in the electoral area.  People who are working as clerical officers or in any other grade are represented on that council.  I cannot understand what pretence is being carried on about the workers' democracy. There is no analogy whatever. The Minister's argument falls when it is said that rate collectors are not eligible and must not be eligible while clerical officers, who are working at a centre of the operations, are eligible. It does not make sense.</P>
      <P>There is something about the registers also.  The responsibility of being on the voters' list rests on each individual citizen.  It is his duty to see that he is on that list.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;might fail to put on the names of some people and take off the names of others, but he will not get away with that for very long. Such a man is a part-time employee. He is moving among the people and is free.  In most cases he is in a good position to do a good job as a representative for any party or as an independent. It would not be fair to take a man who is tied to his desk at the administrative centre of the council and elect him a member of the council, imposing on him the obligation of representing a particular part of the electoral area.  This would create a new dimension in local representation which was never thought of before.  It is a retrograde step.  I appeal earnestly to the Minister to seriously consider accepting the amendment.  Let him not impose this obligation on decent clerical workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fraudulent and irresponsible nature of this budget to which I referred on the day it was announced to the House having been exposed, the keynote of the speeches <Col N="1104" /> from members of the Government can only be described fairly as bluff and I propose to show why this is so. Possibly, in anticipation of that exposure the first sentence by the Minister for Finance in presenting his budget was a statement which is not correct.  I quote from column 1422 of volume 271 of the Official Report for the 3rd April, 1974:</P>
      <P>The success of last year's budget policy is illustrated by the near record rate of 7 per cent growth achieved in 1973....</P>
      <P>If there is one thing that has been demonstrated clearly by a number of speakers on this side of the House, including myself, and by a number of independent economic commentators both in the House and outside, it has been that last year's budget was not a success in the sense in which the Minister referred to it.  Indeed, it has been shown clearly that the growth achieved in our economy took place in the early part of the year, most of it while the previous Government were in office, and that by the middle of the year, as a member of the ESRI remarked, stagnation had set in.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that this is demonstrated clearly by all the indicators available, not only did the Minister for Finance begin his statement in the manner to which I have referred but many Members on the other side of the House, including members of the Government, proceeded as if the statistics did not exist which show that stagnation had set in.  These speakers quoted the growth rate and such other factors as employment as if these were the result of last year's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this year's budget the Minister dealt with the question of income tax allowances.  On the day of the budget statement I said that one of the reasons why I described the budget as being fraudulent was that the workers of this country were being given to understand that they would get substantial income tax reliefs and were not getting any such reliefs.  I suggested that the very least that could have been expected was that the Minister would restore the income tax position <Col N="1105" /> to what it was when Fianna Fáil were in Government.  Was that a reasonable proposition?  Was it reasonable when one considers the solemn public commitment made by the present Government, admitted by them to be with a view to creating a climate in which a national pay agreement would be accepted?  I suggest it is reasonable and that if one reads the records of the debate on the budget, it will not be possible to find as much as one word from any Deputy on the other side of the House endeavouring to controvert that proposition.  The only thing&mdash;and I could not suggest that this was endeavouring to controvert that proposition&mdash;was that the Minister for Industry and Commerce hurled a great deal of abuse at me when he talked on this subject.  He said that I was endeavouring to undermine the national pay agreement.  Of all the people in this House the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have been the one to have remained silent because he is the man who made a fool of himself by suggesting that Fianna Fáil had been responsible for the rejection, in the first instance, of the national pay agreement.  Indeed, he went on to make an even bigger fool of himself by rejecting out of hand my suggestion that in order to create a better climate for the acceptance of a national pay agreement the Government should make a commitment in regard to income tax allowances. The response from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to that suggestion was that it proved that Fianna Fáil deserved to be in Opposition. However, a short time later, the Government had to do precisely what I suggested, having overcome the insuperable difficulties referred to by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by others in relation to budgetary secrecy, a proposition which in this context had no basis.</P>
    <P>At column 1526 of Volume 271 of the Official Report for the 4th April, 1974, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...There was no reform of income tax and no facing up to this injustice until we came to power...</P>
    <P>In the same column he said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> ...The release of 60,000 people from the tax net is a very significant reform in income tax.</P>
    <P>In our last budget, 50,000 taxpayers were released from the tax net but that, in the view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, represented nothing in the way of facing up to the situation.  However, when 60,000 people were released from the tax net, some of them for only a week or so, that was regarded by the Minister as being a significant reform in income tax.  There has been no significant reform in income tax here for many years.  There is no such reform in this budget.  Shortly before I left office I was expecting a report on the reform of the income tax code but I had left office before it became available. At least, I presume it became available to the present Minister, but in any case I do not know what it might have contained although I know that what the Minister announced in this budget was merely a copy of what was done in Britain a few years ago.  It does not represent any fresh thinking on the question of reform of the income tax code.  The real reform with which workers are concerned is the level of income tax which they have to pay.  Under this budget many of them find themselves, in relation to income tax allowances, twice as badly off as they were after the last Fianna Fáil budget of 1972.</P>
    <P>We also find that the Minister in his budget statement announced a new provision in regard to income tax, the effect of which is to increase substantially the income tax liability of thousands of workers employed in factories set up under Fianna Fáil.  I want to make it clear that it has been, and continues to be, basic Fianna Fáil policy to try to ensure as far as possible that we would provide employment, especially industrial employment, in certain areas for people on small holdings who could not make in any circumstances a reasonable living on the land.  We were very successful in that programme.</P>
    <P>As I said, there are many thousands of workers in the position in which they have employment in factories and they have a small holding <Col N="1107" /> and, as a result, they have a reasonable standard of living.  Research has shown that in these cases the level of working of the land has been stepped up considerably, primarily because they had a little money available to invest in their land.  This provision announced by the Minister runs directly contrary to the fundamental concept of Fianna Fáil policy which we have been pursuing over the years. So far as we are concerned we are totally opposed to it.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter to which I referred yesterday at Question Time.  Under the provision announced by the Minister even a married old age pensioner living on a few acres would now find himself paying £92.30 income tax.  In his statement at column 1454 of the Official Report of 3rd April, 1974, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>...it is proposed that, in the case of farmers not now being brought within the scope of income taxation, only one half of the appropriate personal allowances will be set off against non-farming income, whether of the farmer or of his wife.  This restriction will apply as from 6th April, 1974.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to suggest yesterday that smallholders will not be affected by this provision.  I challenge him to demonstrate in what he said in his budget statement that there was any exclusion whatever for smallholders. Yesterday, when he produced an estimate of the number of taxpayers likely to be affected by this provision, he was asked what level of valuation did he use to arrive at that estimate.  He could not, or would not, give the information.  I want to make it quite clear that if the Minister comes here with the Finance Bill to mend his hand in this regard he will have done so because of the exposure of this iniquitous provision by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>When speaking on budget day I said that it was fraudulent of the Government to be giving out repeatedly pious platitudes in regard to inflation.  At the same time, by last year's and again by this year's <Col N="1108" /> budgets, they were deliberately fuelling inflation themselves.  The Minister and some Government speakers have spoken rather glibly about stepping up the growth rate.  Listening to them, one would think that all that was involved was to pump in more money, budget for a deficit and growth increased. If this were all that were to it, one could ask the Minister: &ldquo;Why have a deficit of only £66 million for the next 12 months?  Why not have £660 million and we would all be happy?&rdquo; The reason is that this is a much more complex operation.  One must take into account the capacity for growth in the economy and try to aim at achieving an injection into the economy of a sum of money which will utilise that capacity and no more. If one pumps in more than the capacity of the economy can absorb, one is directly fuelling inflation, directly putting up prices and directly increasing imports.</P>
    <P>On the question of the deficit in this budget we had a very interesting performance from some members of the Government.  I think I am entitled to point out that I was the first Minister for Finance to budget for a deficit.  I did so having regard to the economic circumstances then obtaining.  It was agreed at the time that it was justified on all sides and the result showed that this was so.  At that time, I had a fear, and I expressed it, that some day I might be succeeded by a Minister in a Government which was irresponsible and careless of its responsibilities.  If that happened the political temptation to budget for a deficit with regard only for political and not for economic considerations would be very grave indeed. My fears in this regard have, I am afraid, been justified by what has happened with this Government particularly in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce commented on this question of budgeting for a deficit.  He commented on something I had said on the 3rd April, at column 1492 of the Official Report.  It is interesting to compare what he said with my comment.  I said:</P>
    <P>...Instead of that we have had this unbelievably irresponsible Budget <Col N="1109" /> Statement by the Minister, backed by every member of the Government, of a £76 million deficit in circumstances in which no reputable economist could possibly justify such a deficit.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking on the 4th April and reported at columns 1538-9, commented on my statement as follows:</P>
    <P>If we are being grossly irresponsible we are being so with advice from many advisers who apparently are grossly irresponsible also.  A lot of our advisers are very important people who are serious economists. Deputy Colley doubted last night whether any reputable economist would make such suggestions.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance or any other member of the Government to produce one reputable economist who advised that in our circumstances today we should budget for a deficit of £76 million or £66 million, let them choose either figure as they like.  I challenge them to produce any evidence of that.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when speaking on this matter, was straining very hard, when quoting the independent advice offered from various sources, to try to show that the advice amounted to achieving an additional growth rate of 1½ per cent instead of 1 per cent. Perhaps this is not as serious as it might sound because he was doing his best to stretch the thing to get somewhere near the deficit that had been announced by the Minister for Finance; but when it came to the crucial question of what is the correct deficit to produce a 1½ per cent growth rate increase, he could not refer to any published advice.  What he said was that he had checked with the Department of Finance and had been informed that the deficit in this budget was the right figure to produce an increasing growth rate of approximately 1½ per cent.  He did not, unfortunately, give us the details of the information he said he had got from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister for Finance, <Col N="1110" /> when replying tonight, will oblige us by giving us the exact basis of that calculation.  Many people, including economists, would be interested in it. Indeed, I suspect it might have some great historical interest because it would most certainly mark the discovery of some new economic law, and that is something that should not be hidden from the public.  The Minister owes it to posterity if not to us to produce the precise figures on which that was based, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs was correct in what he said.</P>
    <P>Of course the truth is that in considering a budget deficit one has to consider what is termed in economic jargon as the balanced budget multiplier, that is, even if one does not have a deficit, with a higher level of spending there will be a certain amount of stimulus injected into the economy.  However, this in itself would not have been sufficient for our purposes this year, and so there was a need for an additional deficit. The question is how much?  I agree, and concede quite freely, that there is no clear-cut, precise way of calculating this, but if we operate on the basis of a multiplier of about two&mdash; and there is a good deal of authority for this, including strangely enough, in another context, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;our additional output would be about twice the size of the initial stimulus.  Therefore we would need an additional deficit of £15 million on top of the opening deficit of £10 million, making £25 million in all.</P>
    <P>These figures are necessarily crude, but at least they indicate the order of magnitude involved.  I would be prepared to accept a plus or minus of several millions if somebody produced more refined calculations, but there is no basis for accepting that the deficit must rise from £10 million to £66 million, an increase of £56 million, which is nearly 2 per cent of the GNP, to produce an additional 1 per cent growth rate.  I am prepared to accept that we will get an addition of only 1 per cent, and that is precisely the point that I and others on this side of the House have been making&mdash;that if you put more in the way <Col N="1111" /> of a deficit into the economy than is necessary to produce a 1 per cent increase in growth rate, then you are directly and deliberately fuelling inflation; you are shoving up prices, you are increasing imports and of course you are not in that way helping to raise output or to increase employment.</P>
    <P>It is interesting also to consider the whole change of policy involved on the part of members of the Government now as compared with our line of approach.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, when speaking on the budget, accused Fianna Fáil of sticking to one policy, of being consistent.  We have no complaint about that.  We will continue with policies that we have found to be effective unless new evidence or new circumstances arise, but one thing is certain: neither the Minister for Foreign Affairs nor the Minister for Finance can be accused of consistency in this matter.  For instance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 3rd March, 1971, discussed these problems. I would remind the House that at that time growth in the economy was somewhere between zero and 1 per cent.  In the light of that it is interesting to consider the comments at that time of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I quote:</P>
    <P>To counter these measures&mdash;&mdash; He was speaking of inflationary pressures.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Government should have cut back the growth of public expenditure, both capital and current.</P>
    <P>Later on he stated:</P>
    <P>In a year in which Government borrowing both for new projects and for the redemption of old loans had to be at an exceptionally high level anyway, the unprecedented acceptance of an £8½ million deficit in the November Budget aggravated still further the Government borrowing problems.</P>
    <P>Later on:</P>
    <P>Part of the problem derives from the unhappy reliance on borrowing for almost the whole of the financing of the capital programme. <Col N="1112" /> Budget surpluses are a rarity in Ireland and even if one takes account of the fact that the Irish Budget conventions in respect of the classification of expenditure, either capital or current, are by international standards unduly strict&mdash; about 10 to 12 per cent of what is regarded as current expenditure in our Budget is treated as capital expenditure in both international and domestic presentation of our national accounts&mdash;the proportion of capital expenditure financed from current revenue is small.</P>
    <P>and so on.  I could quote further from this article but it would be on the same plane.  The Minister for Finance is on record from this side of the House complaining bitterly about the increase in Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>Compare that attitude with the attitude now when we get a huge budget deficit which no member of the Government has seriously attempted to justify in economic terms and you will agree with my assessment that whatever else members of the present Government may be accused of they cannot be accused of consistency, as we were by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government deliberately fuelled inflation by increasing the price of almost everything and by injecting into the economy on the capital side money which under the Central Bank guidelines to combat inflation should have been kept out of the domestic economy.  Having, as I described in my speech on budget day, scrambled madly around for capital, the Government resorted to unprecedented and, I would suggest, dangerous measures to get their hands on capital.</P>
    <P>It is extremely significant that no member of the Government who has spoken during this debate has not alone attempted to refute what I said but has not referred to this vitally important point of how the Government handled the public capital programme, how they got the money. They have not even commented on what the Minister admitted, in the published capital budget for this year, <Col N="1113" /> was an exceptional measure.  None of the Government speakers referred to that matter of vital importance to the basic stability of our economy.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have asked the Government to take the country into their confidence on this particular problem of capital.  It is a problem and I am not suggesting that it is an easy matter for the Minister to deal with.  That is not my complaint. My complaint is that it is an enormous problem and the Minister is trying to cover it up.  In the process of covering it up he is resorting to dangerous methods.  I should like to ask the Minister to state precisely, what the position was in the last financial year in regard to the sources of capital, the effect of what he did and, in particular, to say what he intends to do in this coming year to procure the capital for a considerably increased capital programme which he has announced.</P>
    <P>I believe that we, and the public in general, are entitled to know whether he intends to get that additional capital abroad.  Has the Minister information about the state of international markets which would make that likely?  The Minister made it clear in the capital budget during the course of the last financial year that the state of the international markets was anything but encouraging for borrowing.  Does the Minister hope to get considerably more money from the national loan and savings and, if so, on what does he base that hope having regard to the disastrous performance in the national loan and in savings in the last financial year?  Does the Minister propose to repeat what he did in the last financial year but on a much bigger scale?  If he does he should tell this House and the public.</P>
    <P>What the Minister did last year was dangerous and irresponsible and if he proposes to do the same this year on a bigger scale we are entitled to know and to take whatever measures we can to protect ourselves against the consequences of the continuation of this irresponsible policy. Perhaps the Minister will explain the significance of the advertisement in today's newspapers which would seem <Col N="1114" /> to suggest that what is involved is the forced-funding of a loan to the Exchequer by departmental funds of about £45 million.  The Minister should explain precisely what it means.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate we heard a great deal from the other side of the House about the great job done by this Government in regard to social welfare.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare spoke at great length about the concern of this Government.  If there is any basis at all for these claims perhaps the Minister would explain why it is, in the light of the fact that, according to the EEC report on our economy, a further £30 million is becoming available this year from the EEC, he proposes in this budget to spend only £25 million extra on social welfare in a full year as against £39 million last year.  Does the Minister remember a drop of that kind before in the additional provision for social welfare?  This has come at a time of rampant inflation, the like of which we have never experienced.</P>
    <P>On the day the budget was introduced I spoke about mining.  At that time the Minister for Industry and Commerce was very annoyed and indignant at what I said.  I said that the Government's announcement of their intention in regard to taxation of mines had brought about risks, damage, and, in some cases, postponement, if not cancellation, of industrial projects.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was very annoyed and he challenged me to produce evidence of this.  Of course that Minister was only bluffing because he felt reasonably secure that I would not, if only because of my experience in Government, name particular firms.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with this matter on the Bill dealing with mining taxation and for this reason I do not propose to dwell for any length of time on it now.  I should like to say again to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that if there was no damage caused to industrial development, or to potential industrial development, <Col N="1115" /> by the Government's announcement on mining why did he, the Minister for Finance, and some other Ministers, and certainly the Taoiseach, find it necessary to go out and make speeches offering to give personal undertakings in writing that the export tax relief for industrial firms would not be withdrawn?  Either there was a reason for giving such an undertaking&mdash;and if there was it was the Government's announcement on mining&mdash;or there was no reason for giving it.  If the latter was the case they were creating a very dangerout situation by offering such undertakings.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Industry and Commerce can explain that satisfactorily I will be very happy for the sake of our economy to withdraw what I said.  But until he explains it he stands convicted of knowingly denying something that I had said which he knew to be true.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was also very indignant when I referred to the transaction in regard to the Cominco company but I noted with great interest that despite his great indignation when he spoke on the budget he made no reference whatever to this matter.</P>
    <P>On the Bill dealing with mining taxation the Minister for Finance, when replying, denied what he called the allegation I made.  But if he examines carefully what I said he will find that I used very sober words and that the allegation arises out of the circumstances, not anything I said. The circumstances themselves call for an explanation.  In dealing with this the Minister for Finance denied that there was any truth in what he called my allegation.  However he did not, as I requested him to do, categorically deny that any member of the Government had, directly or indirectly, made available to Cominco information not available to ordinary Tara shareholders or to the general public concerning the Government's intentions in regard to mining taxation or the level of royalties to be imposed on the Tara mines.</P>

      <P>Speaking here on the budget on 4th April the Minister for Industry and Commerce said at column 1518, Volume 271, of the Official Report that the language used &ldquo;by Deputy Colley, the Opposition spokesman on Finance&rdquo;, was &ldquo;language that was excessive, intemperate and at times hysterical&rdquo;.  He referred later to my use of the phrase &ldquo;fraudulent and grossly irresponsible&rdquo;, and he made some other references to things I had said.  It is very interesting to note the views of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on my style of speaking, but it would be far more interesting to get his views on the particular points I raised.  It was noticeable that he did not attempt any refutation of what I had said about the reasonable proposition that income tax relief would at least restore the position to what it was under Fianna Fáil, that he made no comment whatever on the very serious criticism I made in regard to the handling of the capital budget.  He suggested that Fianna Fáil were trying to undermine the economy.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that that comment illustrates the arrogance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his desire, if he could get away with it, to stifle criticism.  He accused me of engaging in shyster tactics, but what words would one use to describe his performance when he said at column 1522 on the same day:</P>
      <P>...and the pretence of the Opposition in all these instances is that not the monetary crisis, not the inflationary crisis, not the commodity crisis, not the energy crisis, but the incompetence of this Government is the sole cause of our current economic difficulties....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He knows and I know that he can comb the reports of the debate and he will find no Fianna Fáil speaker who said any such thing.  The point of what is being said from these benches is that having regard to the existence of these various crises the obligation on the Government is even <Col N="1118" /> more acute, to take action, under its own control, to reduce inflation.  That is precisely what our criticism is.  The Government not alone did not take action but deliberately went out and took action which fuelled the inflation in our economy.  Again the Minister for Industry and Commerce pretended that Fianna Fáil people had said certain things, and he is reported at column 1524 of the Official Report of 4th April as saying:</P>
    <P>To say that huge result of commodity speculation and of the oil price rise had no effect from outside is unfair and it prostitutes the level of serious economic debate.</P>
    <P>Who said that?  Nobody.  I suggest that if one wants to see what shyster tactics are about, have a look at what the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to say in this debate.  We had a few other gems from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>On the same day, at column 1528 he said:</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said that everything possible should be done to stimulate exports.  This was the only creative sentence in his speech.  Does the Deputy recognise tourism as an export service?  Is tourism important in his opinion?</P>
    <P>He goes on in similar vein to talk about the importance to the tourist trade of not increasing the price of the pint or tobacco&mdash;a valid point.  But in last year's budget, the highest increase in excise duty ever was imposed on these commodities.  In addition, the VAT rate on them was increased.  Last year that was very sound economics, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  This year to do the direct opposite is a great performance by this Government.</P>
    <P>Later on the Minister for Industry and Commerce again referred to my statement that nothing was being done to stimulate exports, and clearly was confessing failure: What could be done?  He could not think of anything, and he is Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is not my job to do his thinking for him, but since he seems to be so bereft of ideas, could I suggest to him that he have a look at the <Col N="1119" /> scheme I introduced to provide credit at special rates of interest for exporters? It was introduced on an experimental basis, and it was my intention, having established that it worked effectively&mdash;and it did&mdash;to extend that to other types of commodities and other types of exporters.  If he has no other ideas, he might pursue that one.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce also deliberately misrepresented something I had said and tried to make out that when I talked about a free enterprise economy I was not talking about a mixed economy.  In this day and age what else could a free enterprise economy be but a mixed economy?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce quoted Aer Lingus, the ESB, Bord na Móna, NET, and the Irish Sugar Company.  I wonder does he think they are not operating in a free enterprise economy.  Does he think they are not operating against competition?  Does he not know that some of them are even competing between themselves?</P>
    <P>However, despite the nonsense which the Minister for Industry and Commerce talked and despite the accolade given to him by one of his Labour Party colleagues that he was a very erudite Marxist economist, he seemed in the end to be accepting that we must operate in a free enterprise economy as against a State controlled economy.  That is precisely my point. If we must operate in a free enterprise economy, then the test to be applied to any proposed economic measure is a pragmatic test, not is it left wing or right wing.  That makes no sense.  If you must operate in a free enterprise economy, the real question is: is it going to help or hinder the economy?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's philosophy in this regard was summed up very neatly in the phrase that the late Seán Lemass used frequently when he said: &ldquo;A rising tide lifts all boats&rdquo;.  That summarises our approach to the economy.  On the other hand, it would seem that the Coalition approach seems to be to achieve equality by producing a receding tide which will leave us all on the rocks.  Our philosophy <Col N="1120" /> is one of which we are proud; we are proud of its achievements and we intend to continue with that philosophy in relation to the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>I suggested before, and will again, that this Government have demonstrated that they are incompetent in the management of a free enterprise economy.  There are many examples that can be given to prove this, but let me pick just a few.  The announcement of taxation on mining, to which I have referred already, the consequence of which was that members of the Government, including the Taoiseach, had to rush out offering personal undertakings that the tax-free holiday on industrial exports would not be withdrawn; the White Paper on capital taxation, with which I shall deal later, and the Government's performance in regard to that, and a much smaller matter perhaps&mdash; though not to the people concerned&mdash; the halving of the tax-free allowances of smallholders and others to which I have referred earlier.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the style of this Government is to indulge in a great trumpeting of its intentions and then, if it runs up against any opposition, to reverse its position almost completely.  There are a number of examples of that, and I have mentioned some of them in the course of my speech.  But the serious aspect of this is that the kind of thing which the Government have been doing has been creating a climate of uncertainty in key sectors of our economy.  That just might be feasible and workable as a style of government in a State-controlled economy.  But we are not a State-controlled economy; we are a free enterprise economy.  Consequently the vital decisions which affect the progress being made&mdash;if any is to be made by the economy&mdash;depend to a very great extent on the individual decisions made by numerous private persons.</P>
    <P>In that context the kind of performance we have had from this Government, the creation of uncertainty; the running one way and then running another way; the announcement that they are going to do things like <Col N="1121" /> accepting the Kenny Report on land and then doing nothing about it&mdash; the creation of uncertainty by this kind of conduct is fatal to an economy operating on the basis of decisions by numerous private persons.  These people must have confidence not alone in the economy but in the Government that whatever policy they are following will be consistent, and this Government have ensured that nobody could have such confidence.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of capital taxation.  I want to make it clear that if and when the legislation in regard to implementation of Government proposals on capital taxation comes before this House we, on this side, will have very detailed comments and observations to make.  For the moment I wish merely to outline my general attitude to the various proposals. Firstly&mdash;and this is a very limited outline of points in regard to them&mdash;in regard to the capital acquisitions tax, I believe that the concessions granted or suggested in the White Paper in regard to agricultural land should be extended also to family houses and businesses.  The principle involved should be, in regard to any particular asset or the income which could be obtained for it, or, putting it another way&mdash;as I think it is put in the White Paper&mdash;in relation to agricultural land, the return on capital involved. It seems to me that that is a reasonable principle but there is no good reason why it should be confined to agricultural land.  There are different kinds of assets and different kinds of businesses which would have a very different level of return on capital and account should be taken of that in the implementation of the capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proposed gift tax, first of all I want to suggest&mdash;and this is a general observation in regard to all of the proposed taxes and one that I made on the day following publication of the White Paper&mdash;that in the circumstances of rampant inflation which we are experiencing, with the prospect that it will get worse before getting better, it is essential that there be built into the legislation a specific protection against inflation so that tax will not be levied on inflation. <Col N="1122" /> I would suggest that that should be applied to the thresholds of levels of liability in regard to the gift tax. Furthermore I would suggest that the proposals in the White Paper in regard to the gift tax are very much open to abuse because they propose to apply the gift tax to gifts from a single donor.  It would be perfectly feasible for a syndicate of wealthy people to get together, to agree amongst themselves that each would nominate a recipient of a gift and each would give a gift to each of those nominees of £2,000 or just under £2,000.  No duty would be payable.  I would suggest that the right approach would be to operate on the basis of gifts from any source whatever, to accumulate them and to have a progressive rate of taxation, depending on the level of gifts as they accumulate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the capital gains tax, again it is essential that there be built in protection against inflation so that the tax will not be applied simply to inflation.  Furthermore, as I indicated in my original comment on the White Paper, I believe it essential that the principal private residence should be exempt from capital gains tax.  There is no justification whatever for including principal private residences and we, on this side of the House, are determined to ensure, in so far as we can, that they will not be subjected to capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the proposal in the White Paper that a compulsory acquisition or compulsory purchase order being applied to property is to be deemed to be the same as a sale, rendering people liable to capital gains tax, is unjust.  If you force somebody to sell their property, if you take their property from them and compensate them at or perhaps in some cases even below the market value, then treat them as having sold it and apply capital gains tax, this is, if it does not amount to, getting very close to expropriation.  I believe that capital gains tax should not be applied in circumstances of compulsory purchase.</P>
    <P>It is very important also to distinguish between different kinds of capital gains.  Clearly speculative gains are the things we want to get at but, <Col N="1123" /> equally clearly, if a man acquires a business, works at it for 20 years and it increases substantially in value, that is not a capital gain at all in the sense of somebody who makes a quick kill on the stock exchange.  To meet this I believe it is necessary to provide a sliding scale with progressively reducing rates of taxation, the highest rate of capital gains being applied to short-term gains and the lowest rate to long-term gains, with a number of intermediate points on the scale.  An approach on this basis would be a reasonable attempt, at any rate, to distinguish between what are purely speculative gains and what are not.</P>
    <P>I believe the proposed wealth tax is both inequitable and totally inappropriate to our economic circumstances. The first point I would make is that if all acquisitions of wealth have been taxed there can be no obvious case, in equity, for returning each year to levy a tax on the remaining balance.  To levy a tax in this way means that if there are two people, both acquiring the same initial wealth in the same year and both paying the appropriate tax, we find that the one who proceeds to spend his wealth in that year has no further tax liability while the second person who holds on to it finds himself liable for a wealth tax.  This would not normally be regarded as equitable, nor indeed does it take account of the other aspects of economic policy where the objective is to encourage rather than to penalise people who save.</P>
    <P>There is another objection to the wealth tax as proposed in the White Paper and that is that, with inflation running the way it is, inflation itself is in effect a very heavy tax on the holding of wealth.  At a rate of inflation of 10 per cent per annum&mdash;and it is, unfortunately, going to be higher than that this year&mdash;the value of a wealth holding is virtually halved in six years.  This is a far heavier rate of tax then even that proposed in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>It might be thought that this inflation argument is not valid because many forms of wealth which might be held, such as land, house property <Col N="1124" /> or shares in companies, might be expected to rise in value in accordance with inflation.  But, as the White Paper stands, at any rate, these increases in value are subject to capital gains, and consequently to tax them again under wealth tax is inequitable.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other aspects of this I want to mention.  As suggested in the White Paper, indeed as specifically said, there is no upper limit on the amount of wealth tax for which one can be liable.  This would seem to mean that a person could be liable for tax which in relation to his income is over 100 per cent.  That clearly cannot be equitable.  Furthermore it seems to be proposed that this tax should be imposed without regard to the ability of the taxpayer to pay. This is an old problem with which we are all familiar in relation to rates and we do not want to perpetuate that kind of problem in regard to any other form of tax.  I would point out that in the case of a business&mdash;and this can happen in any business, however well managed it may be&mdash;it can go through a bad period when it has little or no profit or even a loss.  Under the proposals in the White Paper the liability for wealth tax would still operate each year whether you had a loss or a profit.  Irrespective of the size of your loss or profit, it is related to the amount of capital you hold. This can hardly be claimed to be an equitable form of tax.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the proposals, I am sure, were not designed deliberately for this purpose but they result in the creation of a major vulnerability of Irish business to all kinds of foreign takeover.  The proposals have a built-in advantage for foreigners to take over Irish business of all kinds&mdash; hotels, factories and so on.  They would all become extremely vulnerable to foreign takeover under the proposals in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>In addition the wealth tax proposed would clearly penalise self-employed people and indeed many people who are privately employed, who try to make provision for their old age, for their retirement.  It is all very well for people in the Public Service who have pensions and who now have, as a result of the decision taken by the previous <Col N="1125" /> Fianna Fáil Government, parity of pension.  That means that not alone do their pensions keep pace with inflation but they go further than that and they keep pace with increases granted to serving civil servants, increases in the actual standard of living, not just inflation.  Public servants have this and I believe they should have it. I should like to see everybody having it.  But self-employed people and very many people employed in private business do not have this and they have to make provision for their old age. Under the wealth tax proposals those people could be very heavily penalised as against people like public servants. This does not appear to me to be equitable, as has been claimed for the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>The imposition of the proposed wealth tax would undoubtedly produce a very substantial outflow of capital from this country, indeed a catastrophic outflow.  It has already produced a serious outflow of capital.  The Minister may say there is no evidence of that, and I have no doubt it is true that there are no official statistics available to show it.  But I wonder are the members of this Government so out of touch with real life that they have never discussed this problem with accountants, bank managers, solicitors.  If they have not done so I would invite them to do this.  They will find if they talk to those people that there has already been a very serious and significant outflow of capital just by publication of the proposals.</P>
    <P>The whole proposed operation of the wealth tax would, I believe, be a serious disincentive to Irish people, in particular those who are engaged in production, in agriculture or industry. They constitute a very grave risk to many existing jobs and to the prospect of creating new jobs.  I believe it is highly significant that of our eight partners in the EEC four of them, much more highly developed economically than we are, have no wealth tax; and of the other four the manner in which it operates is so much at a lower level in practice than is proposed in the White Paper here as to amount to a minimal form <Col N="1126" /> of tax and simply to a check on the reliability of income tax returns.  As I have indicated, we believe on this side of the House that a wealth tax is totally inappropriate and misguided in our present economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the situation in which the Government were scrambling around for capital to finance the public capital programme and had to use what the Minister called an exceptional measure to get £20 million from the Central Bank. They also had to use very exceptional measures in running down further the Departmental funds.  In those circumstances it just does not make economic sense to suggest that we should introduce a wealth tax which has already and clearly will, if implemented on a much bigger scale, drive capital out of the country.</P>
    <P>I appeal to people not to take their money out of this country in the light of the White Paper despite the commitments the Government took on themselves in issuing that White Paper.  I believe they will not be able to implement their proposals in regard to wealth tax because Fianna Fáil have highlighted the iniquities of the proposals and there are enough people who have enough sense to ensure the Government do not implement those proposals.  In the light of that, I urge people not to take their money out of this country.  I am confident that the reasons which would impel them to do so will not operate.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, had a great array of different voices on the Government side in regard to the wealth tax.  Deputy Barry Desmond, interviewed recently on radio, seemed to think the only people who were concerned about the wealth tax were those who were affected by it.  He went on to include the Minister for Defence in that category.  Whatever I may think about the Minister for Defence I believe that, like most public representatives, he is capable of looking at a problem in the interests of the people in general and not determining his own reaction simply by how he will be affected.  The evidence is quite clear that there are very many people <Col N="1127" /> in this country who would not be affected by the proposals for a wealth tax and who are totally opposed to them because they can see that the consequences would not apply only to those with sufficient wealth but would affect the whole economy and every man, woman and child in the country, put many thousands of jobs at risk and damage seriously our prospects of tackling unemployment in any effective way in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour, also interviewed on radio some time ago, and speaking about the proposals on wealth tax, indicated that the White Paper represented decisions taken by the Government on policy and commitments. I cannot really fault the Minister for Labour for saying that because what he was saying would be true in the normal way.  The Government had, presumably, followed the usual procedure whereby the White Paper had come before them.  They had presumably considered in considerable detail such an important document and then decided to issue it.  The implications of that are clear, that the basic decisions had been taken by the Government. Items of detail which would not affect the basic principles, were certainly open to discussion and the Government in the normal way would listen to such representations and if they thought the points made were valid then they would have regard to them, change these points of detail but the basic principles would remain.  For that reason I cannot blame the Minister for Labour for what he said.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have suggested that these proposals in the White Paper were necessary if we were to achieve social justice.  I wonder if they were necessary in the same way as the Minister for Justice thought and said that legislation on contraception was necessary and then the Coalition parties, having said this legislation was necessary, decided to have a free vote.  I rather suspect that is the form of necessity that is involved in this White Paper in regard to the achievement of social justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has suggested <Col N="1128" /> that these proposals are necessary to replace the lost revenue to the Exchequer by abolishing death duties, as though the other proposals, apart from the wealth tax, would bring in practically nothing to the Exchequer, a proposition which he knows is not correct.  Then, of course, we had the very interesting intervention by the Minister for Defence in this House on the 25th April and reported in Volume 272, column 197 and 198 when he said:</P>
    <P>I am not defending one line of the White Paper.  It is not mine, neither is it the Cabinet's.  The proposals in the White Paper were produced by civil servants to replace death duties.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose I need to comment on that.  He said later at column 198:</P>
    <P>It is political trickery for anyone to try to pin the White Paper on the Government and it will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>It is not all confined to the members of the Government.  I think the back benchers have different views too. They have not all said them publicly. I suspect a number of them have said them privately but we are indebted to the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper in Wexford, published on the 3rd May this year, for an insight into the view of Deputy Esmonde where he is reported, when speaking at a Fine Gael meeting in Fethard as saying that he was personally not at all happy about the proposals concerning the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>Then, we come to the position of the Taoiseach in this matter.  It will be remembered that at a press conference, shortly before the last election, and conducted primarily by the present Taoiseach and the present Tánaiste, a question was put as to whether the Coalition, if elected, would introduce a capital gains tax, and the present Taoiseach said they had no intention of introducing a capital gains tax.  Furthermore, according to an article which appeared some time ago in <i>The Irish Independent</i>, by a letter dated 24th February, 1973, the Taoiseach stated that, if the Coalition were elected, there would <Col N="1129" /> be no wealth tax.  In the light of all this, is it not reasonable now to ask where do this Government stand in relation to their capital taxation proposals?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, speaking in the debate on the budget, claimed&mdash;I freely concede the claim to him&mdash;that he had talked about a wealth tax before the election.  He had.  Indeed what he said about it was very close to the proposals in the White Paper.  It is perfectly true he did so, but were not people entitled to assume that, if the present Taoiseach, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, was saying there would be no wealth tax, then Deputy FitzGerald was speaking for himself and not for the Fine Gael Party?  I believe that was a reasonable assumption.</P>
    <P>It now appears, by virtue of some alliance between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and some of his Fine Gael colleagues and some of his Labour colleagues&mdash;I suspect not all of them, but some of them&mdash;that these gentlemen have got the Government into very serious trouble.  It is possible the forthcoming Fine Gael Árd Fheis will sort matters out, but it is quite clear that, as far as this Government are concerned, collective responsibility has gone out the window.  The Taoiseach has &ldquo;shilly-shallyed&rdquo; too long. He clearly committed himself before the election to no capital gains tax and no wealth tax and the Government of which he is Taoiseach have now produced a White Paper setting out what the Minister for Labour has described as &ldquo;firm decisions&rdquo; by the Government to introduce a capital gains tax and a wealth tax.</P>
    <P>The differing voices we hear from the Government benches are certainly not edifying.  It is no credit to the Taoiseach that this situation has developed. It is no credit to him that on a major issue such as this the Government he leads have gone back on his own personal solemn undertaking. It is no credit to him that he has allowed certain people who, in the past, were not very favourable to him, to gang up in the Government and produce what are said to be by a member of the Government &ldquo;firm decisions&rdquo; to introduce a capital <Col N="1130" /> gains tax and a wealth tax, totally contrary to the undertaking personally given by the Taoiseach before the election.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is a most unedifying and degrading performance.  I do not care about the problems it will create for members of the Fine Gael Party or of the Labour Party, but I do care about the damage which has already been done to our economy.  I am concerned to see that this matter is sorted out with the least possible delay to alleviate the damage.  I am also concerned at the brazen and total disregard for collective responsibility in this Government.  I am concerned, too, about the serious anxiety produced by the shilly-shallying of the Taoiseach and the Government in this matter.  In my opinion, it will be a very serious matter indeed if they go ahead with their proposals.  It is probably even more serious that they are speaking with so many different voices, trying to convince one section of the community they are going ahead and another section that they are not going ahead.  This is no way in which to conduct the business of Government.</P>
    <P>This Government have in their whole approach to budgeting, to the handling of the economy, demonstrated their lack of responsibility.  In the current budget and in the last budget they acted in a way which many non-committed observers politically found incredible.  Above all, it is clear that in the preparation of the current budget when members of the Government sat around the Cabinet table and the sums were done the figure that emerged and was allowed to stand as the proposed deficit was arrived at for political considerations and not for economic considerations. It is equally clear that the Minister for Finance, primarily responsible for seeing to it that a responsible approach was made by the Government to budgeting, failed in his duty.  He may have tried his damnedest&mdash;I do not know, but I suspect he did&mdash;but he failed in his duty when he was forced, as I assume he was, to bring in a budget of the kind he did bring in, a budget with that kind of deficit.</P>
    <P>He was faced with the conflicting <Col N="1131" /> claims from different Ministers.  It is extremely significant that in the contributions of various Ministers to this debate and, in particular, those of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, reference was made to the possibilities that were open.  Both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Foreign Affairs went through the possibilities.  They both quoted what I said about the deficit being so enormous.  They went through the possibilities of what the Government could have done.  Neither mentioned the one obvious possibility about which they were so vocal on these benches, the possibility of pruning Government expenditure.  Go through what they said: they mentioned numerous possibilities, but neither of them mentioned that.  This is very significant because it seems to me to fit in with the picture of the Government sitting around the Cabinet table doing the sum; a figure comes out and then the Minister for Finance says: &ldquo;We cannot have that deficit.  It is too big.  It will damage the economy and we must either cut back on expenditure or apply some taxation, or both.&rdquo; But he is ruled out by his colleagues.  I am giving him the benefit of the doubt.</P>

He is over-ruled and the Government come in here with this enormous inflationary deficit and two Ministers, who speak on the budget at great length, mention all sorts of possibilities of approach but neither mentions the possibility of pruning Government expenditure.  It all adds up to what I said earlier: this budget, for the reasons I have outlined, is fraudulent. It is also grossly irresponsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I should like to extend my congratulations to Deputy Colley for doing his best in what must have been an impossible task.  Alone <Col N="1132" /> among all the commentators in the country Fianna Fáil, advised by the only economist they could get to support them&mdash;their own specially employed economic adviser, Professor Martin O'Donoghue&mdash;found cause to criticise the economic philosophy behind the budget.</P>
      <P>In common with every Minister for Finance I looked for comment on the budget in the many days and weeks since it was published.  Among all the comments there was nothing that was fundamentally hostile, there was nobody who disagreed with the fundamental policy and thinking behind the budget. When we look for neutral observers, we find that organisations such as the OECD, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the National Economic and Social Council, the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are in substantial agreement with this year's budgetary policy.  I cannot recollect any occasion in my 15 years in the Dáil when so many organisations of repute spoke with such a unanimous voice in support of budgetary policy.</P>
      <P>The tone of this year's budget debate and the general comment has been quite favourable, even from the Opposition benches.  They could not find much cause to criticise the budget so they endeavoured to create a little mischief in relation to capital taxation. I will come to that shortly. There was a general welcome for most aspects of the policy as outlined and the modicum of criticism we had was predictable.  It was confined to matters of detail and came mostly from people who were, very reasonably, being brought into the taxation net.  They were brought in not because anybody had any desire to do so but simply because the only way to achieve some equity in the Irish taxation system is to broaden the base.  That advice comes not only from every neutral organisation in the country but from every economic and financial organisation in the international field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I should like to remind the House of my closing remarks in the budget speech on 3rd April.  I indicated <Col N="1133" /> then there were three aspects of my budget policy.  First, there was the promotion of economic growth to ensure that the economy would operate as closely as possible to full capacity so that employment prospects might be enhanced.  Secondly, the budget marked a continuation of the social welfare reforms commenced last year and which we intend to continue. Thirdly, there was the securing of greater equity in the sharing of the tax burden in the community.</P>
    <P>The first policy objective was approached in the budget along the lines recommended by the organisations to which I have referred, namely, to require an injection into the economy which would ensure a growth rate greater than the 3½ per cent that was projected.  It is very interesting to note that the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance, supported by all other Fianna Fáil speakers, condemned this policy. An economic growth rate of only 3 per cent or 3½ per cent this year would have meant unemployment. That is the Fianna Fáil programme, their philosophy and economic outlook. Their policy would have meant that this year there would have been a growth in unemployment, a rundown of the economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We found this unacceptable. Deputy Colley argued there should not be a deficit of more than £25 million.  This would mean we could not get greater growth this year than 3 or 3½ per cent.  That would have meant unemployment, but of course that is in accord with the Fianna Fáil tradition.  As Deputy Colley said, they have not been criticised for being inconsistent; they are consistent in having the wrong economic approach to the problems of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided to give a boost to the economy by not increasing taxation.  We wanted to ensure that the economy would operate in 1974 at a level close to the utilisation of capacity. We would have had underutilisation of capacity.  We would have had underutilisation of capacity if we had not given that economic boost.  Deputy Colley thinks we will exceed capacity, <Col N="1134" /> that we will add to the fires of inflation. Again every international competent body happens to disagree with him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Last year's deficit, which was savagely attacked by Deputies Colley, Lynch, Haughey and all the great economic whiz-kids of Fianna Fáil, was fully justified in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was fully justified in the year.  We brought the economy to an exceptionally high level of growth.  It is at least 7 per cent, and when the final figures are available it will probably be more.  As some commentators have mistakenly interpreted the position, the principal growth was not in the first half of the year.  It was towards the end of the year and at a time when the whole world was suffering a recession for a number of reasons, multiplied by the energy crisis towards the end of the year.  We do not pretend that all is rosy and easy, that we live in a Utopia and, even if we did, we are constrained by forces outside.  Because of the delicate balance needed to achieve external and internal equilibrium, in this budget it was necessary to adopt a flexible policy.  We will continue to have a flexible economic policy because we consider it a merit, not a drawback.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a surprising statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very unwise to ignore the fact that problems might arise during the year if the deficit were not reduced but, because of the growth of the economy, we expect the deficit will be reduced.  It would be a problem if we failed to finance the so-called oil deficit by suitable international arrangements. However the collective wisdom of the world today is that we should not panic because of the oil deficit in this or in other western European countries. <Col N="1135" /> I consider that thinking is well-founded, that the worst thing we could do would be to adopt &ldquo;beggar my neighbour&rdquo; policies.  This week we criticised the policy of Italy which we regard as a &ldquo;beggar my neighbour&rdquo; policy, which would be disastrous if it were followed by other European countries, or by countries outside Europe.</P>
      <P>If the capacity of the economy this year proves insufficient to absorb the additional stimulus of the budget on internal demand, and if inflationary pressure becomes stronger than at present foreseen, we will not hesitate to revise economic priorities.  We believe that the management of the economy needed in these changing times is such as to maintain flexibility and this is what we have done.</P>
      <P>There is no point in fooling ourselves. There are real problems facing the country, the principal one being the vast imported inflation over which we have no control.  At the imported level this inflation is running seven times higher than in 1972.  The real and most serious consequence of the oil situation is the transfer annually of £100 million of the effort of this country to oil-producing countries. That means a loss of £100 million per annum of Irish work.  If we are to maintain let alone improve our existing standard of living, we must make good that loss by gigantic efforts of our own on a scale not previously required.</P>
      <P>We are very properly shocked by the terrible toll of life and limb which has and is being paid by the community in Northern Ireland as a result of activities there of illegal organisations. The economic cost too of the senseless bombing and other terrorist campaigns there has reached an enormous and frightening level.  What few of us realise, or even if we do realise it care to think about it, is the heavy cost to the Republic's economy of the criminal campaign of violence in the North and the spread of that to the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore I think it proper that I should point out that the cumulative extra public expenditure directly attributable to the Northern troubles <Col N="1136" /> in our budget, including provision for the Army and the Garda and compensation for damage to property, up to March, 1975, will not be less than £55 million.  Apart from direct expenditure the Northern turmoil has caused very serious indirect damage to our economy through its effect on such factors as investment, tourism and exports.</P>
    <P>The cost to the economy in these spheres obviously cannot be precisely quantified, but it is nonetheless real and of very grave proportions.  Speaking in broad terms, and on the basis of estimates of a falling off in growth, the overall indirect losses to the economy approach, on a conservative basis, £200 million.  Closely linked with the activities of illegal bodies in the North are the numerous bank, post office and other robberies which have taken place in our own territory. It is proper that we should realise that, in other words, the actual cost in money terms to our economy is already in the region of £260 million.</P>
    <P>Naturally there is a sense of grievance that oil producing countries and foreign raw material suppliers will, as a result of price rises, take over £100 million out of our economy over the next year.  The economic consequences of that loss are very apparent and quickly measured.  It means that we have so much less to expend on the welfare of our own people and the development of our economy. It is important that we should also remember that the violent men, so-called Irishmen who spread death, personal injury and property destruction across our land, are doing similar damage to our economic life.  These people who have taken the law of the gun into their own hands, without any authority, are literally stealing millions of pounds out of our economy and depriving many thousands of young people of jobs which cannot be created because of lost income and capital.  These men of violence are, in every sense, enemies of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>To return to some of the specific points in the budget, I should like to take the question of tax reform in the first instance.  It is pointless merely <Col N="1137" /> to go on denouncing Ireland's taxation code as excessively high by international standards, and as inequitable domestically, because the load of taxation was not spread in accordance with capacity to pay.  We have heard that cry, that protest, that moan, that complaint for years past.  What is needed now is more action, more actual reform and less verbosity.  The well-known dictum that by doing nothing one can avoid making mistakes does not hold true in relation to taxation.</P>
    <P>Not only at home but in every international economic and financial body with which we are associated, and in international and financial circles generally, it has long been recognised that the obvious fault in Ireland's taxation system could not be corrected until a Government were in office with the courage to broaden the tax base.  Broadening the tax base means including farming and mining profits and closing avoidance and evasion loopholes such as escape holes to tax payments, expense accounts and exorbitant borrowing to set off against income tax liability when those borrowings are for speculative tax free gains.</P>
    <P>By doing little or nothing in the field of taxation, and certainly little in the field of tax reform, Fianna Fáil Ministers let the tax situation here go from bad to worse.  In their last period of Government the number of income tax payers increased from 185,000 to 730,000 while the number of surtax payers, the people best in a position to pay tax, fell from 9,600 and 6,600, although the number of people with higher incomes was increasing.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil did act in the field of tax changes they did the wrong things, like exempting all mining profits from tax for 20 years.  On the basis of present day figures that meant a loss of £125 million.  With reasonable anticipation of increases in price of minerals it probably would have meant, if we had not got into power, a loss to our economy of £400 million to £500 million.  Yet, that was Fianna Fáil's concept of tax reform: to let people dig holes in Ireland, take <Col N="1138" /> all the wealth away, and leave nothing behind.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil also exempted all farming profits irrespective of the wealth of the farmers or the size of the farms. What was their other contribution? What was the specific contribution for which Deputy Colley deserves to be remembered?  It was in relation to a matter which I notice he did not mention tonight, a matter mentioned on the first page of the White Paper on Capital Taxation and which is crucial to the whole proposal to bring in a new package of capital taxation&mdash; estate duties.  Deputy Colley was not getting enough from estate duties with a rate of 40 per cent.  That was not enough.  He wanted to confiscate family fortunes so he made it 55 per cent instead of 40 per cent.  Then he has the audacity to talk about confiscation of private property.  That is the kind of thoughtless, indefensible tinkering with taxes which we could well do without.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey paid a well deserved tribute to the late Deputy Gerard Sweetman, a former Minister for Finance, and he recommended that I should model myself on him and look to his example.  I do not need any exhortation from Deputy Haughey to follow the path of the late Deputy Gerard Sweetman, who was a great personal friend of mine as well as a man any economist could very correctly admire.  He was a thoughtful man.  He did not make any changes without thinking behind the changes.  I remember his saying to me on one occasion in relation to the 20 year tax holiday for mines that he nearly fell off the chair when he heard Deputy Haughey throw out that suggestion.  There was no other Finance Minister in the whole world who was so reckless.</P>
    <P>That was typical of Deputy Haughey. There was scarcely a year when he did not make an effort to be loved by somebody, so he gave the miners tax exemption in one year and the well-to-do farmers with hundreds of acres of land exemption in another year.  I am sure that if he had stayed in office he would have long since bankrupted the country or, as he apparently intended. it would be the worker with the small <Col N="1139" /> wage packet who would be salted while the well-to-do and the foreigner got away.</P>
    <P>In Government we have the will and the courage to effect real reforms like simplifying the income tax code, abolishing death duties, broadening the tax base to include mining and farming profits and capital gains.  We have not got from our Ard-Fheiseanna a vote such as the Fianna Fáil Party gave at their Ard-Fheis opposing a tax on capital gains.  We are not hamstrung in that way.  We have followers who believe that these things should be taxed.</P>
    <P>We anticipated that, as we went about these reforms, our motives and our methods would be subjected to searching examination which we accept as entirely proper and welcome. We also anticipated that our motives and our methods would be subjected to mischievous misinterpretation which, if not fair, we accept as inevitable in this imperfect world.  We do not complain about this.  We will not be distracted from our purpose.  We feel sure that the income, profits, investment and taxation climate in Ireland will be more wholesome and acceptable when our tax reforms are completed.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that Deputy Colley would have done some homework between his post-budget speech and the speech he made today.  He suggested on the day of the budget that we had not brought the income tax personal allowances in 1974 up to the level of 1972.  The truth is we have done more than that.  We have done a sight more than Fianna Fáil did in fifteen years of office when the tax improvements between 1959 and 1973 amounted to only £23 for a single person and £35 for a married person.  Was there ever such a miserable and pitiable performance? We have done more in 13 months than they did in 15 years.</P>
    <P>As Finance Minister I consider that I have a triple duty&mdash;first, to press courageously ahead with tax reforms widely recognised as necessary and just, not permitting myself to be distracted either by the envy of irresponsible people or the backlash of the hitherto untaxed: secondly, in <Col N="1140" /> considering whether to change the taxation code, to carefully balance perfection and equality of treatment with the need to encourage and reward initiative, enterprise and reinvestment without which the national cake cannot be enlarged; and thirdly, not to encourage or tolerate tax avoidance or evasion.  Because these are the principles of this Government and because we have publicly declared that we will go about our tax reform in this way we have been subjected to attacks, but at least there has been a great debate over the last year, a debate we all welcome, on taxation matters, including capital taxation.  It has been well worth while because it has forced people to think about the use of money, about capital, about property, how it should be created, accumulated, inherited, transferred and used.  We have shattered the lethargy, the dullness, the &ldquo;I am doing all right, Jack, and hump the rest&rdquo; mentality which marked 15 years of lazy, timid and thoughtless Fianna Fáil administration, 15 years which resulted in our having what is internationally and domestically recognised as the most highly-taxed incomes and the most under-used taxfree capital resources in all Europe.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Colley say tonight that the Fianna Fáil Party unanimously attacked our proposal to halve the allowances which the working wife of a farmer can set off against her own income.</P>

      <P>I thought the Deputy had.  I think it is because in their heart of hearts they fully recognise <Col N="1141" /> that we are justified in our action. Most Members of the Opposition skillfully avoided mentioning my budget proposal and now I note that Deputy Colley, if he did mention it did not intend to do so and I accept that.  But our proposal is a simple one, to halve the income tax personal allowances which could be set off against a farmer's non-farming income or the income of his wife, not because we want to tax them but because we could not defend a system under which two married women working, say, at the one factory bench would find themselves treated in a totally different way for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>If one married woman happened to be the wife of a labourer she had her wage packet salted for tax but if the married woman next to her happened to be the wife of a farmer she paid no tax at all.  That was indefensible. The ideal we would all love would be to avoid taxing anybody at any time for any purpose, but until somebody comes up with that panacea we shall have to try to spread the taxation load as equitably as possible. Deputy O'Malley accepted the correctness of the restriction on the working wife of a farmer but he had doubts as to whether it should apply to a small farmer.  We have not, and never had, any intention of hitting the small farmer and the Finance Bill will provide that this restriction will not apply to the small farmer.  The Bill will ensure that full allowances will be available in the case of a farmer whose farm is of a valuation of not more than £20.  There will also be a sliding scale that the full impact of the restriction will not apply where the farm just exceeds £20 valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to the Government's decision to tax farming profits and to take the farmer whose land valuation is £100 and over was very briefly as follows.  Farming profits have been wholly exempt since 1969 and virtually exempt before that. As I pointed out in my budget speech, both the Commission on Income <Col N="1142" /> Taxation in 1960 and the Committee on the Review of State Expenditure in Relation to Agriculture in 1970 recommended the introduction of taxation on farming profits.  The Government of the day chose to run away from that; they had not the courage to do it; they feared what Deputy Colley was so indignant about tonight when he spoke so emotionally about the backlash.  If a Minister for Finance is not prepared to stand up to mythical or real backlashes he can never effect equity in taxation.  But we faced up to it this year and, even if we had not the courage to do it ourselves or rely on our own judgment as to what was fair, we had these impartial reports of 14 years ago and four years ago as well as many other recommendations from responsible people in between.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out, farming profits are subject to income tax in each of the other eight countries in the European Community and it was against this general background and having regard to the basic principle that people in similar financial circumstances should be equally treated under the tax code that we decided that farming profits should be subject to tax in the case of wealthier farmers. If the Fianna Fáil Party do not like this it means that they are asserting that they do not believe that people should be subjected to the same amount of tax if they have the same income.  They should come out and say that and ask the people to support that principle.  We are satisfied that the people are fair-minded and will agree with our approach of principle in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the use of the rateable valuation of land as a threshold for tax liability and its use for the notional basis of assessment.  I can accept some of that criticism but I suggest anybody who criticises must produce some realistic alternative and there is none.  The 1960 report to which I referred recommended that the whole country should be revalued but it would take eleven years to do it.  If the revaluation had begun in 1960, if the Government of the day had not run away <Col N="1143" /> from their responsibility we would not have those difficulties people are criticising today.  They did run away from it and we have to use whatever imperfect tools are available.  I am prepared to consider the possibility of establishing a procedure whereby any farmer who is dissatisfied with the current rateable valuation of his farm would have a right to have it revalued. We all know that this valuation which was done over 120 years ago related to the day of horse and water transport and has little bearing on much of the economic life and transport facilities available today.  There are many cases where people might have their valuations dropped and many where it would be the other way round.  But, in order to ensure acceptability of the code and not to multiply any sense of injustice people might have, I am prepared to provide a means whereby aggrieved parties might have the matter considered by some impartial assessor.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has also been made that this is not a suitable time to introduce income taxation on farming profits.  I suppose no time is ideal to introduce a new form of taxation but this time is no better and no worse than any other.  It is no valid criticism to say that farm profits are down somewhat this year compared with last year and therefore we should not introduce taxation of farming profits. If the profits are down liability to tax will also go down.  If the costs of fertilisers and feeding stuffs have risen, mainly due to world commodity prices accentuated by the oil situation, and if prices of some agricultural products have been somewhat disappointing of late this will be reflected in the net income of the farming community. Consequently, they would have to get this concession when their liability was being assessed.</P>
    <P>In each individual case the tax will be assessed by reference either to the farmer's actual profits or if he prefers he can be taxed on a notional basis. This is rather exceptional.  An option is being given to individual taxpayers to choose whichever system has lesser liability.  Many people who pay tax would love to have an option.  No tax <Col N="1144" /> will be payable if there are no profits. If there are losses they can be carried forward and offset against later profits. In this way full account will be taken of varying circumstances in which farmers may find themselves.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in the budget speech, the Government are anxious to avoid or to mitigate as far as possible any disincentive effect that income taxation in general might have on effort.  They recognise that the introduction of income tax on farming profits may create particular problems in the transitional period.  Already we have had consultations, as I promised in the budget speech, with the Economic and Social Council and with representatives of farming organisations.  I hope the result of these consultations will be fruitful and satisfactory.  I have met the IFA. This week I will meet the ICSMA for the second time.  Further consultations should help us to find an acceptable formula.</P>
    <P>In the programme which the National Coalition parties put before the electorate, and for which they got support at the last general election, we pledged ourselves to drastically reduce rates by transferring health charges and housing subsidies to central taxation.  We said we would endeavour to replace the rates by a form of taxation related to the ability of the person to pay.  We have already removed £30 million from the backs of ratepayers.  By the time we have finished our programme of transfer in another two years' time the local ratepayers will be relieved of £75 million which formerly rested on them in local rates.  This means today that local rates are about £2 in the £1 less than they would otherwise be.  If the Government had not changed, the rates throughout this country would be about £2 in the £1 more than they are today.  Never has the ratepayer been given such very significant relief.</P>
    <P>The question of relating local taxation to ability to pay, which is something which we are also anxious to bring about, is the subject of very active study at the present time.  The Economic and Social Research Institute are also involved in the preparation <Col N="1145" /> of a scheme which will take cognisance of the capacity of persons to pay.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of the deathbed conversion of the Fianna Fáil Party a short while before the last general election when they went back on their White Paper which was then only two months old.  It might be no harm if Fianna Fáil remembered about going back on White Papers. They had a deathbed conversion in which they acknowledged that there were injustices in the rates system. They produced out of a hat, to the great embarrassment of several of their ministerial colleagues who were campaigning down the country, a total reversion of their policy in relation to rates.  They promised to abolish rates on private houses.  This fraudulent promise is being resurrected for the purpose of the local elections. When this quick change was engaged in by Deputies Colley and J. Lynch in Dublin, poor Deputy G. Collins was spending his hard-earned money on a half-page advertisement in Limerick saying that Fianna Fáil would never remove local rates.  It is well that people should be made aware of the price of Fianna Fáil's fraud if ever they got an opportunity, or were under an obligation, to fulfil it.  The Fianna Fáil election gimmick to make the rates on private houses disappear was and still is a despicable piece of political chicanery which only a gobemouche would accept.  People who do not know what a gobemouche is might like to be told that it is a very credulous person who absorbs and throws out nonsense.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil hypocritical and fraudulent scheme would entail the following: a VAT imposed by each city or county council on all goods and services including food and oral medicines which the national Coalition Government have zero-rated, in addition to the national rate, at a rate of 3 per cent.  As I said on several occasions, Fianna Fáil spokesmen did not agree with the removal of VAT from food.  If they got back into office they would restore VAT on food and there would be a rise in food prices of 6 per cent.  If they were to follow our wise course, and <Col N="1146" /> if food and oral medicines were not included, the rate necessary on all goods and services to replace local rates would be 4 per cent.  The price of the Fianna Fáil &ldquo;make the rates disappear&rdquo; act would be VAT rates of 10.75 per cent, 23.5 per cent, and 40.75 per cent.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  The often-voiced fear of many that in their death, their next-of-kin would be caught for savage <Col N="1148" /> death duties gave rise to the public demand for the abolition of death duties.  It is both interesting and fair to comment that the fear of this imposition on the next-of-kin appears to have melted away in the light of the White Paper on capital taxation.</P>

      <P>It would appear that, suddenly this year, there is a kind of euphoric expectation of everlasting life in this world but the reality of life is that it is always followed by death and people, very properly, wished to get away from the Colley death duties of 40 to 55 per cent which ruined many a family business and forced many people to sell out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have done is to offer, on the basis of existing statistics, an alternative pattern for consideration.  Up to the time Fianna Fáil left office death duties applied to estates of £7,500 or more.  We improved that threshold and made it £10,000 but what the White Paper has suggested is that we would do away with these confiscatory taxes and replace them with a system of taxation which would enable people to pay by way of small amounts during a lifetime. The rates and the thresholds in the White Paper are related to the number of estates which are caught in the estate duty net.  These figures are published annually and can be inspected in the Library by Deputies of the House.  Those are the only available statistics of the accumulations of wealth in this country and it is these and not the speculations and the rumours of other people that ought to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have referred on many occasions to a policy of consultation. Democratic government requires consultation but during the terms of office of Fianna Fáil we did not have consultation.  By consultation we mean seeking advice from people, counselling <Col N="1149" /> together and getting the opinions of others which can be checked against one's own opinions and judgment. The Government are doing that.  We have always acknowledged the need to tailor the proposals in the White Paper so as to take account of the special needs of the different sectors of the economy and of society. This is in the foreward to the White Paper and is embodied in it also.  I have spoken of it on many occasions.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that, as a result of these consultations, we have had very useful exchanges of views which will make it possible to formulate more definite and specific proposals.  I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the individuals and the organisations who have taken the trouble of committing to writing their thoughts and suggestions and who have come to see me and officials of my Department and of the Revenue Commissioners in regard to matters of detail and of general principle in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that the same attitude was not adopted by Fianna Fáil or indeed by a minority of wiseacres who are responsible for many baseless rumours and scaremongering and, indeed, for outrageous allegations, some of which we have heard tonight from Deputy Colley who, obviously has not read the White Paper but who waxed eloquently for almost 10 minutes about the dreadful injustice of taxing inflation. Certainly, the Deputy cannot have read paragraph 122 which, for the first time in the tax law in this country, will ensure that there is an indicator built into legislation to protect people against inflation.  There might not have been such an outcry against estate duty if Fianna Fáil had taken account of inflation but they did not do so and would not have done so either if they had been in Government today.</P>

      <P>Once again this evening Deputy Colley displayed how Fianna Fáil have returned to their origins once more&mdash;they do not care what harm they do while they are out of office.  Fortunately, the people are not listening to them and, contrary to what the Deputy alleged in relation to money moving out of the country since the publication of the White Paper, the money is moving in the reverse direction.  In January/ February this year the net inflow was £10 million.  Following publication of the White Paper the inflow for the month of March was £34 million.  It is fortunate that people in this country who have money and who have confidence in this country know they have a Government that are determined to see our economy expand, a Government that are applying the economic policies of the second half of the 20th century and not policies of the 18th or 19th centuries in which Fianna Fáil believed.</P>

      <P>I have said that the period of consultation will continue to the end of June next.  We accept that it would help this process of consultation if the Government's further thinking on some issues of the White Paper were to be made known.  I propose to make an early announcement on some of the more commonly commented-on aspects of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to recall the mischievous scaremongering of last autumn in which Deputy Colley's voice was raised loud and frequently following the announcement of our intention to end the tax-free holiday for mining profits.  Unfortunately, the unwise listened then to the mischief makers and some engaged in panic selling but those who kept their cool, and they were the majority, those who trusted this Government, realised that we would produce a fair deal and we have done this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> I have received letters of congratulation from mining interests on the fair deal we produced.  It is obvious now from the performance of the stock market that interest in Irish mining is growing substantially.  There are people who are falling over one another in the rush to get into what will be a very profitable and expanding industry, notwithstanding all the forecasts of doom from the Fianna Fáil benches.</P>
    <P>Similarly, our capital taxation scheme will be accepted.  It will encourage investment and will distribute the burden of taxation more equitably.  At the end of the day Ireland will have a reformed, a modern and a more efficient tax code, a tax code which will be comparable with that of other countries.  Lest Deputy Colley has forgotten, I would remind him that one of the obligations of our membership of the EEC is that we restructure our taxation code so as to bring it in line with what exists in Europe.</P>
    <P>People talk of Ireland being a poor country and on that account how some other forms of taxation are not suited to us.  Perhaps we should ask why Ireland is so poor.  Maybe the answer is that we have not used our resources properly or that there have been too many loopholes for the well-to-do to place their money elsewhere, to live here in an unspoiled environment while the profits made elsewhere escaped the tax net under Fianna Fáil legislation.  We have closed many of those loopholes.  It was always expected that we would do so because it was accepted that we are a sensible people in Ireland. There was amazement expressed often because we had not moved, as every other country had, not last year nor the year before but decades ago.</P>
    <P>The truth is that the wise people are spurning the troublemakers.  The trust which sensible people had in the Government in relation to mining taxation is being reflected by the state of the money flow which is coming in, and not going out.  It is clear that they will not be misled by the lethargic and chicken livered Ministers <Col N="1152" /> for Finance and their supporters who, at one time occupied my seat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is totally out of touch with reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>In so far as the effect on enterprise generally and private business in particular are concerned, the Government will ensure that the new system of taxation will encourage, and not discourage, growth and development. To that end we have had very useful discussions with interested parties.</P>
      <P>I should like to make specific reference to some of the points raised by Deputy Haughey in the course of the debate.  Firstly, his suggestion that an annual wealth tax of 2½ per cent would result in the appropriation of the entire property of each individual member of the community in 40 years or less is, of course, untrue.  Some of Deputy Haughey's words and actions in the past demonstrated that he can occasionally take leave of his senses.  This is, I think, another of these occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he will not.  Deputy Haughey mischievously suggested that the proposed rate of 2½ per cent would apply to the entire value of property when he knows that it will only apply to that portion of property which will be over £150,000 in value.  The rates in the White Paper start at nil on the first £30,000 for a single person, £50,000 for a married couple and there are other rates as the amounts rise.  Even if the rates in the White Paper were to remain unchanged, Deputy Haughey's suggestion is either to be interpreted as a deliberate misinterpretation of what <Col N="1153" /> is in the Paper or else there is a total misunderstanding of plain English and mathematics.</P>

      <P>The truth is that these imaginary inroads of capital, no matter what the threshold or what the rates will ultimately be, are totally without foundation.  They are not in any way as appalling or as expropriatory as Deputy Colley's rates of 40 to 55 per cent on total family fortunes at the time of death&mdash;mark you, rates which applied without any protection in respect of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey discussed the treatment of compulsory acquisition as disposals for the purpose of capital <Col N="1154" /> gains tax.  Deputy Colley referred also to compulsory purchase orders tonight.  If the proceeds of a compulsory acquisition were to be reinvested in a similar trade or industry no tax liability would arise.  Where is the injustice?  There is none.  If a person sells off an asset and reinvests it in an appropriate trade or business there is no question of subjecting that to a capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>We have been anxious at all times to ensure justice and that is what we are doing.  I am not surprised to hear those criticisms from a party which has charged Deputy Colley and Deputy Haughey with the obligation of opposing a capital gains tax.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey and Deputy Moore referred to the cost of servicing the public debt which falls as a charge on the current budget. This is considerable.  As we borrow more in order to improve the economy it is likely to rise.  The figure for the coming year is £155 million.  Of that figure a sum of £38.7 million represents Sinking Funds for the redemption of debts.  As most of this is not required for immediate redemption purposes, it can, and will be, used for financing the capital budget in accordance with practice which Deputy Colley and his predecessors followed, thereby reducing our other borrowing requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the interest element, the Exchequer generally recovers tax on much of the amounts paid, either from the income of individual investors or from the profits of institutional investors.  The cost of debt service cannot, and should not, be viewed in isolation.  It represents the main cost of financing the large scale public investment which is essential if we are to provide employment, new opportunities for employment, to raise the standard of living and provide our people with essential housing. It should be remembered by those who apparently resent public expenditure, <Col N="1155" /> and consider that all expenditure should be in the private sector, that the main beneficiary of expenditure in the public sector is, in fact, the private sector.  They are the people who spend money; they are the contractors who build; they are the factories who produce; they are the hotels who make a living out of tourism, and so forth.  A great deal of this benefit, therefore, spins off in the private sector and is also returned to the Exchequer in the form of revenue.</P>
    <P>Tonight, Deputy Colley referred again to the receipts from last year's National Loan.  I said at the time that the loan was less than we hoped. Apparently Deputy Colley, now that he has left financial circles, does not bother to read the stock market, does not know what is happening on the international money market, does not realise that interest rates here have risen by 4 percentage points since this time last year and does not know that fixed long-term securities everywhere are feeling the pinch.  The truth is that this is what is happening everywhere. Far from our National Loan last year being an indication of lack of confidence, it was a fair indication of considerable confidence in the Government that we should have done so well in the light of what happened two days after the National Loan was floated.</P>
    <P>I would recall for the House that what happened was that Britain, two days after we had floated our national loan, went into a state of panic following the November trade figures and jumped her rate of interest to a level which naturally upset the flow of funds into our loan.  But for the first time in our history, instead of withdrawing the loan as had happened on previous occasions when there was similar market disturbance, I decided that the right thing to do was to improve the terms of the loan and I was fully justified in this by what happened subsequently.  Were we to go on the market today in Dublin, or London, or New York, Tokyo or anywhere else, we would have to do so on terms which would be a lot less favourable than those on which <Col N="1156" /> we took up last year's loan.  In the circumstances, it was an extremely good return, and Deputy Colley knows well that that was the view of all informed sources in Dublin at the time and ever since.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would this not be a good time for the Minister to tell us about the capital programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the question of agricultural credit which was raised by a number of speakers during the debate.  I want to rebut a falsehood which is being spread regarding agricultural credit.  There is no shortage of credit for agriculture. The Agricultural Credit Corporation have received more money this year than last year.  We are providing for the ACC in the period April to December, 1974, £34 million.  The money which they expended in the same period last year was £29 million. We are, therefore, providing an increase of 17 per cent.</P>
      <P>We accept there will be a high demand for agricultural credit for some years ahead.  The Government will ensure that this demand is met from all available resources.  However, it would be wrong to assume that the growth in demand will be at the same rate as it was in the past few years because, as every sensible person knows, there was a very rapid growth in anticipation of very substantially improved opportunities in the EEC. That was very properly and adequately fed, and we have reached a plateau, as it were, but it is a plateau which will continue to ascend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, it is very interesting to note that people like the Editor of <i>The Farmers Journal</i> have commented that it was right that the ACC should consolidate their position this year, should take a look at the situation and take account of the fact that the demand for a growth in agricultural credit was unlikely to be what it was in recent years.  Notwithstanding the fact that people like the Editor of <i>The Farmers Journal</i>, who is an independent commentator, has said that the appropriate thing for the ACC to do would be to stop growing and to consolidate, we have provided for <Col N="1157" /> further progress and we consider this is a justifiable policy.</P>
    <P>It is worth observing, lest the critics now forget, that net lendings by the AAC increased from £7 million in 1970-71 to £24 million in the following year and by a further £16 million to more than £40 million in 1973-74.  There has been no attempt by us to reduce the demand.  Indeed we provided a substantial increase last year.  The interesting thing about it is that we provided last year £5 million more than the ACC were able to place.  As far as we are concerned, there has been no shortfall for agricultural development.</P>
    <P>It is also important to remember that the ACC are not the only source of credit for agriculture.  Total credit owed by farmers is estimated at £225 million of which £145 million is owed to the banks and £80 million to the ACC.  Obviously, the banking system will and should remain a very important source of farmer credit.  Farmers' incomes have increased dramatically in recent years and they will certainly continue to improve.  For this reason, as the years go on farmers will have more funds available for reinvestment.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that apart from the £34 million available from the ACC for a nine-month period, there is also £20 million extra available in grants from the Exchequer to encourage capital investment in agriculture&mdash;7.3 million in capital grants and £11 million for other purposes such as disease eradication, fertiliser subsidies and arterial drainage &mdash;and last year the ACC were provided with £8 million from the Exchequer's resources with the assistance of the Central Bank.  This is another clear indication of the Government's readiness to provide the agricultural community with all the credit they can usefully and productively use.  We will ensure that this policy of ours will be continued.  We are also satisfied that all this assistance which we give, together with foreign borrowings from the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, will ensure that the agricultural community here will have all the credit that is required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> I would suggest to the mischievous people who are arguing to the contrary that it is time for them now to stop their mischief, to stop trying to discourage people from using capital that can be used productively.</P>
    <P>There was criticism from Deputy Haughey about the control exercised by the Central Bank over capital inflows. I was surprised to hear this from Deputy Haughey because as a former Minister for Finance he knows something about the working of the system.  First of all, it was not in the days of this Government that the Central Bank imposed a requirement that 50 per cent of all net inflows of funds into the commercial banks from abroad should be deposited with the Central Bank.  This system was imposed in February, 1973 when the ordinary bank liquidity ratios were raised.  The purpose of this measure was to slow down the over-rapid expansion of credit which was taking place.  This led to a 30 per cent increase in 1972-73.  The restriction certainly had a moderating effect and credit has not increased at the same runaway rate in 1973-74.  The Central Bank has been keeping the position under review but its considered view is that it would not be justified in easing the measures while inflationary pressures remain so strong.  I was glad to notice that Deputy Colley was very much of the same view when he spoke on the budget.</P>
    <P>The commercial banks could undoubtedly place foreign funds advantageously on the domestic market, but were they to do so without some form of discipline and control it would worsen the national position.  However, I know a case can be made to give special consideration to major industrial development projects of which, we are glad to say, there are now several in the pipeline.  This is a matter which will be looked into.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey, if I understood him correctly, said State bodies can go abroad to borrow whenever they like and he suggested that there is a restriction on the private sector which did not apply to State bodies.  That is a statement which somebody who had not been Minister for Finance could be excused for making but Deputy <Col N="1159" /> Haughey knows that borrowing by State bodies is taken into account in setting the public capital programme &mdash;that State bodies are not free to engage in borrowing abroad unless it meets with the approval of the Minister for Finance who has to ensure that the borrowing is in accordance with national economic and social requirements.</P>
    <P>Some criticism was offered in the debate of my statement that the present time is not a suitable one to publish a four-year programme for economic development and social improvement. We should love to be able to publish such a programme but such a programme could only be as good as the assumptions on which it would be based and nobody but a lunatic would contemplate seriously issuing a programme when there are such a multitude of uncertainties in the international economic and monetary fields.  I have said, and I repeat, that we are pursuing facts.  We want to get the facts right and we are discussing with the National Economic and Social Research Council, a body which shares with the Government a desire to publish such a programme, how best to go about this exercise.</P>
    <P>One thing we must avoid is adding to the cynicism and to the disappointment caused by the failures particularly of the second and third programmes of the previous Administration. Nothing would be more injurious to our confidence and to proper planning than to issue a programme based upon assumptions which within a month could be shown to be totally wrong.  We are continuing our work and our study in this field and we feel satisfied it will be possible before the end of the year to publish a programme which will command respect and will be possible of achievement.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear Deputy Lynch, leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, who was followed by most of his minions in criticism of the social welfare improvements in the budget.  Deputy Lynch suggested they were inadequate but I want to show how this can easily be refuted.  Since this Government took office Exchequer expenditure on social welfare has all but <Col N="1160" /> doubled.  The total Exchequer expenditure has all but doubled in a matter of 14 or 15 months from £92 million in 1972-73 to £172 million in the 12 months to March next.  The old age pension is now available at 68.  It remained at 70 years from 1908 to 1973. It had to wait for the National Coalition to come into office to shift the qualifying age from 70.</P>
    <P>The amount of the contributory pension for a couple aged 68 years or over has risen from £10.35 to £15 per week under this Administration, a rise of 45 per cent.  The maximum rate of non-contributory pension for a couple of similar age has risen from £10.30 to £14.60 per week, a rise of 42 per cent.  As well all know, the means test has been radically and substantially eased by disregarding the first £5 of assessed means.  If one had earned one penny before something was knocked off the old age pension. Now one can earn £5 per week before anything is deducted.  This has given a higher increase over the same period both in money and percentage terms to those who hitherto had their pension really sliced if they had any alternative source of revenue.  Even if it was only £1 per night earned for baby sitting their pension was miserably cut.  Such was the attitude of the then Government towards providing old people with some support and some dignity in their old age.</P>
    <P>The monthly children's allowance for a three-child family has risen from £4.25 a month to £9.65 a month, that is more than double.  A married man with three children drawing unemployment benefit will receive £19 per week from next July plus a substantially pay-related supplement compared with £13 per week a mere 14 months ago. Of course, we are providing all these increases, not from the October following the budget, but from the July following the budget.</P>
    <P>That is not the whole picture but yet we are told this is inadequate.  Many whose need previously went completely unprovided for such as the deserted wives, unmarried mothers, wives of prisoners and elderly single women in poor circumstances, are now being looked after as well as the adult dependant for old age non-contributory <Col N="1161" /> pensioners.  We are providing a special scheme of allowance for severely handicapped children.  We are stopping the complete scandal of a system under which a person could receive about £10 for himself and his dependant wife if he was under 70 years of age but the moment he reached 70 years of age he received less than £7 per week to support himself and his wife.  In addition, we have abolished a large number of vexatious restrictive regulations which had been applied to existing schemes for decades past.  We did no more in those matters than fulfil what we argued for from those Opposition benches as being possible of fulfilment.  We are not asking for any credit but we are just contrasting for the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should now like to deal with some of the economic arguments advanced in the course of this debate.  Last year's budget was, we said, an expansionary budget.  We were told by Fianna Fáil critics, by Deputy Lynch, Deputy Haughey and Deputy Colley, that it was too expansionary; that we were going to cripple the economy and we would not be able to afford it.  We were told that we would have a massive deficit which we could not meet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to show that the allegation that there was a slow down in growth last year is without foundation.  Employment in transportable goods industries in the second half of last year was 4,500 higher than the first half of the year.  At the end of 1973 employment in those industries was about 7,000 higher than it was at the end of 1972.  As a reflection of this increase in employment the number <Col N="1162" /> on the live register of unemployed at the end of 1973 showed a drop of over 6,000 compared with the end of 1972.  This indicates a very marked improvement compared with the decline of 2,100 between mid-January, 1972 and mid-January, 1973.  The comparison is that we did 8,200 better.</P>
      <P>Merchandise exports also continued to expand throughout 1973 and into 1974.  In the second half of the year the increase was 20 per cent over the level of the first half.  In the case of industrial exports the increase was 13 per cent and the fourth quarter increase on the corresponding quarter of 1973 was 36 per cent for all merchandise and 38 per cent for industrial exports.  This expansionary trend has continued into the first quarter of 1974 when the year on year increase in total exports was almost 33 per cent and the increase in industrial exports was 37 per cent.</P>
      <P>Imports were also rising but there was never in increased imports such a large quantity attributable to further production and to capital equipment.  The value of materials for further production in Irish industry in the second half of 1973 imported increased by 10 per cent over the first half while producer capital goods increased by 6 per cent over the first first half.  In the first quarter of 1974 the value of imports of materials for further production was 33 per cent greater on average than in the second half of 1973.  The corresponding increase in produced capital goods imports was 18 per cent.  All this period of very significant progress would not have taken place had we not had an expansionary budget, if we had not had that budget which Fianna Fáil rejected as unsound, as unwise.  If we did not provide the extra stimulus in this year's budget we could not maintain that programme; in fact, we would have something in the nature of an economic slump.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The official external reserves rose between the end of June, 1973, and the end of December, 1973, by £35 million to £435 million, despite the widening of the merchandise trade gap and the increase in the balance <Col N="1163" /> of payments deficit in 1973.  The net capital inflow amounted to about £90 million during 1973, reflecting continued external confidence, and, as I have pointed out already, the level of external reserves continues to rise, and in March alone this year the net capital inflow was £34 million.</P>
    <P>There was a very substantial increase in investments in the second half of 1973, which is being carried through in the first quarter of 1974. Needless to say, this confidence is very much reflected in the housing industry where we achieved, notwithstanding our begrudging opponents, the target of 25,000 houses within a year of attaining office, although the base figure was not 21,000, as our opponents suggested before the election, but 18,000; yet we achieved that magnificent increase against all the odds.</P>
    <P>Business optimism, notwithstanding the gloomy forecasts from the Fianna Fáil benches and the mischief lobby, is on the increase, and this is evidenced by the fact that 74 per cent of the people replying to the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Economic and Social Research Institute quarterly industrial survey intend to have higher capital investment in 1974, compared with 56 per cent replying to that effect in the same quarter of 1973, and only 49 per cent in the first quarter of 1973.</P>
    <P>These are the facts as distinct from the rumour-making and mischief-making of a party that does not know where it is going, which has shown in this debate, as in last year's debate, a complete conflict of policy, a complete conflict of attitude.  There are some members opposite who have spoken in principle in favour of the taxing of farmers' profits and, in fairness to them, I want to include in that category Deputy Jack Lynch, the Leader of the Opposition, but then he is at loggerheads with Deputy Haughey who considers the taxation of farmers bizarre and unjustifiable.</P>

The truth is that as a result of our decision and as a result of the policies which we are following, we are likely to be one of the more fortunate countries in Europe in 1974.  There is no other country at the moment in Europe which is ready to forecast the growth rate which we now anticipate, and we shall find ourselves quite contrary to past experience under Fianna Fáil Administrations, now at the top of the league of the most successful, the most progressive economic entities in Europe.  That is because we are following progressively successful policies, successful economically, and progressive and equitable socially.  We shall not be put off this course by the little begrudgers from the Fianna Fáil benches, and we are certain that we shall be vindicated once again no matter what difficulties may blow our way.  Unfortunately, there will be difficulties in the year ahead.  We have never run away from them.  We shall deal with them as they come along. We shall operate a flexible policy.  We shall operate a pragmatic policy.  We shall not be put off by the people with whom apparently Fianna Fáil want to consort, that is the people who do not understand the real needs and the real demands of the Irish people.  We shall produce an equitable system of taxation.  We shall expand the economy.  There will be more cake available for everybody.  The result is everybody will be better off.</P>

      <P>It is not possible from available statistics to give the information sought by the Deputy about imports of cabinet-type heaters.  Compilation of this information would entail a disproportionate expenditure of time and labour.  As regards rates of duty applicable to such heaters these may come under any one of a large number of tariff headings depending, for example, on type of fuel used, material of which made and whether for domestic or non-domestic use.  If the Deputy would furnish further information in this regard, I will arrange to have an answer supplied on this point of the question.</P>
