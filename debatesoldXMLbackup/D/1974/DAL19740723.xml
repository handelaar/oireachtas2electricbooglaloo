      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I have asked returning officers to furnish certain statistical information in relation to postal voting at the local elections.  The information has not yet been received from all areas. The postal voting system is being reviewed in the light of experience at the local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in the light of the experience of the local elections it would be advisable to make more time available for people to apply for the postal vote?  In the last local elections people had to apply within a matter of two or three days.  Would the Minister not agree that a longer period should be given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree. People had quite a long time to send in the votes.  At a general election it would not be possible to give much longer time.  However, the matter is under review and I can assure the Deputy there will be a number of changes.  Incidentally, I would ask for suggestions in writing from any Deputies who would like to see some changes.  I shall be very glad to take cognisance of their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the operation of the postal vote generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather a difficult question.  In the areas I know well it seemed to work satisfactorily.  However, I received complaints from places such as Cork where the system did not work so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister could not be satisfied with the operation of the scheme?  It was wide open to abuse.  Would the Minister not consider that the receipt for the vote should be witnessed as well as the application for the vote?  Local authorities are not handwriting experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's assurance that things were not all right in Galway also.  I consider it <Col N="1635" /> will be necessary to tighten up considerably on the arrangements but I should not like to say at present what should be done.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the number <Col N="1636" /> of small farm dwellings of under £5 valuation built by the following local authorities from 1968 to date: Mayo, Galway, Donegal, Clare and Kerry County Councils.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the special scheme for the housing of small farmers the valuation of whose land holdings is £5 or less and, as the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the inability of Dublin Corporation to cope with the many serious problems arising from the presence of many caravans and other mobile homes in the west Finglas area, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are problems arising in the west Finglas area and that there may be difficulty in dealing with them.  Wide powers to control temporary dwellings and camping are available under both planning and sanitary services legislation and it is a matter for Dublin Corporation to apply these powers as may be appropriate to the situation. In so far as pressures in the area are related to the tendency of travelling families to drift towards the larger cities and towns, I would remind the Deputy that I have recently written to all county and city managers asking them to work out programmes for the accommodation of such families in their areas.  They have been advised that the services of the adviser on the programme for the accommodation of travelling people are available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that perhaps some of the families in question would not welcome accommodation, that they are mindful of the cheap accommodation they have at the expense of the local residents in the west Finglas area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but I would point out to the Deputy that the local sanitary authorities have adequate powers under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948 to control the erection or retention of temporary dwellings.  Under section 21 of that Act, a sanitary authority may, by order, prohibit the erection or retention of any such dwelling. This includes caravans, tents and so on.  In fact, a prohibition order under the section was made in respect of the west Finglas area on 8th June, 1970.  It is a matter for the local authorities to carry out the regulations they have made.  They have the authority to do so.</P>

    <Col N="1637" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the city manager has indicated his inability to cope with this menace?  Further, would he accept that the feelings of the local community may be such that they will take their own way in dealing with this matter?  I am sure the Minister will agree this would be undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regret very much if any local group would take the law into their own hands.  It is not good enough for people in charge of a local authority to say they are unable to deal with the matter.  They have the statutory powers to deal with it and it is up to the elected representatives to ensure that those powers are used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the fine imposed on a person or persons who abuses the area in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the actual fines here but I am sure the court would deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only £1.  That is very cheap accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">

      <P>I would not like the Minister or the House to be under the illusion that this is just a problem for west Finglas.  This is a problem throughout the length and breadth of County Dublin.  What action is the Minister going to take on a county and city wide basis?  There is no use quoting the law because where are you going to send them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state the terms of the circular which accompanies the notification of capital allocations under the Housing Authorities (Loans for Acquisition or Construction of Houses) (Amendment) Regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the practice to issue a separate circular to local authorities in each financial year conveying the capital allocations for the payment within the year of house purchase and reconstruction loans and supplementary grants.  The circular for the nine months ending on the 31st December next will be issued shortly and I will arrange to have a copy of it sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report the text of the circular on the subject which issued to local authorities on 8th June, 1973.</P>
      <P>Following is the text of the circular:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Housing Loans and Supplementary Grants Capital Allocation, 1973/74</i>
      </P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>1.  I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to inform you that the capital allocation to the local authority for the payment of house-purchase and reconstruction loans and supplementary housing grants in 1973/74 is £&mdash;&mdash;.</P>
      <P>2.  The allocation is made subject to the following conditions:</P>
      <P>(i)  draws made on&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  loans from the Local Loans Fund;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> (b)  loans from other sources, and</P>
    <P>(c)  amounts used from internal capital resources of the local authority (see para. 4 below) in the course of the financial year 1973/74 may not exceed the amount of the allocation;</P>
    <P>(ii)  any credit balance on an account at 31st March, 1973 will be spent in 1973/74 in addition to the amount of the allocation.</P>
    <P>3.  The amount of the allocation to individual authorities is subject to review in the normal way during the year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Use of internal capital resources</i>
    </P>
    <P>4.  It is estimated that housing capital receipts including special prepayments of house-purchase loans amounted to about 12% of the capital allocation in the financial year 1972/73 and the Minister considers that all such special prepayments during the current financial year should as far as possible be devoted to expenditure on these services. Accordingly, the allocations now notified have been determined on the basis that at least 12% will be derived from such sources and that the balance will be raised by borrowing from the Local Loans Fund and other sources.  Each authority is requested to examine specially the extent to which it will be possible to finance its capital allocation from internal capital receipts and to forward the results of this examination to the Department as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Loans from the Local Loans Fund</i>
    </P>
    <P>5.  In accordance with normal practice, the Minister is prepared to consider applications for loans for amounts up to the equivalent of the estimated expenditure of each authority on each service for amounts which, together with any credit balances on accounts, undrawn balances of loans already sanctioned and internal capital receipts will be sufficient to finance the authority's <Col N="1643" /> expenditure for a period of eighteen months in advance.  In particular, local authorities should ensure that loan applications for which sanction will be required in 1973/74 are submitted for sanction <i>not later than 30th September next</i>.  In this connection, local authorities should ensure that loan fees are paid without delay, on receipt of receivable orders from the office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>6.  Application forms submitted to the Office of Public Works for a draw on foot of an approved loan should be fully completed, with particular regard to loan numbers, reference numbers, etc.</P>
    <P>
      <i>General</i>
    </P>
    <P>7.  Loans for previously-occupied houses should continue to be made only to borrowers who are unable to obtain loans from commercial agencies and whose circumstances otherwise necessitate their being rehoused by the local authority.</P>
    <P>8.  Housing authorities in areas where commercial agencies do not operate extensively are reminded that they may advance house-purchase loans without reference to the usual income/rateable valuation limits provided that such loans are financed from a source other than the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>9.  Subject to the foregoing, the local authority may process individual applications for loans and grants on the assumption that the allocation for these services for 1974/75 will, if required, be of the same general order as the allocation now notified to them for 1973/ 74.</P>
    <P>10.  Any telephone enquiries relating to this circular letter may be made to (01) 787199, extension 157.</P>

      <P>I have seen Press reports concerning protests by owners and drivers of public hire vehicles in Limerick city arising out of the issue of licences to persons not previously licensed.  Last year, I decided that applications for such licences should be made on an annual basis. The licences recently granted number 26 compared with 36 granted in the previous year.

This resulted in a number who might have come in during the year not coming in but those who were determined to come in made preparation for that particular fortnight. There is the question of supply and demand and because a number of taxi men go out of business through ill-health, death and various other reasons the number is not growing. We have received complaints from the tourist organisations that there are not enough taxis.  I am trying to keep a happy medium and I prefer to leave it at the once-yearly renewal instead of doing what has been suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as leisure facilities involve the use of land in new residential areas or in existing districts which are being redeveloped, it is a matter for the planning authority to avail of their powers under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their development plan, they may zone or reserve lands for a variety of purposes which would encourage the better use of leisure time and may determine the provision and siting of recreational and other facilities. Such objectives may be secured partly through the control and regulation of private development and partly by the use of the authority's own specific powers to acquire land and provide facilities for recreation and other leisure activities.  While development plans are not subject to approval by me, I have indicated my views on the subject; for example, I have stressed <Col N="1652" /> on several occasions the need for local authorities to make adequate provision for recreational facilities and to have full regard to the overall environment in future housing development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of the application of the rates recommended by Devlin.  The position was that last year the increases consisted of the pre-1973 Act rate increased by the 12th and 13th rounds, with the Devlin proposals as a ceiling, plus the first phase of the 14th round on top of the pre-1973 Act rate.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The discrepancies were as great on the last occasion where the Parliamentary Secretary's rate went, in relative terms, ahead of the rates paid to any other office holders.  The application of these formulae, for which we have no responsibility, as we inherited them from our predecessors, produces this situation, which overall does not produce any change from the Devlin rates as upgraded by the rounds increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of personal satisfaction does not arise.  What has happened is that the rates as recommended by Devlin have been applied, the Devlin Review Body having been established by our predecessors for the purpose of asking an independent body to ascertain what should be the appropriate rates of remuneration for various office holders.  To depart from that in respect of any particular office holder, be that person a parliamentary office holder or an office holder in the public service, would be a breach of the disciplines which it was considered appropriate to develop, and that was simply to have the rates fixed by an independent arbitrator.  Wherever difficulties arise it is open to have these reconsidered from time to time.  It will be recalled that one of the recommendations in the review body's report was that these matters should be referred to them from time to time for reassessment, and no doubt this and other problems will be referred to them in due course.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that about 730,000 individuals were effectively liable to income tax in 1973-74.  The reliefs announced in the budget were such as to remove about 60,000 of those from the tax net.  The number of individuals <Col N="1662" /> who will be effectively liable to income tax for 1974-75 will not be known until some time after the end of the year, when particulars regarding assessments made in the year and other relevant information on which the estimates can be based become available. It is not possible therefore to say at this stage how many extra taxpayers will become liable in the course of the current income tax year.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the new personal allowances for income tax however it can be stated that no person in receipt of an old age pension, contributory or non-contributory even at the maximum rates, will have to pay income tax in respect of such pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people, like CIE employees, who have received increases as a result of his budget are now finding that portion of that has to go back by way of income tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because we know on a certain day that there are so many taxpayers.  We are not in a position to know how many taxpayers there may be, for example, on 5th April next year.  It will depend upon the rates of income which they are earning at that time whether or not they come within the tax net.

      <P>Mayo County Council have requested the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake a preliminary examination under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, with a view to preparation of a coast protection scheme for Kilcummin, County Mayo.

It was implied that this particular work was before the Commissioners of Public Works for examination but that is not so.  When the proposal was placed before the Commissioners of Public Works it did not fully comply with the statutory conditions, which are very complex and complicated.  That is the reason why this particular proposal has not been considered up to this.  From experience I can say that a very long period can elapse between the proposal being examined, considered and sanctioned, and work commencing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a railing that is in question.  I will give the Deputy the information I have here.  In 1972, a railing was erected by the Commissioners of Public Works along the boundary of the Phoenix Park extension to St. Mary's Avenue, The Ranch, Ballyfermot.  The railing was intended to replace an existing stone wall which had been breached in a number of places and was generally in a poor condition.  Dublin Corporation had asked that the wall should be replaced by a railing in order to improve the environment of The Ranch.  The corporation also requested that the railing should be set back about four feet from the wall so that a footpath could be constructed alongside it.  The commissioners agreed to this on condition that the corporation would remove the wall and construct the footpath at their own expense.  Although the railing has been in position for over a year, the corporation have made no move to carry out their part of the agreement. They will be pressed to have the wall removed as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1.  To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Under this section, interest payable to investors in registered building societies shall be exempted from the charge to income tax.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is clear on the face of the amendment that it is designed to ensure that income tax at present levied on deposits with building societies will no longer be levied.  I know from a previous discussion in another place that the Minister has taken the view that this would be inequitable having regard to the fact that income tax is levied on investments other than building societies.  There is in operation and there has been for many years a special arrangement in regard to income tax on investment in building societies, the practical effect of which is that the normal rate of income tax is not levied on the interest paid by building societies to investors.  Therefore there is, and has been for a long time, a precedent for special treatment of income tax in relation to interest on building society deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> Over and above that, there is the fact that the house-building programme is a major national priority and the adoption of this amendment would contribute very substantially to an improvement in our efforts in the house-building field.  It would improve the situation from two points of view: first, the adoption of this amendment would enable building societies to reduce the interest they charge to borrowers by at least 1½ per cent.  Some people argue 2 per cent, but we are prepared to settle for a figure of 1½ per cent.  This is a matter of major significance to those who have to borrow money from building societies. In addition, it would lead to a substantial inflow of funds to building societies.  Both these results are extremely desirable and, indeed, necessary in our present situation in which the building construction industry from the point of view of providing homes is, to say the least of it, in some jeopardy.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us to do everything possible in order to improve the situation.  This amendment presents a method which is not unduly expensive from the point of view of the Exchequer, having regard to the results which can be achieved, namely, a substantial reduction in repayments by borrowers and in stepping up the flow of money to building societies, thereby enabling loans to be obtained by potential borrowers who at the moment simply cannot obtain loans; there are some hundreds, if not thousands, of houses lying unsold because of this inability on the part of borrowers with a consequent disruption of the whole building industry and a threat of redundancy to employees in that industry.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I believe this amendment has an overwhelming case for it.  The argument against it, that it would be inequitable, is somewhat academic having regard to the fact, as I said earlier, that there has been for a long time special treatment given to the interest paid to depositors in building societies from the point of view of income tax.  For all of these reasons, I hope the Minister will see his way to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  It is directed solely at this <Col N="1686" /> area of building societies and not at any other area of investment.  The purpose of it is to try to solve the twin problems in the situation: first, there is the borrower who is unable to get money because the building societies have not got it and, secondly, the aim is to encourage building societies to create a fresh flow of funds so that they will be able to process loans for borrowers wishing to purchase their own homes.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Colley said, we are anxious also to relieve the very serious condition in which builders find themselves in a number of our cities, with houses lying empty on their hands, houses they cannot sell because borrowers are not able to get money from the building societies.  This is a reasonable amendment and, if accepted, I believe it will achieve the aim for which it is designed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost to the general body of taxpayers, if Deputy Colley's amendment were accepted, would be £5 million and the beneficiaries would not be the purchasers of houses through building society mortgages but the very well-to-do who would invest large sums in building societies in order to avoid liability to income tax.  It would be an anti-social measure.  It would be against what we are endeavouring to achieve: equity in the system of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact must be faced that money, like any other commodity, has its price and anybody who borrows must pay the going rate.  There is no such thing anywhere as cheap money in the context of the economic and financial circumstances prevailing throughout the world.  Money is like water; it finds its own level.  If an interest rate is not offered to investors sufficient to attract money then that money will go elsewhere. If this Government, or any other democratic government, has reason to float a loan or borrow money it must offer a competitive and attractive rate of interest or it will not succeed in getting the money required.  Again, public bodies or private individuals who borrow money for business purposes, for the establishment of industries, the provision of employment, the provision of housing, or any <Col N="1687" /> other purpose, cannot expect to get the money unless they are willing to pay interest at the current market price.  If money is drawn away for one particular purpose it will be so much less money available for other purposes. There is at the moment an exceptionally high rate of interest across the world because the supply of money is not sufficient to meet the demand. This problem is being aggravated very seriously by the grave imbalance in money markets as a consequence of the exceptionally high charges for oil by oil producing countries.  World-wide inflation is shoving up interest rates.  It is not any factor within our own domestic environment that is shoving up interest rates.  This is a harsh but inescapable economic fact of life and it must be faced by everybody, irrespective of the purpose for which he seeks money, and that includes all those people desirous of getting money to purchase houses.</P>
    <P>Building societies and other financial institutions can provide only so much money as they can attract and they will not attract money if they do not offer a competitive rate of interest.  Very few investors are philanthropists and people will not invest money in building societies unless they get what they regard as an attractive rate of interest; if they do not get an attractive rate they will put their money where they will get a higher rate of interest, provided there is no risk.  This is a factor many people do not take into account and possibly some of the recent collapses of what were considered to be reputable financial institutions abroad in recent times might persuade some people that it is against their own interests to be perpetually chasing high rates of interest.  They might see merit in investing their savings in reputable building societies which are safe and which are based upon resources which themselves are continually appreciating.</P>
    <P>The building societies are anxious to get further release at the expense of somebody else&mdash;perhaps of this mythical body called the Exchequer. It is well for everybody to remember <Col N="1688" /> that there is no goldmine in Merrion Street.  The suspicion seems to exist that there is a goldmine, but no Minister for Finance ever found one there.  Any money provided by the State, including the £5 million which would be required to accept the amendment of Deputy Colley, would have to be taken from the general body of taxpayers.  There is no other source whereby Revenue could make good the loss if Deputy Colley's amendment were accepted.</P>
    <P>The building societies are receiving a number of very substantial forms of assistance from the State which means that they are receiving assistance at the expense of the general body of taxpayers.  They receive assistance in the form of income tax concessions both for their depositors and savers and for the borrowers.  They are totally exempt from corporation profits tax.  At present these concessions are costing in the region of £6 million per annum.  There is also significant and unique direct assistance from the Exchequer in the form of a subsidy costing £2.4 million annually. The Exchequer is also subsidising a very specially favourable borrowing arranged by the Government with the Associated Banks.  This makes it possible for the societies to pay 1 per cent extra to the depositors while keeping the rate to 1¼ per cent less than borrowers would have to pay otherwise.</P>
    <P>The total State aid to building societies today is in the region of £9 million.  I do not consider that we would be justified in asking the hard-pressed taxpayers to render further assistance.  We are seeking to ease still more the borrowing problems of the building societies.  We are seeking &mdash;and feel confident that we will succeed in getting&mdash;more moneys for house purchasers.  Whether that money becomes available through building societies or the ordinary bank system does not matter as long as it becomes available for house purchase That should be our objective.  We should achieve it, if possible, without imposing further burdens on the ordinary taxpayers.  This is the right approach.  We would be doing an injustice if we were to pretend that we <Col N="1689" /> could wipe away all the difficulties by fiddling around with the tax system.  It is the rich who would benefit most. It could have a very damaging effect on the whole money supply position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be clearly seen that the Coalition Government have no interest in the person who wants to buy his own house.  The Minister's argument would be valid in normal circumstances in which people could get money from the financial institutions, the banks or some other agencies.  We have reached the position, as a result of Government policy, where people are not able to get money anywhere to buy their houses.  There is an example here of a small builder in Dublin who built 28 houses and got £1,000 deposit on each of them.  Of these 28 persons who paid deposits only seven got loans.  Any Government who could ignore warning signs like that and say that it is going to cost the Exchequer £5 million if our amendment were accepted are burying their heads in the sand or are deliberately endeavouring to channel all potential house-buyers away from owning their own houses.</P>
      <P>I think also to use this spurious argument that this would benefit only the rich is playing the type of politics which we have come to expect from the Minister for Finance.  The people who would benefit in the main from this amendment would be the people who want to buy their own houses. They are mostly young people who want to set up their homes.  If we ignore these basic institutions, namely, the building societies, this will have repercussions throughout the whole economy.  The £5 million which the Minister talks about will be a very small amount in relation to the damage that his attitude will result in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have arrived at a serious situation when we find that after the local authorities have advanced loans the banks are not even giving bridging loans following the letters from the local authorities.  The Minister, who said earlier that there was no goldmine in Merrion Street&mdash;which we accept&mdash;should tell us where potential <Col N="1690" /> house-buyers will get the money to buy their houses.  We, recognising this problem, tried in some way by this amendment to alleviate the problem which exists.  The problem affects the house purchasers, the builders and the people employed in the building industry. Concern is being expressed on all sides about the importance of the building industry to the economy and yet the Government are talking about anti-social measures if this amendment were adopted.  Could anything be further from the truth?  This would be a most social measure.  It would encourage people to buy their own houses at competitive rates of interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the vast sums that would be invested in the building societies as a result of the acceptance of this amendment.  Perhaps the Minister is right.  I personally would welcome the day when people would invest in the building societies. This would be the soundest possible barometer of the vitality of our economy.  The only conclusion one can draw from the attitude of the Minister is that there is an ideological tug-of-war going on in the Government in regard to private ownership and municipal ownership.  Obviously the left-wingers are winning.</P>
    <P>We would ask the Minister to use his common sense at this stage and ensure that the building industry does not collapse because of lack of finance.  The Minister's acceptance of this amendment would be a positive step towards ensuring that we do not bring about this type of calamity.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Everybody knows that building societies are starved for money.  If one goes around this town one will see a number of young married couples trying to get house loans.  If one reads the reports in the newspapers one will realise the deplorable state which exists in the housing construction industry.  It is obvious that there are no loans available at present for house builders.</P>
      <P>When we tabled this amendment our intention was to encourage money into building societies.  When one realises the high rates of interest paid by certain financial institutions one can understand that the building societies will find it very difficult to encourage people to invest under the present circumstances.  The Minister is very unwise not to accept this amendment.  When house purchasers go to other financial institutions for loans they are charged interest at prohibitive rates.  Because of inflation, borrowers will not be able to repay these loans unless the Minister takes practical steps.  Today borrowers are paying one-third of their salaries for loans.  This cannot continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I get the impression that the Minister is not concerned about the private building trade.  He appears to be interested only in local authority <Col N="1694" /> housing.  By accepting this amendment he will be helping the building societies by making more money available to them.  Then people will be able to get loans at reasonable rates.  If this amendment is not accepted less money will be invested in the building societies.  More houses will be completed but nobody will buy them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">

      <P>I was surprised when I heard Deputy Desmond's contribution. I was not surprised when the Minister tried to put up a smoke screen by implying that this amendment was intended to subsidise the wealthy.  I would accept the arguments put forward against that form of subsidisation.  That is not the object of the resolution.  I think Deputy Desmond makes a mistake in accepting the manner in which the Minister replied to the arguments on this amendment.  The object of the amendment is purely and simply to enable building societies reduce the interest rate chargeable to borrowers.  I am sure Deputy Desmond has attended at least as many resident association and ratepayers' meetings as I have, since we represent similar constituencies, and that he must be aware of the problem facing existing borrowers of money from building societies because of increasing mortgage interest rates.  He must also be aware that in the private sector the whole building programme is slowly coming to a halt because prospective purchasers of houses are not able to borrow money from building societies and that the building societies are not able to provide the money because they have not got it.  The 1½ to 2 per cent Deputy Colley mentioned, in the case of a reasonably sized loan on a house today, would amount to something between £2.50 and £3 per week. If the Minister can consider the amendment from the point of view that it should be applied only to the reduction of interest charged to borrowers from building societies, I think he will see that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the argument he put forward of subsidising millionaires and so on.  This has nothing whatsoever to do with it and was not intended in that way.</P>

    <Col N="1695" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me say I am somewhat surprised at the Minister's estimate of £5 million as the cost of this.  I would have put the figure somewhat lower.  However, if we accept that the cost would be £5 million, I wonder has the Minister considered the fact that the adoption of this resolution could well save the Exchequer a great deal more than £5 million, because unless some method is found whereby we can ensure an adequate supply of money for the building of houses, the direct cost to the Exchequer of the breakdown and redundancies that will occur&mdash;the loss of income tax, VAT and various other forms of revenue&mdash;would far exceed £5 million.  Therefore, purely on the question of cost, I think the Minister is mistaken in imagining that he should have regard only to the direct cost of this without having regard to the cost in the other direction if this amendment is not accepted.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the only beneficiaries of this would be depositors in building societies.  Indeed, if he did not say it, he implied that all these people would be very wealthy, a fact we know is simply not true.  But we know also that the beneficiaries in this case would be primarily, as Deputy Brugha said those who are repaying loans on their houses and who are put to the pin of their collar to meet those repayments.  They would be the first people to benefit by the reduction in interest.  Secondly, thousands of people at present employed in the building industry whose jobs are at risk at present would be beneficiaries of the provisions of this amendment if it were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me to be a useless and futile exercise to be talking about equity in the taxation system if, in order to achieve that equity, one is going to produce a situation in which no loans are available to people to purchase houses.  We are very close to that situation now.  It does not matter how much denial comes from members of the Government, we all know the facts.  One has only to get in touch with any building society to find out just how difficult it is for people to get loans.  That <Col N="1696" /> is the factual position.  This amendment is designed both to ease the burden on borrowers and improve the flow of money to building societies. I agree with the Minister that I do not care from what source the money comes, whether it be from insurance companies, banks, building societies or any other, as long as there is an adequate flow of money to maintain the housing programme.</P>
    <P>But that is not the situation at the moment.  If the Minister can spell out specifically where the necessary money for the building programme, particularly the private sector, is to come from, I am quite prepared to withdraw this amendment.  I think that should indicate very clearly to Deputy Desmond at any rate, if not to the Minister, that the object of this amendment is not simply to benefit wealthy depositors.  But I suggest that the Minister is not in a position to spell out any such thing.  I would suggest that in the circumstances in the building industry and in the circumstances in regard to borrowers trying to obtain loans, it is simply not good enough to talk about idealogical notions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond amazed me in the approach he took to this.  He is concerned only with whether some people are going to avoid a certain amount of income tax and does not seem to be concerned in the least with whether there would be a reduction in repayments for borrowers and an increased flow of money for house loans.  I just cannot understand Deputy Desmond's approach to this, unless of course he is so blinded by some idealogical hang-up that he cannot see the wood for the trees.  We all know what is the situation, and unless Deputy Desmond, the Minister and other people on that side of the House come out now and tell us precisely how that situation in the building industry and the availability or non-availability of mortgages is to be remedied, they are not entitled to start prating here about equity in the taxation system while people are queuing up, at their wit's end, trying to get loans on houses.  It simply is not good enough for Deputies on the other side of the House to approach this problem in this way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" /> Deputy Desmond made a reference to the announcement by the Minister for Local Government about a further £9 million for local authorities.  Deputy Desmond should know by now that that is merely a window-dressing operation.  He knows there was no announcement about an increase in the limits either in the amounts of loans available or in the qualifying salary. That being so, it is purely a window-dressing operation.  It will not build one more house, and he should know that.</P>
    <P>We are interested in seeing that the housing programme is kept going.  We are interested also in seeing if it is possible to reduce the burden on borrowers.  We claim that this amendment is a rational approach to achieving these objectives.  We have had no answer from the other side of the House other than ideological arguments about inequity in the taxation system. In fact, it would not be unfair to summarise what Deputy Desmond was saying as that he would prefer that millions of pounds would go abroad rather than be invested in the building industry in this country, through building societies, if getting the money into the building societies&mdash;and therefore into the building of houses here&mdash; were to result in some people not paying as much income tax as they do at the moment.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is also the fact that the continued starvation of money for loans from building societies for privately-built houses will have the effect of sending people even further seeking local authority houses at far greater cost to the taxpayer than the cost of implementing this amendment. For all those reasons I would hope that the Minister and his colleagues on the other side of the House would have a little sense and would approach this in some kind of a rational down-to-earth way.</P>
    <P>The Minister should forget the theory and face the reality.  If he has a better way of dealing with it he should let us know, but if he has not he should not be talking about theoretical points while the building industry is running down and while people are at their wits end to get loans for housing.</P>

      <P>I do not think that is necessarily a desirable or an entirely undesirable end in itself. What is desirable is to encourage an inflow of funds to the building societies.  We are all anxious to do that and I am sure nobody is more anxious to do it than the Minister.  I am not at all sure that Deputy Colley's amendment would be desirable from that point of view.  There are other ways in which it could be done.  One would be through the subvention which is being granted to building societies.  It is a complicated matter, but the subvention recognises the encouragement building societies give to housing generally, to housing of a private nature, not necessarily houses for the wealthy.  Indeed, building societies usually do not cater for that type of person on account of the ceiling limit placed on the amounts of individual loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One way would be to increase that <Col N="1699" /> subvention.  Another way which would bring about the desired effect of helping to get over this famine I will come to later.  There is no doubt there is a famine in the building society world which is not now able to advance money for the purchase of houses.  We know that builders are being held up for money.  I do not want the Opposition to take any comfort, so to speak, from that because it does not arise out of Government action.  It is one of the inescapable results of the price of money and that leads to another inescapable fact, that if building societies temporarily can give better value than other financial institutions money would tend to flow into them.  Nobody wants to see a millionaire putting his money, tax free, into building societies, but the amount which an individual and his wife can put in at present could be raised.  I should be glad if the Minister would consider that between now and Report Stage. I should also like him to consider increasing the subvention because at the moment the finances of building societies, though essentially sound, are such that they can only lend the amounts which come in to them.  Like the Government, they have not a gold mine and are strictly bound by the input of investors.</P>

      <P>If I may make a point without interruption, the suggestion is that every wealthy person should invest tax free in building societies.  The suggestion is that if a person had £40,000 in the PO Savings Bank it should be taken out and put into building societies, with tax free interest. Is the Deputy seriously suggesting the Government should say to everybody with money in the Post Office or, say, in the Dublin Savings Bank, or in an insurance company: &ldquo;Release all these investments, even if they amount to £1 million, in institutional investments. banking institutions, speculatory institutions&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputies on the opposite side will clearly remember the substantial Government assistance given to the building societies with four or five strings attached.  For example, there was the embargo on loans for non-housing purposes. That is not included in the Fianna Fáil amendment.  There was also an embargo regarding the upper limit on the amount of individual loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting it is but I am telling the Deputy that the Government told the building societies they would give them a subsidy if there was an upper limit on loans, if they gave precedence to loans for new houses, and if there was an embargo on loans for non-housing purposes.  The Government made this <Col N="1701" /> approach to the building societies and it was a very substantial and costly one. The Government handed out many hundreds of thousands of pounds to subsidise interest rates.</P>
      <P>Are Fianna Fáil seriously suggesting that the most logical approach is that we abolish income tax for investors in registered building societies? I have intervened in this debate simply because I found the suggestions of the former Minister for Finance quite incredible and irresponsible.  I am as concerned about the state of the construction industry as anyone else but I do not believe it to be as disastrous as Deputy Colley suggested. There is a considerable amount of scaremongering by Fianna Fáil with regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the needs for additional capital in the building societies.  I suggest Fianna Fáil Deputies should go to an ordinary cumann meeting and tell an ordinary member that he must pay his income tax while another Fianna Fáil supporter can put £30,000 in a building society without paying interest.  Are Fianna Fáil seriously suggesting that is the way to run the country?  I do not want to drag Deputy Haughey into the matter.  I always had the greatest regard for his common sense when he was Minister for Finance and I am sure he would accept that this kind of suggestion is so preposterous that it is laughable as a means of getting extra money from building societies. I do not think we should delay unduly with this kind of naive, unsophisticated rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to pursue the argument that one could pursue in considerable detail, particularly with Deputy Desmond.  I would point out that neither I nor my predecessors in Fianna Fáil Governments introduced this arrangement.  We did not do so because it was not necessary, however much Deputy Desmond may try to pretend otherwise.  Had he listened to Deputy Dockrell he would have got the message regarding the building industry.  Deputy Desmond said that our proposal was naive and unsophisticated.  His own approach <Col N="1702" /> to this matter and his knowledge of the situation clearly is naive and unsophisticated. Apparently he thinks the adoption of this amendment would result in a vast outflow of money from, say, the Post Office.</P>
      <P>Has the Deputy ever wondered why people leave their money in the Post Office when they could get much better returns in other places with ample security?  This is the fact, not only in this country but in other countries.  I am interested in trying to do something to improve the flow of funds to building societies and, for that reason and bearing in mind something that was said by Deputy Dockrell, I am asking the Minister if he would be prepared to consider an amendment that would limit the amount of investment free of income tax to an agreed figure.  I do not know what the figure should be but, off the top of my head, I am suggesting a figure of £5,000.  Would the Minister consider that in principle?</P>

      <P>At present investors in building societies are liable to income tax at only 70 per cent of the standard rate.  Therefore, they have a 30 per cent reduction in their income tax liability.  This is quite considerable and is costing about £2½ million.  Any concession given to one person means that someone else has to carry the loan.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us deal with the problem with which we are supposed to be dealing.  Through the Minister for Local Government, the Government have let it be known that they are examining carefully the position of building societies and are involved in steps that will improve the flow of money to building societies.  We are satisfied that the way to improve this flow is not by building in a concession the well-to-do can enjoy but which will not operate to the benefit of the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>Earlier, I emphasised there is so much money available, that it is needed to generate jobs, to finance stock and agriculture, and that if we draw too much money away from one necessary purpose the economy is distorted, with consequences as evil and harmful as those which people here are overemphasising.  There is no justification for the sense of alarm generated from the Opposition benches in the course of this debate. I would point out that the amendment put down by Deputy Colley asks that the concession be made available to investors in building societies but there is not one word about passing it on to borrowers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed the Minister would impose that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The capacity to draw money would be minimised if the benefit were passed to the borrowers. Deputies opposite know that the real trouble of the building societies is the world price of money.  We cannot escape this and the entire banking system has to offer higher rates of interest to stop money flowing out of Ireland to other money markets in the world that offer attractive interest <Col N="1704" /> rates.  If you take, for instance, November, 1972, and compare the bank rate then with what applies now you find that it has increased from 3 per cent to 8 per cent.  That is one whale of a jump.  In fact, there are other increases from 3 per cent to 9 per cent.  Against that, building society rates have risen from 5.5 to 8 per cent.  That 8 per cent is receiving a unique, exceptional Government subsidy of £2.4 million which makes the rate for building societies today, as far as investors are concerned, in effect 12.3 per cent, which is not inconsiderable.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise what I said earlier, that there are people chasing hot money in this country and others and they should learn a lesson from the number of banks that have collapsed abroad in recent weeks.  Chasing hot money carries a risk and that risk may mean total loss of money. Central banks and Finance Ministers in other countries have made it clear that they are not prepared to come to the rescue of people who have invested their money to get hot rates of interest.  People at a time of international monetary instability might think well of putting their money where it is safe, as safe as houses, that is in building societies.</P>
      <P>It would be totally wrong for us to provide a distortion, because distortion it would be were we to provide the tax exemption which Deputy Colley suggests.  The effect of that would be that other financial institutions in this country, and that would mean the banks who were lending to industry and commerce and to farmers, would, as a consequence of this concession which would be paid by the general body of taxpayers to building societies, themselves have to increase what we consider to be rates of interest which are already too high in order to attract sufficient money to keep the money flowing through the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask Deputies very seriously and conscientiously to consider the inadvisability of providing any further distortion.  We are going through a period of serious difficulty in this country as a consequence of world <Col N="1705" /> madness in money rates.  It would be very wrong for us to start building in domestic distortions of our own.  We are satisfied that the money supply in this country can be so ordered that the construction industry will receive adequate money.  I can give the assurance to the House that this is a matter which the Government are treating as a top priority.  Just as last week we produced the money necessary for local authorities to maintain their building programme, so in the not-too-distant future we will be providing the money flow necessary to ensure that the total house construction industry gets the money it so badly needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister finds himself unable to accept the amendment and indeed apparently unable even to consider in principle the further proposition I put forward, that a ceiling should be set on the amount of money which should be free of tax in building societies.  I do not think there is anything further to be gained by arguing the case again.  I think we have put the case clearly.  The Minister has rejected even the limited suggestion I made.  I regret that.  I think he is mistaken but it is quite clear we are not going to persuade him even to accept that limited proposition. It is regrettable.  I think the Minister will regret it himself later but it is his business.  He has made his decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate on this amendment concludes I should like to take up where Deputy Colley has been speaking and point out to the Minister that, as matters stand at the moment I understand there is a limit of £5,000 per person on the amount deposited with a building society which qualifies for the limited relief, which the Minister has referred to here as I think 30 per cent, on income tax at the moment.  I think that limit is not always observed where the societies are lucky enough to get more than that amount from any one depositor.  In any event it could be got around by placing some of the money in the name of the wife of the depositor or a child.  Nonetheless, the <Col N="1706" /> principle appears to be there, that for the limited relief that currently exists there is a limit.  If full relief of income tax on those deposits were to be given I see nothing wrong in principle in applying some similar limit to the amount that might be deposited as has been suggested by Deputy Colley and as was suggested by Deputy M. E. Dockrell.  If the Minister is serious in trying to solve the very serious situation that we all know, including Deputy Dockrell, exists at the moment so far as loans and building work are concerned surely this is an obvious way to do it.  We are not asking that a man be allowed to deposit £50,000 or more in a building society free of tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking that, with some limit being placed on it&mdash;and we will put down an amendment on Report Stage if necessary, if this amendment is defeated, in order to make that clear&mdash;that principle be accepted now.  I am sure we will not have any objection to any reasonable limit which the Minister suggests.  Anything that will bring more money into the building societies will be agreeable to us.  Of the various sources from which housing is financed the source which is in greatest difficulty at the moment is the building societies.  The local authority end of it is in a different category.  That is borne out by the fact that the reaction of most people, who know anything about the problem, to this £9 million which was produced out of the hat last Friday evening by the Minister for Local Government is that, of course, it is fraudulent.  It seems extraordinary that the Minister for Local Government, who made great efforts to get in with his Estimate last week and finally got in on Thursday, should have said nothing about that in the House but should have made an announcement through the Government Information Services on Friday evening at a stage where it was no longer possible to question that <Col N="1707" /> announcement in the House this week at Question Time.  Presumably the Local Government Estimate is not going to be resumed which means there can be no discussion on a fraudulent gesture by the Minister for Local Government and the Government to cod the people into believing that something was being done to increase the amount of money that would be made available for housing. It is absolutely no good giving £9 million, or £90 million, to local authorities to be given out in housing loans if the limit of the loan remains as it is and if the income limit for eligibility for that loan remains as it is.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was already available before this £9 million was talked about at all for small dwelling loans but they were not being taken up not because there were not people there ready, willing and anxious to get a loan in order to buy a house if they could but because of a combination of either or both of two factors&mdash; that the loan was too small anyway at £4,500, or that their income was too high, because it exceeded £2,250.  The Government might just as easily have announced an additional £90 million as £9 million because that money is of only limited value to a very limited number of people.  If you are going to solve the difficulties that face the building industry at the moment you will have to solve them in the category for which building societies have been providing money up to now.  There are builders laying off men at the moment, irrespective of what the Minister or Deputy Desmond may say.  There is a considerably larger number of builders who will lay off men in August when the builders' holidays begin.  Unless <Col N="1708" /> they can see some finance coming from a source that will be of some value to them, to their current and potential customers, then these lay-offs will continue.  A maximum limit of £4,500 by itself is no use nowadays when the average house in most of our cities and towns costs £7,000 to £8,000.  People are not in a position to make up the difference out of their own resources.  If the building societies had the money available to them they would be in a position to lend enough on those houses to enable them to be bought.  There are plenty of people anxious and willing to buy them and there are plenty of people anxious and willing to build them.  The difficulty is that the money is not there from the particular source that is the most vital of all, the building societies.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an opportunity by accepting this amendment, with it necessary a limitation on it&mdash;to which we have no objection&mdash;to increase the intake into the building societies overnight. Deputy Maurice Dockrell, who knows a good deal about these things knows that what I am saying is true. The Minister could remove the income tax requirement up to a certain limit of investment in the building societies and this would enable them to pay a higher rate of interest.  This would get in more money but would not entail, as the Minister suggests, the building societies raising their rates of interest to borrowers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told by the Minister that if the limit was removed altogether the cost would be £5 million.  Surely that £5 million could be paid as interest to investors without raising the borrowing rate of interest at all?  If that sort of money became available to investors there is no doubt they would invest immediately very much more heavily in the building societies. When I look at where money appears to have been going in this country in the past three months I am confident that the bulk of that new investment in building societies would not come, as the Minister suggests, from the Post Office and other financial institutions in this country, but would come back from Northern Ireland, England and other places abroad, <Col N="1709" /> where it has gone because of the way it has been frightened off in the past three or four months.</P>
    <P>That is the most valuable type of money because it is money which has now been lost to our economy.  Unless it is brought back through a gesture of this kind by the Government it will remain permanently lost to our economy with all the long-term consequences that flow from that.  The Minister has an opportunity here by the stroke of a pen, by accepting this amendment in principle at least, even if he puts some limitation on it&mdash;we have no objection to that&mdash;to solve many of the problems of the building industry overnight.  He knows he can do it.  Deputy Maurice Dockrell knows it can be done.  We ask the Minister to remember those who will lose their jobs, to remember those who cannot buy houses now and forget about ideology and trying to &ldquo;screw&rdquo; the rich and all the other nonsense that has gone on in this country over the past 18 months.</P>

      <P>When it was conveyed to the Opposition that their amendment was ridiculous the next thing they reverted to&mdash;this is normal when one is in Opposition as I remember during my four years in Opposition&mdash;was to ask the Minister to accept it in principle. As Deputies Colley and O'Malley know, the very principle is equally odious.  When they failed at that level the next proposition was to put a limit on the amount.  If I heard Deputy Colley correctly the limit suggested by him was in the region of £5,000.  I am not sure if it was an investment of £5,000.</P>

      <P>Is Deputy Colley suggesting that if I had £60,000 tomorrow morning I should have the sanction of the State to put it into a building society and to have interest free investment from that particular sum of money, and that I would pay no income tax?  This is what Deputy Colley and Fianna Fáil are suggesting.  The proposition of Fianna Fáil, even if accepted in principle, would create so much excitement that there would be such a swamp of money going into building societies that the very credibility and financial standing of the Government would be called into question overnight. We would have to close down the banks of the country.  The bank managers would get very excited at this proposition of the Fianna Fáil Party on how to make a lot of money without having to pay any income tax.</P>
      <P>I suggest to them that, even in principle and in terms of the particular limit, their amendment is not a viable proposition.  If the Minister wishes to consider the matter that is his privilege.  Are we to suggest that investment in insurance companies in relation to housing should also be exempt from income tax?  The life assurance companies in this country currently invest £10½ million in house building.  Are we to suggest that any person putting his money into an insurance company can say to the investment portfolio manager: &ldquo;I want that £300,000 to go into housing and I do not want to pay any income tax on it.  You give money to the people for house loans and therefore I do not want to pay any income tax on it.&rdquo;</P>

Contrary to the opinion expressed by Deputy O'Malley there has been a marked increase in loans by local authorities: from 5,087 loans, valued at £15.13 million in 1972-73 to 10,000&mdash;twice the number&mdash;valued at £39.17 million for 1973-74.  During that period the amount of the loans and the income eligibility levels were raised.  Deputy O'Malley comes whining into this House trying to scare the living daylights out of the construction industry, trying to suggest to people they have no hope of getting loans when he knows perfectly well that in the past 12 months the number of local authority loans doubled from 5,000 to 10,000 throughout the State.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding that very substantial increase in the amount of loans available, we have very substantially increased the income eligibility limit.  In relation to the construction industry I want to challenge Fianna Fáil on this point: come into this House and name the builders who are laying off their workers.  Stop the spurious scaremongering, trying to create a construction industry crisis.  Name the towns where they are being laid off. Name the construction firms.  Name the builders' providers.  Name the trade unions concerned.</P>
      <P>There is nothing more irresponsible, no more effective way of doing down Ireland, than that an Opposition should come into this House and inquire about redundancies in the construction industry when they know quite well that people are laid off during the holiday period around August and are taken back later on in the year.  I would advise Fianna Fáil not to be the pawns of some builders who want the Government to abolish the £7,500 income limit.  I would urge that party to behave themselves in a responsible manner rather than to try to create a crisis where none exists and where there is every opportunity for the construction industry to prosper.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak, but having listened to Deputy Desmond I feel it incumbent on me to appeal to him to take heed of the words of Deputy O'Malley, who put forward very sound arguments. Deputy Desmond asked us to name the firms who laid off workers.  Do not take our word for it.  Inquire from the trade unions who since last Friday afternoon are carrying out an investigation into the number of people who have been sacked, including apprentices.  Unless the Minister does something drastic there will be a crisis in the building industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Desmond on three or four occasions here today and each time he has contradicted himself twice or three times.  He is making a case against the amendment in Deputy Colley's name and he enforces his argument in opposition to it by saying that the SDA loans have doubled in the last 12 months, both in regard to the number or applicants and the amount of money, which, in my opinion, proves that something has got to be done in relation to investment and the availability of finance from the building societies.  That is the first contradiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second contradiction is that we have been accused of scaremongering over the last few weeks, and in the last few weeks the Minister for Finance is on the records of this House, as is also the Minister for Local Government, as stating that there is sufficient money in the building industry at present.  Yet last Friday the Government had to announce an increase of £9 million for house purchase, £9 million which, as <Col N="1714" /> has already been stated by Deputies, will not sell one additional house, simply and solely because the very people Deputy Desmond is pleading for here, the people under the £2,500 income limit, are not in a position to get from any financial house the £2,500 to £3,000 that is necessary to make up the price of their house. They will get £4,500 loan from the local authority, but they have no where else to go to get the additional funds to purchase their house.</P>
    <P>I would like any member of the Government or any member of the parties supporting the Government to tell me and the many thousands of people throughout the country who would like to purchase and own their own home where they will get these houses at £4,500.  Where do they exist?  Do they intend to provide them, because, as has already been stated, the average price of any house worthy of the name, no matter what part of the country you are in, is £7,000 or £8,000.  The only source of funds is proven by the statistics produced by Deputy Desmond and provided by the Minister or some of his advisers with a little note.  Incidentally, these figures were available to them but not to us.  When the question was asked here in the Dáil two months ago we were told those figures were not available; yet Deputy Desmond could produce them today. The facts are that the building societies, down through the years that the Fianna Fáil Governments have been accused of not doing this very thing we ask be done, had sufficient funds to supply the demands of the market.  The situation is not the same today, and the question I should like to ask the Minister and in particular, Deputy Desmond, is, if they are satisfied that there is sufficient money available from the building societies to finance their target of 25,000 houses until 31st March next year, in addition to the amount of money that is made available for financing houses through the SDA loans.</P>
    <P>We are asking that this amendment be accepted.  To initiate discussion the amendment must appear in some form, but naturally in the course of <Col N="1715" /> the Committee Stage of any Bill both sides should be prepared to pull back from any suggestions that were originally made.  I would appeal to the Minister to pull back from the statements he read out in answer to Deputy Colley's proposal.  Is the Minister afraid of Deputies in the Labour Party like Deputy Barry Desmond? The only Member who spoke on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Maurice Dockrell, seemed to be in favour of the suggestion put by this side of the House.  It is possible that the Minister is afraid of repercussions from Deputy Barry Desmond and his colleagues in the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about this position and the Minister would be telling an untruth if he said he is not concerned about the position that exists in the housing industry.  Deputy Barry Desmond has asked us to give names.  I could give him the names of several companies in the north-west who have left off workers, of builders' suppliers and factories involved in the supply of materials to builders who are affected by the present position.  I do not intend to do so in the interest of the companies concerned.  All of us are aware that in the building industry the holiday period starts in about seven days' time.  We are also aware that most people involved in this industry would not, because they have a conscience, lay off people two weeks before they commence their holidays.</P>

      <P>If the Minister treats this amendment with contempt, as he has done so far backed up by people like Deputy Barry Desmond, when this House meets after the recess thousands of people will have been laid off work and that will cost <Col N="1716" /> another Department of the Government millions of pounds before 31st December.</P>
      <P>In the interests of the construction industry we appeal to the Minister to think again.  It is possible that the Minister has better proposals in mind. The Minister did say last week that the matter concerning the building societies was still under review and what help might be given in that regard he had not decided on.  The Minister should satisfy us that he is going to do something to restore confidence in the construction industry generally.  If Deputies on the Government side are sincere and serious about being public representatives they must agree that the situation that exists today in relation to the building industry and the financing of the building industry is critical.  It just cannot be brushed aside.</P>
      <P>The little bit of whitewashing that was done on Friday, possibly in anticipation of the discussion on this Bill today and tomorrow, is not going to help in any way the difficult situation that exists.  The Minister knows that and he should be honest with the House and state the true position.  This is not the kind of industry that one can bluff one's way through.  Redundancies have already taken place and that is an undeniable fact.</P>
      <P>No matter how many multi-millions the Minister makes available through SDA loans or in any other way through local authorities the vacuum that has been created because of the lack of finance from the building societies and the banks will not be satisfied.  Anybody who applies to a local authority for an SDA loan can. without great difficulty, obtain a loan of £4,500 to purchase a new house. However, we are all aware that any house at present costs in the region of £7,000.  This means that a person obtaining a loan from a local authority must find almost £3,000.  Where can a young couple or anybody find that kind of money?  The only way out of this present crisis is for the Minister to up the limit for local authority loans or accept, in principle, Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 6, to delete lines 7, 8, 9 <Col N="1719" /> and 10 and to substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Provided that where tax is deducted from a dividend at a rate as reduced by virtue of section 396 or 410 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, or section 14 of the Finance Act, 1973, the amount to be included in the relevant income in respect of the dividend shall be an amount which bears the same proportion to the amount of the dividend as the rate of income tax deducted therefrom bears to the standard rate of tax and the amount of the credit to be given shall be the amount of tax deducted from the dividend.  Where tax is deducted from a dividend at a rate as reduced by virtue of section 363 such adjustment as may be proper shall be made in the amount of the credit.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to delete the existing proviso in section 4 and substitute what I have set out in the amendment.  The proviso, as it stands, is inadequate.  It says:</P>
    <P>Provided that where tax is deducted from a dividend at a rate as reduced by virtue of section 363, 396 or 410 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, or section 14 of the Finance Act, 1973, such adjustment as may be proper shall be made in the amount of the credit.</P>
    <P>I submit that is bad law in relation to something as important as the amount of tax to be paid by a taxpayer that it should be left in those vague terms&mdash;&ldquo;such adjustment as may be proper&rdquo;.  The legislation should spell out exactly the adjustment to be made.</P>
    <P>I might draw the attention of the House to the matter we are dealing with in section 4.  It concerns the rate at which income tax is deducted from a payment being made in accordance with the various provisions of the Income Tax Acts.  The provisions with which we are dealing in this proviso are the provisions of the Income Tax Acts which up to now have governed <Col N="1720" /> companies paying dividends out of profits made from the coalmining or export industries or from ordinary mining which are themselves free of tax.  Up to now special provisions applied to the payment of these dividends which had the effect of passing on to the individual shareholders in these companies the benefits of the exemption from income tax to which the companies were entitled.</P>
    <P>The new unified rates necessitate a change of procedure.  In future when dividends are being paid income tax will be deducted at the standard rate in force at the date of payment.  Up to now income tax was deducted at the rate in force over the relevant period. That change causes problems in regard to these dividends which are being paid out of profits which are themselves free of tax.  The proviso to the section as framed leaves the matter very much in the air.  My amendment is designed to spell out in more precise terms the treatment which should be afforded these dividends in relation to the tax-payers total income for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>My amendment is directed to the amount of these dividends which should be included in the person's income as assessed under the new income tax provisions set out in this Bill.  In the amendment I set out that the amount which is to be included in the relevant income in respect of the individual shall be an amount which bears the same proportion to the amount of the dividend as the rate of income tax deducted therefrom bears to the standard rate of tax, and the amount of credit to be given shall be the amount of tax deducted from the dividend.</P>
    <P>I think that is a reasonable approach and is in line with the approach in general adopted up to now.  I cannot see that the Minister can have any objection to accepting this amendment. I am sure he cannot be satisfied with the wording of the proviso as it stands and in everybody's interest it is proper that this Bill should spell out precisely the way in which these dividends are to be treated in future.  My suggestion is that you take the rate at which tax is deducted from the dividend and relate that to the standard rate of tax and bring in that proportion of the total <Col N="1721" /> dividend as the amount of that dividend which should be included in the taxpayer's income for tax assessment purposes.  I hope I have made myself clear.</P>

      <P>I have noted a number of matters I should like the Minister to clarify because the section is certainly not clear.  I support Deputy Haughey's amendment.  It goes a long way towards clarifying that which is obscure in the section.  I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this amendment.  There are other matters which will arise more properly on the section in regard to which I shall ask him some questions.  As it stands, the section is not clear and Deputy Haughey's amendment goes a long way towards clarifying it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the unease of Deputies in regard to the language used in the phrase &ldquo;such adjustments as may be proper&rdquo; but it is of interest to note that the same language was used in the 1956 Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, in the Finance Act, 1958, and in section 410 of the Income Tax Act of 1967, so it is not a new phrase. That, of course, is no reason why we should not look at it to find out whether or not it is appropriate.  But it is not new.  It is not a question of our adopting something which is not time honoured.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that where a dividend is paid out of tax and there is relief to profits&mdash;export tax relief, Shannon relief&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exports and mining relief&mdash;a proper share of the relief will be available to the recipient of the dividend which will be chargeable to tax at a higher rate.  Tax relief was available in the case of a person liable to surtax.  It took the form of having included in the taxpayer's total income for surtax purposes only the proportionate part of the dividend, that proportion being the same proportion as the reduced rate of tax bore to the standard rate <Col N="1722" /> of tax.  I take it the Deputy's amendment is intended to carry through the same provision for the purpose of the higher rates of income tax which are to replace surtax.</P>
      <P>Section 4 makes provision for the granting of such relief.  The language may be faulty, but that is the effect of the provision: &ldquo;such adjustments as may be proper shall be made....&rdquo; The Deputy says the provision is not specific enough and it does not state precisely how the relief is to be granted.  He hopes his amendment has the necessary precision.  In fact the Deputy's amendment, if accepted in its present form, would not alone provide relief from the higher rates corresponding to the relief formerly available in respect of surtax but would also have the effect of reducing the income tax liability ordinarily existing.  The amendment would work in such a way that a greater benefit than that which Deputy Haughey has in mind would accrue.</P>
      <P>The difficulty we face is no doubt a difficulty which faced legislators in earlier years&mdash;the difficulty of devising precise language to suit all cases&mdash;but I am advised by the parliamentary draftsmen that it is not possible to do this.  If we use any other form we will not avoid the pitfalls Deputy Haughey's well-reasoned amendment aims at avoiding and, on that account, I would ask him not to press it.  The intention is to apply the provision so that precisely the same result will be arrived at under the new system as was arrived at under the old system.  We are following a form which has in practice achieved the right result, notwithstanding the looseness of the language, and I believe we have no reason to fear that it will not be similarly beneficial in future to both the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation, but I cannot regard it as satisfactory.  I should like to tease the matter out a bit more before we come to a decision. The Minister admits that the language used is just not adequate.  The proviso stipulates that the adjustment to be made will be such adjustment as may <Col N="1723" /> be proper.  I do not think it is good enough for us, as legislators, to enact legislation which leaves someone else to decide what may be proper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Revenue Commissioners.  We are not here dealing with things which are either proper or improper.  We are dealing with taxation, with money, with the question as to whether or not people will get certain credits.  This whole matter touches on something of vital importance, namely, income tax relief on exports.  From the point of view of the economy generally this is a very important aspect of the income tax code.  It is perhaps the most successful device ever adopted to promote industrial and economic growth.  As a corollary to exempting the profits of companies from the export of industrial goods&mdash;incidentally this also applies to coalmining and mining generally&mdash;we had these provisions whereby the benefit of the relief from taxation was passed on to the individual shareholders.  The Revenue Commissioners, the Minister or, if you like, the Establishment, adopted a very sensible approach to these dividends.  They took a very straightforward and reasonably simple formula.  If the rate at which the tax was deducted by the company was half the standard rate then half the dividend was included in the taxpayer's income.  My amendment seeks to carry that forward.  We should here say what the adjustment will be in regard to these dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the parliamentary draftsman comes up with something better than leaving it to the good sense and moral judgment of the Revenue Commissioners I certainly will be satisfied with that situation.  I am not quite clear what faults the Minister finds with my amendment.  It seems to me to meet the situation.  If it does not I would like the Minister to indicate precisely in what way it does not.  I am keener on my amendment now when I hear the Minister saying that in fact the Revenue Commissioners intend to do precisely what I am spelling <Col N="1724" /> out in my amendment.  They will continue the existing system of adjustments.  If that is their intention let us put it into the Bill.  Let us not be legislating in an imprecise and vague sort of way.  Unless the Minister can say specifically what is wrong with the forms of words used in my amendment, he should adopt the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The best thing to do would be to illustrate what I am saying.  An example is better than words.  Suppose we say a taxpayer's total income is £2,000 consisting of one dividend taxed at 17.5 per cent Tax free allowances amount to £1,000.  The treatment as proposed by section 4 would be as follows:</P>
      <P>Total income, £2,000.</P>
      <P>Tax deducted, £350.</P>
      <P>Repaid Tax-Free Allowances of £1,000&mdash;£175.</P>
      <P>Net tax payable, £175.</P>
      <P>That is the present position.  That is what the section as drafted would maintain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  When we come to the amendment, what would happen is this:</P>
      <P>Total income, £2,000&mdash;multiply that by 17.5 over 35.  That would equal £1,000.</P>
      <P>Tax deducted, £350.</P>
      <P>Tax free allowances, £1,000.</P>
      <P>Taxable income&mdash;Nil.</P>

    <P>The taxpayer would not be liable to income tax in which event all the tax deducted&mdash;£350&mdash;would be refunded. Taking off a proportion of the dividend for the purposes of the total income was confined to surtax in 1973-74 and previously.  This did not apply for the purposes of income tax. This is where the proposed amendment conflicts with the existing income tax position, which we are now dropping.  Under the scheme included in the Bill the proposed credit on the relieved amount of the dividend for the purposes of the higher rates of tax will ensure that the same <Col N="1725" /> measure of relief will be afforded for 1974-75 as was available in respect of surtax for 1973-74 and previous years.</P>

      <P>I would accept that there may be some little imprecision in my wording.  I would accept what the Minister says if his proviso spelled out what he says: The Minister is interpreting the proviso, but all it says is &ldquo;such adjustment as may be proper&rdquo;.  If the Minister writes in what he has said across the House I shall withdraw my amendment in favour of the form of words he puts in.  I do not think the Minister should ask me to withdraw my amendment in favour of his vague wording. It is all right for the Minister to spell out what the practice will be, but we have no guarantee that that will be the practice.  Once this Bill leaves this House the Revenue Commissioners and others will look only at the wording. They will not look at what we hoped or what was suggested.  They will look at the exact wording.</P>
      <P>The only arbiters would be the Revenue Commissioners.  They are entrusted with the care and management of these taxes.  I do not think the Minister can discredit my amendment by putting forward against it something which is not in the Bill as such, but is merely his intention of how the Bill should be administered. I am not sure what the procedure will be as regards the Committee and Report Stages.  Is there any suggestion that on the Report Stage the Minister might put in a proviso such as he has spelled out to us?</P>

      <P>One wonders about the efficacy of this amendment in legislation.  It is a statement of intent, nothing more and nothing less. When I was speaking on the Second Stage I proposed that this Bill should be child-centred rather than mother-centred. I suggested that it should be discussed in that context, not dismissing the mother's entitlement and rights and having regard to her position. One wonders if this is a piece of legislative piety and if it is necessary in the Bill.  It does not affect the Bill one way or the other.  The legislation dealing with adoption was brought in with the Principal Act, 1952, amended by the 1964 Act and this is a consequential Bill. One must see this as a statement of intent and nothing more.  It has no legal efficacy, as I understand it.</P>
      <P>The board have been doing a very good job over the years.  They decide the questions relating to the arrangements for the making of an adoption order.  They keep in mind the welfare of the child as a first and paramount consideration.  As I said, one wonders if this type of statement of intent is necessary in a Bill of this or any kind. In two pieces of legislation in which I was participating, the Prosecution of Offences Bill and the Contraception Bill, there were a number of sections setting out a given position.  When it came to enforcing the sections there was no enforcement for the actual sections themselves.</P>

    <P>When replying the Minister might let us know from what Senator or Senators these amendments came.

      <P>I agreed to this amendment in the Seanad.  It could possibly be of assistance to the courts in an interpretative sense.  I cannot visualise in what actual instance it might be so but it could be of assistance to the court if the court had a choice.  It could compel the court to lean in favour of the child.  There can be no doubt about that.  There is a precedent for this in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  It is almost word for word with the interpretative direction given in that Act that the child's welfare must be paramount.  I saw no good reason for not agreeing to accept it in the Seanad.  It sets out what we all want and what I think is already effective in regard to the operation of these Acts, although they have been unjustly criticised as being mother-centred.  In other words, this is expressing what is already a factual position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not impose any additional burden on the Adoption Board or on the courts.  It is no harm to have a clear expression of the Legislatures' intention contained in the Act itself. <Col N="1729" /> As the House is aware, the courts are by convention precluded from looking to the debates in this House for assistance in interpreting a statute. They are confined to the bare words of the statute.  They cannot even look to the side note.  In an area like this, lest there be any doubt, it does not do any harm to spell out to the court what the Legislature's intention was. That was the reason for the amendment. It does not conflict with the principle of the Acts.  In fact, it confirms it.  Deputy Andrews in his Second Stage speech said that this emphasis in favour of the child is the proper emphasis in the adoption code.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>NEW SECTION: Before section 2 a new section inserted as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  (1) In any case where a person has applied for an adoption order relating to a child and any person whose consent to the making of an adoption order relating to the child is necessary and who has agreed to the placing of the child for adoption either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) fails, neglects or refuses to give his consent, or</P>
      <P>(b) withdraws a consent already given,</P>
      <P>the applicant for the adoption order may apply to the High Court for order under this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) The High Court, if it is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child so to do, may make an order under this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  giving custody of the child to the applicant for such period as the Court may determine, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) authorising the Board to dispense with the consent of the other person referred to in subsection (1) of this section to the <Col N="1730" /> making of an adoption order in favour of the applicant during the period aforesaid.</P>
    <P>(3)  The consent of a ward of court shall not be dispensed with by virtue of a High Court Order under this section except with the sanction of the Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 relates to the problems which this Bill sets out to cure, namely, the case of the mother who delays unduly in giving her consent or withdraws her consent and then does not do anything about taking the child into her care but leaves the child with the adoptive parents without finalising their position.  The amendment has made it clear that the High Court has a jurisdiction on the application from the adoptive parents to make an order for the custody of a child in these circumstances.  On the making of the custody order the Adoption Board are then free to make an adoption order.  As originally drafted the section might not have enabled adoptive parents to have access to the High Court.  This was drafted on the assumption that every citizen had as of right the entitlement to go to the High Court for relief in any matter.  Lest there be any doubt about that, this opportunity was taken to clarify the position and a positive right was given in the section as redrafted.</P>
    <P>Again, it was felt necessary to provide in this section that there should be a time-limit on the custody as given by the High Court.  It is necessary to provide in this section that if the board wished to make an adoption order without the consent of the mother it must do so within the time specified by the court in the order. This is to avoid a continuance of the situation which the section is designed to cure, namely, an undue delay on the part of finalising adoption proceedings. That is bad for the child and for the parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, this will become a new section 3 in the Act which deletes section 2 in the Bill we have before us.  There is one matter which concerns me&mdash;and I do not know if the Minister has satisfactorily explained it&mdash;in relation to the second amendment, which sets out:</P>
      <P>(2)  The High Court, if it is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child so to do, may make an order under this section&mdash;(a) giving custody of the child to the applicant for such period as the Court may determine,...</P>
      <P>Is there not an element of uncertainty there?  Would the Minister not agree with me that the purpose of giving custody of children to adoptive parents is that it is a once-and-for-all custody and that the child is adopted finally in relation to the adoption order which is made.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister explain what the phrase:</P>
      <P>giving custody of the child to the applicant for such period as the Court may determine,</P>
      <P>means?  Can the Minister explain in greater depth and to the satisfaction of the House what exactly that means?  Having read it again and studied it at some considerable length there seems to me to be not the element of finality.  Again, I may be misinterpreting what the Minister has in mind in relation to subsection (a) here.  Perhaps the Minister could help me in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the custody order is only the instrument to enable the adoption to take place.  In that sense the custody order is not the be-all and end-all of the matter.  It is merely the means through which the Adoption Board can make an adoption order.  This situation is one where the mother has failed to give her consent or has actually withdrawn <Col N="1732" /> her consent having given it and before the adoption order was made.  As matters stand at present the Adoption Board cannot make an adoption order for that particular child.  We have had the harrowing situation of children with the adoptive parents, in the adoptive home, for months and even years, and the board being unable to make a final adoption order because of the failure of the mother to give consent.</P>
      <P>What we propose now, in such a situation is that the adoptive parents will make an application to the High Court&mdash;not for an adoption order because that is not the function of the High Court; that is reserved to the Adoption Board&mdash;for an order for the custody of the child.  The court is being empowered to order that the prospective adoptive parents shall have custody of the child.</P>
      <P>On foot of that order the Adoption Board can then make an adoption order.  I think that the High Court order has to be to give the custody of the child to the parents for a period certain rather than for a period uncertain because the whole purpose of this is to eliminate the uncertainty which caused the application to the court originally.  If the court were to make a custody order without any time limit on it, it could mean further procrastination.  I think it is in the child's interest that the custody order would be for a definite period. The parties could then proceed to the Adoption Board for an adoption order.  To some extent this would also be a lever on the Adoption Board to ensure that matters will be finalised quickly&mdash;not indeed that I think any such lever will be needed because the mere fact that the adoption was hanging for so long as to justify the adoptive parents seeking the protection of the High Court will mean that all parties will be anxious to have it over and done with quickly.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in Amendment No. 4.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>NEW SECTION: Before section 4 a new section inserted as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 11 of the Principal Act (as amended by section 5 of the Act of 1964), in any case where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a child in the care of a married couple who have made an application for an adoption order in relation to that child, and</P>
      <P>(b) the wife dies before the making of the adoption order,</P>
      <P>the Board may make an adoption order relating to that child on the application of the widower: Provided that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) the widower has, at the date of his application another child in his custody, and</P>
      <P>(ii) every person, whose consent to the making of the adoption order is required by section 14 of the Principal Act or by section 2 of the Act of 1964, knows, when he gives his consent, that the applicant is a widower.</P>
      <P>(2) In any case where an application for an adoption order is made under this section, any consent given to the making of an adoption order in respect of the child in favour of the married couple shall be disregarded.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a new provision in the Bill since it was introduced originally in this House.  It is to meet a rather narrow case: to enable a widower to adopt.  It was criticised in the other House on the grounds that it was excessively narrow.  In introducing this new principle of allowing a widower to adopt, I think the safest course is to start from a narrow base and widen if experience shows it to be necessary.  Provision is made for a widower to adopt in the narrow situation if a child is already in the care of that widower&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But in circumstances in which, before the adoption order was made, the wife died.  We could then have a situation&mdash;and there was an actual case&mdash;where the child stood to be taken back from that home, a home in which there was already an adopted child and where this other adopted child had come to look on the new child as a sister and, of course, the new child had adjusted to the new home.  Considerable trauma would have been caused in that home if that child had to be taken away following the death of the wife, which is what would have to happen at the moment because if the order were to be finalised it would be finalised in favour of a widower and that is not possible under the law as it stands at present. Therefore we are changing it to provide that an adoption order may be made in favour of a widower provided two conditions are fulfilled : (a) there is already a child in the home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree that if the Minister is bringing in this section in ease of a number of cases which have been brought to his attention we should pass this section.  Perhaps the Minister could clear this up for me. It seems to me to be unfair to say:</P>
      <P>the widower has, at the date of his application another child in his custody,...</P>
      <P>That seems to be unfair to the widower, or the widow, as the case may be.  We know that the wife is entitled to adopt a child where the husband dies before the actual order is completed.  Now it appears to be the case that we are enshrining in legislation that a widower or widow has, at the date of his or her application, another child in his or her custody.  It seems unfair that a married couple who decide to adopt their first child should be prevented from so doing in the circumstances outlined in the Minister's proposed section.  In other words, the section demands that the widower or widow has a child, be it their own child or an adopted child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why a widow is allowed adopt a child is that it is part of a feminine nature to be able to provide a household and domestic environment that a small baby needs, as well as the skills of attending to a small baby.  Very few widowers would have such skills or would have the household where those skills would be available.  They are <Col N="1736" /> more likely to be available in a household where there is already a child, where a widower has been attuned to a small child in the household and would be able to make these facilities available.  If a widower were to be allowed to adopt a child without already having a child, I think it would be risky to expect him to provide the type of domestic environment, the nursing skills and other care that an infant of tender age would require.  That is the first argument against allowing a widower adopt a child where there was not already a child in the household.</P>
      <P>The second argument is one in relation to age, the age difference between the adopted child and the widower.  The difference in ages at the time of infancy of the child might look vast and might not be such a material factor, but as the child grew the age difference would decrease in importance.  In the case of a female adopted child there would be certain reservations in regard to such domestic situation and it would be imprudent for the law to permit such a situation to arise.  Therefore it is important that there must be the nucleus of a family other than a single child family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I still must express our concern at this section.  It is extraordinary that where a young married couple have adopted a child and the wife tragically dies and the child is more or less in the custody of the widower that the law will now say that the widower, young, single, must hand over custody of the child.</P>

      <P>A widower is still at a disadvantage as against a widow. I accept what the Minister has said&mdash; that the male of the species has not the greater capacity in regard to looking after a child&mdash;but if a child is adopted and the young wife dies it is most unfortunate that the young widower should have to hand over custody of the child.  In addition it is important to remember that a young widower might well marry again and have his own children.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy is arguing is in favour of the widower, so to speak, whereas we have agreed that the whole situation should be in the interests of the child.  I have no doubt that a child in such circumstances would be best served in another home, for the reasons I have given, plus the complications in regard to subsequent remarriage by the widower.</P>

      <P>These might not arise.  I accept that the section is child-centred rather than fathercentred but for the widower there is the double tragedy, first of all the loss of his young wife and then the loss of the adopted child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if subsection (2) is not also rather harsh on the widower who must go back to get a fresh consent.  The whole question of consent by the natural mother is the trickiest area in the adoption procedure, the area where things are most likely to go wrong in respect of the child.  There could be situations in which a recently widowed man with other children, either natural or adopted, might clearly be suitable for the retention of the child who has been placed with him and his late wife, but because the natural mother would have to be told six months after she had consented that the child was now proposed to be adopted by a widower, a new situation arises.  Is this not to some extent an invitation or an incentive to her to withdraw her earlier consent?  Presumably she cannot be told more than that it is a widower who is the prospective adopter.  In such circumstances she may think it is an entirely new family and that the widower might not be able properly to look after the child.  Is that not an incentive to her to fail to give fresh consent, as is required in subsection (2)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can see such a situation causing a great deal of difficulties.  One of the <Col N="1738" /> original objectives of the Bill two years or so ago was to be less stringent with regard to consent by the natural mother because of the danger of hardship and consequent difficulties and disappointments for the child as well as the parents because of withdrawal of consent.  Are we now wise to create a further situation in which a fresh consent would be necessary particularly when the extent of the information to be given to the natural mother would amount almost to encouragement to her not to give a fresh consent?  The child at that stage might be a year or two years of age and might have become concious of membership of a family, having been with them for six months or perhaps nine months or more.  Apart from the problems which it would create for the widower, more seriously it could create problems for the child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this provision is necessary because we must have regard to the essential nature of adoption proceedings, which is that it is a voluntary arrangement whereby a natural mother gives her child for adoption. The mother's consent must be obtained except where the High Court intervenes, as provided for in the earlier amendments.</P>
      <P>Because of the voluntary nature of the adoption procedure, it would be unjust and unfair if the mother were not informed of such a radical change, that instead of her child being placed with a married couple the child was being placed with a widower.  It would cut across the voluntary nature of adoption if she were not informed of this change and given an opportunity to intervene. She is entitled to that opportunity. After all, she signed her consent on the basis of a certain set of facts and her consent could not be regarded as a real one if the facts were not as she assumed them to be.  That would be innocent misrepresentation and her consent would be vitiated by the change of circumstances.  A fresh consent would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of information to be given would depend on the adoption procedures and practices but she <Col N="1739" /> would be assured by social workers in whom she would have trust that the home was adequate and the welfare of the child guaranteed notwithstanding the death of the adoptive mother.  It is assuming too much to say that, because she was asked for a further consent this would be tantamount to an invitation to refuse the second consent.  I do not think that would be the case.  In any event, for the consent to be real it would have to be given again in the light of the radically altered circumstances of the placement now being with a widower instead of with a married couple as originally agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed this matter last Wednesday we encountered some difficulty regarding extension of the life of the boards. The extension was for elected members only but we raised the matter of <i>ex officio</i> members.  From inquiries I have made it appears there is a discrepancy in that <i>ex officio</i> and nominated members cannot lose their seats, irrespective of the wishes of the people who nominated them.  This is a bad arrangement.  The Bill proposes to extend the life of the boards and we expected that those who are members of boards for the past five years would hold their places for the coming year until the elections are held in October, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have discovered that the <i>ex officio</i> members can be changed.  There could be a problem for the boards, for instance, <Col N="1740" /> if someone wanted a militant member to be on the board.  We realise that there will be many changes and, in fact, we do not know what the outcome will be.  I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary can say that the Bill provides specifically for the elected members.  We hope our suggestions will be borne in mind and I imagine there will be many more suggestions before the report of the board of the Inland Fisheries is implemented.  We have no amendments and we agreed we would let the Bill through if the Parliamentary Secretary was prepared to clarify the position regarding <i>ex officio</i> and elected members.</P>

      <P>Deputies raised questions on Committee Stage regarding the continuance in office of nominated and <i>ex officio</i> members.  I said then it was not necessary to include any subsection in section 2 covering such continuance in office, as was asserted by Deputy Molloy and others.</P>
      <P>By virtue of the wording of section 24 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, the <i>ex officio</i> conservators hold office on the board so long as they are eligible and so long as there is a board in existence.  This situation is not altered by the provisions of the Bill now being discussed.  By virtue of section 36 of the 1959 Act, a similar situation obtains in the case of <i>ex officio</i> members who represent the ESB, and in accordance with the wording of section 37, a similar situation obtains in regard to the nominees of the ESB except that their term of office is only for one year from the day of the annual fishery rate is struck.  It is not necessary for the ESB to renominate their nominees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was raised regarding members with a valuation of £50 or more.  Anyone with a fishery valuation of £50 or more is notified of meetings of the board.  Apart from the valuation qualifications, there are no set rules.  Persons with the required valuation present themselves at meetings. Section 52 of the Act requires that notice of the time and place of meetings be published by the boards. <Col N="1741" /> Deputies will see it was not necessary to have an additional subsection in section 2 of this Bill to continue in office the <i>ex officio</i> and nominated members.  We had to accept the Act as we found it&mdash;it has been in existence since 1959&mdash;and it contains the provisions that these people had a right of office under the circumstances as outlined in sections 34, 36 and 37.</P>

    <P>In page 6, to delete lines 7, 8, 9 and 10 and to substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that where tax is deducted from a dividend at a rate as reduced by virtue of section 396 or 410 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, or section 14 of the Finance Act, 1973, the amount to be included in the relevant income in respect of the dividend shall be an amount which bears the same proportion to the amount of the dividend as the rate of income tax deducted there-which bears to the standard rate of tax and the amount of the credit to be given shall be the amount of tax deducted from the dividend.

      <P>I propose to refresh the Minister's mind by asking if Deputy Haughey's amendment is not accepted where does the section bind the tax-payer receiving the same treatment as he has obtained heretofore and what specific provisions are in that section or in any other section like this?  In addition I requested information about the relief under section 332 of the 1967 Income Tax Act, what the position will be in regard to that and how it will be calculated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as drafted does not change the law.  What now applies will continue to apply.  That is the effect of the wording that is used.  As I said, I can see people's anxiety about the apparent lack of precision.  Perhaps if the words had not been used at all it might have been better.  As Deputy Haughey appreciates, I only received this amendment this morning, together with other amendments, so we have not had time to give as much consideration to this as we would want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> Perhaps, we might be able to meet it by deleting the last line of the proviso in the Bill, that is to delete all the words after &ldquo;adjustment&rdquo; and let it read as follows:</P>
    <P>Such adjustment shall be made in the amount of the credit as may be necessary to give effect to the reliefs provided for in the said sections.</P>
    <P>This would aim to give the reliefs that these sections provide.  That, perhaps, would be a little more precise than simply using the phrase &ldquo;such adjustment as may be proper&rdquo;.  That is certainly the intention.  Perhaps the other words might be more precise.  I would like, before I commit myself to that specifically, to see if we could have a look at it and possibly bring in an amendment for the Report Stage.  If some technical difficulty arises I will give the assurance that the law will be applied in that manner and at the first available opportunity, which might be the Finance Bill later this year, which, of course, primarily will deal with capital taxation, the matter could be tidied up.</P>
    <P>Under section 332 of the 1967 Act the following would be the position. Suppose there is a dividend of £100. Tax is deducted at 35 per cent that would be £35.  Tax repayable under section 332 would be 20 per cent of £35, that is, £7, leaving net income tax of £28.  Sur-tax at 80 per cent only of the dividend, taking into account, the charge to sur-tax at the top rate of 45 per cent would be £36.  Therefore, the total tax is £64.</P>
    <P>The effect of the new provision is as follows: again taking a dividend of £100 and tax deducted at 35 per cent, that is, £35.  We then take 80 per cent of the dividend&mdash;that is, under section 332 as amended by the deletion of surtax&mdash;that is, £80.  Since the tax is chargeable at the top rate, the tax charged is £64.  Against this there is a credit of £35, which would leave a net sum of £29; £29 and £35 leaves you once again with the figure of £64. Therefore, although you use different machinery you arrive at the same result.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a question on section 5.  Section 5 provides for deduction of tax at the rate applicable at the date of payment of the interest or dividend.  I think there is general agreement that this is an improvement, but I want to put to the Minister the case of an export company which has accumulated tax free profits.  How will they now be situated in regard to the payment of dividends out of accumulated tax profits?  If such a company will now have to deduct tax at the standard rate in operation at the date of payment, surely this will prevent them passing on the benefits that they might wish to pass on to their shareholders?  I have been informed that a company went public on the basis that they would pay dividends free of tax out of their accumulated tax free profits. It seems that under the provisions of section 5 they will be prevented from doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I fear the Deputy misunderstands the position.  Again, as in respect of other sections, the position after the Bill is passed will be the same as heretofore.  You can make your deductions and whatever is the appropriate deduction under the exports relief and so on will apply in the future as in the past.  I do not quite understand the Deputy's particular difficulty, because the end result will be the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with the case of a company which has accumulated profits which were earned as export profits, which fact made them free of tax.  These profits have been accumulating, and if it were not for section 5 the company would be able to pay them out without any tax or at a reduced rate of deduction to their shareholders.  It seems to me that section 5 will now require that any payments out of these <Col N="1745" /> profits which have accumulated in the past will have to be paid out at the standard rate applicable at the date of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment the appropriate rate applies to all such dividends, and then you apply to them whatever the export tax relief is, which ends up with a gross payment being made.  Therefore the situation in the future will be precisely the same.  You will treat it as though the standard rate were being applied, and then if the particular dividend is entitled to other reliefs, they are applied in addition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the situation of a company before section 5 comes into operation.  That company would have been able to pay out dividends out of their accumulated profits without deducting any tax or deductting tax at the reduced rate.  If they pay out from now on, according to the strict terms of section 5, they will have to deduct tax from these dividends at the standard rate applicable now.  In those circumstances I cannot see how the benefit of tax relief, because all the profits were earned in the export trade, would be passed on to the shareholder.  I understand that one company which had considerable accumulated tax free profits went public on the basis that those tax free profits would be used to pay out tax free dividends to the shareholders and that they will be prevented from doing that now by the operation of section 5.</P>

      <P>This section makes a fundamental change.  Up to now tax was deducted from dividends at the rate obtaining in the period over which the dividends accrued.  Now section 5 states very specifically that where a dividend is paid in future tax must be deducted at the standard rate in operation at the date of the payment of the dividend, not in respect of the rate in the period over which it accumulated.  There are companies with an accumulation of tax free profits which before this they would have been able to pay out at either a reduced rate of deduction or of no deduction at all.  How will they fare under section 5?  Will it not be obligatory on that company, even though these dividends are paid out of accumulated tax free profits, under the strict terms of section 5 to deduct tax at the standard rate applicable at the date of payment irrespective of when the profits were earned?</P>

Sections 410 and 456 of the 1967 Act deal with the position of companies engaged in the export of manufactured goods.  Those are the sections which will continue to give the benefit to profits made on exports in the future as in the past.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if subsection (3) is the one under which allowances in respect of mortgage interest will be given and thereby would be given at the standard rate.  Secondly, has a case been made to the Minister, and if so would he let the House know what his attitude is, to the effect that under this section a loss of revenue will arise where, for example, dividends are paid in the future to a UK resident out of profits which suffered a lower rate of income tax than the standard rate at the time of payment?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In column (3) of the Table to subsection (1) to delete &ldquo;800&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;1,000&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make the income tax relief in respect of a married man equal to double the income tax relief proposed for a single person.  To do that it would be necessary to raise the relief for a married man from £800 to £1,000.  The Minister may well tell me that we should have done this when we were on his side of the House.  The fact is that the differential which existed heretofore and <Col N="1751" /> which was attacked as favouring living in sin is now being almost doubled by the Minister.  The differential is being increased from £104 to £200.  I feel pretty sure that the Minister does not really need convincing that he should not increase a differential in favour of living in sin and that he will not have any great difficulty in accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal difficulty I would have in accepting the amendment is that it would cost £15 million to implement.  Therefore £15 million would have to be paid by people who were not enjoying the blessings of married bliss.  I do not think there is an obligation on the Minister for Finance to be a marriage broker in addition to his many other onerous obligations.</P>
      <P>The reliefs given in this year's budget to all income tax payers are costing £32.1 million a year.  Matters of this kind costing so much are obviously matters of major budgetary consideration.  In the circumstances, we would not be warranted in entertaining this application at this time.  I know the argument is frequently thrown out that the tax laws operate to encourage people to live in sin. There are greater bonds between man and woman than those of avoidance of tax liability.  Were it not so, the human race would not continue to replace itself from generation to generation.</P>
      <P>This can be argued as well on one side as on the other.  It is good meat for a debating society, but it is not necessarily a valid consideration in fiscal matters.  I am fairly well personally disposed towards this idea and I have made a study of it, but I have yet to find any country in which a married man and a married woman are treated as the equal of two single people for tax purposes.  Perhaps that is because the married man in his wisdom has long since recognised that, if two people cannot live as cheaply as one, they certainly can live a lot cheaper than two people living separately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that if the cost of implementing this would be £15 million the Minister could not contemplate this with equanimity. Nevertheless, I imagine he would agree that it is a retrograde step to increase the differential, as is being done in this section.  This seems to me to be retrograde and unfortunate. I wonder has the Minister any figure to indicate what it would cost to maintain the differential without closing the gap?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; I have not.  If we take £100 as a round figure it might be £7½ million.  I am sure there are many variables in between. Obviously the figure would be not insignificant.  Married persons were the principal beneficiaries of the improvements in the income tax code in this year's budget.  That is another matter which has to be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>The increase in the gap is attributable to the fact that we have increased the allowances.  As the Deputy knows, we are now providing a £200 working wife's allowance.  That has been done out of consideration for the disincentive which some married women felt against working because of the very heavy tax load they had to carry as a consequence.  The larger you make that concession towards the working wife I suppose the greater the differential might become.  I am not opposed to the idea in principle. It is something I would like to do, but one must bear in mind that, like any other concession, somebody has to pay for it.  I do not think this is the time to push this matter.  We have given considerable additional benefits this year to married people.  Perhaps at another time we might look at this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that the cost of this amendment would be £15 million.  Taking the matter in round figures, as he did, it is fair enough to suggest that the cost to <Col N="1753" /> the taxpayer of increasing the differential from £104 to £200 is approximately £7 million to £7½ million.  It is no harm, therefore, that we should realise that, in effect, what the Minister is doing is imposing between £7 million and £7½ million in new taxation. He is getting in an extra £7 million to £7½ million which he would have not got when the differential stood at £104.  In examining these figures for personal allowances under section 6 &mdash;and this is only one of them&mdash;many people fail to remember that, as well as making nominal increases, or what appear on the face of them to be increases in allowances, the Minister is at the same time abolishing earned income relief so that the apparently more generous allowance is in many cases quite illusory.  We should understand that by increasing this differential the Minister is getting more money out of taxpayers who come into this category rather than less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

The Bill is still before the House; it has not been passed and people are getting tax-free certificates incorporating the new allowances.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I wonder is the Minister sincere when he mentions the rejoicing in regard to the single person's tax-free allowance. If we look at the miserable allowance granted in the last budget we find it was exactly £51 for a single person.  Prior to the budget the majority of single people expected far more.  During the negotiation of the national wage agreement this was one of the vital factors taken into consideration and promises were given by the Minister for Finance and other Ministers that substantial allowances would be made in the income tax code, but when we examine the proposal <Col N="1755" /> in the budget we see it means exactly £51 income to a single person. The Minister stated the tax concessions in the budget would cost about £31 million.  He also mentioned in his budget speech that the budget would put 60,000 people outside the income tax bracket.  This is not now true. Since the first phase of the national wage agreement, which averaged about £3 a week, half of those people are back in the income tax bracket and the figure of £31 million worth of a concession is not now realistic.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley's amendment to some extent takes into consideration what the average person expected as a tax concession.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment seriously because the majority of single taxpayers are very disappointed with the concessions given in the last budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and a number of his colleagues, having first been told by us that they should <Col N="1756" /> make a public commitment to increase personal reliefs in order to assist the conclusion of a national pay agreement, told us we were talking through our hats, that it could not be done and that it would be a breach of budget secrecy.  Eventually, they saw the wisdom of what we were saying and they made a public commitment. I said in regard to that commitment on a few occasions&mdash;and I want to say it again&mdash;that the very minimum any taxpayer would expect when he heard the Government making that commitment was that income tax reliefs would be restored to the position in which they were under Fianna Fáil in the 1972 budget.</P>
      <P>In the budget debate I gave figures to show that this was not so, that the position under Fianna Fáil had not been restored and in fact in some cases the allowances were very far short of that position.  Recently, in a discussion with me on this topic on radio, the Minister said when I mentioned this point that he had demonstrated that the statement was untrue &mdash;in other words, that he had demonstrated that the allowances provided in this Bill did restore the position to what it was under Fianna Fáil.  I now challenge the Minister to say where and when he demonstrated this.  If he has to admit&mdash;as I think he must&mdash;that he never did so, would he care to try to demonstrate it now?</P>

The fact is I listened to him and I went through the Official Report with a fine tooth comb and there is no such statement by the Minister and the reason there is not is because the Minister could not make such a statement. I have given the figures and no attempt has been made by the Minister, or anyone else, to show that these allowances proposed under this section do not restore the position to what it was under Fianna Fáil in the 1972 budget.  That is the position and it should be clearly understood that that is the position.  Despite all the claims made for the budget, and consequently for this Bill, by the Minister and some of his colleagues, that is the fact.  This is not even restoring the position to what it was in 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back now to a question I asked earlier, which may be more appropriate on this section: would the Minister indicate what provision is made under the revised system of income taxation for an allowance in respect of mortgage interest?  This is of some importance, as the Minister will appreciate.  He will recall that Deputies on this side of the House made a case in regard to the allowance in respect of mortgage interest. In answer to arguments as to what is happening to mortgage interest under this Bill, the Minister answers by talking about the allowances set out in this section, citing examples to show that the people concerned are, in fact, paying less tax than they would have paid under the <Col N="1758" /> old system.  The Minister has not on any occasion specifically referred to the relief in respect of mortgage interest and the rate at which that interest is relieved.  Could the Minister indicate now what the rate of relief will be in respect of mortgage interest?  Where is the provision?  Is it in this section or in what section does it appear?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I said these were examples of what would happen in relation to all other cases.  Every taxpayer, including people with mortgage interest, will benefit; they will pay less tax as a consequence of the changes in this year's income tax structure.  How many more examples do I have to quote?  I make this challenge to anyone who believes he will not gain: give me a case and I will have it examined.  No such case has been presented.  There were certain references in the public media but they were quickly corrected by people who showed that the calculations made were erroneous.  I am inviting people now who think they will pay more tax to give me the particulars and, if they can prove their case, I will be the first to admit I was wrong.</P>

      <P>The Minister is missing the point, either deliberately or because I am not making myself clear. The Minister is quite correct in saying he took specific examples and gave details as to how they would work out, but he did not indicate in relation to mortgage interest relief at what rate it would be allowed.  That is the point at issue.  It is not the overall position of the taxpayers.  If you leave out mortgage interest relief and increase the allowances as provided in this section, of course the taxpayer on the same income will pay less tax; but the point at issue is mortgage interest relief.  That is the one we want the Minister to clarify now.</P>

      <P>The relief is the rate at which the person is charged.  People could be subject to different rates of relief.  What matters is the end result. As I said in reply to the debate on the Second Stage, if income tax were abolished there would be a huge grievance because no longer would there be any set-off of interest against tax liability.  Because we have reduced the rate of tax the complaint now is that there is a lesser tax benefit for some people, but there is no additional net payment out of the family budget. That is the important point.  There is, in fact, a gain because the tax load will be less than it was up to 6th April of this year.</P>

      <P>If I understand the argument it is that the person should be given relief at a rate greater than the rate of tax he pays.  That would be an anomaly.  During the Second Stage I gave an example of a person with an income of £3,000 and with mortgage interest.  That person saved £87.50.  People do not give a hoot how the tax is calculated as long as they have more cash in their pockets.  No matter how much the people opposite try to twist the formulae by which we have achieved this dramatic and significant easement of the tax burden, and also its simplification, the truth remains that there are substantial cash benefits for everybody under the tax code.  That is all that matters.  You can argue as much as you like that we are only jumping two steps at a time but that does not matter to anybody. People pay less tax.  I will make you a present of any argument you want about any particular stage of this alteration.  Everybody benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we should understand exactly what the position is.  I would like the Minister to confirm whether my understanding of it is correct.  A mortgage interest payment by a taxpayer in any year is allowable in full as a deduction from that taxpayer's gross income in order to arrive at his taxable income. If that is so, it does not matter at what rate the tax is charged.  It may be 80 per cent, 60 per cent or 35 per cent.  If any particular slice of the taxpayer's income is being taxed he will get the allowance in full.</P>
      <P>The confusion arises from the fact that often the inspector of taxes when making his calculation will relate the amount which is to be deducted in respect of mortgage interest to the different slices of the taxpayer's income and the rates at which those slices are taxed.  If a taxpayer is entitled to say, £300 in respect of mortgage interest the income tax inspector would begin by taking the first £100 at 80 per cent and the next at 60 per cent and the next at 35 per cent, if they were the appropriate rates.  If a taxpayer has a gross income of £X and mortgage repayment interest of £Y one can deduct Y from X in order to arrive at his taxable income and then proceed to make the calculations of the tax due at the appropriate rates.  If I am right in that perhaps the Minister will say so.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to explain why the process of putting in a table was resorted to here.  Section 7 amends the 1967 Act as that was amended by the 1973 Act, but this simply changes the figures. When one sees a table inserted it is usually to make more readily available and in an up-to-date amended form a section which would otherwise involve a great deal of research to find out exactly how it now stood.  Is subsection (1) of section 142 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, amended in any other way?  When one sees a table like this it appears that it is.  If one is only changing simple figures in the section why resort to a table?</P>

      <P>We are trying to make this simple and uncomplicated. Maybe if we had put a table in section 4 instead of the particular formula we used, Members might not have had so many worries.  We could have said that section 410 of the 1967 Act was rewritten in this way.  This is purely to illustrate the effect of the change.  This has been discussed at Government level and with the parliamentary draftsman.  This particular form has been used elsewhere with great success.</P>

They are a very valuable drafting device. Here we are using the table system. repeating the whole of subsection (1) of section 142 simply to give new figures and, apparently, nothing else. The wording of section 142 (1) is not changed.  Only the figures have been up-dated.  While I am delighted to see a table at any stage, I am wondering why a table is being used here when only two or three figures were changed.  Am I right in that?</P>

      <P>In page 7, between lines 44 and 45, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 143 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the substitution for subsection (1) of the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1) subject to the provisions of this section and of section 152 any claimant&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) who has paid any such premium as is specified in subsection (2), or</P>
      <P>(b) who is under any statute or under the terms or conditions of his employment liable to the payment of any sum or to the deduction from his salary or stipend of any sum for the purpose of securing a deferred annuity to his widow or provision for his children after his death.</P>
      <P>shall be entitled to have the deduction specified in subsection (3) made from the amount of income tax with which he is chargeable.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section, as drafted, has at least one effect which I assume was not intended by the Minister: it increases the differential which exists by law in the income tax allowance as between Irish life assurance companies and non-Irish companies.  It may possibly have other effects.  That raises a number of problems, particularly as it is contemplated that in due course the differential will be done away with altogether.  I say &ldquo;in due course&rdquo; because possibly under certain EEC developments and on the assumption that fair competition exists, I visualise in due course that the differential will disappear.  Consequently, it seems the wrong approach altogether to start increasing the differential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 72, taken together, are designed to do certain things.  I hope they do that and the Minister can tell us whether <Col N="1766" /> he feels they achieve what I set out to do.  I tried to maintain the existing position, firstly, as between Irish and non-Irish companies and, secondly, so far as taxpayers are concerned to maintain the existing position, so that they would get the same relief as heretofore except in the case of taxpayers who are on the lowest rate, the 26p rate.  The effect of these amendments taken together would be to benefit them because they would get relief at 35 per cent of the standard rate. The existing position would be maintained by adopting these amendments. I hope the Minister would be <i>ad idem</i> with me in aiming at that position and will find it possible to accept these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my budget statement last April, a number of reliefs, including life assurance relief, which up to now qualified for income tax relief only, will in future under the new unified personal taxation structure be available in full to income taxpayers whatever their rate of tax.  As a result the absolute or cash amount of the differential relief which has operated in the past between premiums relating to policies taken out with Irish life offices and those taken out with non-Irish life offices has widened where the taxpayer is liable to tax at the higher rate than the statutory 35 per cent, although the relative ratio between the two reliefs has been maintained. I admit that was not intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the budget we have had very useful and constructive discussions with representatives of both the Irish and non-Irish life offices.  The position <Col N="1767" /> of the non-Irish life offices is such that their competitive position, if the legislation were left unchanged, would be worsened.  They have argued that the pre-budget differential position should be restored in order to leave the absolute or cash advantage to the Irish offices no greater than it was formerly.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept these arguments in principle but there are several practical difficulties in making the changes, including adopting the amendments suggested by Deputy Colley.  These difficulties arise primarily by reason of the short time we have to research the consequences of any changes which may be made.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, many of the assessment certificates required as a result of the changes made this year have already been prepared.  It would be unfair to amend the certificates later and recoup from the taxpayers concerned part of the benefits they had been given.  If any further change were to be made other than that envisaged originally, it would mean a delay of up to three months in the issue of the amended tax certificates to all taxpayers.  That would be a situation that would be unjust and difficult to justify.  Accordingly, I have decided to allow the position as provided for in the Bill remain for 1974-75 but I will provide an amendment in the law&mdash;in next year's Finance Bill&mdash;which will have the effect of restoring to the pre-budget level the absolute or cash differential on existing income tax premium relief between Irish and non-Irish life assurance offices.  The charge would operate from 1975-76 onwards and would apply to all life policies irrespective of when they were taken out.  I might add that this formula has been discussed by us with the two groups concerned.  They consider this to be fair compromise in the circumstances and that there will be no significant distortion or advantage flowing to either groups as a consequence of this arrangement.</P>

First of all, what he has just said severely indicts him for his handling of the Finance Bill and for the time schedule which he has set for it.  Quite clearly the Minister admits that the provisions which he is making in regard to the new unified rates of tax have given rise to a situation in regard to insurance premium allowances which he did not envisage and which he now admits, here in this House&mdash;by virtue of the way in which he is handling the Bill&mdash;cannot be rectified this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a very regrettable situation.  Deputy Colley has outlined quite clearly what is involved here; that the introduction of this new, unified system of rates gives very considerable, competitive advantage to Irish as against non-Irish insurance companies.  The Minister has admitted that he did not want to do that; that he thinks it is wrong and that he wants to restore the situation.  But because of the way he has mishandled this Bill he cannot restore it this year and has to wait until next year so to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second aspect of the matter to which I would like to draw the House's attention is that it proves once again how fallacious is the Minister's case when he comes before us and preaches about simplifying our income tax structure.  These new, unified rates of income tax are the gem in this crown of simplification by the Minister.  In this one area alone it is leading us into complicated territory and causing problems.  In order to rectify the situation in regard to these insurance premium allowances, the Minister will have to bring in a whole lot of provisions which will be, I believe, much more complicated than those Deputy Colley has put down in his amendments, and they are complicated enough.  But the <Col N="1769" /> Minister states that Deputy Colley's amendments do not solve the problem. Therefore he is going to have to bring in much more complicated provisions. Where, then, is this great new concept of simplifying our income tax code?  Even at this late stage would the Minister admit that it is all a myth&mdash;that this, as much as any other aspect of the Bill, proves that all his talk of simplification of our income tax structure is entirely misleading.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Deputy Colley in his approach to this because I think it is a situation which needs to be rectified.  My main interest in it at this stage is not so much the merits of the situation but the way in which this matter highlights the impossible situation in which the Minister has placed us this year, as legislators, dealing with this Finance Bill.  This is something on which we would all have liked to have a good discussion here and have it straightened out one way or the other, but we cannot do it and the Minister cannot do it with all of the resources at his disposal.</P>

I have said on many public occasions&mdash;and I say it here again&mdash;we will never be put off doing what we consider to be right simply because the process of doing it is difficult or because in the process of doing it there may be some temporary anomaly.  We could leave things as Fianna Fáil did and the situation would go from bad to worse.  We could start off with 160,000 taxpayers and end up ten years' later with 730,000 because we did nothing to change the system.</P>

      <P>This difficulty rises not because of simplification of the income tax code, not because we are amalgamating income tax and sur tax into one system which leaves itself open to less avoidance, but because we are in section 9 providing a limit of £1,000 on the amount of premium in respect of life assurance which may qualify for income tax relief.  The number of people in this country who can afford to pay life assurance premiums of £1,000 and over out of their current income are very few and far between. Notwithstanding the fact that they are few, we accept that it would be wrong to allow a gross imbalance to arise between Irish and non-Irish insurance companies, particularly at a time when because of EEC obligations we are moving towards a position in 1977 in which any preferential treatment of Irish assurance will no longer be permissible.  Therefore all we are concerned with at the moment is not providing any significant number of years during which such a concession could be enjoyed which would operate to the detriment of any section of the insurance industry here.  We could well leave it alone and say: Look, Irish industry is entitled to this and if there is a greater benefit here let Irish industry enjoy it.  But, in fairness to the Irish offices, I want to say that they accepted that this would give them an advantage not required by them and they did not wish any injustice, temporary though it might be, to be done to the non-Irish offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this matter has been dealt with in a very constructive and responsible way by all of the people <Col N="1771" /> involved and I see no reason to accept the chastisement of Deputy Haughey. We could have done what he did so often&mdash;done nothing about it.  I need not have come into the House here. I could have said: &ldquo;We will leave this as it stands.  This is a necessary consequence of stopping avoidance.  It is a necessary consequence also of simplifying the rate and the whole tax structure.&rdquo;  However we can provide an easement of this difficulty and that is what we are doing and that is what the insurance industry find acceptable. This will not be the only obstacle on the road to reform of the tax code but we will not be put off because the passage is rough.  At the end of this road the taxpayer will find that the way is much smoother than it was before we began.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing himself less than justice in what he has now said in response to Deputy Haughey's case.  In his Second Reading speech he said:</P>
      <P>Under the old tax code, relief from surtax was not given in respect of life assurance premiums but under the new system it is not possible to retain this exclusion. Accordingly relief may now arise at rates up to 80 per cent on the appropriate fraction of premium payments in the case of individuals with high incomes.  It is reasonable therefore to take some offsetting measure to limit the effect of this change, and it has been decided to restrict to a maximum of £1,000 the amount of qualifying premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister was quite right in that.  He had to take action not to allow relief at 80 per cent in some cases but he should say now that he had to take that action as a direct consequence of the introduction of the new system.  I am disappointed in what the Minister has said and I cannot let it go at that.  The first thing I want to know is whether the Minister would explain in regard to the amendments I have put down what are the other difficulties that would <Col N="1772" /> arise in accepting them apart from the difficulty about tax certification?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's amendments, he is confining the relief only up to 35 per cent and not going beyond it.  That would be contrary to the principle of simplification which I spoke about in my budget speech.  That relief would apply across the board both to Irish and non-Irish insurance interests.  In other words, above 35 per cent it would be applied right across the board in both cases.  That is what we are doing up to a maximum of £1,000.</P>

I do not know if he has indicated the kind of new provision he has in mind but would he propose to maintain the £1,000 limit and what effect would he propose to bring about on the differential in regard to Irish and non-Irish companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would give relief up to 35 per cent on the present differential which is two-thirds in the case of Irish and half non-Irish companies, but it would give relief in respect of any higher rate of tax above 35 per cent on a basis which would be uniform in the case of both Irish and non-Irish.  This would maintain the benefits which at present accrue to Irish premium holders and it would extend to both Irish and non-Irish across the board at the higher rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

If he did he might find that he would not have spoken quite so glibly of this figure as being a large one.  I am quite unhappy at the Minister's approach to this problem.  He has told us that this is the method most acceptable to both Irish and non-Irish companies.  Of course I have to accept that but I am surprised to hear that for one year we will be operating a system which is unsatisfactory.  I personally would prefer the Minister to approach it on the basis of my amendments because they merely maintain the <i>status quo.</i></P>

Deputy Fitzpatrick was quite right to point out that what the Minister said in his budget speech about income tax relief and the new unified rates, could have encouraged taxpayers to take out new policies. They will now find that this restriction will adversely affect them and they will not get the benefits the Minister led them to believe they could expect.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy disputes the fact that there are people in greater distress than those with incomes of £24,000?  The budget contained many indications that any legislative provisions that are used by people for the purpose of avoiding their fair share of tax would be corrected.  This is one of the areas where reasonable people would agree there should be correction.  A person with an income of £24,000 would be in the top income tax rate group of 80 per cent.  I cannot think there would be any justification why this Legislature should impose on society the obligation of paying 80 per cent of the premium of persons in the £24,000 bracket.  We must have a sense of proportion here; a proper proportion is to be found in the limits we are suggesting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, I wanted to hold this amendment until I saw the Minister's attitude to the previous amendments.  Now that he proposes to maintain section 9 as it stands, this <Col N="1776" /> amendment becomes of considerable importance.  The section provides that the new provisions imported in this section would apply on contracts of insurance made on or after 3rd April, 1974&mdash;I think that is the date of the budget.  In his Second Reading speech the Minister stated with regard to section 9:</P>
    <P>One section which was not mentioned in my budget statement is section 9 which makes a change in regard to the amount of life assurance premiums which may qualify for tax relief.</P>
    <P>In the light of that I assume the Minister will have no objection to my amendment which proposes to operate this provision in regard to policies of insurance entered into before 2nd July, 1974, namely, the date of publication of this Bill, which was the first indication any one had of the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>I am assuming the Minister will have no objection to accepting my amendment because the case for it is self-evident.  Clearly there must have been a number of people who, prior to publication of this Bill, in good faith entered into a contract of insurance on the assumption that the position as outlined in the budget statement was the one that would obtain.  However, on publication of the Bill they found a new situation was to operate.  It is self-evident that common justice demands that we should not operate a retrospective section of this kind and, therefore, the correct date to be inserted in the section is the one indicated in the amendment, namely, 2nd July, 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make <Col N="1777" /> any point of it but I made an inquiry while the Deputy was talking.  Let us study what we have been asked to do here.  This amendment is intended to make the £1,000 limit apply only to policies taken out after 2nd July.  In other words, those people who took out insurance policies after budget day and up to 2nd July in the hopeful, even presumptuous, expectation that they would get full relief without limitation would, as a result of Deputy Colley's amendment, get relief without regard to the £1,000 limit not only for this year but for decades.  It would be most unreasonable to expect the general body of taxpayers to bear the cost of the advantage given to people who would be in the five-figure group and upwards.</P>
      <P>For example, if a person with an income of £18,000 took out a policy with an Irish company before 2nd July, 1974, with a premium of £3,000, he would have a tax saving in 1974-75 on that premium of £1,600 which would be £900 greater than he would have earned under the old system.  I do not think that can be warranted.  Similarly, a person with an income of £30,000 taking out a policy with an Irish company with a premium of £5,000 would get a tax saving of £2,666.  On a £5,000 premium £2,666 would be paid for that person with an annual income of £30,000.  By whom?  Not by himself but by the general body of taxpayers because that is what happens when people get an exemption of that kind. I do not think that would be warranted.</P>

I do not care whether <Col N="1779" /> a person is a millionaire or a pauper he is entitled not to be got at by the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners retrospectively. If the Minister does not accept that principle there is nowhere on which we can stand.  Why does the Minister provide in this section the 3rd April, 1974?  Why does he not say whether before or after the passing of this Act. Why apply any limit?  He did not say anything about this on the 3rd April so what is the significance of the 3rd April?  Why does he not go back to the people who benefited to the extent he is talking about last year and the year before?  If his case is justifiable in principle why does he stop?  He is losing money to the taxpayers by stopping on 3rd April.  This is a principle of great importance and I hope the Minister will reconsider his attitude.  More than that, why does the Minister pretend that all that is involved here is people who take out policies at a premium of £1,000 a year?  Why does he pretend that that is the only effect of section 9?  Does he not know, for instance, that the people who are affected by it are the Irish companies and the non-Irish companies and those employed by them?  Does he not know that there are many people who took out policies between 3rd April and the date of publication of this Bill not for £1,000 but for very much less premiums per annum and decided which policy they would take on the basis of the relative advantage or disadvantage of Irish or non-Irish companies and what they could offer?  Does he not know that this section is fundamentally affecting that position and, therefore, the people involved with this section are numerous and in many cases not at all wealthy?  They entered into contracts freely <i>bona fide</i> and on the strength of what the Minister said in his budget statement.  The Minister has no right to come in here behind their backs and say: &ldquo;No, we are going back retrospectively.  We are changing all the rules.  You entered into your contract believing me but that is your hard luck because we are going to <Col N="1780" /> change it&rdquo;.  If that is the Minister's attitude in this matter it will make life difficult for him but it will also make life difficult for the Revenue Commissioners and if that attitude is to be continued it will lead to a breakdown in the whole system the Revenue Commissioners operate.</P>
      <P>For as long as I can remember, and long before that, on both sides of this House it was always accepted that you did not operate Finance Bills retrospectively.  There have on occasions been some arguments as to whether a thing was retrospective or not but the principle that you did not go back and operate it retrospectively was never questioned to my knowledge in this House until this Minister for Finance took office.  I want to tell him that he is totally unjustified if that is the attitude he is taking up and that we will, and must in pursuance of our duties, do what any Opposition would do in this House, and what any Opposition in the past did, and that is to oppose tooth and nail any attempt at retrospective legislation on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly and I do not want to go too far on this because I am hoping the Minister will reflect on what he is doing.  I do not think the significance of what he was saying has occurred to him yet.  I hope that before we conclude our debate on this amendment the Minister will see the dangers of retrospection of this kind.  There are other examples we will be dealing with later but it is terribly important that the Minister should accept what has always been accepted in this House.  There may have been arguments about whether something was retrospective or not but I have never before heard anybody in this House argue against the principle that you do not apply legislation of this kind retrospectively.</P>

      <P>I want to say very seriously that, of course, there is no element of retrospection here whatever. Any person who took out a policy after the 3rd April, which is the date of the budget, did it in expectation or presumption of a benefit which might accrue to him in the <Col N="1781" /> future.  It was <i>in future</i> not in the past that such a policy would have been taken out if it was taken out but I have great doubts.  If it was taken out it was taken out in expectation of a benefit which no reasonable person would have contemplated the Legislature would provide.</P>

      <P>If, when one goes above that, it goes into the areas I have been talking about, areas which lead one not unreasonably to believe that the policies are entered into primarily because &ldquo;Séan Citizen&rdquo; is paying the lion's share of the premium then I think there is a very clear obligation to take steps to prevent that occurring.

      <P>Because we are dealing with a new regime of taxes as and from the commencement of this tax year, which allows the benefit on such policies above 35 per cent.  Primarily that benefit would not have been available above 35 per cent so there is no question of retrospection here.  We are dealing with a new situation which arises by reason of the simplification of the tax code.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to agree fully and strongly with what Deputy Colley has stated in relation to section 9, the injustice of which he is endeavouring to rectify in amendment No. 6.  I am horrified the Minister attempted to do what he did.  I am more horrified now, having heard him reply to Deputy Colley, to see him endeavour to justify his action.  He appears to me, to put it at its most charitable, entirely to miss the point Deputy Colley is making.  I do not think he is that foolish, that he misses the point.  I think he is deliberately giving the impression that he misses the point in order to avoid having to attempt to reply to the nub of this argument.</P>
      <P>The problem that arises, arises because for at least the second time in this year's budget the Minister for Finance made a serious error which he subsequently had to rectify.  The first of these serious errors which he made in this year's budget was in relation to the disallowance of half the personal allowance of people who possessed even the smallest quantity of land.  When the consequences of what he proposed in the budget were pointed out to him he immediately backtracked and said that it would not apply to anyone with a valuation of less than £20, even though the budget was perfectly clear and set it out in black and white, that it applied to everybody, no matter how small a quantity of land he had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second one is the one which results in this mess, that is now section 9 of this Bill.  When the Minister introduced this new system of tax, with the top rate at 80 per cent and the lowest rate at 26 per cent, he completely forgot when framing the budget the sort of consequences which would arise on claims for relief on payment of insurance premiums, on mortgage and bank interest and similar matters where a taxpayer was entitled to certain reliefs before his taxable income was arrived at.  About four Deputies on this side of the House, during the budget debate, pointed out to the Minister the gross inequity of what he proposed to do.  We pointed out that whereas relief under the old system was the same for everybody at 35p in the £, relief would now depend on one's top marginal tax. <Col N="1783" /> If you were not a very well-off-man, who had a taxable income after allowances of less than £1,550, you could benefit only at the rate of 26p in the £ but if you had taxable income after allowances in excess of £9,800 per annum your marginal rate of tax would be 80p in the £ and, therefore, on life assurance premiums you would get relief of 80 per cent on each £ on half your premiums with a foreign company, or ? of your premiums with an Irish company.</P>
    <P>I, and to my recollection, three other Deputies on this side of the House, on the budget debate pointed that out to the Minister who poohpoohed, told us we were wrong, that we did not understand the thing and we were talking through our hats.  We insisted we were not, that we believed we were right.  The budget debate ended conclusively with four of us on this side of the House saying we were right and the Minister telling us we were wrong.  We heard no more about the matter and the public did not hear any more about it until 2nd July when the Minister published this Bill.  In the course of his Second Reading speech he said that among other things in this Bill which were new, that were not in his budget speech, was section 9 which sets a limit of £1,000 on premiums.  He said the reason this was being done was that because of the new graduated rates of tax the well-off people would benefit considerably and the less well-off would lose by it.  He said, while he was not doing anything for the less well-off paying tax at 26p in the £ at least he would curb those at the higher end of the scale and put a limit of £1,000 in premiums on the amount for which they could claim.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that a lot of the people who will be allowed to claim up to £1,000 premiums relief will be those claiming at the second highest rate of 65 per cent.  The vast majority of people are at the lower rates of 50 per cent, 35 per cent and 26 per cent.  They stand to lose under section 9 as it stands.  The better off you are the more you stand to gain on this.  I have no objection to the <Col N="1784" /> principle of putting a limit on the premiums involved, particularly if it is those who are best off who would benefit.  However, I object very strenuously to people who read the budget speech, read the debate afterwards in this House and saw it was the very clear intention of the budget that they should be allowed to benefit to a greater degree than heretofore from insurance policies, and bought policies between 3rd April and 2nd July on the strength of what the Minister for Finance said and now they turn around after publication of this Bill to find that the Minister, for the second time in this year's budget, and for about the fourth or fifth time in his short career as Minister for Finance, has gone back on his word and welched on what he publicly announced.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough to have a situation in which someone announces before a particular game is about to take place that he will change the rules to suit himself but with the present Minister for Finance the situation is considerably worse.  He plays the game first.  He finds you beating him and then when the game is over he says: &ldquo;We are changing the rules now for the game that began three months ago.  We cannot let you away with that.  We will clip your wings now.  You cannot rely on my word. I am entitled, after you have beaten me, to change the rules in order to bring you down to earth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The argument which the Minister put up on this amendment is specious and dishonest.  He went into his usual long cant, that we have heard so much of in the last year, about trying to get at the rich, that it is only the rich who are affected by things like this and why should the ordinary taxpayer have to pay for the benefit the rich get from these policies they might have taken out in good faith. That is a dishonest and specious argument.</P>
    <P>The fact is, as was clearly demonstrated by Deputy Colley, the Minister set out the date of 3rd April in this section because it was the day of the budget and said that anyone who <Col N="1785" /> had taken out a policy before budget day would be entitled to all the normal reliefs without any limitation. There was nothing in his budget which gave anyone reason to believe that there would subsequently be a cutting down of these reliefs.  There was nothing to show that there would be any cutting down until this Bill was published on 2nd July.  There is, therefore, no answer in principle, in honesty or in equity to the amendment in Deputy Colley's name, because the equities enjoyed by those who took out policies between April and July are every bit as great as the equities enjoyed by those who took out policies prior to 3rd April.  The argument Deputy Colley made here now, and which was in no way answered by the Minister, is a perfectly valid argument in principle, that is, that if the Minister, in order, as he puts it, to get at people who have large insurance policies, picks out the 3rd April as being the day on and after which they no longer get these reliefs, to take as much money as possible from them.  He should not pick out the 3rd April. There was nothing said in the budget that gave anyone reason to believe that this section 9 would ever appear subsequently.</P>
    <P>The Minister's own speech on the Second Reading of this Bill made it clear that this was something entirely new and was not in the budget.  If his only reason for doing what he is now proposing to do in this section is to try to take as much money as he can from people, why does he not fix some day like 1st January, 1960, as the relevant date?  He will catch umpteen more people if that is what he wants to do.  He will get far more money for the Exchequer.  But he is being totally dishonest in picking out a date which has no relevance at all, because nobody who would be affected by this would have known anything about it until 2nd July, 1974.</P>
    <P>If this system is going to be operated, it is totally wrong and quite contrary to the whole spirit of our financial or other legislation, that any date, earlier than 2nd July, 1974, should be picked for it.  If the Minister insists on trying to push this provision <Col N="1786" /> through, I can assure him that he will be a long time doing it and that is something which he will regret. I can only hope that some people who appreciate the propriety of legislation will explain clearly to him just how much in default he is in what he is now trying to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not very odd what some people can pick out of the budget statement?  Is it not very odd indeed what Deputies opposite want to overlook?  What they want to overlook and what they want the people of Ireland to overlook is&mdash;I have been chastised for pronouncing this again and again as an objective of this Government&mdash;that the budget statement is an important aspect of tax reform and contains measures to counter tax avoidance and evasion.  I said one of the reasons why our rates of income tax are so high is that a great many people who ought to pay a lot of tax pay very little or none at all.  I indicated that it was my policy in the interest of fair play to take firm action against those avoiders and evaders and to ensure a more equitable tax system.</P>
      <P>If people choose to take the risk of using concessions which are there for the relief of ordinary people to get for themselves vast accumulations of wealth by using the money of the ordinary taxpayer as a subvention to their investment, they have no right to complain when the Legislature takes corrective action to stop such developments taking place.  The change in the whole structure of the tax system operates only for the commencement of this tax year, that is, from 6th April.</P>

As we were giving an indication that we would be making changes, we gave fair warning that if the laws of this land, actual or potential, were to be abused by tax avoiders, we would take action to stop them being so abused. That is what we are doing in this section, and that is why we cannot <Col N="1787" /> find our way to accept the amendment which would give these massive tax free gains to people who are in a position, if they want to make such gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, with some seriousness, to suggest to the Minister that he has no alternative but to accept Deputy Colley's amendment.  In this respect I want to read for him the exact words he used here in this House on budget day in his budget speech, the most important statement of the Minister for Finance in any year.  I quote from his speech:</P>
      <P>Under the existing dual system of income tax and sur-tax some reliefs namely, life assurance relief, health expenses, wife's earned income relief, and age allowance, apply for income tax only.  As it would be anomalous to maintain this distinction under the unified system now proposed, these reliefs are being placed on the same footing as other reliefs and allowances and will be available in full to income taxpayers whatever their marginal rate of tax.</P>
      <P>I want to submit to you, a Cheann Comhairle, that is an unequivocal statement by the Minister for Finance on budget day that anybody who was contemplating taking out an insurance policy could do so with a solemn assurance from him that the insurance premium would be allowable in full.  I suspect, and I think Deputy Colley will agree with me, that the Minister has walked himself into the position without fully realising what he is doing.  In the light of that statement on budget day, he was encouraging taxpayers to take out insurance policies on the basis that under the new unified structure of rates of tax their insurance premium would be allowable in full right up the whole range of the new rates of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is appropriate for the Minister, in replying to this debate, to throw out figures of £24,000 or £75,000, as if we were dealing with tax avoidance or some undesirable aspect of the income tax code.  We are dealing with life assurance.  It is prudent for taxpayers to take out life assurance to look after their families.  The income tax code since the twenties has written into it special provisions to <Col N="1788" /> encourage taxpayers to take out life assurance.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister, and I think if he thinks about it he will agree, that any impartial observer reading his speech on budget day would regard it as an encouragement to people to avail of these new provisions, would assume that from the date of the budget people could expect these premiums to be allowed in full for income tax purposes.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister must accept Deputy Colley's amendments because nobody had any indication that there would be any restriction on the allowance of these premiums until the Finance Bill was published.  Indeed the Minister should allow a week after the date of the publication of the Finance Bill because very few people get time to see what is in the Finance Bill until they have examined it carefully.</P>
    <P>Neither Deputy Colley, Deputy O'Malley nor anybody on this side of the House, objects to the restrictions coming into force from the date of the publication of the Bill because then everybody knows that the restriction is there and nobody is going to take out an insurance policy under false pretences. However, between budget day and the date of the publication of the Finance Bill a situation obtained in which any taxpayer who had read the budget speech, and God knows thanks to the Minister's efficient propaganda machine, the budget and everything in it was sufficiently publicised, was perfectly entitled to feel encouraged to take out an insurance policy in the light of the fact that the full premium would be allowable under the new rates of taxation right up to the maximum rate of tax.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he is doing himself a disservice by endeavouring to create a smoke screen of envy in this and trying to stir up people to be envious of some other group of taxpayers who can take out insurance policies of up to £30,000. That is not what is involved: what is involved is the word of the Minister for Finance as solemnly given in a budget speech, the most important pronouncement he makes in any year.</P>

The Minister was quite correct in doing so.  This year on the budget the Minister referred to tax avoidance systems and methods.  I welcomed his approach in trying to close any gaps or loopholes there might be.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to take a second look at what he is talking about here under section 9.  When the Minister was replying on the first occasion he threw out big figures and big premiums. I am not sure whether he was doing so in order to weight the argument in his favour so as to win the argument by using the examples of some cases of people who took out large premiums.  I do not know whether this exists or not.  I would be influenced if I thought there was a large number of people but I am inclined to doubt it.  What concerns me and the other speakers is the element of retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> It is very important that the Minister for Finance keep in mind that individuals and companies must be able to rely in the probity and the rectitude of the Government financial policy.  This is quite dangerous.  There may be a couple of cases but Members on this side of the House are not interested in those who may have involved themselves in premiums exceeding £1,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>I was concerned that the Minister, on behalf of the Government, should not engage in retrospective action which may shake the confidence of people in our financial and budgetary policies.  A few moments ago the Minister stated that this will apply only from the date on which the Act will apply which is 3rd or 6th April.  I would accept that from the Minister if he had referred to it in his budget speech.  He did not refer to this element of tax avoidance based on large premiums.  If he had mentioned it that would have been a warning to people that, if they took out a very large premium, they would be caught.  He did not do so.  Consequently, I would suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider this, not because there may be a couple of cases, of which I have no knowledge, of individuals who may have been smart enough to believe that they could anticipate what the Minister would do in the Finance Bill, but because of the principle of retrospection which I should not like to see the Minister breach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like again to <Col N="1793" /> try to disabuse the Minister of the idea that the only people affected by this are people taking out very large insurance policies.  The fact is that in the light of what the Minister has told us, that is, that he proposes to retain section 9 as it stands and to amend it in the next Finance Bill, there are people&mdash;and there must be quite a number of people&mdash;who took out quite small insurance policies and whose rate of tax relief is being affected.</P>
      <P>Furthermore it is more than possible that a number of these people made their choice as to which company they would deal with on the basis of a certain differential between Irish and non-Irish companies.  This section is changing that differential.  It is no good pretending that the only people affected are those taking out huge policies.  That simply is not a fact.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I want to remind the Minister again that when he very kindly made me a present of a few days in April he was adroitly trying to avoid a very important point. When I asked him why he was not applying this, for instance, to people who took out a policy in February he said it was because there is a new regime of taxation in operation now. The new regime is operating, as he said himself, as from 6th April.  This section does not refer to 6th April. It refers to 3rd April.  The reason it refers to 3rd April is that that was budget day.  There can be no other reason for referring to 3rd April.</P>
      <P>As has been demonstrated very clearly by Deputy Haughey in his quotation from what the Minister said, the fact is that nobody listening to the Minister on budget day could possibly be deemed to have noticed anything of the kind of thing which is contained in this section.  There is no logic whatever in stating in this section that the section operates in respect of policies entered into on 3rd April.  If it were to be any way logical at all it would have to say that it would operate from 6th April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real truth is&mdash;and the Minister should admit it&mdash;that a mistake was made.  This should have been <Col N="1794" /> mentioned in the budget speech.  If it had been mentioned there would be no problem but it was not mentioned, for whatever reason I do not know.  Perhaps it was overlooked or the speech was too long or whatever. That was an omission.  The Minister is not justified in penalising people because of that omission.  Even if the result of accepting the amendment were to cost the Exchequer some money&mdash;and we have no indication at all whether that is so or if so how much money would be involved&mdash; surely it is more important that the Minister should be seen to uphold a principle which this House has always upheld of not legislating retrospectively in Finance Bills.</P>
    <P>It is simply not possible for the Minister credibly to argue that what is in this section is not retrospective. Surely it has been demonstrated clearly by this side of the House that what is provided here is retrospective and must be retrospective.  The only circumstances in which this would not be retrospective would be if the Minister had mentioned it in his budget speech. If he had, 3rd April would be the correct date and there would be no problem about it.  The fact is that he did not mention it in the budget.  He should not frame the section and he should not argue as though he did mention it in his budget speech. Let him acknowledge that it was omitted for whatever reasons and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>To me it is self-evident in all the circumstances that the correct date is the date of publication of the Bill.  We have no knowledge&mdash;and I doubt if the Minister has any knowledge&mdash;of any large insurance policy taken out in that interval.  I doubt if there is any such evidence but even if there were the principle involved here is far more important than the amount that could be involved to the Exchequer.  The principle of not applying Finance Bills retrospectively is one on which we simply must stand or there is nowhere we can stand.  I hope the Minister agrees with me on that general proposition even if he does not agree with its application in this case.  Could I ask the Minister does he agree with that <Col N="1795" /> proposition that we should not operate retrospectively?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with it but Deputy Colley was acting against that principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may argue if he wishes on particular instances.  I said at the beginning that there have been arguments in the House from time to time as to whether something was retrospective.  I would hope that the Minister would at least accept the principle that we should not operate retrospectively.  Apparently he has indicated now that he does accept that principle.  If he does, is it not a fact that if he had mentioned this in his budget speech there could be no question of anybody saying this was retrospective? He did not mention it and the section is framed as if he did.  If the section were to be framed on the basis of a new tax regime the date should be 6th April but it is 3rd April, the date of the budget.  The framing of the section indicates that it is going on the basis that the Minister indicated in public on 3rd April that this section would operate.  He did not indicate that.  It may have been an oversight.  I do not know what the reason was.  Let him acknowledge that because it was not mentioned in the budget speech he should not operate a section framed as though he did mention it and let us get on with this Bill and not be wasting time on what, on the face of it, is a small point but in principle is a fundamental matter which we on this side of the House cannot concede.  The Minister must understand that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In his various contributions since I came into the House the Minister has indicated that some inequity is emerging under this Bill if what is sought in the amendment is granted.  In making that case he <Col N="1796" /> has posed questions to me to which I would very much like to get answers. What is the merit in granting relief on the payment of premiums no matter whether they are large or small?  That is question No. 1.  If it is a good thing to give relief and there is a good reason for it&mdash;and I am not saying there is not&mdash;what yardstick is used to determine that when the premium exceeds £1,000 it becomes a bad thing to continue it? That is question No. 2.  Question No. 3 is: if, as would emerge from what the Minister has said, it is the new rate of tax that is the variable rating from 26 per cent running up to 35, 65 and 80 per cent.  If this is held to be the cause of the difficulties that now seem to stand between the Minister and various Fianna Fáil Deputies who have put down amendments, surely the new scale should be examined. Judging by some arguments put forward this would appear to be the cause of problems that cannot amicably be resolved between the Minister and the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider that while he has said that those paying premiums greater than £1,000, particularly on policies taken out since 3rd April, would benefit at the expense of other taxpayers, is it not fair to ask at whose expense are reliefs given to those who pay premiums under £1,000?  I cannot see the sense in the argument that anything over £1,000 in premiums is a mortal sin and that if a concession were given in respect of this, it would be done, at the expense of the poor, as it were, according to the Minister.  I should be grateful if the Minister would throw some light on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is now legislating against those who have existing premiums in excess of £1,000 before 3rd April last why has he not taken the obvious step to ensure that under the new scale of tax they will not get a windfall as a result of the new scale?  Will he allow the windfall to benefit such people because they were in before 3rd April and because they are people in the tax bracket paying up to 80p in the £ and would therefore <Col N="1797" /> get relief at 80p in the £ whereas up to now they would not get relief at a rate greater than 35 per cent or, in the surtax bracket, perhaps 50 per cent or so?</P>
    <P>Getting down to what the Minister is perhaps most concerned about, although somewhat obscured by other things he said the small premiums, if the Minister is really concerned about those which come from people of modest means and if they previously were paying tax at 35p in the £&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have about 1½ more questions to ask and I have already posed about seven to the Minister. The question I was about to ask is entirely relevant to the amendment and not to the section only.  It is quite obvious that a loss is being incurred by payers of small premiums as a result of the Minister's action in this legislation.  This loss can readily be calculated, depending on the premium being somewhere under £1,000, in relation to the 35p in the £ standard tax payable up to this year and which is now being reduced to 26p in the £. How does the Minister justify their losing money when it appears that the purpose of the whole section&mdash;and indeed of the amendments&mdash;would be to favour the small, modest investor through insurance premiums?  May I ask the Chair whether we are dealing solely with section 6 or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I apologise to the Chair if I have wandered very widely from amendment No. 6, I thought all four were being discussed.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Several of the Deputy's questions, as the Chair pointed out, are not relevant to this amendment but if the Chair would bear with me I shall reply briefly.  Tax reliefs are given on insurance premiums because, as I understand the will of the Legislature in the past, they wished to provide incentives to people who were saving through insurance. Like any other exemption given to relieve ordinary people and promote thrift among them, if it reaches the stage where it can be abused by the well-to-do without any deprivation of themselves of their standard of living and if they engage in it because one of the major considerations they have in mind is that somebody else really bears a large share of the burden, you have then reached the stage where it is proper to draw a line and say that beyond that line the tax system may not be used by any person because it reaches the point of abuse.  It is very difficult to set the correct threshold. Up to now the law said one-sixth of income was the total premuim which could be availed of to get income tax <Col N="1799" /> relief, but the maximum relief was 35 per cent.  Now that we have amalgamated sur-tax with income tax we are saying that we should apply this new ceiling in addition to the one-sixth of income ceiling of £1,000 and that means that a person with £6,000 could still lose one-sixth of the income.</P>
      <P>If a person goes beyond that, and wants insurance of a larger amount, we say he can do that but he will not get relief of income tax beyond £8,000. He gets relief up to £6,000 but, beyond that, he has gone into a level of income, status and comfort which does not need to be supported by the rest of the community and we do not think it is proper that it should be so supported.</P>

I am sure many professional people in this House have from time to time advised clients of the uses to which life insurance could be put in order to ease their tax burden.  Fair enough, but it is the duty of the legislature to ensure that the law is not used in a way never intended by the legislature.

      <P>This side of the House would agree with everything the Minister has said in regard to dealing with deliberate methods used to evade tax particularly in relation to the changeover in the tax structure. Those involved would be a minority.  I doubt if any here would be included.  The point the Minister does not seem to be able to grasp is that, if there are these two or three black sheep&mdash;I do not know of them; the Minister may have knowledge we have not got&mdash;that is no justification for the Government breaking a very important principle in regard to retrospection. The Minister did not say in his budget statement: &ldquo;I am going to deal with tax evaders.&rdquo;  Had he said that the Government would be justified in saying that the new system would relate to any insurance premiums taken out from the date of the budget onwards, that would be another matter, but that was not said.

Is he further aware there are people whose decision as to which company they would deal with was affected by the existence of a certain differential which was changed by this section?  Is the Minister aware of that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I was not completely satisfied with the answer given by the Minister to Question Nos. 7 and 8 today.  I would like to point out that <Col N="1803" /> I am under a handicap in that the answer to the questions I put was given in the form of a tabular statement which was circulated after Question Time.  I would like to record a certain degree of dissatisfaction about the fact that the answer was so given.  The amount provided to each local authority was not shown.  I only got the total sum.  The figure I queried today is in relation to house purchase loans and supplementary grants.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his Estimate speech last week said that the provision for local authority loans and supplementary grant schemes in 1974 was £20.85 million.  The amount for a full year would be £27.8 million in 1974-75. On 19th July the Minister announced that there would be an extra £9 million bringing the total for 1974 to £29.85 million.  That is for the transitional nine-month year ending on 31st December next.  That is the figure which I received in reply to my questions today.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister the date on which the local authorities were informed of the allocations under the house purchase and supplementary grants headings.  The Minister's reply, gave the date which has not been corrected since although I directed the attention of the secretary of the Ceann Comhairle's office to it and asked her to convey it to the Department of Local Government, as 8th June, 1973. In a note at the bottom it was stated they had not been informed at all.  The Minister pointed out that under these headings £17.4 million was provided in the Estimates for 1974.  He is adding £9 million to that to bring it to a total of £26.4 million.  The Minister states that this would be £35 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that this is an extraordinary turn about in the method of providing finance for the construction of private houses when one considers that the provision by the State last year under both headings was £25.49 million.  It looks as if the figure will be in the region of £38 million this year, showing an increase of £13 million. I will refer to that figure later. <Col N="1804" /> Why did the Minister not refer in his Estimate speech last week to the inadequate amount of money which he had provided for the Local Loans Fund? In his Estimate speech last Wednesday the Minister stated that the Government had taken positive measures to provide finance for houses through an increased public capital programme. We were led to believe last week that the situtation was under control and that positive measures had been taken by the Government to deal adequately with the situation.  In fact, the Minister went further and offered an insult to those who were concerned about the financial provisions being made for the housing industry by saying that people who were commenting on the housing industry should know better.  Whose job is it to know better.  He said they were misinterpreting statistics.</P>
    <P>The day after that the Minister announced an extra £9 million for local authority housing loans.  After not even four months of this financial year there is an admission by the Minister that something has gone wrong with his budget estimates for housing for 1974. It ill-becomes the Minister to refer in the terms he did to the people whom he felt should know better and who are commenting on his housing policy. These people have many pertinent questions to ask him.  Why has the Minister not increased the maximum loans for local authority loans from £4,500?  Why has he not increased the maximum income limit from £2,300? Why has he not taken action on the crisis in the building societies?  One building society has gone out of business in this country.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter on the Adjournment to ask the Minister to inform the House of the source from which this money is to be provided.  The Minister's statement said that the extra finance would be provided by savings in other public expenditure.  That is a vague sentence.  This conveys nothing to the ordinary, intelligent person reading the statement issued from the Minister's office.  It is incumbent on the Minister to inform the House where the cutback in expenditure is to be effected.  He should tell the House whether the £9 million will involve a <Col N="1805" /> reduction in Estimates which have already been presented to this House for other Government Departments and were accepted by the House in good faith as firm Government commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very relevant. It is not fair to interrupt me.  The Minister made the statement.  I did not make it.  Any interpretation put on it does not lead one to a certain answer.  If this affects areas other than local government it is a serious matter.  If it affects other Government Departments it is also a very serious matter.  If it is to involve a mini-budget in the autumn to raise £9 million for local authority loans, we are entitled to know what new taxes are to be imposed on an already overburdened public.  We are entitled to this information.  We are entitled to know where the money will come from.  The records of this House now show that £28.5 million will be provided for local authority loans and supplementary grants in 1974.  The House has not authorised the expenditure of all this money.  This position is highly irregular and is in need of immediate clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that the average gross price of new houses in the Dublin area for which loans were <Col N="1806" /> approved by all agencies in the fourth quarter of the year 1973-74 was £8,358&mdash;those figures were given by the Minister's Department&mdash;yet the maximum local authority loan still remains at £4,500.  If a person's income is £3,300 approximately, he will qualify for a loan of £4,500.  If his income is less, then he will get a lesser sum.  People are being forced to make up the difference between the average price and a sum somewhere in the region of £3,500 and £4,000. They are being forced to go to the banks to seek a second loan at an interest rate ranging from 16 to 18 per cent.  This is very dear money for people buying their own homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that a solution to the building finance problem today will not be solved by allocating an imaginary sum for local authority loans.  He knows also that there are houses lying idle.  He knows, too, that there are threats to the building industry.  In the past three weeks three building contractors have gone bust.  I have already mentioned <Col N="1807" /> that one building society has gone out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>This is not relevant to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken no action in the present difficulties to alleviate the hardships which are being experienced by so many people.  His only comment was that the building societies' lending rates are still under review.  In the present serious financial situation which has developed in the private house building industry there is the ironic situation of the Minister fiddling while Rome is burning.</P>
      <P>The total house purchase loans and supplementary grants for the nine-month period is £29.85 million.  For loans alone the Minister speaks of an amount of £35 million for the full 12-month period to the end of March next.  Then there is the plus for the supplementary grants.  If we put in a figure of £3 million for that, which would be a very small figure, there will be a total of £38 million for 1974-75. Last year an amount of £25.4 million was provided for grant-aided houses, local authority loans and supplementary grants.  An increase of roughly £13 million is being provided by the State.  That could be deemed satisfactory, and indeed acceptable, if this additional money was being provided by way of a Supplementary Estimate. Even with that assurance one could still question the housing policy of the Minister where an additional £13 million is being made available by the State to provide 750 fewer houses than last year.  An ironic situation has developed.  The official Government policy seems to be to reduce the number of privately constructed houses.  The number of completions last year was 17,400.  The target for this year, according to the Minister's figures, is 16,650.  Therefore the Minister is aiming to reduce the number of private houses by 750 this year and a further 750 in the following year. This is a deplorable policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appears to be trying to upset an established industry with <Col N="1808" /> established traditions and practices. The industry had been experiencing continuous growth for several years. For the State to deliberately hinder that progress and set about a policy to reduce the number of private houses being built is deplorable and must be exposed.  This is a threat to the men employed in the industry and is the real reason for the crisis which was deliberately brought about by the Government today.</P>
    <P>On their own admission the Government, because of their interference, are now obliged to provide an additional £13 million.  The end result of all this extra money is a reduction in the number of private houses being built.  In his reply the Minister made no reference to the fact that he had increased by 1 per cent the interest rate on these loans.  It is not referred to in my question or in the reply. I do not wish to dwell on it too long but I would ask the Minister to clarify for many people who had their local authority loans approved whether the increased rates of interest will apply to their approved loans, even though they have not yet received payment. If that is so I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter rather than throw that burden on people who have budgeted for certain payments over the period ahead.  As the Minister knows, most of them are young married people and this would upset their budget plans for the repayment of their loans.  This would mean difficulties and hardship for them.  I do not think the Minister should thrust that on them.  The Minister's statement gave the impression that as and from a certain date&mdash;last Friday&mdash; any loans shall bear the additional 1 per cent.  Some loans were approved six or seven months ago and the people are waiting for the first payment. It would be unfair to them if they were expected to pay the extra money.</P>
    <P>Those are the points I wish to raise.  I should like clarification of the additional £9 million which the Minister's statement, issued through the Government Information Services, deals with in a very vague manner. <Col N="1809" /> It was said in that statement that most of the additional money being provided now will be found from savings elsewhere in public expenditure. In an economy which is rife with inflation, where costs are escalating month by month and week by week, it is extraordinary that a Minister should suggest that he can effect savings to the extent of £9 million to provide money for an industry which is tottering on the brink of disaster. If this is the best the Government can do it is a sad reflection on the person who sits in the Minister's office at the moment and on each individual member of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Over the last few weeks Deputy Molloy's contributions on this question of the housing programme have been funny.  Tonight, they have been hilarious.  He does not even know the simple rudiments of how housing is financed.  He has juggled with figures which obviously he does not understand and yet, he expects to be treated seriously.  As a matter of fact, over the last week-end I saw a newspaper report where he was asked about the £9 million and his comment was: &ldquo;Of course, I knew it was not going to be drawn&rdquo;. Somebody who knows as little about finance as all that would be much better if he did not try to recover the mistake he made last week because we know why this question is down on the Adjournment.  He thought he was going to pick his own time to come in on the debate on the Department of Local Government; obviously he did not want to come in for one reason or another.</P>

      <P>Then he decided he would try to get in on this debate by asking to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  He seemed to say with one voice that, of course, there was extra money being provided, a lot of extra money being provided. He then said: &ldquo;the supposed £9 million&rdquo; but he was not quite sure whether it was going to be provided or not.  Then he talked about a Supplementary Estimate.  I am afraid that perhaps I led him into that today during Question Time because of course, there is no Supplementary Estimate required.  This £9 million represents non-voted capital expenditure. Therefore, the question of a Supplementary Estimate&mdash;as Deputy Molloy will probably understand&mdash; does not arise at all.</P>

      <P>The non-voted capital moneys for which I am responsible are for local authority housing, house purchase loans and supplementary grants, sanitary services, environmental and other services.  The total expenditure on these services has jumped from £47,640,000 in 1972-73 to £98,210,000 in the current 12-month period.  This of course, is the figure for 12 months equivalent to the nine months.  The fact is that the Government have, in two years, provided for a doubling of the expenditure on these services.  But we have Deputy Molloy coming in here tonight complaining.  He talks about the building industry falling down, on the brink of collapse. I would suggest to Deputy Molloy, that, during the recess, he should check on the debates of last year when he said exactly the same thing. Despite the fact that he said this, we built 6,500 houses more than the best Fianna Fáil ever did, and we paid for them too.
