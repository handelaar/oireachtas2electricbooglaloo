      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to extend the statutory limit on borrowings by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara from the Central Fund, to enable the boards to borrow in foreign currencies and to provide for the giving of a State guarantee where necessary for the repayment of sums borrowed by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of those Members of Dáil Éireann who may not be fully familiar with the role of An Bord <Col N="1392" /> Iascaigh Mhara in the fishing industry, I would like to outline briefly what the board's functions are at present.  The general powers of the board were set out in the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, in very broad terms but the primary purpose of the board's establishment can be described as the assistance and improvement of all facets of the sea fishing industry.</P>
    <P>In their early years the board actively engaged in a number of aspects of the industry including the purchasing, processing and marketing of fish but as the years went by it gradually became clear that some of the board's activities were no longer necessary and that they should concentrate more on promotional and advisory activities.  In 1962 the board's role in the furtherance of Government policy in modern conditions was set out in a White Paper entitled &ldquo;Programme of Sea Fisheries Development&rdquo;.  As a result the board have withdrawn completely from active participation in fish processing and marketing and now operate in the role of a development body for the industry.</P>
    <P>The board's present functions include the administration of a marine credit plan under which grants and loans are given for the purchase of fishing boats, engines and gear; the provision of an advisory service to fishermen to improve fishing techniques and promote co-operation among fishermen; the development of markets at home and abroad for fish and fishery products; the encouragement of private investment in worthwhile fish processing undertakings; the operation of three boat years for the building and repair of fishing boats; and the operation of ice-making plants at some fishing ports where such facilities are not provided by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>In addition to their grant-in-aid for capital development, the bulk of which is used to provide grants for the purchase of new fishing boats, BIM receive payable advances each year from the Central Fund for the provision of loans at a reduced rate of interest for the same purpose.  These advances are repaid to the Central Fund from the loan repayments made by purchasers of boats.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> Under existing legislation&mdash;section 1 of the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1970&mdash;the amount of outstanding repayable advances from the Central Fund to the board may at no time exceed £5 million.  That limit has now been reached and it is necessary that it be extended so that the development of our sea fishing industry may continue. Because of the strong demand for new fishing boats, the rapidly rising cost of these boats and the tendency to use increasingly larger boats, I consider that the limit should be raised to £15 million.  This should be sufficient to meet BIM's demands on the Central Fund for at least five years.  The original limit established in 1952 was £500,000 which applied to aggregate borrowing and not the total outstanding.  That limit was increased to £1 million in 1956, to £3 million in 1959 and to the present £5 million in 1970 when it was also decided to change the application of the limit to total outstanding borrowings instead of aggregate borrowings as before.</P>
    <P>The provision of more and larger vessels is the most important part of fishery development.  I would like to quote a few statistics to show how the board's work of assisting fishermen to acquire fishing boats has been expanding in recent years.  Last year the Irish fishing fleet contained a total of 1,126 motor vessels, an increase of 271, or 32 per cent, as compared with 1969.  In the same five-year period the number of vessels exceeding 50 gross registered tons practically doubled from 70 to 138 and the number over 75 gross registered tons more than doubled from 19 to 47.  In the same period the amount of financial assistance given by the board for the purchase of boats and gear tripled from £644,000 to £1,996,000.</P>
    <P>The powers of BIM to borrow from sources other than the Exchequer derive from section 22 of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, as amended by section 2 of the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1970, which provides that the board may, with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, given after consultation with the Minister for Finance, borrow such sums as they may require for the purpose of providing for <Col N="1394" /> capital or current expenditure.  The Attorney General, however, has advised that the statutory powers of State-sponsored bodies to borrow do not cover borrowings in currencies other than Irish currency unless a specific provision to the effect is included in the legislation.  I think it desirable that such provision should be made in respect of BIM so as to enable them, with the approval of my Department and the Department of Finance, to borrow outside the State.  This is being done in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I am also making provision in the Bill for the giving of a State guarantee for the repayment of borrowings by BIM.  This is quite a normal feature of borrowings by State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>I recommend this short Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>We wish enthusiastically to support this Bill.  Any legislation that would in any way improve the lot of our fishermen and provide more employment around our coast will have our full support.  This, the Parliamentary Secretary said, is a short Bill to provide extra financial accommodation for Bord Iascaigh Mhara to expand our fishing industry further.  I wonder whether it will do that.  The Book of Estimates was published on Friday last.  Government spending for the coming year will be increased by something like 26 per cent.  Out of this, semi-State bodies are getting increases of anything from 40 to 45 per cent.  However, when we look at the fishing industry we see that the Government have cut back on expenditure by almost 5 per cent. That is a deplorable cut.  We must remember that 1974 was a nine-month financial period and 1975 is to be a 12-month period.  Even to remain at the same level there should be an increase of 33? per cent without making provision for inflation or the huge increase in expenses which is inevitable. I am sure Bord Iascaigh Mhara will find themselves in the same predicament as every other individual and industry in regard to rising costs.  It is most disappointing to find this cut in such a developing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> At this time the fisheries division should be made a full Ministry.  Everything connected with this industry can be done within the State.  Nothing has to be imported.  Perhaps the Ministry could include such matters as the development of offshore oil and gas. At present fisheries are fragmented over four or five Departments.  We hope our resources of gas and oil will be exploited and that all these activities can be included under one new Ministry.  The British trawler fleet are at present seeking a £20 million subsidy per annum to keep going.  Our fishing industry is doing well.  Our fleet is growing rapidly.  The industry is one of the fastest growing in the country and it is one of natural resources. Is it because it was not causing any problems to the Exchequer that the Government decided to cut back?  Will this £15 million which we are allowing the industry to borrow under this Bill be an advantage to it after the cut back that has been imposed? Let me warn the Parliamentary Secretary that the money to be spent on fisheries for 1975 will barely keep our boat yards in production for the coming year because of the escalation in costs.  It gives us on this side of the House no pleasure to predict that our boat yards will come to a standstill before the month of August next year, this at a time when our unemployment figures are soaring daily and at a time when there is growing confidence in the fishing industry.  To prove this we only have to look at the progress of Bord Iascaigh Mhara over the past several years and to look at the orders they have on their books.  I understand they have something in the region of £7 million worth of orders for new vessels on their books for three years.  After this cut back by the Government it is doubtful if this power to borrow an extra £15 million will keep our boat yards going.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that to date our fishing industry is worth about £18 million to the economy and the value of exports of fishery products stands at something in the region of £10 million whereas ten years ago it was only £1 million.  Big redevelopment <Col N="1396" /> plans are in progress in our major ports and, more important, more young men than at any time in the history of the State are taking over skipper/ownership of huge £300,000 and £400,000 class vessels.  Apart from this there are businessmen and others investing in shore industry based on a resource which all evidence proves is there.</P>
    <P>At the present rate of growth there is every hope that by 1977 £34 million could be added to our GNP.  In the past year 50 per cent of our exports have gone to EEC member countries with a further 43 per cent to Britain. The board's export development programme during the year concentrated on diversification of fish exports into the most remunerative outlets.  The people who are qualifying as skippers are men in their early twenties.  It is gratifying to know that those young men can get financial support for vessels costing £300,000 and £400,000 from financial institutions throughout Europe.  Surely that is evidence enough of the confidence there is in the fishing industry.  If a man in his twenties went into any financial institution for a loan of that size for any other industry or business what sort of reception would he get?  We all know he would be thrown out.  He would not even be considered.  Unfortunately this confidence does not exist in the Fisheries Division.  This is one of the reasons why Fisheries will have to be divorced from Agriculture.  Fisheries is big enough now to stand on its own as a Department of State instead of being an adjunct of Agriculture or some other Department.</P>
    <P>Fisheries should be responsible for all development and for looking after the interests of those engaged in the industry.  It should be responsible for the development of harbours, ports and other facilities essential to the industry. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to processing.  This is one area which has been sadly neglected.  Total investment in the processing industry is hardly £4 million.  The processing industry will have to be developed substantially either by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, private enterprise, <i>entreprencurs</i> or someone else.  Processing will <Col N="1397" /> have to be done here right through from the raw material to the finished product.  This would greatly benefit our economy and provide much needed employment in depressed areas along the western seaboard where the greatest potential for development lies.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry in the past played a major part in curbing emigration. Surely it could play a big part now in halting migration from the west to the east.  Our processing plants are very primitive.  We are doing only the primary processing&mdash;freezing, filleting, smoking and salting.  It is galling to see our fish going out partly processed to continental factories where the final stages of processing are carried out. There is very little sophisticated packaging. It is merely rough packaging for the catering trade.</P>
    <P>One example of the gross lack of development is our herring.  These are exported to Germany, France and Holland to be finished in these countries in cans, jars and marinades. There is no reason why this work should not be done here.  Prior to our entry into the EEC these countries had very high tariff rates on finished fish products for the purpose of protecting their own industries.  With the removal of the tariff rates we have reached the stage now at which Irish producers should expand the processing of fish right through to the finished stage.  This will of course call for a huge capital investment in the industry.  Will part of this £15 million be available by way of loan or grant to enable those interested to make a start in complete processing?</P>
    <P>Last year herring catches were close on 40,000 tons.  This makes us a major supplier of European requirements. With proper development there is nothing to prevent us supplying canned herrings, soused herrings, jarred marinades and other herring products, such as frozen kipper fillets in vacuum sealed packets.  All these would be suitable for the European market, for Germany, France and the United Kingdom, and would provide a valuable source of revenue.</P>
    <P>We are importing over £2 million worth of finished fish products, such as tinned salmon, tinned sardines, fish fingers and so on.  Imports are actually <Col N="1398" /> growing and this could have a damaging effect in the long run on the sale of our own fresh fish on the home market.  White fish would present a bigger problem than herring does from the point of view of processing.</P>
    <P>With regard to research, we have at the moment only one research vessel. This, in itself, is an indication of the truly minor scale of the work.  No single vessel could possibly do the amount of research required.  There is every likelihood that there are unexploited fish resources within our territorial waters.  Investment in research would pay a dividend from the point of view of pinpointing stocks and prevent the danger of overfishing to the detriment of future yields.  We should learn a lesson from what happened in the North Sea where stocks were completely fished out some years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is in order to talk about the protection of our waters.  Probably the Ceann Comhairle will rule me out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major complaints is the lack of protection around our shores.  There are four vessels but these can cover only a limited area.  Their whereabouts are usually fairly well known and foreign skippers relay the information from boat to boat.  More should be invested in fishery protection vessels because illegal fishing represents a loss to the economy.  The position may be made more difficult as a result of our entry into the EEC.  Fishing limits will have to be reviewed in 1983 and may result in a reduction of territorial waters. Could our laws be amended?  Now, when foreign trawlers are caught within territorial waters, the skipper is fined and the gear is confiscated. Could we adopt tougher measures which would inhibit illegal fishing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must congratulate the board on the job they are doing but the board should be expanded.  Some members of the producing association should be on the board.  This is essential since they are the basis on which the whole industry rest.  This is essential in the years that lie ahead now that it is <Col N="1399" /> more than probable that the Conference on the Law of the Sea, which it is hoped will conclude next May or so, will give exclusive rights for all economic exploitation within a 200 mile zone from the nation's coast. This will give Ireland extensive tracts of some of the most valuable fishing grounds in the world in the north east Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Maybe this does not count within the aegis of the Parliamentary Secretary, but the Government should take note that a huge fishing port will have to be developed on the western seaboard. It is essential to our economy that this work should be put in train. The lack of a major fishing harbour will hinder growth in what is already the most under-exploited of our fisheries.</P>
    <P>The number of fishermen in the industry remains static with new recruits only filling the gaps left by older men retiring and other forms of labour waste.  BIM will have to try to attract new recruits to the industry. There are many other aspects of this Bill which I could discuss but I know that other speakers are anxious to get in.  We wish BIM every success and we hope that some of the things which will be said here today will be taken into consideration in the expansion of this huge industry.  It deserves the attention of a Government Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Fishing is our third largest industry.  Being an island country and fishing being one of our natural resources, I agree with the last speaker that we are not spending enough money on fishing.  I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the job he is doing for our fishermen.  I have heard nothing but the highest of praise of him from any deputation who met him.  He listened very sympathetically and he did his utmost for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishing industry should be taken away from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  It is an important industry and it should be dealt with by a separate Department.  It is good to see that the Parliamentary Secretary is looking for an increase <Col N="1400" /> in the limit to £15 million.  In 1962 the limit was £500,000, and today it is £15 million.  I hope this will enable BIM to meet the terrific demand they are getting for money from our fishermen. If young men who are able fishermen, who can make a good job of fishing, apply for loans they should not be denied the money which is available.  This industry is too important to spare money on it.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to realise that over the past five years our 50-ton vessels have increased from 70 to 138 and our 75-ton vessels have increased from 19 to 47.  Like Deputy Brennan, I live in a constituency where we have the most modern fishing port in the country. In the past couple of years we have seen terrific advances with new piers being built, factories going up and a boat yard.  No matter what night you travel down that road you see five or ten lorries bringing the fish to be sold in the cities.</P>
    <P>BIM have done a terrific job in marketing fish.  We cannot overemphasise the promotion needed to sell more and more fresh fish.  At one time most people used to eat fish on Friday.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara must promote the different ways in which the different fish can be served.  Nowadays the housewives are looking for filleted fish.  They are looking for shell fish, mussels, oysters and all the different kinds of fish.  We must encourage the fishing industry.  I, too, support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could hardly let this occasion pass without coming in to lodge a protest at the fact that the Book of Estimates shows a drastic reduction in the amount of money available for this most important industry.  I want to put it on record that the people in the industry are appalled at the way this Estimate has been handled this year and to appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to try to redress the wrong even at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present state of the economy this is one industry in which we would expect to see investment by the Government and signs of new development, because it can have a direct effect on the economy in the part of <Col N="1401" /> Ireland where it is most needed. Frequently in this House we talk about the undeveloped areas, the less-favoured areas, the areas where decentralisation might help, and the areas where special incentive grants should be applied.</P>
    <P>We have two natural resources in in the west of Ireland, fishing and tourism.  We have the raw material for them given to us by God.  If we do not make an effort to develop this important industry we cannot claim to be serious about anything we are doing in this House.  Yesterday a serious blow was delivered to our tourism industry, and today we have to refer to a reduction in the Book of Estimates, Estimates which would need to be doubled if they were to pick up the slack which has come about by inflation and make for the expansion our industry is geared for.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry has made steady progress down the years but it is now only beginning to show itself. That industry is now in a position to absorb more capital and respond more actively than any other industry.  This is a sad story; it is a disgusting story and I want to protest in the strongest terms at the failure of the Government to give the Parliamentary Secretary the necessary money to do something with this important industry. This industry has a high labour content. It is an industry which, capital wise is not a difficult one to finance in that it will respond pretty rapidly to any investment.  I did not come here to make political capital out of this but coming from a maritime county I was saddened, disgusted and completely upset to see that this Estimate was singled out for reduction this year.</P>
    <P>At times we have referred to urban-minded people in Government and the lack of knowledge of the problems of the western seaboard&mdash;at times we may stress it too much&mdash;but there are signs that this is the position.  The Government are now hitting an industry that is most deserving of investment and most responsive to capital in-feed.  The action of the Government in cutting this Estimate is difficult to understand because the fishing <Col N="1402" /> industry is now geared for a great go ahead.  We have more water than land and for this reason fishing should be our primary industry.  It has been frequently said in this House that it is only being scratched.  I was never content with what we were able to do for this industry in the past, but the industry was rapidly gaining momentum and showed signs of reaching the stage it should reach for a country surrounded by a wealth of waters.</P>
    <P>We talk about the potential offshore mineral wealth, the Continental Shelf, and the exploration that should be carried out at £1 million per bore for testing the possibility of gas or oil, but the fishing industry only requires the capital because the exploration has been carried out.  The potential of this industry is well known to everybody but it is starved for capital.  This is an on-going industry that should get more and more capital each year.</P>
    <P>My main purpose here today is to protest against this complete lack of responsibility by the Government in curtailing the capital available for this industry.  Increasing the borrowing limit of State guarantee to £50 million means nothing.  This has been increased as time went on and as inflation ate into money value.  The question of being able to borrow is one which must be questioned because it is subject to our being able to borrow abroad and we have been borrowing so much abroad these days that we are wondering when the time will come when our cheques will be returned.</P>
    <P>To develop the fishing industry was a difficult task and this could not be done rapidly because a four-pronged assault was necessary to bring the industry up to a proper standard.  It was necessary to increase catching power and to do that it was necessary to have marketing.  It was also necessary to have processing stations ashore and to improve harbour facilities for the people engaged in this occupation. I watched with interest all these things happen.  The progress was commendable and we were reaching the stage where success was breeding success. Our boat yards were working to capacity and the size of boat was increasing. In Killybegs the biggest boat <Col N="1403" /> now is more than 80 ft.  I am not making the point that everybody should have a larger boat.  When I visited the north of Denmark to have a look at the fishing industry I was impressed by the fact that the fishermen there used every size of boat, the small boat to go to sea for a few hours, the larger craft which spent months at sea and the craft used for fishing from morning to evening.  We should continue to use boats of all sizes but the use of the larger boats ensures that our fishermen are able to exploit the wider limits available to them.</P>
    <P>These signs were most encouraging in recent times but the necessity for more capital is becoming more evident.  I would hate to think that anything would halt the progress that has been made in that direction.  Our navigation education has improved and facilities have been provided for the training of fishermen-skippers, in particular.  It is a huge undertaking for a young man to go to sea with gear worth close on £250,000.  The repayment of a loan of that size is a big undertaking but this has been done in many cases.  Young skippers, sometimes in their early twenties, have qualified for the bonus payable to those who have repaid their loan before the allocated time.  This is proof of the enthusiasm of such skippers, of the progress in that industry.</P>
    <P>The most interesting thing in recent times is that the old tradition of only sea folk going into the industry has disappeared.  We now have people from inland counties going into the industry, completing their training and taking charge of boats.  They have successfully proved that it is not necessary to be a kind of amphibious animal to be a fisherman.  The conditions under which crew work are better and the boats now have facilities for sleeping and eating, facilities which boats did not have heretofore. The net result is that fishing is becoming a more interesting occupation and one which is providing a high standard of living for the growing numbers going into it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Killybegs harbour development <Col N="1404" /> is not held up again.  We ran into capital shortage more than once since that development work began. A former Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, on one occasion had to tell a deputation that the reason why we were not making more progress was that we did not have the finance.  He gave an undertaking to that deputation that the finance would be provided as soon as possible.  This was done and this very big undertaking, which was originally recommended in the course of a report on deep sea harbours around the coast, commenced.  I would hope that the necessity for that urgently required accommodation in Killybegs would be recognised and that work would proceed. If the Parliamentary Secretary could borrow on the strength of the extended facility being afforded him here he should allocate the moneys to harbour development of that type in order to ensure that the industry would not be restricted for want of accommodation and that provision be made for the growing fleet and larger boats the outcome of many years endeavour put into the industry in the past.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal also to the Parliamentary Secretary or to anybody who may succeed him to put a few extra million pounds into the development of this industry.  I would appeal to him not to forget the casual fishermen around the coast and the little facilities they have come to use and enjoy around the western seaboard. We had a storm last January which did a lot of damage to many of these landing places.  Not one penny has been spent since putting right the damage done on that occasion.  Lest the Parliamentary Secretary might think I am speaking off the top of my head, so to speak, I am thinking of places like Rossbeg in Donegal, Inver, Malinbeg, where the facilities were either destroyed by storm or eroded over the years.  No effort has been made in this respect.  I have failed even to get satisfaction from the Department in relation to Malinbeg when I put a number of urgent requirements before them for the fishermen who use that landing place with their small craft and do a very <Col N="1405" /> good job in that respect as well as farming a little land.  The part-time fisherman must not be overlooked in our efforts to develop the larger ports. I would make a very earnest appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to find some money in the EEC or elsewhere for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We talk about regional development. Yesterday we received a paltry sum of money for regional development that would not even construct a decent road from here to Galway, would not even patch it.  I should like to see somebody negotiate at EEC level and come back with £100 million to develop fishing on the western seaboard, really make the people realise that we are up and doing, that we mean business and that we are going to develop one of the greatest industries of this country.  It remains still only as a bad third when it should be equal to agriculture and manufacturing, if not ahead of them.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for having done a good job and put a lot of expertise into fishing.  I admire them.  Over the years they have had their critics, sometimes the fishermen themselves&mdash; and fishermen are not always people easy to deal with; they have many problems and tend to blame them on many people and many sources&mdash;but the fishermen in Donegal are among the best in the world.  I think they would all agree that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have been doing a very good job in so far as it lies within their power to ensure that the industry is developed.  For goodness sake, give them the money to do it.  It is a good capital investment and a lot better than some of the things on which we are spending money.  As I have said at the outset, it will respond more rapidly and any capital fed into it will yield an immediate return.  It will reduce that about which we have spoken so much&mdash;the balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the previous speaker, spoke about the sale of fresh fish.  I am not anxious to encourage the sale of fresh fish.  I feel it is like selling cattle on the hoof.  The more processing we can have at home the better.  When we engage in processing whether it be <Col N="1406" /> smoking, marinating, deep-freezing, filleting, or anything else all of which is being done at present we are enabled to hold our supplies and place them on the market at the most advantageous time.  The fresh market is one that must be availed of immediately and one must take or leave whatever may be the price at a given time.  Processing is a market that ensures continuity of supply.  Nowadays there is no such thing as dumping of fish supplies.  I remember on many occasions seeing herrings being put out on the land as a fertiliser when they could not be sold.  Thank God, that day has gone. Many people in this House would find it hard to believe that tons of those herrings had, at times, to be dumped because they could not be sold.  We will never have a glut of fish now because the fishmeal factories are prepared to step in at all times, when the price drops below a certain economic level, to process them and they can use more than they can get.  Our fishmeal can be sold in competition with Peruvian or any other in the world because it is of a higher standard and generally of better quality.</P>
    <P>Thank God, again, we have seen a lot of progress made in the fishing industry in recent years, thanks to those who have worked hard in it.  But today we are alarmed and worried at the way the industry has been treated in this year's Book of Estimates.  This is not something that could not be remedied as yet were the will there to do it.  A Supplementary Estimate for a few million pounds would be very useful.  Increasing the borrowing to £15 million will take up a good deal of the slack in the devaluation of money as a result of the inflationary erosion of money values.  Assuming that we could borrow that money, assuming that it would be available to us from some money market abroad, it should be used primarily to improve landing facilities and particularly to complete those works in hand because until they are completed, they are not a proper investment.  Until they are officially completed, they are not yielding to the nation the benefit intended.  I was glad that permission was granted to the fishermen in Killybegs temporarily to use part of the development <Col N="1407" /> there because they were completely hampered through lack of space.</P>
    <P>My main reason for speaking is to protest about the way the industry has been handled in the allocation of Estimates. When there was going to be a slashing of the capital programme it is a disgrace that this most important industry should receive such treatment. I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to do something about it.  I want also to reiterate the need to keep the smaller landing facilities around the coast in a decent state of repair to enable part-time fishermen to continue their seasonal work which is their main source of income apart from anything they may make on their small holdings. It is one of the means of livelihood in the west and not one that can be taken from the people there as a result of centralisation or any rushing to the brighter lights of the city.  It exists and development of it is what is needed. The tourist industry, having received the knock it did last week with the increased price of petrol, the fishing industry now is showing signs of being starved of finance.  This is a bad omen for the future.  I do not approach this with any desire to use it as propaganda but in an effort to make a genuine appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, along with the Minister for Finance, to ensure that we on the western seaboard live too.  If we have not got anything worthwhile out of the regional fund, at least we have the raw material for two great industries, if given a chance. One of those is fishing and the other is tourism.  The Government must realise the importance of our fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to say a few words in support of this Bill.  Like the other speakers, it is my contention that more money should be provided for the fishing industry.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a man who is deeply interested in the development of this industry.  He is living on the water's edge, as it were, and he meets with fishermen every day of the week.  It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that he has a much greater knowledge of their problems than any of his predecessors might have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> I wish to pay tribute, too, to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara who have done a tremendous job.  For a number of years the fishing boats were on the small side but there is now the realisation that, if we are to make a success of the industry, there must be larger vessels.  I am glad to say that during the past few years the trend has been towards these larger vessels.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would refer briefly to the question of our boatyards. These concerns have not been given the support that they deserved down through the years.  Too many boats were imported from abroad and, unfortunately, the history of those imported vessels has not been all that might be desired.  Many fishermen have found fault with them and some of the vessels are now lying idle although they were very costly to purchase. It is generally accepted by the fishermen that those boats built in our own yards are of better quality than the imported ones.  There is a boatyard at Baltimore in Cork which has a very long tradition in the building of fishing boats, but I was amazed to find that they did not have a crane with which to shift the heavy materials required for building the larger fishing vessels.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to use his influence with an Bord Iascaigh Mhara to enable our own boatyards to be equipped better so that the larger vessels could be built here.  The day has gone when heavy timber or steel could be lifted by manpower.  With the proper equipment our boatyards would be in a position to compete favourably with foreign shipyards.</P>
    <P>While the Naval Service are carrying out fishery protection work around our coast, the board should take an interest in providing small boats for the protection of the fishery industry. While the Department of Defence have increased their number of protection boats, these vessels are still very scarce so that they are not capable of carrying out all the protection work necessary.  The result is that foreign trawlers are fishing off our coasts, sometimes within the twelve mile limit.  During the year many of these boats were captured but we can assume that others escaped.  An adequate <Col N="1409" /> protection service is the basic requirement in regard to any efforts to safeguard our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>As the previous speaker said, a number of small fishing harbours and piers have been neglected for many years.  That speaker however was seeking a sum of £100 million for this work, but he did not think of giving credit to anybody for the £35 million that we are to receive as our share of the Regional Fund.  That amount of money should not be turned down and we should thank the people who were instrumental in our qualifying for it. Might I suggest however that some of this money be spent on improving piers and harbours around our coast, especially fishing harbours?  I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary is well aware of the need for improving the harbours at such places as Schull, Baltimore, Courtmacsherry, Kinsale and a number of others which are used as a safe anchorage by fishermen, who consequently do not have to take their vessels the many miles to Bantry and other places.</P>
    <P>We must be prepared to provide sufficient moneys to enable us to have the best possible fishing industry.  As much money as possible should be provided for the purchase of bigger boats.  Courses in fishing are very important, too.  In this regard the board are to be congratulated on the courses they provide for young fishermen. It is heartening to see these young men completing these courses which equip them to take over those big vessels that are costing up to £100,000.  Every effort should be made to encourage participation in the courses.  However, we can rest assured that the Parliamentary Secretary, with his intimate knowledge of the industry, will do all in his power to help the fishermen make a better livelihood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long.  At the outset I congratulate An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the great work they have been doing during the past ten years in providing grants and loans for the purchase of fishing vessels.  Much credit must go, too, to the Parliamentary Secretary who is deeply involved <Col N="1410" /> in the problems of the fishing industry. I am sure he is well aware of the plight of fishermen, not only in his own area but around our coasts generally.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a word, too, in praise of the training courses provided for young fishermen.  This training, together with the grants and loans that are made available to them, enable them to make a good livelihood. However, of equal importance is the provision of adequate facilities for the harbouring of these boats. There is a great need around our coasts either for the reconstruction of existing harbours or for the provision of small piers so that when there is a storm the skipper can proceed to the nearest harbour for shelter for the night.  Otherwise, he suffers the risk of being lost at sea with his crew.  There are some facilities around our coast but there should be guiding lights to enable fishermen to see where they are going with their boats.  It is very hard on any young skipper if he has a boat worth £100,000 which he is trying to pay for, and he goes into a harbour where there are no guiding lights and where he may catch the boat against a ledge of rock, and it may cost him £1,000 to have the boat repaired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our fishing fleet has grown a hundredfold in the past ten to 15 years.  People make a good living out of fishing but it is hard work.  The three islands off the Galway coast, the Aran Islands, are greatly concerned with fishing and when the herring and mackerel seasons come around boats come from Dunmore and Killybegs. The harbour is choc-a-bloc with boats.  Often a ship comes in to take away ore or ships come in with timber, phosphates and so on.  These boats must be moved from time to time.  I understood the Parliamentary Secretary was to visit Galway but the Galway races intervened and he did not come.  I would ask him to come and take a look at the bottleneck in Galway harbour with fishing boats and all the rest, so that a decision can be made one way or the other on the new fishing harbour announced years ago in Galway by the then Parliacee <Col N="1411" /> mentary Secretary, Deputy Fahey, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance.  If the project has been shelved it should be taken off the shelf.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is confined to loans and grants and so on, but there are many inshore fishermen who must be protected.  They make a mere livelihood out of fishing and their work is even harder that that of a man with a big boat who can ride the swell of the sea.  The man with a small fishing boat with a diesel engine is always in danger.  That is why I say guiding lights should be provided in the harbour.  Could grants or loans be given to inshore fishermen who set the lobster pots for crayfish and lobster? If a storm blows up they can lose anything up to £500 worth of lobster pots and go into bankruptcy.  The Parliamentary Secretary will get all the support he needs for assistance in this direction.  I would ask him to come to Galway as soon as he can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he was down already and saw the harbour when the fishing fleet was in, he will agree that something will have to be done.  In Galway the fishing fleet comes into the inner harbour.  If a Tynagh boat comes in it must go into the inner harbour to turn around and face out towards the Atlantic and pull up beside the shed to unload the ore.  The fishing boats would have to be asked to move aside to enable the other boat to turn.  The owner of the boat may have gone home to Waterford or Killybegs or he may be at the far end of the Gaeltacht and it would be very hard to contact him, and the tide means a lot when you are bringing a big boat into Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the old Congested Districts Board there were beacons to guide <Col N="1412" /> fishermen into port.  The ones I have in mind are those leading to Killeaney in the Aran Islands.  There are four to six beacons there altogether.  During a storm five or six years ago one of them was knocked down.  One side of these beacons is usually painted white to guide the fishermen at night. If a storm blows up the boats leave Kilronan pier and head for Killeaney where there is complete shelter.  These beacons have not been painted or whitewashed for a number of years.  In view of the value of these boats and their cost to the fishermen, it is only a small thing to ask that this be done. Until the Parliamentary Secretary takes a stand they will be left at the mercy of the waves and the swell.  I would ask, therefore, that he seriously look into this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill which reveals the progress made in our fisheries industry. I welcome the fact that it allows BIM to extend the limit of borrowing from the Central Fund from £5 million to a new limit of £15 million, which it is thought will be sufficient for the next five years.  I also welcome the second provision which gives them the capacity to borrow abroad with the permission of the Minister for Finance.  Borrowing outside the country carries risks, so far as inflation is concerned.  Sometimes we would have reservations about Government Departments or semi-State agencies going outside the country for their funds for obvious reasons.  When one is dealing with an area, which is basic to the economy, developmental in nature, which is developing raw materials for resources, providing employment and helping our balance of payments, it has all the ingredients of what must be termed &ldquo;top priority&rdquo;.  In other words, if there are problems in the country this is one area in which we cannot afford to let up.  The net loss to the nation if there is not progress in such a fundamental area, will be infinitely greater than any reservations we might have about borrowing for such activities.  Therefore, I am completely in favour of the development of the fishing industry to the fullest potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> Despite the progress BIM have made in fishing we are still at an elementary stage.  We must avoid falling into the trap of patting ourselves on the back too much.  There is a danger of being carried away by figures, especially when we are looking at the increased financial value of catches in recent years due to the level of inflation.  Our assessment should be based on catches in terms of tons and numbers of fish rather than financial value.  The most recent figures in my possession are for the period 1970-72. The increase in the quantity of wet fish in that period was from 1,325,000 to 1,489,000.  This is progress, but at a relatively slow pace.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that the provision of more and larger vessels is the most important part of fishery development. I believe this to be at the root of the fundamental problem in the Irish sea fishing industry at present.  It is fundamental also when we look at the level of catches and the value of fish. Despite the progress referred to, we are still relatively underdeveloped and, to a very large degree, engaging in inshore fishing.  We will have an escalation of this and rapid progress only when we begin to tap the resources further from our shores and which we are very limited in tackling at present, not due to skills or men, but simply due to the lack of facilities in the form of adequate harbours with infrastructural necessities and adequate depths and also the question of larger vessels to allow us to venture further from our shores.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of sense in looking at our offshore prospects.  The figures we have read are startling in so far as they show the degree to which other European countries, even land-locked countries, are tapping a resource which is nearer to this than any other country.  Only a tiny portion of the fish off Irish waters is being caught and landed in our ports by Irish boats.  We have seen the extraordinary movement of large vessels from continental Europe and the very heavy catches of fish off the Irish Continental Shelf being caught and brought to continental <Col N="1414" /> ports.  The total tonnage of fish taken by European countries in sea areas near the Irish coast in 1971 was 700,000 metric tons.  This gives some idea of the potential which exists for us to tap.  I welcome this Bill because the provision of larger vessels will lead to a rapid increase of funds in capital investment.  If progress is to be made, the £15 million which BIM are seeking may be absorbed sometime before the five-year period expires. I look with some disquiet at the Estimate for fisheries in next year's capital programme.  At first sight it seems that fisheries in 1975 will be provided with £4,240,000.  In the nine months ended December, 1974 &mdash; we are not comparing like with like but a nine-month period with a 12-month period &mdash; £4,473,000 was provided as compared with £4,240,000 for the 12 months of 1975.  This is a reduction of 5 per cent and is inconsistent with the Estimates for other Departments.  An explanation of this figure is necessary.  How is this figure arrived at?  To what extent is the drop in the budget contained in the Department or within BIM?  The sea fishing industry is vital to our economy and must not be starved of funds.  If there is a limitation on the availability of funds, that limitation should be in non-productive areas of the economy.  We may have supplementary Estimates for this particular area later because the fishery industry will have a problem providing the necessities in 1975.</P>
    <P>Like some Opposition speakers, I believe this is a useful time to question the State organisation of marine activity.  Before becoming a Member of this House I always questioned the wisdom of fisheries being in the same Department as agriculture.  We are an agricultural country.  Next year agriculture has a massive budget of practically £80 million.  By its nature, it demands the concentration of the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  We must question some fundamentals about State organisations which affect various Departments, but particularly fisheries and the validity of its inclusion in the agricultural area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended making a few further remarks but I bow to your judgment.  We are pleased in Mayo with the proposal to develop Ballyglass harbour.  We are frustrated by the delay in regard to the design of such works.  We urge those involved to speed up the provision of this harbour because on the Mayo coastline there are many fishermen who are starved for adequate harbours.  There are very few landing points of any depth between Galway city and Killybegs.  Therefore, the provision of this harbour is of vital importance to our economy.</P>
      <P>While Killybegs is the port at which are discharged the highest quantity of fish a large proportion of it is caught on the north Mayo coastline.  The provision of this harbour and additional employment for our people there would be particularly welcome.  There are possibilities at present, even greater than originally envisaged, in other areas in which a harbour can be used. It is possible on that part of the coastline, because of all the discussions taking place about offshore oil exploration, that where there are no harbour facilities a good harbour could be used as a basis for such exploration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about fish farming.  Apart from the people in BIM, who are active in this development, who are extremely well qualified and are <i>au fait</i> with the possibilities, we are not sufficiently aware of the possibilities that exist in this aspect of fishing.  Fish farming was in the science fiction area a couple of decades ago.  It then moved into an era of fairly hard research.  It has now come out of <Col N="1416" /> the research and development area into a specific type of fishing, where there are hazards.  It is an area in which we have great resources, because of our sheltered bays, the ideal format of them, the unpolluted waters and the temperature of the water.  We have this tremendous advantage for this aspect of fishing which is almost undeveloped. In other countries there is enormous development largely by multi-national companies.</P>
    <P>BIM, while looking at the development of fish farming, should attempt to get the greatest possible level of Irish participation.  This would be preferable to having multi-national companies coming in to use our resources. There are about 5,000,000 tons being produced for human consumption all over the world.  This aspect of fishing could be tackled by Irish commercial interests and farmers who live along the coastline.</P>
    <P>The problem arises with regard to how this should be tackled.  I believe the IDA are doing useful work in pointing out to Irish business people in different towns, whose background is commercial rather than industrial, the possibility for investment in industry. They should undertake a similar type of campaign with commercial interests, who may have no knowledge of the sea or fishing, provide feasibility studies for them, show them the unlocked potential which we have and instil an interest in Irish companies for this type of development which offers one of the greatest possibilities for development at present.</P>
    <P>I intended speaking at some length about the organisational question and the degree to which we are a maritime country and the degree to which I believe maritime matters should as far as possible be contained within a single Department.  If it must, due to constitutional limitations be grouped with another Department, one infinitely more rational than the Department of Agriculture might have been chosen.  However, since this is beyond the bounds of this Bill, I will finish by welcoming it with my reservations about the Estimates and hoping we will continue to make progress in the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming this Bill I must express disappointment with it.  I do not agree with the previous speaker when he said this will mean a massive capital investment for our fishing industry.  It will do no more than keep pace with inflation and with increased costs of materials used in the building of boats and the other works in which BIM are involved.  This only allows for an average increase of about £2 million a year in the borrowing of BIM.  This is subject to obtaining this money from abroad.  So much money has been borrowed from abroad in recent times that I foresee difficulties in having this money available.  I have to express disappointment with this Bill especially when we see in the Book of Estimates a reduction of 5 per cent in the money available for this important industry.</P>
      <P>Many speakers referred to the progress made in the fishing industry over the years and I agree with this.  I was responsible for fisheries for three years and during that time I was able to assess the progress made.  While I felt that progress was reasonably satisfactory I was convinced that we were only scratching the surface as far as the fishing industry and its tremendous potential was concerned.  We did not make the progress we wished for mainly because of lack of finance and it is sad to see now that the necessary finance to continue the rate of expansion is to be curtailed.</P>
      <P>This Bill will do nothing to offset that curtailment in any way.  We have a tremendous resource around the coast which is crying out for development and to be exploited to its fullest extent but this Government do not intend to continue the rate of progress we were making.  We hope the demand for newer and bigger boats and for more up to date equipment will continue. We hope there will still be a need to continue the expansion of our boat yards but I fear that finance is not being made available to allow that expansion to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Bord Iascaigh Mhara, its chairman, staff and members of the board and all involved in the Fisheries Division for the <Col N="1418" /> progress we have made even if it is limited down the years.  I should like to refer to the fragmentation in our fishing industry.  I should like to see the work of the board expanded because it is charged with responsibility for the promotion of the sea fishing industry and if it is to do its work satisfactorily it would require to have control of many more aspects of the industry.  While the board has responsibility for operating our marine credit plan and grants for new boats and the building of those boats, it has not responsibility for the training of personnel to man those boats and this is an important part of the work.  When we are building bigger and better boats with better equipment it is vital that these boats be manned by experts properly trained in their use and capable of using them to maximum advantage for their own benefit and that of the industry.  The board should be involved in recruiting and training future fishermen and, having got the people to man the boats, it is necessary for the board to be involved in the development of fish landing places around the coast.</P>
    <P>Reasonable progress has been made in this connection.  We have evidence, I am glad to say, that anywhere money has been invested in this aspect of the industry it has proved to be well worth while and a sound investment but there is often long delay between the time the development is planned and the fishing port is officially opened and put into use.  Frequently, so much time has passed that the work is out of date before the port is fully in operation and the need is already evident for further expansion.</P>
    <P>Because of this experience we should have no hesitation in providing money for fish landing places.  No industry here has developed as quickly as the fishing industry, especially as regards exports.  If one looks at the increases that have taken place one must feel very gratified.  From the export point of view no industry has given the same return as the fishing industry has given and is capable of giving in the future if it gets the necessary capital.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the board more deeply involved in the provision of fish <Col N="1419" /> landing places and more consultation taking place with fishermen.  My experience was that this consultation was somewhat lacking and I believe the board should have more say in this aspect of the industry because if landing places with suitable facilities are not available all the other work is of little value.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the very important matter of processing.  We should process as much fish as possible at home. This would give much-needed employment in areas where it would be very welcome and it would add considerable value to the fish being exported which would be a tremendous benefit to our economy.  Our processing industry has never made the progress it should have made and one of the reasons for this is that we have never been able to keep up a constant supply of fish to the factories.  They always run into difficulties for want of continuity of supply, but with the development of larger boats properly manned we should be able to get over this problem.  These larger, better-equipped vessels could go to sea in the most difficult weather conditions and stay out much longer and bring back much larger catches of fish and this would help to ensure that the processing industry would make the progress we all want to see in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The boat building aspect of Bord Iascaigh Mhara is also very important and I should like the boat building capacity to be increased and the yards extended so that we could meet at home the demand for boats.  We know that many more fishermen would buy their boats if it were possible for them to do so.  There is a waiting list, or they are compelled to go abroad to make their purchases.  We know from experience that this can create difficulties. It would be much better if we could cater for them at home.  It would give much needed employment in areas where it is most needed.</P>
    <P>Therefore I regret the curtailment in the amount of money being spent in this industry, that a board as important as BIM would not be able to continue at the rate of expansion, even the limited rate of expansion, we have had during the years.  I do not <Col N="1420" /> say this for party political reasons but because of my sincere wish that the fishing industry would continue to develop.</P>
    <P>In Waterford we have one of the major fishery harbours, Dunmore East.  There are many other fish landing places along that coast which are in need of development.  We have Cheek Point, Passage, Dunnabrattin, Helvick and Ardmore.  Dunnabrattin is one which could be developed to the advantage of all concerned.  Many new boats have been put into use there in recent times, many of them provided through Bord Iascaigh Mhara loans and grants, and it is sad to say that because of the lack of facilities proper use cannot be made of these boats.  Because of the damage done by storms, particularly during this winter, the people there are unable to continue to use the bigger boats they now have and it is vital that the landing facilities be improved immediately.  If that is not done the fishermen there will find themselves going backwards.</P>
    <P>We need not be afraid to invest money in this aspect of the industry. Anywhere money was invested in this work it proved to be worthwhile expenditure and created a demand for more and more investment in improving landing facilities.  Therefore I submit that money must be made available quickly, whether by way of Supplementary Estimate or otherwise, for this work.  If the confidence of the industry is not to be undermined there must be massive investment as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Resource development and research were mentioned.  This is a very important aspect of BIM.  Perhaps we have had some overlapping in this work and this should be avoided as much as possible.  My point is that more money must be spent on this aspect of the industry because in order to exploit these resources around our shores we must have research and resource development.</P>
    <P>The benefits negotiated for us on EEC entry will be coming up for review and I am sure this will take into account the use we have been making of our fisheries.  I am afraid that if we are not prepared to develop <Col N="1421" /> them ourselves, others will do it for us, to their, not to our, advantage. Therefore we should set out a programme of developing this vital industry as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Before I left the Fisheries Division I set out a programme of future expansion which would entail considerable investment.  Today I regret that we are going into reverse and I do not think any Deputy in the House realises that more than the Parliamentary Secretary.  He should be prepared to take into account the views of Deputies who spoke this morning from his own benches, each one seeking greater investment in the fishing industry, suggesting that development should and must take place.  There was a special plea from the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>I appreciate keenly that if the Parliamentary Secretary found it possible he would expand the fishing industry. Therefore he must use all his influence and power to bring home to the Government the importance of the industry and the need for more investment in it.  I know this is a difficult task for him but I urge him to introduce a Supplementary Estimate if necessary to get the vital funds made available for this great industry which is so vital to the parts of our country where there is no alternative employment, the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>I should like to couple with my comments on the necessary improvement of fish landing places the difficulties in getting fish to market, the transport problems.  A promotional body like BIM should interest themselves more in this side of the industry &mdash; getting the fish to market in good quality and the presentation of it in the market.  The roads from many of our fishing ports are in a deplorable condition, not fit for use by the bigger lorries now necessary for fish transport. This applies to the entire country. Money is needed for the improvement of these roads if our fish catches are to be transported efficiently to markets.</P>
    <P>Today we are agreeing to increase the borrowing powers of BIM.  This will all have been done for nothing if <Col N="1422" /> we continue to neglect some of the areas in this industry.  I make this point with particular regard to landing places and the facilities available there, the need to have sheds and storage places in which fishermen can look after their gear during bad weather conditions.  Bad weather involves loss of fishing time.  It is at times of bad weather that fishermen would need facilities to improve and maintain their gear.  Suitable facilities for this work should be provided at landing places.  Toilet facilities should also be provided.  There should be efficient transport to markets.  Therefore I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, who has a particular interest in fishing and who is aware of the problems, to bring home to the Government the folly of neglecting this important industry.</P>
    <P>It is essential to progress that fishermen should be properly organised. They are not so organised at the present time.  In this respect An Bord Iascaigh Mhara can play a very important part.  They are close to the fishermen and work with them in trying to improve their lot.  We must ensure that fishermen are organised and are given every facility to organise.  There must be constant consultation. I regret the slow progress in the establishment of producer organisations. I do not know the reason for it.  Organisation is vital to the proper operation of the industry within the EEC.  If advantage is to be taken of membership of the EEC, organisation must be achieved quickly.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House what the present position is, what steps he is taking and what progress he has made in this direction.  I do not see that any progress is being made.  I should like every fisherman to be in an organisation because he would then be in a better position to look after his own interests and the interests of the industry.</P>
    <P>There should be proper distribution of fish to inland towns and villages. Those of us who live inland know the problem of getting fresh fish there.  It is desirable to increase home consumption of fish but this cannot be done <Col N="1423" /> without regular supply so that the housewife knows that she can get good quality fish in fresh condition.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to BIM for the wonderful part they have played in publicising the advantages of fish and the proper presentation of fish.  A great deal more could be done in this direction if more money were available to BIM for this purpose. Lack of finance inhibits progress.</P>
    <P>Fisheries protection has been referred to.  This is a matter of vital importance to the industry.  Reference has been made down through the years to the lack of proper protection for the industry.  The money that has been invested in the industry and the money we are voting here today will count for very little if the industry is not protected.  For proper protection there should be a fisheries protection vessel at each major fishing port.  The protection vessels must be available on call when foreign boats are within our limits.  If the boat has to travel a long distance there is the danger that radio messages will be picked up and the foreign boats can be outside our limits by the time the protection vessel arrives at the scene.  Dunmore East is one harbour where a protection vessel should be based during the herring season.  I can see no problem in having this arranged.</P>
    <P>Fishery protection should come under the auspices of a Department of Fisheries and not under the Department of Defence.  At least, a Department of Fisheries should have a say in the operation of the protection vessels.  There is too much fragmentation with regard to this important industry.  I would agree with the suggestion, which I also have made, that there should be a Ministry of Fisheries.  There is great need for development of the industry and it is vital that the various elements of the industry should be brought under one umbrella.  Marine works and problems of pollution could be dealt with by a Ministry of Fisheries.  I do not wish to develop this point now.  I make passing reference to it in the context of the fragmentation that exists in the industry.  The Office of Public <Col N="1424" /> Works are involved in estimating harbour works and in the execution of the work.  Local authorities are involved in the financing and maintenance of the work.  All this leads to delay which can mean that a scheme is out of date by the time it is completed. In Killybegs boats are tied up in the harbour, sometimes five and six deep, with the result that the fishermen have lost their livelihood because of the overcrowding.  If all these matters could be put under one umbrella we would do much better.</P>
    <P>There is much duplication and overlapping of work in the fishing industry. I know the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to do as good a job as possible for the fishing industry, not merely because it is a matter of concern to his constituents.  He is doing everything possible to get the necessary finance but a separate Department is essential.  A Minister has access to the Cabinet table when decisions are being made, but a Parliamentary Secretary has not this access and must depend on his Minister to speak for him.  The fishing industry is too important to the economy to allow this situation to continue.</P>
    <P>It is time to take a hard look at the industry and to see where we are going.  I acknowledge that progress has been made during the years; in the circumstances it could be described as tremendous progress having regard to the finance available to the industry.  I have experience of this matter and I realise we are only scratching the surface of the enormous potential of the fishing industry.  However, we are now going into reverse; we are cutting the finance available and curtailing the activities of the industry.  This measure will do nothing to improve the situation.  There has been a cut of 5 per cent and this must be regretted. At a time of galloping inflation and with increased costs in all directions, it is obvious that this important industry has suffered a great set-back. I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to do all he can to ensure that money is found so that at the very least the rate of progress will be maintained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> Our fishermen have been badly hit by the increased cost of oil.  Other countries have come to the assistance of their fishermen to help them survive the present economic situation but I am afraid the Parliamentary Secretary has done nothing to help the people in the industry here.  I appeal to him to help them in their desperate plight; otherwise it will take them years to recover from the present situation.  We are in the EEC and we have a tremendous market advantage but we must keep up constant supplies to that market and we must develop our processing industries.  Consequently a massive investment in fishing is needed to ensure that there will be a future for the industry.  Instead of that we have cut back at a vital time and the people are losing heart and confidence.  They are crying out for assistance but it is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has been in office for two years and I realise it is not easy for him to accept a curtailment in the activities of the industry for which he is responsible. Therefore I would ask him to listen to us and to Deputies on his side who have applied to him.  I would ask him to do everything possible to ensure that the Government wake up to their responsibility, that they know of the injury they are inflicting on the industry. Although the industry may not have developed to the extent we would have wished, nevertheless there has been quite considerable progress during the years.</P>
    <P>When the review clause provided for in the negotiations and in the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities is being considered it will look very bad if our fishing industry has not made the progress we claimed it would make.  We based our arguments with regard to the retention of our fishing limits on the statement that this was an expanding industry and we had evidence to back up that statement.  When the matter comes up for review, if it is shown we are not making progress, that we are going backwards, that the Government have no confidence in the industry and are not prepared to give it the <Col N="1426" /> necessary finance, I am afraid we will not be able to repeat the same argument and we will not be as successful as we were previously.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we are seen to have made the progress we claimed we would make and that we make available the necessary investment so that the industry will survive.  If we have not the finance, let the Government be honest and say so.  They should seek the necessary funds from the EEC or elsewhere.  What we have got from the Regional Fund will do nothing for us in this matter.  It is only a paltry sum and is less than what we rejected 12 months ago.  It was not enough then and it is not enough now.  We must get money from some source if we are to ensure that this vital industry continues to make reasonable progress.</P>
    <P>I appeal once more to the Parliamentary Secretary to impress on the Government the need to have money made available for this very important industry.  The investment will be a sound one and there will be a good return on it.  We have proved this is so down through the years.  This industry was handed over to the present Government in a flourishing condition. It was perhaps not making progress at the rate at which we would like it to be, but nevertheless it was making progress.  They have the responsibility to ensure that that progress will be continued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill. It is obviously very necessary.  As we can see from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, the loan moneys available have now reached the ceiling of £5 million fixed in 1970.  The figure proposed in this Bill multiplies by three the ceiling of the moneys that can be made available.  This is to make money available so as to extend the statutory limit on borrowings by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very important matter introduced in this Bill.  It is that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are given power to borrow in foreign currencies.  This is very necessary when one bears in mind that boats of only a limited capacity can be built as yet in this country and that there are many boats <Col N="1427" /> on order which are being built in other countries.  It is natural enough that in placing the order for these types of large boats the business is done through foreign finance channels. I am glad to be able to tell the House that the pioneers and the innovators in the purchase of those large vessels are people who come from my constituency and that it is a company in my constituency that has put its feet on this new road.  The purpose of purchasing those vessels is to enable the Irish fishing industry to fish in deep water grounds far further offshore and in far further fishing fields than have hitherto been even thought of by Irish fishermen.  In order to do that the amount of money involved is exceedingly large.  When I mention the figure of half a million pounds per boat I am not overstating what the implications are from the financial point of view.  We have not gone anywhere near that in our boats to date.  This is new ground that is being broken by the Irish fishing industry and I hope it will prove to be successful and fruitful ground.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made a very pertinent point in introducing this Bill when he stressed that the board should concentrate more on promotional and advisory activities. That sounds a very small and simple statement but there is much implied and much contained in it.  What is virtually being said is that the marketing that was previously worked out under the aegis of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is largely being taken over by private enterprise in the fishing industry itself.  That is a sign of maturity and growth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahey spoke about the difficulties in the fish processing industry. He said that past difficulties had been due to lack of continuity in supplies. He said that the way to get over those difficulties was to go further afield for our fish supplies.  That may be correct, but only in a limited sense.  I would not want it to go from this House that that course, as advocated by Deputy Fahey, is necessarily the correct and only course.  There has been considerable research work done, again by <Col N="1428" /> fishing families from my constituency, on the fish processing business.  They have already been in the business in a partial way and indeed have been unable to meet the demand for their product.  This product can be made and will be made in larger quantities in this country because there is a new factory set up in Castlebridge in County Wexford.  This factory will use a process that is in considerable demand and is of a higher standard than is to be found in other European countries.  It may be of interest to know that the demand comes from Norway.  It is great to see that an Irish firm can produce a processed fish material that is better than is produced by the premier fishing nation in Europe.  We should take pride in that fact.  It shows that we can do equally as well and better than other competing countries in Europe who have been in the business much longer than we have been.</P>
    <P>Why is our standard low?  This is where I disagree with Deputy Fahey. The reason is that the fish delivered to the processing plant is fresher and younger because it is kept over a shorter period as between catching and processing than is the case in other countries where the structure is different from ours.  It is well to bear these matters in mind and not to take a blanket view of what policy should be.  This has been proved by people who have been in the fishing industry like their fathers before them and possibly their grandfathers.  These are the people who know what they are talking about.  I must say I admire those people who have spent a considerable length of time in Europe and elsewhere discovering for themselves and studying up-to-date methods.  They have done this at their own personal expense.  It is heartening to find that spirit in the industry, particularly in the processing industry, because it augurs an excellent future.  It means we will have an extra exportable product which will be able to compete with an equivalent product from any other country.</P>
    <P>We should not approach this Bill with an inferiority complex, with the <Col N="1429" />&ldquo;Och, och, ochone&rdquo; that we heard from certain speakers here this morning. I can see no reason for that.  I can see no reason for the loud clamour about a decrease of 5 per cent in the Estimate for the Fisheries Division.  Is it realised that the capital allocation to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has increased by 6 per cent and, on current account, the allocation has increased by 1 per cent?  This Bill multiplies threefold the amount that can be lent to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I am sorry to have to say that a great deal of time was wasted this morning in waffle.  We should get our figures in proper perspective.</P>
    <P>One matter which was not adverted to this morning is the fact that money is available to the industry through FEOGA.  A grant of up to 25 per cent can be made.  In case Members are not aware of it, FEOGA look on the fishing industry with a kindly and co-operative eye.  They realise that it is a growing industry and they are prepared to give all the assistance they can.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to fishery protection. Recently someone advocated the use of smaller boats.  The Minister for Defence was quite correct when he said it was absolutely essential to have all-weather craft on fishery protection. Again, I disagree with Deputy Fahey when he advocates the stationing of a fishery protection vessel in Dunmore during the herring season.  That is a landlubber's view; that is the view of the man on the shore looking out to sea.  A fishery protection vessel must be out at sea, if necessary outside our own territorial limits.</P>
    <P>What would be the use of having a vessel moving out from Dunmore after a message, picked up on the ether, has been sent?  Such a statement shows a complete lack of appreciation of what is involved in fishery protection.  It would be a good thing if more Members would take a trip in a trawler and undergo the trauma of a little bit of sea sickness to discover for themselves exactly what fishermen have to contend with: that would give them a proper appreciation of the requirements of the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of us have, but there are others who have never gone beyond Dún Laoghaire Pier.  I should like to see more money invested in fishery protection.  I know protection is very expensive because special craft are required.  There is a more sinister aspect where fishery protection is concerned.  Up to now our industry has not been able to avail of the full catch within our own territorial waters.  I doubt if poaching has been a very serious matter, but it is becoming more serious because we are now battling at international level for quotas.  Other nations realise that our industry is growing.</P>
      <P>There is a restriction on catches in the North Sea because that area was grossly overfished.  There has been overfishing in other areas as well and greedy eyes are now concentrated on the Celtic Sea.  There is a strong feeling among our fishermen that there is poaching in the Celtic Sea.  The Celtic Sea could yield us a rich harvest.  The area is ours by tradition and by right. Other nations are becoming very interested in it and it is very important that we should preserve our rights.  I know we have not got the resources and I know the difficulty involved, but I would dearly love to have evidence of what the actual catch has been by foreign trawlers operating in the Celtic Sea.</P>
      <P>I and my constituents feel that a great deal more is being taken out of these waters than is admitted by people claiming quotas in the area. One cannot put a figure on it because we have not got the resources necessary for proper protection, but it is a matter of some seriousness.  The excuse is made that conservation requires a curtailment of quotas, but the Celtic Sea is not so important to other countries as it is to this country because it is there that a very large proportion of our herring catches occur.  Admittedly, our take last year was not the best because of the weather and other circumstances.  It could be very large, and very rich, and very rewarding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> As I understand it, the present proposals from NAIF, the organisation which is discussing the matter of quotas, would mean a curtailment of our take amounting to at least £500,000.  That is very serious from the point of view of our fishing industry. Not on purely selfish grounds but with the God-given gift of being near our waters, we should be given a better quota than is being offered, particularly as we are a developing fishery nation.</P>
    <P>Since I was elected to this House I have been an unofficial spokesman for the cot fishing men off the coast of Wexford.  These are part-time fishermen.  For a long time we have pleaded that something should be done in the way of providing lights at landing areas for these small cot men. These are herring drifters.  They go perhaps three or four miles offshore. We all know that herring fishing in that area is at night, as it is in other areas.  Sometimes the weather is not the most clement.  For years we have been looking for proper lights at landing points so that at least these men can find their way home.  To date in many cases it has been by guess or by God that they got home.</P>
    <P>These men are in small open boats, 18-footers to 24-footers, driven at the best by perhaps a nine horsepower outboard engine.  Due to the complex world in which we live, when we look for lights in a situation like that we are passed from the ESB to the county council and from the county council back to the ESB.  Nobody appears to have responsibility.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary most sincerely to get BIM or his branch of the Department to be the co-ordinating head to get something done.  It would not cost much, and one life lost would be a terrible price to pay when it could be avoided very easily and very simply and at a small cost.</P>
    <P>I have heard a recurring complaint in the fishing industry about the delay caused by the slowness in providing spare parts for fishing boat engines. Possibly the difficulty has arisen by <Col N="1432" /> virtue of the multitude and diversity of the models of engines.  I know that when BIM are building a boat for a fisherman they give him fairly good latitude in the choosing of the equipment for his boat, including the engine. Having regard to the amount of time lost, and to the failure to provide a speedy service, this aspect of the type of engine used in our trawlers might be given closer scrutiny.  We could save money and provide a better service.</P>
    <P>There have been undue delays as a result of parts not being available, and service not being available on time.  I am aware that there has been an improvement but, in respect of certain makes of engine there have been deplorable and unnecessary delays resulting in heavy loss of revenue and finance to the fishermen.  One must bear in mind that fishing boats are not cheap.  The repayments are high and, in this day and age, interest is high. Any day off the fishing grounds when they are available and accessible must be avoided at all costs.</P>
    <P>As this debate has ranged fairly widely, I should like to compliment one aspect of the fishing industry, that is, their newspaper <i>The Skipper.</i>  It provides an absolutely first-class service for the fishing industry.  It is very nice to see BIM working so well with that newspaper which is an organ for disseminating information to the fishing industry and keeping them up-to-date with world developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I welcome this Bill.  Having listened to most of the speakers this morning two points emerge from the contributions made.  One is that speakers have complimented BIM on their efforts to improve the fishing industry; the other is that nearly all speakers were crying out for a larger investment in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past number of years, and particularly since BIM were organised under the present manager, we have seen the planned development which has gone on from year to year in the industry.  The work of the board is wide and varied.  I was rather critical of the board in the past but, as a member of the board later, I got an insight into <Col N="1433" /> the working of the board and I can say quite honestly that the efforts made by the people involved are tremendous. They are not fully appreciated by the general public or, very often, by the fishermen.  I am very glad that the Members of this House appreciate the great work being done.</P>
    <P>A new phase has arrived in the boat building industry.  Traditionally many of our fishermen have worked in small boats, in half-deck boats.  In Killybegs or any of the large ports, you will find that many of the men who are now thinking in terms of 80-foot boats started off with small half-deckers.</P>
    <P>They progressed from 50-foot craft to boats of more than 80 foot.  This type of development, while it has not helped to bring us the rapid returns we would like from the fishing industry, has been a good one inasmuch as the owners and skippers of the boats had to come from the bottom.  They succeeded through encouragement from BIM who provide assistance by way of educational facilities and advice.  It is mainly through the efforts of BIM that these fishermen are now in a position to take over the larger craft.</P>
    <P>A close eye on all development in the fishing industry is kept by BIM. When I refer to development I am talking in terms of boats.  Because there are fishermen who are not afraid to invest as much as £200,000 or £250,000 in a boat, a venture which takes a great deal of courage, one realises the great development that has taken place in the fishing industry. BIM know who to invest the money in and they are seldom far wrong.</P>
    <P>As a result of the gradual development over the last nine or ten years we have now reached a new stage in the development of the industry.  Up to now we have had an inshore fleet and we are now contemplating the possibility of having a middle water fleet or a fleet which will be larger in size than those in use at present.  It can be said that we have not been too successful in ventures of this kind in the past.  However, I feel confident that we now have reached the stage that our fishermen are fully qualified and expert to go into this type of <Col N="1434" /> fishing.  The extra finance for this expansion of the industry has been sought but I was disturbed to learn that the money allocated will not be sufficient.  Are we being consistent in cutting back on the amount for fishery development?</P>
    <P>In my view all this focuses attention on something which we have been guilty of here down the years.  We do not seem to realise the potential we have in our fisheries.  I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary for the fact that the Government have decided to cut back on the amount of money to be made available for the fishing industries.  But this action focuses attention on the way we have been treating this industry in the past. Until such time as we have a Minister to deal exclusively with fisheries, a person in the Cabinet who will be directly responsible for this industry, the situation will continue.  Any fairminded person will agree that this industry has not expanded to the extent it have should or would have if we had a Minister for Fisheries. Listening to some comments recently on this aspect of our national activity, one would imagine that we had done nothing at all with regard to the development of the fisheries industry down the years.  I agree that we have not been sufficiently active and that a good deal more could be done but it is only fair to say that we have made progress although this progress may not have been spectacular in this vital industry.</P>
    <P>It is seldom realised that there is a great deal more involved in the fishing industry than the catching of fish.  The ratio of employment is something like six to one; for every fisherman six other people benefit directly by way of employment.  This shows how important it is to improve and expand the industry.  We owe a great deal of thanks to BIM for the work they have been doing on a very limited budget.  This work covers a variety of aspects of the industry.  Taking into consideration what is done by other semi-State bodies and the facilities made available to them, I do not believe that we fully recognise the great work done by BIM.</P>
    <P>Mention was made during the <Col N="1435" /> course of this debate of the fishery protection service.  I had occasion recently to ask the Minister for Defence a question on this service.  At present we have four vessels carrying out this work.  It is completely unsatisfactory to have such a number of vessels involved in fishery protection and, with the possibility of our fishery limit being extended, it is necessary to have some new thinking on this matter.</P>
    <P>On that occasion the Minister mentioned it was necessary to have &ldquo;all weather&rdquo; craft suitable for that type of work.  We might take a look at what happens in other countries, such as Canada, for instance, where a coastguard service is provided, where boats are located at many points along the coast and where the cost of maintaining them is not nearly as high as we pay for the boats we provide for this service.  If boats were located at many more points it would mean that foreigners would be more careful about poaching our valuable stocks. There is another point to be made about the manner in which foreigners are apprehended.  It is this, that when one of our boats intercepts a foreign trawler the procedure followed is that a boarding party take in the foreign vessel; it is conducted in by our boat. I believe that that is the time when the other foreign trawlers really go to work because they know that our patrol boat is in harbour and they have a clear field.  I know it is a situation not easily remedied but I believe we could provide a more efficient service, at a lesser cost, were we to approach it in the way I have suggested.</P>
    <P>One encouraging feature of the fishing industry at present is that fishermen approach it as a business. Bord Iascaigh Mhara deserve a great deal of credit in this respect.  All skippers and boat-owners now approach the business in a completely different light from that which we knew traditionally.  They know they have to make provision for maintenance of their engines, for the purchase of new gear, and so on, and their whole approach is different.</P>
    <P>Marketing is another area where tremendous advances have taken place. <Col N="1436" /> Again, this is due to the service provided by the Board for the fishermen. I know there are areas where the situation could be improved.  The ideal situation would be to provide markets at the landing points so that the fish could be marketed when landed.  Unfortunately that is not the position and fishermen continue the practice of sending their fish to the Dublin market where it is auctioned.  I know also that in many areas they have no choice but to follow that practice, which is not a satisfactory one.  The Parliamentary Secretary might examine the manner in which the market operates at present, where there are several auctioneers.  They are both buyers and auctioneers and this is something in need of revision.  I think there was a recommendation a number of years ago that a State auctioneer would go to the Dublin market and that there would be one auctioneer only to conduct sales of fish.  It is true to say that an auctioneer, or a fish buyer, actually sells the fish to himself and charges the fishermen 7½ per cent for buying that fish from them.  That is the way in which things operate at present and it is not at all satisfactory.</P>
    <P>There is the question also of carriage on the fish and, very often, the question of pilfering, which means that fishermen who live a long distance from the larger centres of population experience great difficulties in that respect.  Again, I know that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have made efforts to assist the fishermen by providing grants for cold storage and processing and, through their marketing service, have assisted in the provision of outlets for the fishermen in the smaller towns adjacent to ports.  But that operation has not advanced as much as I would like to see it advance.  That brings us to the question of continuity of supply. Fishermen, especially those along the west coast&mdash;where there are long periods of broken weather&mdash;even with the facility of cold storage and access to centres where their fish can be sold are afraid that they will not be able to maintain a continuous supply for merchants.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Fahey who mentioned that fishermen were not <Col N="1437" /> organised and that this was a hindrance to them.  I would not agree entirely with Deputy Fahey in this respect.  In recent years fishermen have tried very hard to organise themselves.  There are now very successful co-operatives in many ports; for instance, there are successful ones at Killybegs, Kilmore Quay and right along the coast.  There was formed also a federation of co-operatives which drew up a policy in relation to the fishing industry&mdash;a worthwhile effort&mdash;but which did not yield the desired results.  I make that point because it is fair to say that efforts have been made to have fishermen organised.  At present there is the Irish Fishermen's Association&mdash;I think it is called&mdash;an organisation which covers all the ports.  When the co-operatives were formed the position was that there were a number of existing organisations and there did not seem to be any proper tie-up between the co-operatives and the existing organisations.</P>
    <P>That situation has improved.  There is one organisation, with a full-time secretary, representing the fishermen. This should make for a vast improvement and should also ensure our being in a position to avail in the best way possible of any benefits accruing from the EEC fund.  From a reply given to a parliamentary question, I am aware of the Parliamentary Secretary's anxiety that this organisation get off the ground as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of fisheries and their development have taken on an entirely new dimension in recent times.  In the past when we talked of fisheries we thought in terms simply of the men going out in boats, catching the fish and bringing them in but now a very wide field has been opened up as a result of the research that has been carried out into fish farming and other aspects of the industry.  However, much financial input is required if we are to exploit the potential of the industry to the full.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, too, that we concentrate on the education aspect of the industry.  I know there are many people who would be prepared to engage in such work as research if only the finance required was available <Col N="1438" /> to them.  In this connection I might mention a very worthwhile project undertaken last year in Killary Harbour by a group from UCG.  Unfortunately, very little finance is available to people like those who are prepared to devote their time and energy to projects of this kind.  They deserve every help that we can give them.  In regard to the work undertaken by the UCG group there was a grant from the board and also from Galway and Mayo County Councils and from the regional development groups in the two counties as well as from the university, each contributing a few hundred pounds.  Money invested in work of this kind can only be beneficial to the industry and, consequently, to the nation as a whole, in the long term.</P>
    <P>Greater development of fishing not only in the west but in many other parts of the country would lead to the availability of much more employment for local people.  We always seem to have money available for a foreigner who wishes to set up an industry here. Unfortunately, however, some of these people, having collected their State grants, disappear overnight, so to speak.  We should concentrate more on the development of our own resources.</P>
    <P>To return for a moment to the question of education, there are many people going to our universities who will never have the opportunity of working at home for the simple reason that there are too many graduating in medicine, engineering and the arts, for instance.  This is happening while there continues to be a total lack of knowledge of marine works and other aspects of our economy.  If there were scholarships whereby people would be sent to Norway or Denmark or some other continental countries where there has been more rapid development than has been the case here, the students who would visit these countries would be a tremendous asset on their return because they would be in a position to help in the development of co-operatives and also in the development of the wonderful resources that are ours.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why <Col N="1439" /> there should be a cut back in spending on fisheries.  I sympathise with the Parliamentary Secretary in finding himself in this position but I hope that these cut backs will not result in work being held up in our boat yards.  The yards at Killybegs, Baltimore and Dingle have managed to expand in accordance with the demand for boats. Up to recently 60 per cent of our boats were being built in those yards but now they are geared to building the bigger vessels and are even talking in terms of building steel boats.  Our boat builders deserve every credit for the type of vessel that they have been providing.  These boats compare favourably with any that have been imported from continental countries.  Indeed, I have heard from fishermen that our boats are better than any built outside the country.  One must not mention boat yards without referring to the contribution made in this sphere by the private builders.  There are some areas of the country in which there is a tradition of boat building.  It would be a tragedy if the progress in this field were to be halted now because of a lack of funds.  If this occurs during the year I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will ask the House to provide the necessary money in order to keep things moving, and he will have the full co-operation of this side of the House in doing that.  The projections are there for a great future in the industry.  Everybody who has spoken this morning recognises this, and I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are so foolish as to allow this progress to be halted.</P>
    <P>We are catching up on the other countries in our development.  We had a late start.  We did not have the resources that were available to many other European countries, and comparisons in this respect are often not fair.  Having regard to our limited resources, progress has been steady although not spectacular.  I wish the Parliamentary Secretary every success, and hope that, as a person who lives along the coast and understands the position of fishermen better than most <Col N="1440" /> people here, he will do his utmost to continue the good work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome this Bill, I am not satisfied at all with the progress being made by the Fisheries Division and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the promoting of the fishing industry.  Not enough money is being injected into this industry having regard to the vast potential which there is in the Celtic Sea and, indeed, within a few miles of our shores.</P>
      <P>The numbers engaged in fishing here is remarkably small in comparison with the numbers engaged in it in other countries.  More money should be invested in training young men in fishing so that they would be able to man the bigger boats.  We are badly hampered along the whole coastline due to lack of proper landing and storage facilities and the atrocious condition of our piers and small harbours.  The amount of money spent on the repair and improvement of these small piers along the west and south west must be terribly low.  The time has come for the Fisheries Division of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to set up some organisation or agency to co-ordinate and organise such repairs and improvements.</P>
      <P>A Deputy finds it very difficult at times to know where to start when making representations about these harbours and piers.  We are referred from the Fisheries Division to the Office of Public Works and from there to the county council, and it appears to the local fishermen that all these stages are nothing more than a stalling measure.  This organisation should be responsible for the repair and improvement of these small piers and harbours from the very moment the application is made until such time as the work is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the height of the mackerel season last September and October I visited a number of these small piers throughout south Kerry and in parts of west Cork.  There was one pier in particular.  Garnish, out of which 18 small boats fished.  It was a terrible sight to see these boats lining up and waiting for their turn to load their <Col N="1441" /> very heavy landings onto lorries.  The lorry driver had to reverse his truck down the pier with half the wheels on either side hanging out over the verge of the pier.  This was a very dangerous operation.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary knows this pier very well.  I saw many similar situations at other places but not quite as bad as this one during that period, September and October.</P>
    <P>Something must be done about these piers before they are completely washed away.  As a result of heavy storms and rough weather conditions over the past few years these piers and harbours are deteriorating. This will continue from day to day and year to year until there is a terrible tragedy, and then we shall all realise that something should have been done years ago to remedy this terrible situation.  If we want to maintain and increase our population in the fishing villages and in the districts along the western seaboard and particularly in the south west, we must look after the fishermen who go out in small boats.  Many of the fishermen operate with four or six in a small boat, an 18-footer or a 24-footer with an eight- or nine-horse power outboard engine.  There is a great fishing tradition in all those areas, and the younger people there today prefer to stay at home and work at fishing than to emigrate. Therefore, more money should be spent in providing greater grants for the smaller boats.</P>
    <P>I would also urge strongly that public lighting should be made available, particularly in the more important of these small piers and harbours.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary realises how dangerous it is at night and in bad weather when some of these fishermen come in in these light boats trying to make their way towards the pier and going only on experience.  I am surprised we have not had even more tragedies in these areas.  Money spent on lighting these piers and harbours would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to see that the Estimate for Fisheries for the coming year was cut.  Out of the money to be made available a great deal of it <Col N="1442" /> should be spent on these piers and harbours, especially on lighting.  We must remember that the bigger the boat the greater the catch. The vast majority of our fishermen fish nearer home than those who man the bigger vessels costing from £250,000 to £500,000.  We should balance the value of our exports of fish against the employment content of the fishermen working on small boats off the west and south-west coasts in particular. We must make sure that there will be a more equitable distribution of the wealth of the fishing industry. In my view the Estimate should have been increased if we are to improve the industry and increase our exports. I cannot see how this can be achieved by cutting the expenditure to be voted for fisheries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt once again to throw some light on the entire fishing position and the approach to it so far as our thinking is concerned. Down the years I have consistently tried to get the message across about the massive wealth which abounds off our coast.  There has been terrific excitement about the wealth&mdash;oil deposits&mdash;supposed to exist off the Head of Kinsale.  These deposits are small compared to the other wealth which can be brought ashore and harvested very easily. With an energetic approach and realistic thinking, which do not appear to have existed through the years in all the Governments we had, an industry could be built up mainly along the west coast which would mean £100 million a year to the people living along that seaboard.  It would give employment to 5,500 extra personnel on major trawlers which would fish off the banks of the west coast. It would give employment to a further 20,000 to 25,000 people ashore plus up to 10,000 more in connected industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach to the Estimate&mdash;a reduction of 5 per cent&mdash;reflects the limited thinking which exists at all levels here.  I am not blaming only the present Government.  I am blaming everybody concerned.  This industry, which could be great, has been <Col N="1443" /> latched on to the tailend of agriculture. The fact that the sum provided will be cut by 5 per cent shows how little importance is attached to this industry by the people concerned.</P>
    <P>About a fortnight ago I attended a meeting of the CDC in Athlone.  I lashed out at their approach to the fishing position.  Some officials from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries let us know that FEOGA grants were being channelled into providing grain silos and other forms of farmyard development in agriculture, all of the larger type.  We are getting money from FEOGA because of the depressed conditions which exist on our western coast and this money is being channelled into more active sections inland.  Why were there not some officials from the Fisheries Division present at that meeting in Athlone? If they were there, they did not speak on behalf of fisheries.</P>
    <P>We have a great natural asset which could yield anything up to £4 million a year.  Eight or nine years ago, when I was in Europe, I got production and export sales figures of all the different fishing countries.  At that time, Norway's figure was £100 million and our puny effort was £2 million.  We are now claiming credit for about £15 million in exports, a great deal of which is as a result of our inland fisheries, salmon fisheries, fish farming, shell fish and so forth.  If at this stage we can produce only £15 million, surely it is time to have a look at the situation again?</P>
    <P>Let us make a general statement. We are or we are not a fishing nation. We are not a fishing nation because fishing was never encouraged here. The limited number of fishermen in the different areas are fully engaged with the type of craft they operate in our inshore fisheries.  We must think big.</P>
    <P>There is no thinking behind the policy of BIM.  They did not do a very good job in the past.  I was amazed to hear today they still operate under the same system.  We hear of delays in getting parts for boat engines and for the different things that are needed to operate fishing boats.  In this day of costly <Col N="1444" /> trawlers and the high cost of everything in relation to fishing, fishermen are losing money every day they are tied up in ports.  When I first came into this House I studied the position in Dingle and found that in a fleet of 17 boats there were at least four different types of engines.  Very often boats were tied up at the pier waiting up to three months for the replacement of a part so small that you could put it in your pocket.  Sometimes BIM got a replacement engine and sent it down to the fisherman but there was no system of organised repair locally.  There was no attempt made to have the parts available to serve this industry, which could have been built up to a position far ahead of what it is today.</P>
    <P>There should be one type of engine for a fleet of boats fishing from a particular harbour and there should be a complete set of parts in store and a repair service available.  There should be a re-conditioned engine for any engine that fails.  Many fishermen in the Dingle area gave up fishing when they became so frustrated at not being able to get replacement parts. They left the area and got jobs in other parts of the country or emigrated. They were forced to sell their boats or had them seized when they could not pay their debts.  The Government should consider setting up a body something like the IDA, which could be called the Fishery Development Association, with power to develop the great asset we have around our coastline.  This would give employment far beyond our dreams to fishermen around the coast.  Such a fishery board could revitalise this industry, now that we are getting money from the EEC development fund.</P>
    <P>We need the development of more harbours along the west coast. Valentia is a natural harbour and should be developed.  With Portmagee adjacent to it, this could be a very active centre for the development of deep sea fishing in the Kerry area.  We could have an industry there worth £20 million.  We have people there looking for work.  We should make every effort to keep them in their own area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> Much has been said about the protection of our fisheries.  The greatest protection we can have is to reach the stage where we have 500 heavy trawlers operating from Bantry Bay to the coast of Donegal.  That would keep foreign trawlers out because they will not come if there is competition. I was attached to the fishery committee in Europe for a few years and at that time there was a noticeable drop in the foreign trawlers fishing off our coasts because they could not get the quantity of fish they got in former years.  I was informed last week that anything up to 100 British trawlers were seen off the Donegal coast getting high catches of fish on their way to the Greenland coast.  We have the greatest fishing grounds in the world.  We have the weather to fish all year round, which most European countries have not, and we have sufficient manpower, once they are trained, to go to sea.  It will not be easy for these men to obtain work in Britain in the future, so we should make every effort to provide work for them at home.</P>
    <P>Europe is wide open because of the high cost of meat, for products we could develop here from our fishing industry.  We can land first class fish, process it and find a ready market in Europe.  The new board, which I suggest should be set up, should have processing and fishmeal plants established. Their first duty would be to obtain markets for our fish.</P>
    <P>We must first erect piers at many of the harbours around the coast.  It is necessary to allow the existing places, like Dingle, to operate as they have been doing.  It would not be easy to get them to change to modern methods as they are making sufficient as they are and are not interested in any major type of development.  We are supposed to have a major harbour in Castletownbere which, according to official thinking, should serve Kerry.</P>
    <P>The worst part of the Atlantic coast, apart from the Bay of Biscay, is the point off Dursey Island and to ask Kerry trawlers which have to operate off the Blaskets and further north to find their way around that <Col N="1446" /> dangerous coast to get to Castletownbere is out of the question.  This is one reason why I make the point that a major development harbour is necessary on the Kerry coast.  I think Valentia harbour is ideally suited for this.  It has a very long reach of water extending far beyond the pier, beyond Knightstown.  We have the pier at Portmagee within the harbour and the pier in Valentia itself and with little development these can be adjuncts to a massive central pier which should exist at Renard Point, to be extended further and enlarged so as to take the many boats that could come in with their catches there.</P>
    <P>I do not see great difficulty in finding money for trawlers or to equip ourselves with trawlers.  I know that many family-owned trawlers in Europe would be very anxious to get over here provided we had crews to man them.  We would have the expertise of the skipper with a total of 11 personnel so that if we could provide 12 trained personnel here to operate that trawler we would have the intake of fish plus the expertise of the trawler owner concerned.  Many of them have told me they would be very glad to find their permanent boat here and to take out naturalisation papers so as to avail of the work that can be provided here.  This would suffice for opening up the position and as our young people acquired expertise and as we could provide the money they could in time become owners of further trawlers by purchasing them, thus expanding the fleet to land the type of wealth I have in mind.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will carry this message to the Government. There is a ripe harvest ready to be gathered.  Much courage will be needed to launch the project and put it before the nation but nobody ever succeeded by being squeamish.  One must go in bull-headed; it is the only way to achieve success.  I cannot see any possibility of failure here.  We have the energy, the ability and the driving power to do this given the courage to go ahead and get it under way.</P>
    <P>I should also like to comment on <Col N="1447" /> the position in Caherciveen.  About five years ago we were listed for a development grant for that pier to help moor the smaller boats that come up there and land what fish they have. Certain plans had to be prepared but even after all this time work has not even started.  If this is the type of thinking in the two departments concerned, one of which does not move, one is entitled to say derisively they probably do not get up until after lunch.  That is the type of thinking that one feels affects such projects&mdash; after five years we have not even made a start on this pier which is so essential to all the fishermen operating into it.  Surely, in 1975 something can be done to get an immediate start and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine the situation at this stage to see if something can be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>When I was in Europe I had to attend a fishery committee meeting in Ankara in Turkey and I was invited to stay over for three days by the Turkish Government and the experts concerned.  They showed me massive plans they had on their drawing boards to have huge ocean-going trawlers fishing the Atlantic coast mainly off our own coast and in the North Sea.  They asked what I thought about it.  I said that because of the distance involved I thought every type of difficulty would develop and I gave them the figures I had got out of Europe about the position of the trawling fleet there and their approaches to the North Sea and around our coast.  I mention this to make the point that if a nation like Turkey, no more wealthy than ourselves&mdash;if they have as much&mdash;are prepared to sink colossal sums of money into trying to fish off our coast, it is a sorry state of affairs if we cannot see the wealth they believe they saw there and if we cannot devise ways and means of reaping that wealth in our own backyard, so to speak, which the Turks are prepared to travel hundreds of miles to reach.</P>
    <P>Facing 1975 I should like to see some national thinking directed towards the development of this <Col N="1448" /> source of wealth and the landing of that wealth for the benefit of our country as a whole and towards giving the maximum injection of money because by and large this would be all for export and would give us great earning power abroad while providing massive employment at home in areas where there is no employment and which always are and have been a worry to the different Governments through the years.  In the past we had to build up our inland industries to try to produce wealth and give employment needed within our shores but now that we have advanced reasonably well, it is time to look at the wealth in our own back yard and to try to develop it.  There is terrific excitement throughout the nation about the oil and gas finds around the coast but in our fisheries we have a never-ending source of wealth if we can only get men of vision and of standing to develop them.</P>
    <P>The only way I can see it being done is through the establishment of a board&mdash;call it the Fishery Development Authority.  Give them the same money and other backing that the IDA have got, let them set up harbours here and there throughout the country, let them have the necessary trained personnel to man our fishery vessels and to staff fish processing plants and let them establish a first-class sales organisation.  In this way we shall be taking a step towards proving to the world that we are an island nation capable of reaping the benefits of the resources that Almighty God provided for us around our shores.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy) Michael Pat Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to voice my appreciation of the constructive nature of the discussion on the Bill. Many useful suggestions were made by Deputies and I have no doubt they will be helpful to the Department in formulating new policies or revising existing ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill was generally welcomed and I could glean from the debate that one of the main reasons for it was the faith and the confidence Members of <Col N="1449" /> the House have in BIM.  That was expressed in no uncertain terms today. There was also commendation of the personnel of the Fisheries Division and I agree wholeheartedly with that: during my close association with the Division as Parliamentary Secretary I have found the personnel always ready, always at the disposal of our fishermen and all those associated with the industry with a view to its advancement.</P>
    <P>A question arose about the functions of BIM.  They are clearly set down in the regulations governing the board's establishment.  I always like to see Deputies displaying inquiring minds in so far as the board's activities are concerned.  It is desirable that elected representatives should have as much information as it is possible to get from such a board, and BIM are favourably disposed towards making available to Deputies all the information they have.</P>
    <P>What I want to see firmly established in the not too distant future is a united front between our fishermen, our fish processors and others associated with the industry, BIM and the Department.  I do not see any great dividing line between BIM and the Department.  Their work is of a similar nature, if you cut away the jargon utilised in statutes and so on. Their work is the development of our fisheries, and whether it is the personnel of the Department or the officers of BIM, their aim is the same.</P>
    <P>I said here on previous occasions that what I hope to see emerge in the not too distant future is a comprehensive up-to-date report on our fisheries generally, not that we have had many reports already, not that there is a great deal of filed information in the Department.  I should like to see a situation evolving through which the representatives of the fishermen, the Department and BIM would sit down at regular intervals, say quarterly, to discuss problems common to the industry&mdash;all the difficulties, all the credits and debits &mdash;and try to formulate policies generally helpful to the industry.  In the light of our EEC membership and of the changes that take place rapidly <Col N="1450" /> from time to time, we must always be ready to adapt and to revise systems which may not be measuring up to present-day requirements in the industry. Therefore, it would be helpful to have such a co-ordinating body. Frequently I use the term &ldquo;involve&rdquo;. I am a great believer in the involvement of all the people concerned in an industry.</P>
    <P>To comment on Deputies' contributions, I do not think it is necessary to go along with the suggestion made by the last speaker to the effect that a new board should be set up to do what I have mentioned, to assemble all the information available from all possible sources and to make a comprehensive report.  I particularly do not wish to see further boards being set up.  The work can be usefully continued by BIM.  I agree that it is necessary to revise and update information but it can be done by the existing board, the Department and the fishermen.</P>
    <P>One of the main points that arose in the debate and that was adverted to by a number of Deputies was that there was not sufficient money available for fisheries.  I thoroughly agree.  I do not think that there is sufficient money available for fisheries.  We are an island country.  I said in Opposition and I say now from the Government benches that our fisheries need further development and further injections of public money than they are getting. That is self-evident.  I can assure the House that whether the funds are available from the Irish Exchequer or from the EEC or from any other source it will be the objective of the Government to make as much money as possible available for the further development of fisheries.</P>
    <P>The report contained in my introductory statement indicated a reasonably bright picture so far as our fishing fleet is concerned.  The report indicated that the fleet contained a total of 1,126 motor vessels of which 138 were larger boats.  I am very pleased that the number of larger boats is on an upward trend and I hope that position will continue.</P>
    <P>Everybody here recognises the adductor <Col N="1451" /> vantage in having our own boat yards. I make no distinction between privately owned boat yards and BIM boat yards. Because of the association of BIM with the Department and its dependence on public funds we must address ourselves to the question of BIM boat yards in the first instance.  I have no doubt that the BIM yards will continue to expand and that the employment in them will continue.  I have no doubt that BIM will have sufficient orders for their yards.  It is pleasing to note that the work produced in the yards is of excellent quality.  Every person who got a boat provided by the yards is satisfied that the boat is a good one and as good as, if not better, than what can be obtained elsewhere.  The same satisfactory account can be heard from those who acquired boats from private yards here.  It is a pleasing feature that the various yards are capable of turning out an excellent product.  The bigger boats now cost almost £200,000.  In view of the high cost, persons will place orders only with those yards from whom they can be reasonably sure of getting value for money.</P>
    <P>Down through the years the State, having regard to the value of a boat, the importance of a boat to an approved applicant, did not place any barrier in respect of where the applicant would purchase the boat.  If the applicant thought he could get a better boat outside the country he was free to do so.  Fortunately, the number who availed of that accommodation is very small.  Possibly the reason why even a small number did so was that the Irish yards were unable to supply them within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>I am mindful of the role played by boat building yards in the development of fisheries.  I am mindful of the employment they provide.  I appreciate the skills of the craftsmen working in the yards.  I think I could with safety dispel any doubts expressed by Deputies on the future of the yards.</P>
    <P>Valuable suggestions were made during the debate by a number of Deputies.  I cannot adopt the suggestion made by Deputy Kenneally regarding a Ministry of Fisheries.  That is a constitutional matter and is outside <Col N="1452" /> the range of discussion on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the employment content in fisheries.  It starts with the boat builder and then takes in the man who takes the boat out to sea, who does the fishing, then it takes in the man who may buy the fish at the pier and who sells it around the country or who may process the fish.  Deputies stressed the desirability of processing the fish caught by our fishermen because of the additional employment involved.  I thoroughly agree with that point of view.  Naturally, we try to supply our own people first and then we like to have some fish for the export market but we would like to have that fish processed here.  Processing plants are not established by the Department. A fish processor has the same right as any other industrialist has to apply to the Department of Industry and Commerce or to the IDA for a grant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher referred to the group who operate fish auctions and he spoke about abuses.  I have been at the auctions but I would inform the Deputy that we must have further information regarding the alleged abuses.  I believe that every man who handles fish should get a fair slice but I do not think that some people, such as those mentioned by Deputy Gallagher, should get two slices.  If the system operates whereby a man actually sells fish to himself and then collects auctioneer's fees on the sale, it is obvious the system needs reviewing. It is not fair to the man who catches the fish and who transports it to Dublin.  However, without further inquiries and evidence being available, I do not want to reflect on any section.  Every man is entitled to his fair share but I am afraid there are a few people in this industry who are getting more than they are entitled to.  It will be necessary to carry out further inquiries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahey mentioned the responsibility of BIM for training and he said that organisation should have wider responsibility.  I answered that point before the Deputy came into the House when I said I did not see any great dividing line between the <Col N="1453" /> activities of the Department and BIM. All of them are there to cope with all aspects of the industry whether it is harbour works, the training of fishermen, the provision of boats or the administration of the marine industrial plan.  The Deputy mentioned that BIM have no responsibility for harbour works.  It is only fair to say they are consulted on the development and improvement of harbours.  I would emphasise that we must operate as a united team.</P>
    <P>The training scheme for young fishermen was commented on quite favourably by many Deputies.  Deputy Gallagher emphasised the desirability of education.  He said we are moving into a modern age and that it was highly desirable that people who are in control of equipment costing approximately £200,000 should be properly trained to manage it to their best advantage and that of the country generally.  That is desirable and it is being implemented.  There is the new school at Greencastle, County Donegal, where a number of boys are accommodated each year and where they have comprehensive courses. Subsequently if the examiner considers they are entitled to certification they get it, but if they do not reach a standard of efficiency that warrants certification they are deemed to fail.</P>
    <P>I support the ideas of Deputy Gallagher and other speakers on this subject.  To date there have not been any young women applicants for boats but the young men who wish to be considered for grants or boats by BIM or other State agencies must realise that unless they take steps to attend the courses available their chances of being allocated either grants or boats are minimal.  We must be mindful of our resources and if there is an adequate number of trained people who are fully competent naturally they must get priority.</P>
    <P>The question of fishermen's organisations was mentioned by a number of Deputies.  We know there are a number of such organisations but the statements emanating from the Department referred mainly to the producer organisation that would fit in <Col N="1454" /> with EEC requirements.  That was our main worry but, according to the information available to me, through the efforts of the IAOS and BIM working in partnership a producer organisation is expected to be formed early next year.  Both of the organisations mentioned have been working in partnership to bring about this result and I am sure that the new organisation will measure up to what is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the critical situation in the footwear industry in this country, he will take steps to prevent the importation of footwear from outside the EEC and curtail imports from EEC countries to an amount equal to the exports from Ireland in the preceding year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated in reply to previous questions, our freedom of action in regard to measures to protect domestic industry is limited by <Col N="1455" /> the obligations arising from the international agreements to which we are parties and in particular our membership of the EEC.  The possibility of action being taken by or through the Community to ease the situation of sectors of industry, including footwear, seriously affected by the present economic situation was taken up with the EEC Commission, and as already announced, following the approaches which I made the Commission has set up a task force which has been in Ireland to examine the problems of certain sensitive industries including footwear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state when the Commission's task force will issue its findings and come to a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a firm date but it has been made absolutely clear to the task force that we look on this as a matter of great urgency and we expect a response before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, since the debate began on the Private Members' motion last week, 60 more workers in the footwear industry have become redundant and would he not agree that it is imperative that a decision be reached as quickly as possible so as to safeguard employment in the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the Deputy on the last point.  I have made this clear to the task force and indeed in Brussels to the relevant Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the present situation would the Minister not consider getting the employers, the employees and the big traders together for a meeting to see whether anything can be done to persuade the big traders here to buy shoes from the Irish companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had one meeting with representatives of all sides in the footwear industry.  I have had a meeting this morning not specifically with footwear or clothing or textiles or furniture, not specifically with the <Col N="1456" /> acutely embarrassed sectors of our economy, but on the general matter of directing the purchasers towards Irish manufactures.  I hope to have further initiatives in this area in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any plans to deal with the very serious situation in the footwear industry should the task force decision be negative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says &ldquo;plans&rdquo;.  I cannot say there are firm plans because this is a matter on which we have both made comments in this House in another context.  In the event of failure to satisfy us by Community action the other possible actions open to us are at variance with our commitments under the Act of Accession.  While the possibilities have been looked at carefully it would be wrong for me to say that there were plans because the repercussions of such action over the whole economy are very serious indeed.  It would certainly be my wish, the Government's wish and I hope it would be the wish of every Deputy, that the legal channels of Community action should be exhausted before we would proceed to any plans or to any actions of a kind that were in conflict with our commitments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>One final supplementary. Would the Minister agree that the industry, which is employing approximately 5,000 workers, is at present in a critical condition and that it is lax on his part not to be preparing some kind of contingency plan <Col N="1457" /> in case it should happen that the decision of the task force is negative?</P>

      <P>One final supplementary. When does the Minister expect to have the decision of the task force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to Deputy Faulkner's first supplementary.  That was what he asked me and I answered it as well as I could.  I said I had urged the need for great speed and I am hopeful of some decision before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has referred any aspect of the importation of footwear to An Coimisiún Dumpála; and, if so, with what result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not referred any aspect of the importation of footwear to An Coimisiún Dumpála.  The normal procedure is for the manufacturer or the trade association concerned to make the request.  No recent approach of this kind has been made to the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In present circumstances would the Minister not consider that he should investigate this matter further?  It is quite obvious that there is a very serious situation involved and that this should be <Col N="1458" /> investigated to ascertain whether dumping is taking place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be under a misapprehension.  The Commission need serious data on dumping, as it is defined in the relevant legislation, for them to act.  I made the point that no recent approach has been made by the manufacturer or trade association.  The whole problem here is that, for example, many of the Korean imports that are a source of embarrassment are not dumping as it is defined by any normal process of definition.  The Deputy said he was dissatisfied with the definition of dumping and with the protections offered both at Community level and by Irish legislation.  He has a point but I do not see the value of referring something without evidence to the Commission. If there is evidence coming forward either from individual manufacturers or from a trade association, from Deputies or indeed from any other source I will certainly act on it promptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>If certain evidence is available to An Bord Dumpála which would make them strongly suspicious of certain importations have the board power to restrict or stop those imports while an investigation is being carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers of An Bord Dumpála are subject to our Treaty obligations.  The Act of 1968 provides:</P>
      <P>The Commission shall have regard to any international agreements or conventions to which the State is a party.</P>
      <P>The situation there is that we must invoke the Community mechanisms before acting in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Are not imports from places like Hong Kong governed by quotas laid down by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the position is that imports from third countries into all Community countries are controlled at Commission level. The relevant person is the Commissioner, Sir Christopher Soames, who is the Commissioner for trade with non-Community <Col N="1459" /> areas and we do not have individual unilateral powers.  People believe that, while we cannot control imports from other Community countries, we can do so with third countries.  That is not the case.  Imports from third countries are under the control of the central institution of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he has requested the Revenue Commissioners to keep in close and constant touch with An Bord Dumpála should there be any suspicion of dumping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Not specifically with An Coimisiún Dumpála, but we have asked the Revenue Commissioners to exert the maximum possible degree of examination, surveillance and scrutiny of documents of origin, and so on, and in every way to ensure that nothing happens which is not obligatory under our existing legal commitments.  They have that request to be in constant communication with my Department.</P>

      <P>In view of the serious unemployment situation among textile workers at the moment would the Minister not agree that his most important function is to preserve and protect these jobs?  Surely some means must be at his disposal to prevent what we all know is dumping of textiles from third countries.  Surely that is the first function of the Minister for Industry <Col N="1460" /> and Commerce of the day.  Does the Minister not agree?</P>

      <P>As I explained in answer to a similar question by the Deputy last year, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are keeping in touch with experiments in this field that are being carried out in certain countries which are better equipped to conduct the necessary research than we are.  Difficulties are being encountered in finding kinds of container which are resistant to <Col N="1464" /> children without also presenting difficulties to invalids and old people but, as I said in reply to the earlier question, if the tests being carried out elsewhere eventually produce worthwhile results I shall consider embodying these in compulsory standards.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Treaty of Rome exports to other EEC countries may not be restricted.</P>
      <P>The imposition of restrictions on exports to third countries is governed by Community regulations on protective measures to be employed to prevent critical situations from arising on account of the shortage of essential products or to remedy such situations.

      <P>The Minister has indicated that a Buy Irish campaign has been an on-going thing as far as the <Col N="1473" /> Government are concerned but I should like to know why he had to wait until the housewives, the trade unions, and the manufacturers drew his attention to it and until the unemployed list had increased enormously before he added the weight of his ministry to this overall appeal. Why did the Minister wait until such time as most of the distributive trade have done their purchasing for Christmas?  The Minister should have moved sooner and more actively in this regard.</P>

      <P>The examiner of restrictive practices has carried out an investigation into the operation of Articles 2 and 3 of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1973, as amended, and has recommended to the Restrictive Practices Commission that they carry out a special review of the operation of these articles.  The commission has decided to carry out the special review and if, after publication of their intention to do so, there is a demand for a public inquiry, would be prepared to carry out the special review by means of a public inquiry.</P>
      <P>The order as amended is in operation. The examiner has made it clear that the onus is on each supplier to comply with the Orders and, in particular, to prepare a written statement of terms and conditions which in the opinion of the supplier comply with the orders and to furnish a copy to him.</P>

In my brief I have no information of the sort of inquiry the Deputy mentioned.  Therefore, since there is literally nothing before me, there is nothing I can usefully say now.  I would be perfectly happy to co-operate with Deputy Lalor in giving him the information he wants but it is not before me.  Perhaps the word &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo; may not have been understood in the context of the Deputy's question because, if the National Prices Commission employed consultants, that would not be an inquiry in the sense of the word, as understood, but I shall try to sort out the Deputy's difficulty.</P>

If, on the other hand, the Minister is disowning the National Prices Commission, as being unofficial, I will accept his reply. Therefore, I would ask the Minister is he not aware, or has he not been informed by the National Prices Commission, that they are at present investigating the operation of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware.  The difficulty here arises from the dual way in which people may reach the position of art teachers in vocational schools.  One of these is by way of a series of the Department's technical school's examinations.  There is a high failure rate in this examination of drawing from life.  During the past three years the figures have been 47, 53 and 50 per cent failure.  There are two reasons for this.  Art students are entered prematurely for examinations and temporary whole-time teachers of art requiring qualifications in drawing from life often have no facilities to continue study in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> Employment as a teacher hinders full-time study in the area required. I may mention that a circular was issued to the school authorities in February, 1974, admitting that the technical school art examinations are not considered suitable for the purpose of awarding qualifications as art teachers and that it was proposed to discontinue the award of the art teacher's certificate on the results of these examinations.  While there may be dissatisfaction with the suitability of these examinations for the purpose of acquiring art teacher qualifications, there is no reason for dissatisfaction in regard to the marking of an examination such as drawing from life. This is the distinction.</P>

It was considered that the manager would be anxious to receive a reply to his letter by Tuesday at the latest and that the possibility of a delay in the delivery of the reply through the post could not be ruled out.</P>
    <P>In the letter of 2nd December the manager was informed that the Minister had already arranged that the question of the educational provision for boys in Carrick-on-Suir should be carefully examined in his Department and that a decision had been taken that arrangements should be made for a discussion at an early date between officials of his Department and the authorities of the school in regard to the question of the provision of new premises for the Christian Brothers School.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was referring to herring fisheries.  This question was raised in particular by Deputy Esmonde.  We all realise how valuable the herring is, that it is possibly the most valuable species of fish.  I can assure Deputy Esmonde that I share his concern in regard to conservation <Col N="1491" /> measures necessary for the Celtic Sea area.  This question was thrown up some years ago when our scientific advisers informed us it was necessary to take steps to ensure that our herring stocks would not be overfished and, consequently, we had, in conjunction with other members of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, agreed on a quota system for the herring fisheries in the Celtic Sea.</P>
      <P>The total allowable quota to all countries entitled to fish in the Celtic Sea was 32,000 tons; our share of that quota last year was 18,000 tons; the others had 14,000 jointly.  This year, unfortunately, the advice was more unfavourable in regard to conservation than in the previous year, and the Commission decided at their recent meeting to reduce the allowable quota for all countries to 25,000 tons, and of that quota we were allocated 14,000 tons.  We expressed our disappointment through our representatives on the commission and we voted no on the commission's proposal.  We have requested the chairman of the NEAFC to review the position if at all possible, and we hope that as a result our quota of 14,000 tons will be increased for the year commencing 1st April, 1976; we have to deal a year in advance with these matters. Therefore, I can assure Deputies that the Department are mindful of our herring fisheries position.  We realise their value and are doing everything possible to ensure that other countries who have the right to fish, particularly in the Celtic Sea, will not, as indicated by Deputy Esmonde, overfish their quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy was worried about how we could ascertain whether the returns we get from the Netherlands or from France or Germany are correct and factual.  We have to depend on our counterparts in the Department of Fisheries of the different countries.  We expect that their reports are factual and truthful, and possibly they could question whether our reports were factual and truthful. In any case, we must, as members of the Commission, accept the good faith of the other members.  As far as Ireland is concerned, we always <Col N="1492" /> give factual returns of our herring fisheries and we in turn expect that the States reporting to us will likewise give factual and truthful information.</P>
    <P>Deputies Geoghegan and O'Connor were worried about landing rights and public lighting particularly at small ports.  This may seem a small question, but I agree it can be a source of worry to fishermen and naturally, we would like to be as helpful as possible.  The lighting of such ports would be a matter for the local authorities concerned, and any recommendations we get on the desirability of providing landing rights or public lighting on a pier we shall be only too pleased to take up with the appropriate authorities and see what can be done about it.</P>
    <P>We are taking appropriate steps in regard to research in the erection of a laboratory and two field stations. We have plans for two new research vessels.  We expect to have them within the next two years.</P>
    <P>Fish farming is being actively researched at present by the Department, BIM and commercial interests. This is a rather complex question as I am sure Deputy Gallagher appreciates. There is a possibility that it could be a valuable fishery.  All the necessary steps are being taken to discover its potential.  Fish farming is in its infancy and we are trying to get more comprehensive reports.  As soon as the information is available to the Department and we can formulate our policy on fish farming.  Deputies can be assured it will be circulated.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the welcome extended to this Bill by Deputies from both sides of the House.  BIM provide grants for the purchase of boats.  The advancement of loans is possibly one of their most important functions. For some time I held views on the availability of such money to skippers for the purchase of boats.  The provision of public funds carries with it obligations.  These boats are used by share fishermen, the skipper getting one, two, three or four shares, so many shares for the boat and one share for each deckhand.  It has come to my notice that some of the deckhands never see the returns made by <Col N="1493" /> certain boats.  On pay night, Friday or Saturday night, they get an envelope with, say, £28.71 marked on the envelope and no information as to how that figure was arrived at.  I deplore that type of system.  It is not right.  BIM should stipulate, when approving grants and loans, that when fishermen are fishing in a share system every man is entitled to see the documentation and returns.  He is entitled to know where the fish is sold, how it was sold and particularly the returns for all fish caught.  I hope it may not be necessary to refer to this question again, and that our comments today will bring such a system to an end.</P>
    <P>We in the Department are as interested in the welfare of the ordinary deckhand as the skipper, the manager or senior executive of a processing plant.  We are particularly mindful of the position of individual deckhands. Some of them are afraid to demand their rights, because possibly the making of such demands would ensure their dismissal.  This should not happen in the Ireland of 1974.  Again, I repeat, I hope this system will end this year.</P>

    <Title>Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill, 1974: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies with the Bill describes the categories of persons who are liable to pay health contributions.  It also describes the services to which they and their dependants are entitled.  There is no need for me therefore to reiterate these facts in this debate.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, health contributions were introduced in 1971 as an additional source of revenue for financing health services.  The rate of contribution has remained unchanged since that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same period however the cost of providing health services has risen dramatically.  In 1971-72 health expenditure amounted to £86 million. This year it will rise to approximately <Col N="1496" /> £166 million on a 12-month basis.  This figure represents an increase of £80 million in three years, equivalent to a growth of 93 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer has borne almost all of this increase in health expenditure. Since 1972-73 the proportion of expenditure met from rates has been significantly reduced.  The rates contribution has diminished from £36 million in 1972-73, the last budget year of the previous administration, to £13.5 million in the period April-December, 1974.  At the same time the revenue from health contributions has remained almost static.  The Exchequer therefore has borne an increasing proportion of the rapid rise in health expenditure during the period because of the Government's commitment to phase out health charges on the rates. Overall this has been a desirable development.  The fact that the Government are phasing out the rates contribution means that we are abolishing the most regressive element in the health financing system and shifting the balance very quickly in favour of an overall progressive revenue scheme.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there was considerable debate in 1971, when the House discussed the proposal to introduce health contributions, and many Deputies questioned whether this was the most equitable way of finding additional revenue.  There were valid arguments put forward then for and against the proposed health contributions and I can still see merit in many of them.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the provision of limited eligibility services at 15 pence a week and £7 a year has been exceptionally good value and compares very favourably with private health insurance schemes.  In addition health contribution means that we are abolishing the most regressive element in the health services, thereby allowing them to develop faster than would have been possible if we had relied exclusively on the Exchequer for funding.</P>
    <P>On the other hand however it was argued that health contributions were really another form of taxation and that the flat-rate contribution was regressive since it did not take account <Col N="1497" /> of the income of the contributor. When the scheme was introduced in 1971 it was argued that, since the contributions proposed constituted a regressive alternative to taxation, it would be better to rely exclusively on the Exchequer for health services revenue.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is some merit in both sides of this argument. Accordingly I propose to begin shortly a review of the present system of financing our health services.  This cannot be done in isolation of course, so I propose to link it with the review of the financing of our social welfare system which has already been announced.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this review will be to see whether the present system of financing our health services can be improved.  The present flat-rate health contributions scheme will be examined in that context.</P>
    <P>The situation at the moment is that, of the total sum of £166 million for the health services in 1974-75, about £120 million represents the cost of hospital and specialist services, maternity and infant care services and the drugs subsidy scheme, which constitutes the services to which persons with limited eligibility are entitled. Of the £120 million it is estimated that about £72 million would represent the cost of services for persons with limited eligibility.  But health contributions only amount to £5 million at present.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed as proposed, health contributions will go up by £3½ million to £8½ million in a full year and will account for only about 10 per cent of the estimated cost next year of providing the limited eligibility classes and their dependants with hospital and specialist services, maternity and infant care services and the drugs subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>So, in fact, the financing of the health services is moving towards a situation where it virtually depends on the Exchequer.  I hope that my review will analyse this trend in all its implications and will help us to form final judgments on the future financing of the services.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to point <Col N="1498" /> out that two serious anomalies exist at present in the entitlement provisions for our limited eligibility health services.  The first is the differing upper income limits for eligibility which exists for differing groups of people.  For insured, non-manual workers the upper income limit at present is £2,250 per annum.  For non-insured persons, other than farmers, the upper income limit at present is £1,600 a year.  This is an anomaly which must be removed as soon as possible so that the upper income limit is the same for both groups.</P>
    <P>The second anomaly is the existence of any upper income limit to entitlement to limited eligibility health services. As Deputies are aware, this anomaly is not of my making.  It is the policy of this Government to abolish income limits entirely as soon as agreement can be reached with the medical profession.  Discussions will begin again on this question when the review body, which I set up, issues its recommendations.</P>
    <P>I indicated earlier the rate at which health expenditure has risen since 1971.  While, as I mentioned in my Estimates speech, growth in real terms over the range of services has been significant, the fact remains that rising costs have also pushed up expenditure.</P>
    <P>The House is aware of the current world economic situation which threatens all economies with a recession of major proportions.  The effect of the present downturn in the world economy is evident in our country and the Government's analysis of the situation, and the policy objectives they have set themselves, have been set out in their recent White Paper, entitled <i>A National Partnership.</i></P>
    <P>Over the next two years little real growth can be expected in the OECD group of countries, of which we are one.  Obviously this will have serious Exchequer implications, particularly in relation to the growth in tax revenues and, consequently, for the resources available to finance State services.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my Estimates speech, this new situation, imposed by external events, will have a direct bearing <Col N="1499" /> on the funds available to meet the costs of the existing health services and to finance their expansion.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I view with deep concern the scale of demands which are presently being made on resources which are far less than they would have been in normal world economic conditions.</P>
    <P>The White Paper clearly indicated the limits which are now imposed on the growth in real incomes for the entire community.  It appealed for moderation in income demands and I reinforce that appeal here today.  It pointed out we are affected not alone by world inflation but by world recession as well, and I wish to emphasise those points again because they relate to the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an increase in health contributions to a level of 26p per week or £12 per annum.  As incomes have risen substantially since 1971, when the present rates were established, these increases are not inordinate, but clearly there is a limit to the point to which the contributions can be raised and also to which the Exchequer can be asked to finance the health services.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I trust that the cost of the services will not escalate beyond the point where future developments may have to be curtailed.</P>
    <P>I trust, too, that the House will take account of the review which I will have undertaken of the principles underlying the Bill, of the factors which have caused me to seek these increases, and of the purposes to which the revenue will be directed.</P>
    <P>I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was circulated about two weeks ago with an explanatory memorandum which makes its objectives clear and, surprisingly enough, it has received very little publicity because it is a Bill that is of significance in more than the field of health.  This is a taxation Bill for the imposition of taxation and the fact that the taxation is called a health contribution rather than income tax does not render it any less a taxation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> It comes less than a week after the imposition of £27.5 million extra taxation on petrol.  It comes on the very day on which £2.4 million subsidy has been taken away by the Government from butter with a resultant increase of 4p in the £ on butter.  Therefore, with the £3.5 million extra which this Bill is designed to raise for the Exchequer added to the £27.5 million which the petrol taxation brought in last week and the £2.4 million which was gathered by the Exchequer today by the Government taking the subsidy from butter, we have a total taxation raised&mdash;assuming this Bill passes&mdash;of £33 million within a week.  The Government have come along with this further penal taxation on the less well-off people in the community&mdash; because the best-off 10 per cent about whom there was so much talk before are not included in this and are not penalised by it; it is the limited eligibility classes who are penalised and who face an increase in their weekly or annual health contribution of over 80 per cent.  These, for the most part, are ordinary workers who every week are having deducted from their pay income tax, social welfare and health contributions.  Now, they find their health contribution is to be increased by over 80 per cent.  It is exactly the same to them as if they were called upon to pay an extra 11p a week in income tax.</P>
    <P>In the light of what has happened in the last week as a result of a deliberate Government decision to put up the price of petrol by 15p per gallon and the price of butter by 4p a pound and now this Bill, the people and, in particular, the workers who have no option but to pay this increase because it is deducted from them at source are, and are entitled to be, very some over another example of this backdoor taxation.  It is introduced in the form of a Health Bill which I can only assume is designed to put some colour on it other than what it is, taxation of the people.  Up to now very few people have realised, even though the Bill was published a fortnight ago, exactly what it proposes to do and I think that when people do come to realise what it means&mdash; many of them may not do so until <Col N="1501" /> after the deductions are made from their pay&mdash;there will be an outcry against this proposal to tax workers.</P>
    <P>Many people have said that it is an extraordinary form of socialism that is being practised by this Government when they seek to give free or almost free hospital in-patient services to the top socio-economic group even though there is no demand for them and, having failed to do that&mdash;they are still apparently determined to do it as soon as they can&mdash;in the meantime they impose higher charges for health services on a much less well-off and much larger group in the community.  Presumably this is some form of socialism but I wish that the Minister who again today lectured us about the necessity for restraint in wage claims and so on would explain to us what precisely is his thinking on health matters when on the one hand he is trying to confer benefits on the well-off or comparatively well-off and on the other hand at the same time trying to charge the less well-off 80 per cent more for the privilege of free medicine.</P>
    <P>This is nothing but a clear demonstration of the sort of muddled thinking besetting this Government, not just in matters of health&mdash;although it is probably clearer here than in other Departments&mdash;but in other Departments also.  We have this sort of <i>ad hoc</i> solution to problems while the big problem facing this Government today and for the past few months is a grave shortage of money which will become worse, quite clearly, from what we have heard and seen.  In order to raise more money they are prepared to resort to all kinds of subterfuges and one of them is the present Bill because the Minister for Health has been Minister for Health for 20 months now and the first piece of legislation in relation to health that has reached the floor of this House is the miserable, hypocritical Bill we have today with its two sections imposing higher charges on the limited eligibility class which constitutes about 55 or 60 per cent of our population.</P>
    <P>That miserable piece of legislation is the only contribution the present Minister has made to the health legislation in 20 months.  If this is the only performance of all the promises that <Col N="1502" /> have been made, it is a sorry state of affairs and I should be very much ashamed to be judged as Minister for Health if this was my only contribution to health legislation in 20 months.</P>
    <P>This Bill is as much a subterfuge as increasing the price of butter was this morning and the performance we had last Wednesday night in bringing in under an Act, where it was not at all appropriate, a massive increase in taxation on petrol.  More than £33 million has been raised this week by the Government in taxation without any reference to budgets or anything else, and this is the most cynical and the most blatant effort of all.</P>
    <P>The figure is given in the explanatory memorandum and in the Minister's speech that the yield from health contributions is £5 million a year.  I am surprised to see that because only ten days or so ago we had a Supplementary Estimate which we agreed to without any discussion on the basis that there would afterwards be a full discussion on the Health Estimate, which unfortunately we have not had. That Supplementary Estimate, which was very substantial, included provision for £500,000 for the shortfall in health contributions in the current year.  The Estimate was revised to provide that only £4½ million would be obtained, and the reason given for that shortfall by the Minister&mdash;at the time I demonstrated it to be untrue&mdash; was that he had been allowing for further contributions from the 10 per cent who do not qualify for limited eligibility.  As that category had not come in or been brought in, the Minister said the shortfall had arisen.</P>
    <P>Of course we know that that is not correct, because the Minister had separately estimated for their contributions when he was costing the scheme and announced that the net cost of it would be £1.8 million.  We know the tremendous difficulties experienced by the health boards in trying to collect contributions of £7 a year from farmers and others.  There was no difficulty in collecting it from workers with weekly wages because it was taken from them at source with their income tax and various other deductions. But the farmers, who are the principal category paying the £7 <Col N="1503" /> a year, found it very difficult if not impossible to pay their contributions this year because of the general economic mess in which they found themselves.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, even though the Supplementary Estimate was moved here and was agreed to by me and this side of the House in order to try to keep the health services going, the Minister again today trotted out the old figure of £5 million.  Is that figure right and, if it is, why was the Supplementary Estimate for £500,000 moved, supposedly to cover the shortfall? We are told that the increases proposed in this Bill should bring in an extra £3.5 million to bring the total up to £8.5 million, but we were told ten days ago that only £4½ million is being got in at the moment.  I cannot follow this sort of reasoning.  I wonder if the Minister can, or whether he will explain why there is this serious discrepancy in the figure and why the House was asked to vote a Supplementary Estimate of £500,000 when the Minister had to come back to the House ten days later to tell us the original figure was right.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why this shortfall occurred&mdash;if indeed it was there, because it seems to have been contradicted&mdash;is that the smaller farmers found it impossible this year to make their payments.  Now they are being asked instead of paying £7 a year to pay £12.  Does the Minister seriously think he will find it easy to collect £12 a year when he was not able to collect £7 a year?  Does he think that farmers and others who are hard hit at the moment&mdash;God knows, there is hardly anyone who is not in that category&mdash; will willingly pay up this £12 a year, a further form of taxation, even though it is under another name? Does he think that the difficulties of collection which he spoke about earlier will be lessened by increasing the contribution by more than 80 per cent?</P>
    <P>If the Minister were sincere in his desire to provide health services for all who need them, he would have begun by providing them free for those who do not have them free at the moment but who were making these payments.  Even if he could <Col N="1504" /> not at the start cover the whole of the limited eligibility class, would he not, as I have suggested in relation to the general medical service, begin by taking half of that class and giving them free services both under the GMS and by abolishing the contributions they have to make at the moment?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any realisation of the difficulties ordinary people are in at this time in trying to make ends meet?  There are an awful lot of workers, particularly in rural areas, who have to depend on their cars to get to and from their employment, and if they had not their cars and the wherewithal to drive them they would lose their jobs.  Still, a brutal increase was put on them last week.  Another increase which affects everybody in the country was imposed by the Government this morning on the price of butter.  Now we have this final straw this afternoon&mdash;virtually every insured worker except those below the miserable figure which is the income limit for medical cards will have to pay 11p in extra taxation out of his pay packet each week.  And in the very speech in which the Minister introduced this further measure of penal taxation, he made yet another appeal for restraint in wage demands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly embraces wage earners because they are the people who were being told all the time in the past couple of months by the Government that they had better restrain their demands.  How can the unfortunate people restrain their demands when more and more tax is being milked out of them every week?  How are they expected to live? In the past week they have already contributed more than £33 million in further taxation and now they are being asked to restrain their demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill and the whole thinking behind it&mdash;the speech of the Minister in introducing it&mdash;are in my opinion <Col N="1505" /> nothing but hypocrisy.  It is incredible that taxation of this nature would be imposed for health services by a Labour Minister for Health and that in the same speech by which he introduces and commends it he asks those affected by it to restrain their demands for higher incomes.  They cannot restrain their demands for higher incomes.  It is not the Arabs, world inflation or external circumstances that are driving them into that position. In the past week I have given three uncontradictable examples of the Government taking £33 million, at least, in extra taxation from the wage earners.  They have to pay that much more.</P>
    <P>How can they be expected, if they are to maintain any kind of standard of living, to restrain their demands for more income?  The Minister has shown amazing hypocrisy in saying here today what he said in relation to those people, because if wage demands are being made there is no one factor that has driven those demands more than this Government in the past 20 months, a Government which have taken these incredible decisions in the last few weeks.  The Government themselves are the major factor in driving up costs and wage demands.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see in the Minister's speech that he realises an anomaly in the matter of eligibility, because on today's Order Paper I had a question to him on that point.  Unfortunately it was not reached.  The fact that I had it there may have helped to inspire the Minister to refer to this anomaly in his speech.</P>

      <P>In Question No. 84 today, I asked the Minister</P>
      <P>if he is aware of the hardship suffered by non-insured persons, such as widows, with incomes marginally over £1,600 in paying for medical services in full; and if he will amend the health services regulations to entitle them to limited eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to be the intention of the Minister to do that and to bring them up to the ordinary figure everyone else <Col N="1506" /> is at of £2,250 for insured non-manual workers.  In the last year I have come across several instances of people who are certainly not well off, including the instance of a widow with quite a large young family whose total pension came to just over £1,606, being denied limited eligibility.  She incurred some extremely heavy expenditure, which she could not hope to bear, in the provision of medical services for herself and her children.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to refer to what he calls the second anomaly, the existence of any upper income limit to entitlement to limited eligibility.  That is a very major topic which we debated here before and no doubt will debate again.  It is an expression of the Minister's doctrinaire approach to the health services.  Unfortunately in no way can it be seen as an expression of concern for people who need help because in his doctrinaire efforts to give the better off people the benefits of limited eligibility he is giving them something which for the most part they do not want and he is proposing to do it, as I pointed out before, at the expense of the less-well off who will be shoved further back in the queue, the queue for the limited facilities which are available in our hospitals, hospitals which are grossly overcrowded and unable to cope with those entitled to institutional services at present.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that if the Minister wants to distribute largesse as far as entitlement to hospital services is concerned, that largesse should be given in the first instance to those who are least well off and that a large proportion of the present limited eligibility class should in fact be given free services without any contribution at all.  Before we saw socialism in practice by this Government, I understood it to mean trying to help those who were least well off and to give the most help to those whose need was greatest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We now have the situation in which the actions of the Minister are the direct opposite.  Instead of relieving the burden on the least well off of the limited eligibility class, he is today asking the House to agree to adding to that burden.  He is increasing their contributions by over 80 per cent and the services they are going to get are certainly no better, and indeed on the Minister's admission today and on his Estimate speech a fortnight ago, we cannot expect any improvement in the health services in 1975 because of general economic conditions.  When the Minister says we cannot expect any improvement, I think it is fair to assume from that, from what we have seen over the past year or so, that that will really mean in practice that we can expect a significant disimprovement because the waiting lists seem to grow and grow in every part of the country and the problems of getting into hospital seem to become increasingly difficult and unfortunately those at the lower end of the scale are the people who suffer most by this.</P>
      <P>I hope that as a result of what I hope will be a full debate on the Bill the 1½ million or more people who are to be affected by these increases will realise what this Bill is about, will appreciate that further taxation to the tune of £3½ million a year is now being placed on them by the Government and that all these things are being done surreptitiously in the past week, just a month or so before what is officially to be the first budget of 1975.  Deputy Lalor expressed well the other day the feelings of pretty well everyone in the country, that fixing a budget for January 15th or any particular date really does not matter very much because virtually every day is budget day in this country now. This is the third instance in a week of concealed taxation being placed on the people by the Government or by a Minister who, to my mind, has reached the ultimate in hypocrisy when in doing this and taking a further 11p per week out of the wage packets of ordinary workers, he has the effrontery to ask them to restrain their demands.</P>

    <P>The Government more than any <Col N="1508" /> one factor are pushing up prices which in turn are causing greater wage demands, and they are doing it not because of outside influences about which they talk so much, but because they need more money in order to try to keep this country afloat and are prepared to get that money by any means, surreptitiously or otherwise, while trying to cod the people into the belief that they are really doing something for their benefit.  The people are awakening to this situation very quickly and it is at the end now of a sore and sorry week for us all that we come to the realisation that here under this new brand of socialism is a further imposition on those who are least well able to bear it, allegedly in the interests of health. The amount got in, even if the Minister were to get his whole £8½ million, is only a very small proportion of the cost of health services for people in this class, and if the Minister has any humanity in him or any genuine desire to help those so badly hit at the moment as a result of Government activity in recent times, he would, instead of increasing these health contributions by more than 80 per cent, in fact be abolishing them altogether.</P>
    <P>We cannot see our way to support or even to be neutral about a Bill such as this.  Our position is that we are totally opposed to it and we regard it for what it is, a surreptitious backdoor method of imposing further taxation, except that in this case it is being imposed on a large group of people who above all others are less well able to bear it.  We will vote against the Bill and against each section. We think that for the Minister to try on this effort of penal taxation and in the same speech to ask the workers affected by it to restrain their demands is the ultimate in hypocrisy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak for a moment or two on something I know a little about.  I have served for 25 years as a member of a health authority, as a member of a health advisory board and in a regional health board. Before Deputy O'Malley leaves the House&mdash;I am sorry he is running away from it&mdash;I want to give him a few <Col N="1509" /> lessons on what health is about.  It is typical of him to make these charges without foundation and what I consider the ultimate of hypocrisy is the manner in which the Fianna Fáil Party and their spokesman on health will make a filthy allegation, unfounded, unsupported, with regard to health.  I was a member of a mental hospital board.  We were promoted into a health authority.  Then we moved up into a regional health board.  I can speak from experience. My first concern is for the patient. Everything after that is supplementary. We must first of all have regard to the patients.  Deputy O'Malley knows absolutely nothing about it. He is not a member of any health board.  Because of his villianous attacks he is thrown in for political purposes. Health is above politics.</P>
      <P>Physical or mental ill-health is a problem.  Some of it can be cured. In some cases it cannot be cured. I refer particularly to mental disorders. Most of us who have been associated with health services know the position better than any medical man.  We meet the people every hour of every day.  We know how they complain and how they think.  They come to us as their public representatives more often than they go to their medical consultants because we can talk sense to them and can listen to them.  We have extreme endurance and patience with unfortunates.  We do not think of money or any other aspect.  We think of the person who has a complaint, whether it is real or imaginary.  If it is real we try to solve it.  If it is imaginary we talk about it and discuss it with the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not come into the health service on a two-day apprenticeship like the Fianna Fáil spokesman.  I came in here the rough and hard way.  I know what health is all about, physical and mental.  This is not a political football. In the Mid-Western Health Board we completely rule out politics and on every occasion since the Mid-Western Health Board was formed I have either proposed or seconded a political opponent for the chair&mdash;a Fianna Fáil man&mdash;because I believe that we are above politics when we deal with the <Col N="1510" /> health of the people.  On the last occasion of the election of chairman of the Mid-Western Health Board a Fianna Fáil colleague of his opposed his election to the chair.  I proposed his election and he is back there.  That was because I believe health to be above politics.  Fianna Fáil do not believe that.  Let me enlighten those who know little or nothing about health, if they are prepared to be educated.</P>

      <P>When people talk to you, you must talk back to them. There are eight health boards: the Midland, Mid-Western, North Eastern, North Western, South Eastern, Southern, Western, Eastern.  I do not know what their budget is.  We shall know when the time comes.  I can speak of the health board with which I am associated and of what it costs to provide a service.  I am not satisfied that we are giving a full service but within our limitations we have improved astronomically in the last two years.  Despite what Deputy O'Malley says, we have given a service and never was income the thumb rule which determined that a person should be deprived of service.  Each case is treated on its merits regard being had to the health of the patient and the capacity of the person to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cases have come from Clare, Limprove <Col N="1511" /> erick city or county, North Tipperary. I have met cases where the limit has been exceeded whether in relation to income or valuation or other matters, but despite the fact that guidelines are laid down a human approach is adopted towards the persons concerned.  I am sure any Member of this House who is a member of a health board knows how expensive treatment can be, whether in St. Patrick's, Waterford, or anywhere else.  In these cases income limits are rarely introduced.  We take all cases as they come and we help them irrespective of income or valuations.  We are honest about this, not like some Fianna Fáil Deputies.  I am not referring to all of them but to the spokesman for Health.  He knows absolutely nothing about the workings of a health board.  He comes in here to play politics with health.  Confound him and damn him for it.</P>

He has made a disreputable speech, trying to decry a man and a Department whose first concern is the patient.  This is the time and the place to set the record right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our health board region comprises the city and county of Limerick, North Tipperary and County Clare. In that region there were 269,804 people on the 1971 census.  When I started with the health authority in Limerick 25 years ago we had less than 100 employees.  Today there are 3,000 people employed by the MidWestern <Col N="1512" /> Health Board.  These people are not wasting their time; they are looking after the needs of the unfortunate people who require help.  We do not play politics with these matters.</P>
    <P>For 1974 our budget was £9,340,000 and it is now £16,765,000.  There has been talk about an 80 per cent increase but the difference in the two budgets is greater than that.  An increase of 80 per cent means 11p per week, approximately 2s in the old money.  Nobody was more vociferous than Deputy O'Malley when whiskey and other drink were increased in price and he made much play about the old money then.  The increase from £7 per year to £12 per year means an increase of less than 2s per week and we all know what we can buy for that amount now.</P>
    <P>The institutions in our health board region number 23.  We have three regional hospitals&mdash;a general, maternity and orthopaedic hospital.  We have four geriatric hospitals, two county hospitals, two psychiatric hospitals and three units for handicapped children at Roscrea, Foynes and Ennis.  We have made arrangements for construction of a bigger institution and 12 months ago the Tánaiste turned the sod on what will be the biggest mental institution in the country. It is situated in Limerick city. We also have three welfare homes.</P>
    <P>Since April, 1971, we have given £24,000 to the Regional Hospital in Limerick on the first occasion and subsequently we gave £42,000 for a theatre and all the necessary equipment. We have spent £29,000 on industrial therapy in St. Joseph's Mental Hospital.  We have spent £10,000 on hostel accommodation and £15,000 on renovation work.</P>
    <P>We have spent £7,000 in Roscrea, in Nenagh £10,000 and £235,000 on welfare homes in Nenagh and Roscrea. In Kilrush we have spent £168,000. In Ennis we have spent £13,000 on industrial therapy.  On rehabilitation hostels and doctors' accommodation we have spent £20,000.  We have spent £12,000 on new dental accommodation in Ennis County Hospital.  On St. Nessan's Orthopaedic Hospital, Croom, we have spent £52,000.  On <Col N="1513" /> St. Ita's Hospital, Newcastlewest, we have spent £190,000.  We have schemes prepared catering for a new laboratory in Limerick Regional Hospital at a cost of £130,000, for a 50-bed paediatric unit at a cost of £120,000 and a 50-bed psychiatric unit costing £150,000.  We are also providing an extension to the staff diningroom at St. Joseph's Hospital.  For the schemes I have mentioned the cost will be £700,000.</P>
    <P>We have also schemes in progress for St. Camillus's Hospital in Limerick, which was formerly an old workhouse, at a cost of £100,000&mdash;this is in connection with the cafeteria and changing room.  We are also arranging for the provision of boilers and an incinerator at a cost of £23,000.  Work on the welfare home at Newcastlewest is estimated to cost £100,000.  Reconstruction work at Ennis Hospital, £530,000, and the health centre in Limerick will cost £300,000.</P>
    <P>Up to 30th September, 1974, we had 14,800 medical cardholders in Clare; in Limerick there were 25,577 medical cardholders and in North Tipperary 8,335.  This gives a grand total of 48,392, representing 95,753 people which is 35.49 per cent of the board's population and the State figure is 36.04 per cent of the population. There are other boards&mdash;perhaps less affluent, I do not know&mdash; but as far as we are concerned the patient is our first concern and any damn character, whether inside this House or outside it, who wants to play politics with health, I say a curse on him, a curse on him, and let that go out from me.  Inside or outside this House they are not fit to represent anybody and the sooner the people realise that they are a lot of white sepulchres, who will come in here and play politics with the health of the people, the better.</P>
    <P>We have produced our guidelines with regard to the issue of medical cards.  So have every other board.  We will be reviewing those in the new year, bearing in mind the cost of living and all the things that go with the changing times in which we live.  I am a man of change.  I believe in change.  Any man who does not <Col N="1514" /> change should have his head examined.  I am all for change and we will be changing our guidelines in 1974.  It is bitter and sugar is scarce, but the Fianna Fáil Party will take it from me.  I know it is galling but, by God, they will take it and the people who are listening to me all over this House on the intercom can come in here and deny what I am saying.  I know I am being listened to all over the House tonight.  Let the man come back and sit there.  I will not stand for this and the people of Limerick did not stand for it at the last local elections and that is what counts.  Guidelines are like estimates.  There is no line beyond which one can go no further.  That does not apply with regard to the health services.</P>
    <P>We talked about this and we agreed that a single person living alone with £14 a week or under should automatically, leaving out his circumstances and his problems, be entitled to a medical card.  We agreed that a single person living with his family with £12 a week should qualify.  We set £20 a week for a husband and wife and we allowed £1.75 a week each for dependent children under 16 years of age, £2.75 for other dependent children, outgoings on mortgages and rents £2.00 a week.  They are only guidelines.  We met the problems in each individual case and we made our case to the CEO.  Humanity was always shown, particularly when people were in distress.  Nothing causes more distress than worry about what is to happen.  I have very little medical experience except the experience of going into hospitals and meeting people who are physically or mentally ill.  If one can say to a sick person: &ldquo;Do not worry about the bill; we will look after that.  Relax there for yourself and we will not send the bailiff to you&rdquo;, if one can give a patient that little comfort, it puts them at least 50 per cent on the road to recovery.  When a person is worrying about what an operation will cost, if one can sit at his bedside, as we all do, and relieve him of that worry one is putting that person 50 per cent on the road to recovery.</P>
    <P>Many hard things have been said about the medical profession and maybe <Col N="1515" /> they look for a lot of it.  A former Minister for Health, Mr. MacEntee, had some cantankerous times with the medical profession.  My experience of the medical profession is that when people come to me with a bill&mdash;a bill for surgery, an anaesthetist's bill, any kind of bill&mdash;and say they cannot pay, I take the telephone, ring the doctor involved and I say: &ldquo;Look, John or Jim, what are you going to do about this?&rdquo;  He says: &ldquo;Make your own price&rdquo;.  That is an arrangement I have with most of the medical men in the city of Limerick.</P>

      <P>You will get a bad apple in every barrel and you will get gluggers in every nest.  We had it in Wexford a couple of days ago when I had to come out publicly and denounce them at our health board meeting last Friday.  I had to denounce them publicly again when our health board met on Monday night.  I denounced them for their lack of interest in the burning question of alcoholism.  Letters and telegrams from medical men have reached my house since my pronouncement on Monday night congratulating me and thanking me and saying that they had not woken up to the fact that alcoholism is one of our greatest problems today.</P>
      <P>Much play has been made of the increase of two bob a week.  The Tánaiste was castigated and we were all castigated and denounced without any proof of what it was all about. They are immature little boys who were thrown into positions because of their sniping qualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they would only come and ask what is it all about.  Would they not go to their masters?  I am not a dentist, a general practitioner or a consultant.  I am an ordinary man with something between his two ears <Col N="1516" /> who knows how to use that something. I have no furrow to plough but I know there are others who have a furrow to plough.  I attend health board meetings.  One day I listen to the general practitioners, the next day I listen to the dentists and the day after I listen to someone else.  They are all trying to get ahead.  As far as we are concerned we put the patient first and the professional man will have to take his place in the line.  He will have to sit back and wait.  But he will give a service.</P>
    <P>We hear all this outcry now about doctors, consultants and dentists.  A former Minister for Health had some little difficulties too with the medical profession and with other professions. We heard nothing at that time from Fianna Fáil.  The Minister was right and the doctors were wrong.  It is a turnabout now.</P>
    <P>This is not indirect taxation.  I have proved in my figures and in my association with my board what this is all about.  We have relieved the ratepayer of health contributions.  We have increased social welfare benefits beyond the wildest imagination of Fianna Fáil, if they have any imagination. We have given the people a health service Fianna Fáil could never have provided for them.  All we are seeking is 10p per week.  Whatever political capital anyone may try to make out of this, there is one lesson Fianna Fáil should learn.  They spent hundreds of thousands in the Cork by-election, but the people were not fooled.  Not alone are Fianna Fáil trying to cod the people but they are actually trying to cod God.</P>
    <P>I suppose Deputy O'Malley can spell the word &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; and, beyond that, he cannot go.  Far be it for me to decry a colleague from my own city, but I will not stand for hypocrisy.  The people I represent will not stand for hypocrisy.  That was proven beyond yea or nay at the local elections.  We are doing a good job of work in Limerick.  I visit the hospitals. I have not seen the spokesman for Health in Fianna Fáil visiting any hospitals or attending meetings for alcoholics or anything else.  It ill becomes anyone to come in here and <Col N="1517" /> try to play politics with ill health.  If we want to help we must give. Remember, we are helping those who cannot help themselves.  That is our job in life and it is on that we will be judged by future generations.  It is on that judgement I will stand.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on what he has done and on the courage he has shown.  I congratulate him on his humanity towards those who cannot help themselves. What more can a man do? Bees always gather around the honey. Woe to the people who are making big profits out of the illnesses of others.  If I were Minister for Health I would go a few steps further than the Minister has done and I would check every account sent in.  I can assure you they would be revealing.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the way he is handling our health services and I deplore the actions of those who try to sabotage his efforts.  They deserve ill of the people.  Let us forget about bank accounts and new cars and let each of us apply himself to his vocation, whatever it may be, in a charitable way, without disruption and without sabotage.  If we do that we will be a better country.  This is what socialism is all about.  I shall always be in the forefront of the battle where health is concerned.  Only those who have had experience of hospitals can understand what is involved.  I spent a Christmas in hospital.  I know how onerous the duties of the nurses are.  I know what they have to put up with night, noon and morning every day of the week.  They give a service.  The majority of the medical men I know are service-giving men, charitable men. As I said, there is always one bad apple in a barrel.  The ordinary man-in-the-street has nothing but respect for the Minister for Health.  He is with him all the time in his battles. We are all with him.  I want to refer again to the former Minister for Health, Mr. MacEntee.  How ruthless was ruthlessness there?  In all my experience in dealing with public health, never have I seen a Minister for Health such as the present Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill increases the contribution by 80 per cent for <Col N="1518" /> people in the middle income group. Deputy Coughlan could not lecture me on a social conscience.  I was a socialist all my life and I hope to die with a social conscience.  I will not take a lecture on socialism from anybody.  Deputy Coughlan gave us a long lecture on the amount of money being spent by health boards, and the way it has increased down through the years.  I want to compliment the Minister on doing a good job, but his predecessors did a good job too.  As a result of all these good jobs being done, there is an increase of from £9 million to £18 million in Deputy Coughlan's health board area. Surely he is not trying to insinuate that the improvement came in two years.  Surely that was achieved because other Ministers for Health did a lot for the health services.</P>
      <P>I said the other evening that at the beginning I was against the health boards.  I have to admit I was wrong and they are doing a good job.  Deputy Coughlan mentioned guidelines. I think Deputy O'Connell will agree that if you are over the guideline you are out.  I am not a member of a health board.  I am a member of an advisory committee.  At the beginning the figure was £15.  Now it is £20 and we are pressing to make it £25.  I hope that will happen.  It should be even higher than £25.  I am not very keen on bringing in the top-notcher free.  I am concerned about the people in the lower and the middle income groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment our hospitals are very overcrowded.  If I were sure that we had accommodation for everyone I would say that the Minister should include us all.  We should move slowly. Road workers are getting over £30 a week now.  They should qualify.  The figure of £20 is outdated.  The Minister should tell this to the CEOs of the different health boards.  Deputy Coughlan talked about telling a patient that he was OK, but if he is a little bit above the figure he is not OK unless you can get him in under the hardship clause.  I do not see any mention of increasing the figure of £60 valuation.  I have condemned valuations before and I condemn them again as the most unfair <Col N="1519" /> and unjust way of assessing a person's income.  In some cases you would get a valuation of only half a crown for good land and in others you would get a valuation of £1 for flooded land along the Shannon.  If a person has a valuation of £61 he is out.</P>
    <P>The Minister should move slowly towards bringing us all into the scheme.  The person with a big income should be able to pay for himself. The voluntary health scheme is available to him.  All my life I was a poor man.  I never had a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; until I came into this House.  We are not too badly paid and I do not mind the Press taking note of that.  I consider that I should be able to look after myself.  The man struggling at the bottom and the middle income man need help.  The contribution is going up by 80 per cent whether it is 2s or 10s or whatever Deputy Coughlan says it is.  This is the fact.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister is an excellent Minister.  I want to make that clear.  I am not criticising him. He is concerned about the people I am concerned about.  I am not concerned with people in the very high income group.  They can pay voluntary health insurance and cover themselves, and the hospitals will not be overcrowded.  They can go into private homes or wherever they like.  If they are in the health service they will have to be accommodated.  Unfortunately, there is still a bit of social snobbery and I am afraid that the person in the higher income group will get in before the person at the bottom if there is a free for all.</P>
    <P>I forget what Deputy Coughlan called the Fianna Fáil Party.  I think he said they were trying to educate God.  I was always told to say what I had to say in as few words as possible, but he spoke for half an hour and he said nothing.  He read out of a paper what the health boards are doing.  The members of the Western Health Board have the interests of the patients at heart and the patients come first.  Deputy Coughlan is not the only man in Ireland with whom the patients come first.  I do not think the Minister should increase the contribution <Col N="1520" /> by 80 per cent.  It might look small at 2s.</P>
    <P>On a short Bill like this, if you cannot say what you have to say in ten minutes, you should not speak at all, so I will not detain the House. I appeal to the Minister to consider what I have said.  The lower income group and the middle income group should be moved up and we should forget about the top man and let him look after himself through the voluntary health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must congratulate Deputy Callanan on an excellent speech.  It was very pertinent and I have no hesitation in endorsing the fact that he is a good socialist.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was first introduced into the House in June, 1971, I opposed it.  I did so because I thought it was a subtle form of taxation; taxation on the people least able to bear the brunt of it.</P>
      <P>We are not looking at the whole question of the health services in the proper perspective but are coming in to this House with a makeshift arrangement, and not doing anything spectacular in the process.</P>
      <P>I realise that the Minister has problems in his Department and that tremendous demands are made on him. We know that the health services are ever-consuming in demands on the budget and on the Exchequer.  However, I would be dishonest if I did not speak my mind on these matters. I would be dishonest to the House, and to the public, if I spoke out and condemned the Health Contributions Bill in 1971 and now fully endorsed it. If I did so I would be a hypocrite and that I will not be.  When I decide to be a hypocrite I will quit this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view the Minister has been a bit shortsighted in this Bill.  I will forgive him because the economy is in such a bad way.  We have a crisis on our hands and money must be found rapidly.  This is the message that is coming across over and over again. The Minister spelled it out when he appealed for moderation and told us that things were not so good.  What this increase will achieve by way of increased contributions to the Exchequer is negligible by comparison <Col N="1521" /> with what is spent on the health services. That is glaringly obvious and I am wondering is it all in vain or are we not looking at the whole question of the health services in a proper perspective.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to bring in a 70 per cent increase.  It will be an increase of £3½ million.  In comparison with the £72 million that represents the cost of the services for persons with limited eligibility, this £3½ million looks ludicrous.  However, what is important is the fact that it is a burden on the people least able to bear it. We are being asked to impose this burden on the ordinary worker, the social welfare contributor, who is not entirely free from burdens.  This person is burdened with very high social welfare contributions and many other forms of indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>Would it not have been easier, better, and more socially desirable as well as being ideologically so if the Minister asked that this £3½ million be borne by the Exchequer and paid for by way of normal taxation?  In this way the burden would fall a lot more evenly on those best able to bear it. For example, I would be paying it but I would not be able to avail of it. I would not object to paying it.  I consider it more socially desirable that this money be paid out of the Exchequer and applied by way of increased taxation.  I am astonished that consideration has not been given to this aspect because Labour Party policy is that taxation, or the Exchequer, take over more of the burden of the health services.  We should not be asking this section of the community to bear this burden; we should be asking the entire community to bear it, particularly those best able to do so.  It would have been more desirable to ask the Exchequer to bear this.</P>
    <P>The Minister put up a very cogent argument for this increased contribution in his statement when he said that it will only account for about 10 per cent of the estimated cost this year of providing limited eligibility classes. Because of that I would have thought that adding this to the Exchequer would have been the proper way out. <Col N="1522" /> The present health contribution, contrary to what the Minister may say, is being paid for by those medical card holders who are unable to pay this. Many of them have had the health contribution deducted from their wages.  I have written up to 60 letters to the Department pointing out that many people, in their ignorance, and in the ignorance of their employer, were having 15p deducted from their wages, even though as medical card holders, they were not obliged to pay it.</P>
    <P>I saw the terrible, ridiculous blunder made by the Department of Health and the Revenue Commissioners recently. A circular was issued by the Revenue Commissioners to the effect that if employees did not wish their employers to know that they were medical card holders they could notify the commissioners and they would be refunded the money at the end of the year.  For some reason this was abandoned; one Department did not know the other Department were operating the system.  We should look seriously at this whole question of health contributions. I am astonished that it has taken so long for the Department to examine this aspect because in 1970 the EEC Commission examined the whole question of the financing of the health services.  In 1971 The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium and Denmark set up review committees to examine the financing of health services.  It is three years since we joined the EEC and I wonder why we have not tackled this matter before now.</P>
    <P>I am critical because I wonder what is being done in that Department. Everything is about to be done but matters like this should have been attended to at least two years ago. Our review of financing the health service should have been synchronised with the decision of the EEC Commission but this review is only taking place now.  I would like information on when this review will take place, how it will operate, what the terms of reference will be and when we can expect a report.  It is not enough that we should be given a two line report to the effect that it is proposed to begin shortly a review of the present <Col N="1523" /> system of financing health services. Will such a review be buried or left to lie gathering dust on the shelves of the Department of Health as so many different reviews and documents have in the past?  I have noticed in the Department of Health a tremendous deal of inefficiency and it galls me when I think of another review body being set up by that Department.</P>
    <P>I would be dishonest if I suddenly warmed to this increase and acclaimed it with enthusiasm.  In my view it is wrong to look for £3½ million on the basis of burdening the less-well-off sections of our community.  We are not providing anything more for them. The Minister has told us that it is only to keep up with inflation.  What we should be doing is carrying out an examination to see if the first Health Contributions Bill was necessary.  In 1971 it was estimated that £5 million would accrue from it and it was understood then that it was for the purpose of eliminating the hospitalisation charges and the out-patient services. The most that would be saved by that was about £500,000 because the cost of collecting these services was 50 per cent.  Therefore, we got £5 million out of that.  I said it was a trick.  Deputy Tully, my colleague in Government now, said it was a sham.  We all thought it was a trick.  It was a subtle form of taxation and I still think it is. I should like to see a much more realistic and broader approach to this whole question of the health services. I should like to have seen that £3 million borne by the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Chair for allowing me 12 minutes.  I thought I had about eight or nine only.</P>
      <P>When speaking last week I was dealing with the prospect of unemployment. As will have been seen over the weekend, about 70 workers were made redundant.  Therefore, it can be taken that the position is deteriorating.  In his speech last week the Minister went out of his way to say that neither Dublin nor London had anything to do with the matter at all; it was all decided in Brussels, Luxembourg, or some such place.  He went on to point out the regulations prohibiting him from doing anything to alleviate the situation.  The Minister then accused us of being responsible for having brought about this situation because of our entry into the EEC.  On the eve of his departure for the summit meeting in Paris, the Taoiseach, as reported in the Press, stated: &ldquo;If England were to withdraw from the EEC, we would stay in.&rdquo;  He must have had the approval of the Government to make a statement of that nature, a Government of which the Minister is a member.</P>
      <P>I am really worried now as to whether the Minister is in earnest about doing what he can to help the boot and shoe industry workers in the serious situation in which they find themselves.  I want to refer to the tanneries.  When the Minister went back to his Department at the weekend did he examine the possibility of doing anything to ensure that we could carry out all processing here?  We should have tackled this matter before now.  We will have to tackle it sooner or later.  The advisers in the business should have come up with that suggestion, but they did not do so.  I am not laying all of the blame on the Minister, because I like to be as constructive as is possible in my arguments.  I am not a person who lays blame here, there and everywhere. But I stress that something along those lines should have been done, possibly years ago, but certainly something must be done immediately. I would strongly urge the Minister to have his advisers investigate the possibility of doing something forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> Finance should be found for these very important footwear projects, manufacturing and so on.  This is an industry which has been built up over the years.  As I was explaining the last evening, it is an industry in which, when workers are made redundant&mdash; some of them, perhaps 30 years in the business&mdash;they cannot easily adjust to employment elsewhere.  AnCO may come up with a training course or something else, but when a man reaches 50 years of age or, I would go so far as saying, over 40 years of age, he has got into a routine which is very hard to break; he is beyond the crossroads.  This is the situation facing many such workers at present.</P>
    <P>I think also of the statement made a few weeks ago by the Minister to the students of Bolton Street College when he went there to confer degrees or issue certificates.  The Minister ended up by advising the students to keep demonstrating and causing trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, Sir, I was merely quoting what the report said. I am really worried now as to whether the Minister, his Department or the Government have anything in mind. There is, I believe, a task force in the country at present.  I know all these people fairly well.  They will move around a tremendous amount, speak to an enormous number of people, write many reports which, I presume, will have to be sent to Brussels.  We are approaching the Christmas vacation and, between one thing and another, I am of the opinion now that <Col N="1526" /> this task will continue well into the New Year.  But we are faced with the problem that if they do not come up with anything, the Minister's Department must have plans ready to be put into operation to salvage the position &mdash;and I mean &ldquo;Salvage&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With regard to the design aspect, I do not want anybody to think that we have not got designers of adequate calibre.  We have top designers.  One of them in my own area won the shoe design award, as I stated the last evening.  That will not stand up as a gimmick to be put across in order to profiteer at the expense of others, workers or the public at large.</P>
      <P>I should like to know whether the Minister would meet the union representatives, the workers, the manufacturers and, above all, top traders here. I shall lay blame on some of those top traders who have not been pulling their weight.  There is no doubt about that.  They could have patronised our shoe and boot industry, boosted sales more than they have done.  They cannot get away with merely saying that this, that or the other does not suit.  They may say that they are in the business for profit and perhaps the margin of profit is higher on the foreign-made shoes than on those manufactured at home.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister said he was about to launch a Buy Irish campaign. I am wondering why, when the Minister became aware of the serious situation not only in regard to the shoe industry but in other industries such as textiles, he did not launch such a campaign then rather than do so now on the eve of Christmas.  It would have been more appropriate to have launched this campaign three or four months ago.  I might add that it was not until the other day that the unions woke up and realised the extent to which workers are losing their jobs. This situation is bad enough but to add fuel to the flames the workers must now bear a 15p increase on the gallon of petrol.  This increase has been imposed at a time when many people are on shortened working weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the task force referred to by the Minister, can he say if it <Col N="1527" /> will be possible for these people to make recommendations?  Any recommendations they might make and which would be of help to the industry should result in contingency plans being put into operation immediately. Perhaps, too, the IDA could help by way of grants to bolster up the industry and tide it over this difficult time.</P>
    <P>Regarding some new industries being set up here by people from outside I would make the point that these have yet to prove themselves.  It is alarming to note that the cost of providing a job in an industry is between £900 and £1,100.  It is my belief that we have the right management in our shoe factories and we know that we have good workers.  Therefore, if the Government give the lead by way of financial support, I am optimistic that the industry will weather the storm but success or failure depends on the Minister and on the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  As a member of a family who have been associated with the shoe industry for many years and with one of the oldest factories in the country, it would be remiss of me to let the opportunity pass without saying a few words regarding the present situation in the industry.</P>
      <P>Let me say first that all of us know that the shoe industry has been experiencing what we might refer to mildly as a difficult stage.  In the House last week the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to a task force from the EEC coming here on a fact-finding mission.  I am informed that six people visited this country in this regard on Sunday last when they met with representatives of the trade unions, of the manufacturers and with officials of the Department.  I understand that, having heard from all sides concerned, they are to report back in due course.  The Minister deserves credit for his efforts in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to our accession to the Community we were all made aware that, in the event of membership of the EEC, the protective tariffs that had <Col N="1528" /> rightly been given to the shoe industry down through the years, would be phased out.  I am satisfied that the Irish manufacturers have played their part in keeping the industry alive and that the goods produced were comparable with, if not better than, anything that was imported.</P>
    <P>From the figures available to me I understand that the lowest rate of duty on footwear is that in respect of importations from Britain which is 10 per cent but that this will be reduced to five per cent from 1st July, 1975, and will be phased out completely as and from 1st July, 1976.  The duty in respect of imports from the other EEC countries is 32 per cent and that, too, is to be phased out by 1st July, 1976.  I am convinced that anything the Minister can do&mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;can do&rdquo;&mdash;to help the footwear industry will be done by him but he has a problem in so far as the EEC regulations are concerned.  It is hardly likely that he will be able to get any extension of the phasing out dates.  I am sure that the manufacturers heeded the warnings that were given to them in regard to the situation in EEC conditions.</P>
    <P>According to my figures, there are 34 factories in operation which employ 4,600 workers.  While the picture may seem depressing, it is no harm to strike a note of encouragement, and I am happy to see from the figures that in my own constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, in which there are two factories, Carlow Shoes employ about 40 people, and there have been no redundancies in the past 12 months. Impact Shoes also employ about 40 workers, and again there have been no redundancies in the past 12 months. and I hope that will continue.  In Kilkenny there is the firm of Padmore and Barnes.  I have no figures for the numbers employed but I congratulate them as I do the two factories in Carlow on doing quite well.  The success of these three factories is due to the design of the articles they produce and the value they give for money.  Today we are all more priceconscious than ever.  While, in order to capture the market you must produce goods at a reasonable price, it <Col N="1529" /> is very important that the goods which are produced are of good quality.  In saying that I am not being critical of any Irish manufacturer.  We can hold our own with any other country.</P>
    <P>However, I want to refer to a point made by the previous speaker and with whom, perhaps for once, I thoroughly agree; and if he had not said it I intended to say it.  I do not believe&mdash;and it may not be a popular thing to say&mdash;that the Irish manufacturers of footwear are getting a fair deal from certain retailers or wholesalers. At a function I attended last Sunday night&mdash;admittedly it was a political function&mdash;I finished my speech by appealing to the public to buy Irish goods.  During the festive season people give presents and spend a little more money than usual.  People should be asked to ensure that, when they go into a footwear shop&mdash;perhaps I would be straying from this measure before the House if I mentioned any other goods, but I include the lot&mdash; they are supplied with Irish footwear in order to protect the jobs of the people engaged in this industry and to protect the economy.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing to note that imports of footwear, broadly speaking, amount to between 45 and 63 per cent this year.  I am not sure how this can be controlled now that we are one of the nine members of the EEC.  I understand restriction of imports may only take place under Article 135 of the Act of Accession to the EEC, and this would have to be approved by the member countries of the EEC.  I am not certain as to what the position of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or whoever would be dealing with this, is in this connection, but I would appeal to the Minister to use his influence if it is possible for him to do something in the matter.</P>
    <P>While I have, I suppose, been critical of certain wholesalers and retailers, I am not picking out any particular wholesaler or retailer.  I am speaking generally and I have no evidence of anybody in particular being guilty of giving preference to imported goods in the footwear trade. Judging by the percentage figures I have already given somebody must <Col N="1530" /> be at fault somewhere.  There is an old saying, and a very true one, that no man is a prophet in his own country.  I remember a certain shoe manufacturing firm which was founded about 1904.  The person who started that industry&mdash;and I will not mention his name&mdash;had to open a retail shop in his own town because the local traders would not sell his goods.  I am afraid that is happening in the footwear industry throughout the country today.</P>
    <P>There have been exceptional circumstances over the past 12 months.  I believe there was a certain amount of over-buying by manufacturers and the retail trade.  Some of this was due to the expectation of rising prices and increases in the cost of raw materials. Petrol prices have also risen.  As we all know, petrol has a certain amount to do with plastics which are also used in the footwear industry.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city unfortunately we had the bus strike and the bombs. They must have affected shoe shops in the city.  Some of the main streets were deserted for a long time.  I often wonder how the retailers survived because that must have had a certain effect on business.</P>
    <P>I also understand that during the first six months of this year imports of footwear from the United Kingdom were in the region of 75 per cent and 14 per cent came from other EEC countries.  There is a potential danger &mdash;and I am not quite certain if the Minister is empowered to do anything about it&mdash;of imports of footwear from lower cost countries outside the EEC. Perhaps the Minister might give information on this point, if it is available.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce received a submission made on behalf of the Irish Shoe and Leather Workers' Union, the Workers' Union of Ireland and the Irish footwear manufacturers. I am sure all interested Deputies have read this document.  I should like to put on record a paragraph which is of interest:</P>
    <P>The retail trade in Ireland, in common with all other sectors, have had to face greatly increased costs this year.  As they are able to buy <Col N="1531" /> imported shoes much cheaper than their direct equivalent of Irish made shoes, they are able to get a much higher profit mark-up on these shoes.  For this reason, more and more retailers are turning towards purchasing imports rather than home produced shoes.</P>
    <P>I take it that this is a true statement as it comes from the people concerned. In the footwear industry and the retail trade there is a certain mark-up profit on all shoes.  I have not bought a pair of shoes recently but I think the retail price is on the sole. I know a little about this industry and I am aware that there is a bigger mark-up on ladies' shoes as against gent's shoes.  This is quite fair because men's fashions do not change very much while the women's fashions change quickly.  I can understand that an additional mark-up is necessary for any retailer.  He may buy a line of ladies' fashon shoes, say one dozen pairs, and he could be left with five or seven pairs which he might have to sell under cost.  Last week I had a discussion on prices and the cost of living with a friend.  I said that we could freeze prices at the expense of jobs and he said: &ldquo;Why not let the Minister for Industry and Commerce ask the retail trade what mark-up they need&rdquo;?  He could agree with them on a fair mark-up.  This person said to me that there were shoes being imported into this country which were being bought at £3 per pair and sold at over £12 per pair.  I do not know how true that is.  His argument that the same mark-up should apply to gent's shoes even if they are imported was valid.  It shocked me to hear that if a certain fashion shoe was imported at a low price a high price could be obtained for it.</P>
    <P>We might appeal to people to buy Irish but there are certain people who have no pride in their own country. There are people who feel that because something is imported and was not manufactured by Irish labour it is 100 per cent better than the article produced in Ireland.  I do not agree with them.  When I am buying anything I make a habit of asking if it is <Col N="1532" /> Irish manufactured.  If everybody did this, we would have less unemployment and not alone in the footwear industry.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the work he is doing.  Every time prices are increased people blame him.</P>

      <P>We are all aware that increased prices are recommended by the Prices Commission and the Minister then sanctions them.  I have often looked through the list and noted that many of the increases recommended are not granted.  I appeal to people, not alone during this festive season, but every time they are buying footwear, to ask for Irish manufactured goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies tabled this motion was to bring the serious position of the footwear industry not alone to the attention of the House, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government but also to impress on the general public, the importers and the supermarkets how necessary it is that Irish goods are supported.  Since the motion was put down I believe some supermarkets have had a rethink regarding their orders for home-produced footwear.</P>
      <P>I suppose some women wonder at us asking them to buy Irish manufactured footwear.  Many of them who work on restricted budgets would prefer to buy imported footwear if they can get them at a cheaper price. On the last occasion a Deputy speaking on this motion stated that imported children's sandals were sold at 40p per pair.  This price is very attractive to people with large families and very little money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take action fairly quickly.  I asked him a question recently about what action he proposed to take to control the importation of footwear from countries outside the EEC.  He came into the House without the actual percentage of footwear imported.  I gave a figure which the Minister did not accept.  He was <Col N="1533" /> asked to receive a delegation from Stedfast Shoes Limited in Carrickmacross. The reply I received on 29th October from the Minister's office stated:</P>
    <P>I am desired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your representations on behalf of employees of Stedfast Shoes Ltd., Carrickmacross, regarding difficulties being experienced arising out of imports of footwear from countries outside the EEC.  I regret that, due to an extremely heavy schedule of commitments, the Minister is unable to receive a deputation at the present time.  Senior officers of the Department will, however, be available, if so desired, to meet representatives of the Stedfast workers.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister should have met the deputation and discussed the worker's problems.  There are between 4,000 and 5,000 people employed in the footwear industry in County Monaghan and in the town of Monaghan there are about 500 employed in it.  The footwear committee of the National Federation of Drapers and Allied Traders requested a meeting with the Minister after talking to the footwear manufacturers. He seemed to have the same problem in regard to them.  I do not believe any of these deputations would have suggested something outrageous.  I should like to give a quotation from <i>The Irish Press</i> of 28th November.  It relates to this matter and states:</P>
    <P>The National Federation of Drapers and Allied Traders, Footwear Committee, has expressed concern at the apparent increase in low-cost dumping of footwear.... The statement suggests some form of limitation on footwear imports from low-cost countries, as the committee is disappointed with the Government's failure to tackle the problem.  As a protective measure against dumping a minimum price ceiling on imported footwear&mdash;other than canvas footwear, wellingtons, slippers and sandals&mdash;of £2 per pair is recommended.  Since 80 per cent of footwear imports are of British origin, retention of the 10 per cent <Col N="1534" /> duty on British footwear, to be abolished next July, is recommended. This should be in the form of a levy, with 50 per cent used to finance the industry, the remaining 50 per cent devoted to an intensive advertising campaign to promote the sale of footwear.  The Committee strongly recommend that all Irish manufacturers stop importing and concentrate on making footwear&mdash;Irish manufacturers in the current year will have imported 1.4 million pairs.  And manufacturers should cease importing finished uppers which are at present being imported duty-free.</P>
    <P>Then there is a breakdown of the total estimated imports for the current year of 5.5 million pairs.  These are: to supermarket outlets, 2.4 million pairs; footwear manufacturers 1.4 million pairs; wholesalers, 1 million pairs and retail specialists 0.7 million pairs.</P>
    <P>That tells much of the story where you have footwear manufacturers importing to the tune of 1.4 million and supermarkets are distributing 2.4 million pairs.  Seemingly, the retail specialists have only 0.7 million pairs, so that the portion of the entire market they have appears to be very small.  If customers would insist on getting home produced shoes the situation would be very different.  It is not so many years ago that we ourselves were a low-cost country, low-cost in wages.  That changed in time and I think credit is due to the Fianna Fáil Party, largely through the initiative and foresight of the late Seán Lemass, in setting up those industries in my area in the thirties at Mullanmills and Carrickmacross.  It would be a great tragedy if the present Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not do all in their power to save those industries.  It would be equally tragic if purchasers of footwear did not insist on getting the home-produced article and if the distributors and footwear specialists and importers tried to make a quick shilling.</P>
    <P>We have had experience of this before.  While shoes are coming in at a dumped price at present, probably in a few years the low-cost countries <Col N="1535" /> producing them will have their labour forces organised and getting conditions now existing here.  You will then have the situation of very expensive footwear being imported but the factories and the skilled workers in them would no longer be here to provide shoes for the home market.</P>
    <P>It has been a popular pastime of members of this Government to blame Brussels all the time, not only in this House but outside it.  In my own constituency a politician recently laid all the blame on Brussels.  He even suggested to the Monaghan farmers that they make a protest in England to the British Government.  This seems to be the theme.  It appears as if there were never problems here before.  In all the years when the industry was in its infancy here, from the thirties onwards, we were a small nation with very little resources and most of the raw material had to be imported and those problems must have existed always.  But at that time the problems were tackled and if a remedy was possible it was applied.  At present, the blame is laid on Brussels.  We must take issue with those who blame Brussels for all our ills.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker seemed to imply that, if there was short-time and redundancy in the shoe trade, that was not the case in his area.  He mentioned the workers in factories, a small number admittedly, who never went on short-time and he seemed to infer this was because they probably had superior designs and had given better value.  I should like to blast that right away.  The shoe manufacturers in my constituency have been in the business for both the home market and for export for the last 40 years.  If they had not been well up in regard to design and management and the other necessary factors of a successful industry they could not have survived until now.  That was not a valid point.</P>
    <P>To have manufacturers importing footwear is a serious matter and one that the Minister should take up with them since it involves 1.4 million pairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had a seven-point <Col N="1536" /> proposal submitted to him by the trade unions to deal with the present crisis.  The Minister spoke the other night at great length in replying to Deputy Faulkner and referred to the legality and otherwise of imposing restrictions on imports.  He said that under the provisions of the Treaty and the Act of Accession we are precluded from imposing new financial burdens on imports either from EEC or other countries.  If he had answered the seven points in the trade union submission and if he had clarified those, he would have done better.  I believe that in regard to dumping he can invoke certain regulations.  Shoes coming into the country at 40p per pair would certainly indicate dumping because that seems to be a price at which it probably would be impossible to manufacture them.</P>
    <P>To come back to the trade union submission, it says:</P>
    <P>Please find enclosed a copy of the submission made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on Friday last, 15th November, on behalf of the 5,000 workers in the footwear industry.  In particular, I wish to draw your attention to Items 1 and 2 of our seven-point plan, and my colleagues and I are satisfied that immediate action is required on those points if our industry is to survive.</P>
    <P>One of the points is that all imports of footwear from outside the EEC should stop.  Admittedly, the Minister covered this in his reply but he did not say if dumping is occurring, taking into account the prices of the shoes.  We ask him to have another look at point No. 1 in this plan.</P>
    <P>Point No. 2 suggests that imports from inside the EEC should be limited to an annual amount equal to the export from Ireland in the preceding year.  The submission continues in regard to that point:</P>
    <P>In the context of 1975, we would expect that the export figure would be taken from 1973, i.e. 3.1 million pairs.  We would ask that there be no further reduction in the existing tariff levels between ourselves <Col N="1537" /> and the UK and the other countries of the EEC.</P>
    <P>No. 4 of the submission suggests that VAT be levied at the point of entry on all imports of completed shoes. This is a point at issue not alone in the shoe industry but in furniture and other imported articles.  It seems to be very unfair that VAT is levied at point of sale for home produced articles and that large importers, distributors and wholesalers are left in a position that their stocks would be eight or nine months in the country, VAT not having been levied at the point of import.  Point No. 5 of the submission suggests that an import deposit scheme be introduced on a temporary basis.  It continues:</P>
    <P>We propose that the figure of 25 per cent, similar to Italy, be used. The Minister spoke on that point and said that the economy generally in Italy had been at crisis point and that they took measures to remedy it.  The footwear industry here is at crisis point and it should not be necessary to wait for the country's entire economy to collapse in order to introduce these aids to a particular industry in trouble.</P>
    <P>The Irish footwear industry needs every possible aid from national and the EEC levels.  The Minister said that a task force had been invited here. He did not tell us when they were invited. It should have been done eight months ago when the footwear workers first went on short-time.  I hope the findings of this task force will be issued soon and that they will be favourable to the industry.  The situation in that industry was allowed to drift and the workers did not protest at the first sign of lay-offs.  It took them a few weeks to make their feelings known in a dignified way. They are reasonable people.  It is work they want, not dole.  In their march, they were led by the Carrickmacross band and they paraded in a dignified protest.</P>
    <P>This would not have happened had the Minister met them at the beginning. At that time the difficulties might have been ironed out.  There are about 500 workers in the shoe industry in Monaghan made up of two <Col N="1538" /> very large factories at Carrickmacross, a small factory in Castleblayney, a small factory in Glasslough and a large factory in Mullan, near Emyvale. The factory at Mullanmill is a good example of a rural based industry. It was established in the 1930s and has become part of the rural scene there.  Small farmers' sons have found steady work there and have built their homes there with the aid of Government loans and grants.  Because of the steady nature of their work many of them are repaying housing loans.</P>
    <P>Now they find themselves not alone losing their jobs and their homes breaking up but the entire community is in danger of breaking up.  The ideal situation in a rural area is that workers can continue to work and live there.  In County Monaghan working in the shoe industry has become a family tradition.  The loss of jobs is serious not only in that county but in Cavan as well where a large number of workers are engaged in shoe manufacture. There is no alternative employment in those areas and, therefore, the loss of jobs affects everybody there much more than in larger centres.</P>
    <P>Those people feel that the Department and the Minister are not doing sufficient not only to safeguard the existing factories but to establish new factories to absorb the work force available due to the falling-off in the incomes of small farmers.  We believe that it is a matter of urgency for them to provide not alone for the continuation of existing jobs but many more jobs and I would ask the Minister to consider very closely these submissions from the unions.  They have claimed, following this very orderly and mild protest, that they will go further in time to come and probably interfere with and block the marketing of imported footwear. None of us will stand up and say that we should completely clamp down on imports but we should impress on the people the importance of this situation and should take the measures that must be available to ensure that our own-produced article gets a fair crack of the whip.  In recent times various Ministers have been claiming that we on this side are not facing up <Col N="1539" /> to the world economic situation, that we are asking the Government to correct situations over which the Government have no control.  I would not complain about a situation if there were not workable proposals for its correction, and I believe that there is sufficient written into this Act of Accession to ensure that our industries are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>One of the annoying points of the Minister's contribution was his statement that there was a certain irony two years ago in the demands from the Opposition benches that the Government break the rules which that Opposition at the time negotiated and brainwashed the people into accepting very lightheartedly without understanding the dangerous ramifications involved.  That was a very unfair statement by the Minister because he has to realise that it was the overwhelming wish of the people that we enter the EEC and we have had proof positive recently, even with what has happened in regard to imports, that we are still better in the EEC.  We had a colleague of the Minister, Deputy Thornley, saying last week that our only hope is to stay in and we also had the Taoiseach before going to Brussels saying it.  The Minister should not have said that we brainwashed the people.  We put our case and went on platforms and the people overwhelmingly accepted our word.  The Minister was speaking only for half of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I have less than a minute to state the case I want to state, but if the purpose of the motion is to bring home to the consumers, the people who spend the money buying shoes, the necessity, above all at this point in time, to buy Irish and particularly Irish shoes, the motion may have served some purpose but unfortunately the wording of the motion is one of condemnation of the Government, and in particular, of the Minister for his lack of action in the direction of protecting the boot and shoe industry.  In his statement last week, the Minister did outline the problems confronting him in dealing with this matter, problems that were not of his or the Government's making but problems of the previous Government's making.</P>
      <P>When the mover of the motion referred to the alleged criminal inactivity on the Minister's part in this matter, I think we also are entitled to accuse the Fianna Fáil Party of criminal inactivity in explaining to people the full consequences of accession to the EEC and the full terms they had negotiated on behalf of the people, because I am sure Deputies from the constituencies involved, be they Louth, Cavan or Monaghan, did not explain to the workers in the industry in those constituencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Since this debate began last week, 60 more workers have lost their employment in the footwear <Col N="1541" /> industry.  This is a further indication, if that were necessary, of the very serious situation in which this industry finds itself.  The most significant and equally the most frightening aspect of the Minister's speech was his fatalistic approach to the problems of the industry. His attitude was that while he recognised there were problems, there was nothing that he could do, that decisions were made in Brussels and that was that.  This is an attitude which permeates Government thinking generally and it is frightening because it creates a frame of mind within the Government that is more concerned with thinking up excuses for inaction than taking positive action.</P>
      <P>We are constantly being told by the Government, for example, that price increases are due to outside influences over which they have no control and so no positive action is taken to control prices and prices continue to escalate.  We are told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he is powerless to take decisions to reduce the volume of imports from low-cost countries through the EEC or from outside the EEC and so millions of pairs of cheap footwear continue to flood the Irish market with impunity, throwing hundreds of workers out of employment and nothing is done about it because the Minister has already decided he can do nothing.</P>
      <P>The Minister today spoke of the serious consequences, both economic and social, which would result from unilateral action in relation to imports but what of the consequences resulting from the collapse of an industry emplaying 5,000 workers?  We have to take a balanced view in this matter. It is obvious from the Minister's speech that he decided that the best way to defend his inactivity was to attack Fianna Fáil and to ignore the real issue.  He claimed that Fianna Fáil were responsible for Ireland's decision to enter the Common Market, carefully neglecting to refer to the active participation of the senior partner in the Coalition, Fine Gael, in the campaign for entry and further claimed that he and his party alone had warned of the dangers to the footwear industry, should Ireland enter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course Fianna Fáil advocated entry into the EEC but to suggest that no warning was given by this party as to the effect of entry into the EEC is nonsense. We recognised that our entry into the EEC would mean an increased share of the home market for imports but equally we knew that the reduction in the tariff walls of the original six member countries would be the incentive needed to develop our footwear exports and to expand employment in the industry.</P>
      <P>The share of the home market held by home produced footwear fell from 81 per cent in 1970 to 65 per cent in 1971, a fall of 16 per cent, and by 1972 it had fallen to 56 per cent, a further fall of 9 per cent and we were not a member of the Common Market during that period.</P>
      <P>Had the economic climate in the footwear industry remained good since we entered the EEC much of the problems we are now experiencing would not have arisen.  Is it possible for any rational individual to visualise a prosperous, outward-looking, developing footwear industry giving large and constant employment existing within the confines of a 26 County market while barred by high-level tariffs from entry into Britain and to the other countries of the Common Market?  This would have been the position if we had not entered the EEC.  In such circumstances we would still be a prey to cheap footwear from low cost countries unless we were prepared to stop all imports and to live in a completely isolated situation because, as I pointed out in my opening speech and as the Minister very well knows, tariff protection is of no assistance against the importation of goods from low cost countries or from countries where exports are heavily subsidised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me further point out that this very week the Taoiseach stated that we would remain a member of the Common Market whether Britain left it or remained in it.  I would like <Col N="1543" /> to ask the Minister if this was a Government decision and, if it was, did he protest against it?  If the Minister&mdash;and I would include the Deputies on the other side of the House who referred to our activity in relation to entry to the EEC&mdash;had succeeded in his campaign against entry to the EEC our footwear industry would be confined to the 26-County market deluged by low-cost footwear and having no exports.</P>

      <P>A free flow of trade in fair trading conditions&mdash;and I want to emphasise fair trading conditions&mdash; stimulates an industry by ensuring that quality, design, and price are right. Our prospects on entering the EEC were vitiated by abnormal economic conditions but the prospects are still there and it is most important to be prepared to avail of them when the time is opportune.  Production must be rationalised and, as I said in opening the debate, we have the skill and the ability to do just that.  None of the other countries in the EEC is so dependent on the footwear industry as we are.  Indeed, many of them would <Col N="1544" /> prefer their footwear workers to engage in heavier industries.  This makes Ireland an attractive place for the establishment of new footwear industries now that the tariff walls in the Common Market against our goods are practically gone.  There is in my view a bright future for the industry provided always&mdash;and I want to stress this&mdash;that it gets a breathing space now in its present extremely difficult condition.</P>
      <P>Let me again emphasise that it would be impossible to develop an export trade in this industry without having a firm base in the home market. If low-cost goods continue to flood the home market, if the share of the market for Irish products continues to be eroded, we will end up with no industry at all.</P>
      <P>I read an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 6th December by Peter Kenyon reporting from Brussels.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Protective measures against imports of footwear and possibly textiles and clothing are being actively considered by Mr. Keating, Minister for Industry and Commerce, following exploratory talks earlier this week in Brussels.</P>
      <P>Is not this an appalling piece of news? Here we have a Minister who has been informed of the critical state of the footwear industry by management, by unions and by Deputies on this side of the House for months on end waiting until the industry is in a state of near collapse before even beginning to have exploratory talks, never mind making decisions.  Yet the Minister had the nerve to complain when I charged him with masterly inactivity.  The only conclusion I can come to is that the Minister is hypnotised by bureaucratic rules and regulations to the extent that it took a Private Member's Motion in the House and a protest parade by the footwear workers to get him to move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech on the previous day, after quite a considerable build-up, he informed us that a Commission task force is coming here from Brussels this week to investigate among other things the footwear industry.  I should like to ask him as I asked him already today how long it will take this task force to reach a decision.  Unless it acts very <Col N="1545" /> promptly it will be too late.  Surely a long investigation is unnecessary? The small size of the home market is well known.  The enormous import figure, 5.6 million pairs of footwear, is also well known.  To the workers and the management in the footwear industry who are expecting positive action by the Minister or by the EEC the Minister's announcement of a working group from the EEC to investigate conditions came as a complete anti-climax as it did to the Members on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Let me move a step further, as I did during the course of questions today.  Suppose that the task force from the EEC decide that we have no grounds for complaint.  Suppose they point to the few factories which for a variety of reasons are doing well and suggest that it is better to keep the Common Market rules intact than to save factories in serious difficulties, what would the Minister's reaction be? I asked him today if he had any contingency plans prepared and he told me that he had not.  Will he revert to his stand that he can do nothing, that the rules are made in Brussels and that he is powerless?</P>
    <P>I pointed out that I would be slow to break the rules.  I recognise that it is not in the interests of small countries such as this, highly dependent on exports, to have rules changed except by negotiation.  I pointed out, however, that if discussions and negotiations failed we would have to consider what further action was open to us to prevent at this critical time the collapse of the footwear industry which is vital to the Irish economy <Col N="1546" /> and which can develop and prosper in the future.</P>
    <P>There are articles in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and in the Rome Treaty which give some scope to the Minister.  He should have concerned himself with these articles and should have taken whatever initiative was available to him.  We again ask that the industry be given a breathing space, that its position in the home market be improved by curtailing imports from low-cost countries and by encouraging, by the most modern methods available, our people to buy Irish.  We are saying to the people that the situation is now critical, that in their own interests and in their children's and friends' interests and in the national interest they should buy Irish at the present time.  We are calling on the retailer not only to stock Irish goods but to present and to display them to the best advantage.  In this way we can ensure the building of a bright future for the industry, that the development of the industry can begin at once and that the workers' future will be secure.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have failed this great Irish industry by their indecision, by their failure to act positively.  This is especially underlined by the Minister's last-minute trip to Brussels on the eve of the debate. The debate, therefore, has been useful in that it has achieved some action but this is not enough.  Plans should be drawn up immediately to deal with the situation that will arise should the discussions fail.  The employment of our footwear workers must be safeguarded in these very difficult times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is the continuation of the legislation which provides for relief of rates on agricultural land by way of the agricultural grant; existing legislation is due to expire on 31st December 1974. This grant is paid by the Exchequer to county councils to enable them to give abatement of rates to occupiers of agricultural land.  In the coming financial year more than £30 million will be paid over from the Echequer to county councils by means of the agricultural grant to reduce the rates burden on the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the Bill is to provide for the continued payment of the agricultural grant on its present basis for the year ending 31st December, 1975, thereby providing for the continuation of the existing allowances. In the case of land holdings the valuation <Col N="1549" /> of which does not exceed £20 the primary allowance relieves 100 per cent of the general rate; this allowance effectively derates 77 per cent of all rated holdings of agricultural land.  In the case of holdings between £20 and £33 valuation the primary allowance relieves 100 per cent of the rates on the first £20 of the land valuation and the rated occupier is liable for rates on the remainder only.  Land holdings with valuations in excess of £33 qualify for a primary allowance of 80 per cent in respect of £20 valuation and a supplementary allowance of 30 per cent on the remainder of the valuation.  In addition to the aforementioned allowances, an employment allowance of £17 per workman is available, in appropriate cases, towards the relief of the net rates payable after deduction of the primary and supplementary allowances on holdings with land valuations over £20.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very similar to Bills which have been brought before the House on previous occasions to continue the rates relief on agricultural land.  We are happy to support the Bill in its general purpose.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I may be allowed to ask the Minister some questions which arise from the statement he has made and also from statements which the Minister made in the past.  The idea of making available an employment allowance of £17 per workman was subjected to very severe criticism when I came before the House with the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1972.  It was criticised by the members of the Labour Party as being a waste of money and it was criticised by the Fine Gael party spokesman as being too small.  They said the £17 could be increased.  Sums of £50, £38 and £40 are mentioned but, generally, the figure of £17 was ridiculed on that occasion.</P>

    <P>The Bill brought in by Fianna Fáil continuing the rates on agricultural land was for a longer period than one year and, as I understand it, this Bill is merely to continue rates relief for <Col N="1550" /> the next 12 months.  I should like to ask the Minister, therefore, why he has decided only to continue this Bill for another 12 months.  When this subject was discussed in July, 1972 there was criticism of the fact that continuing Bills were being used by the Government rather than permanent legislation to regularise the situation.</P>
    <P>To come forward with a Bill merely continuing this for another 12 months seems somewhat contradictory of the sentiments expressed then.  The principal contradiction is that the Minister, who expressed strong views against the payment of the £17 employment allowance then, has now decided to continue it and, in so deciding, I am surprised that he has not implemented the views expressed by members of the Coalition Government when they were in Opposition that the amount should be increased.  I stated then that I had an open mind.  I was inclined to agree with the arguments put forward by Deputy Tully that its discontinuance might be very little loss because it had very little effect.  I accepted there was a valid point in the arguments advanced by the Opposition spokesmen in that debate and these arguments would be kept in mind when preparing further continuing legislation.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government on 6th July, 1972, Deputy Donegan, the Minister for Defence in the present Government, said at Columns 951 and 952 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The employment allowance of £17 on the rates should be scrapped.</P>
    <P>This was a contrary view to that expressed by some of his colleagues at the time.</P>
    <P>The political line that has been taken in respect of the west of Ireland was that when holdings were derated, the people would be given an employment allowance also through the Department of Social Welfare, but there is a case for a higher employment allowance through the good areas of Ireland. Would any farmer decide to employ or not to employ a man on the basis of £17?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> That was the query posed by Deputy Donegan at that time.  Deputy Tully interjected:</P>
    <P>It is a complete waste of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Either it should be discontinued altogether or the amount of money should be increased considerably ... In relation to agricultural work anybody who suggests that £17 would be the decisive factor in employing a person, not for one week in the year but for 52 weeks, is being unrealistic. That is the reason why both Deputy Tully and I wish for a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the reasons.</P>
      <P>We have had the change of Government but we have not had the implementation of the views expressed on that occasion by two Opposition Deputies who are now members of the Government.  I would like the Minister to elaborate somewhat on his real thinking because we must accept that his real intentions are those expressed now in this Bill.  I accept that he must have considered this matter, having held those views then, and has obviously decided to come down in favour of continuing the £17 employment allowance.  This will cost the Exchequer roughly £500,000 next year, quite a substantial sum when taken in one lot.  Broken up into pieces of £17 per workman it does not really have any great impact on whether or not a man's employment will be continued or whether a man will be offered employment by a farmer.  The sum of £500,000 assumes special significance when one remembers that the Book of Estimates recently published shows a cut of 50 per cent, the equivalent of £500,000, in the amount being provided next year for local improvement schemes, very worthwhile schemes and very necessary in rural Ireland in bringing people up to a certain standard of living by providing them with decent roads to their isolated homesteads.  But this Government apparently decided to reduce the amount by half a million.</P>

      <P>The amount is significant. If the Minister sincerely held those views in 1972, would it not have been better for him to ensure that the local improvement schemes maintained their level of output at the same figure as that provided in the past of £1 million rather than cut off £500,000 off that sum?  If he was short of money, he could have found that money by adhering to his clearly expressed views in 1972.  He has let down many people in rural areas.  This is a matter we shall have to discuss on another occasion.</P>
      <P>I notice this measure provides that the employment allowance may be paid for workmen who have holdings under £20 valuation.  It did apply to holdings under £15.  Towards the end of his short introductory statement the Minister said:</P>
      <P>In addition to the aforementioned allowances an employment allowance of £17 per workman is available, in appropriate cases, towards the relief of the net rates payable after deduction of the primary and supplementary allowances on holdings with land valuations over £20.</P>
      <P>The rate has been increased to £20 obviously.  Naturally, we do not object to the Bill.  It is very similar to the one we introduced.  We would, however, like to have the benefit of the Minister's views now on the criticisms he made when he was on this side of the House.  Speaking on 4th July, 1972. when this Bill was being discussed, Deputy Tully said at column 535 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Clinton, I feel the £17 unemployment allowance is a bit of a joke, but for a different reason.  I believe there is no point in paying £17, that it is a complete waste of money and that nobody at present employs a man because he is allowed £17 off his rates ... If the Minister wants to save whatever small amount of money is involved he could do so and nobody <Col N="1553" /> would cry salt tears if they lost this £17.</P>
    <P>Later at column 536 he said:</P>
    <P>The Minister might forget about the £17 altogether.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the Coalition Government, speaking on the same day had this to say, at column 533:</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that there has been endless agitation and discussion all over the country in county councils, in the General Council of County Councils, in committees of agriculture and in the General Council of Committees of Agriculture and resolutions have been passed going back many years asking successive Ministers for Local Government to come up with a realistic figure.  It is certainly many years since the £17 figure was arrived at and if at that time it was regarded as a figure that might induce a farmer to employ an extra man it certainly would not do so now.  It is altogether unrealistic as an inducement.</P>
    <P>There is need now for some explanation for the change in thinking following on the movement from Opposition into Government.  In 1972 the Minister described this whole thing as a joke and he said the provision of £17 was a waste of money.  If those views were sincere, then the House is now due some explanation as to why the Minister is continuing the joke and the waste of money.</P>

      <P>This Bill must be viewed against the background of the farming activities which exist at the moment and against the problems created by the Government from the farmers of Ireland.  This Bill, which is similar to the Bill introduced in 1972, should indicate to the farmers that the Government are prepared to go one better or two better than the Government did in 1972, for no other reason than that the farming community are now demanding better treatment, are demanding action by the Government and are demanding that their lot, which has deteriorated drastically over the <Col N="1554" /> past 18 months, should be improved.</P>
      <P>So far, in other fields the Government have turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to their requests and their resolutions and their letters, and to all the pleadings from this side of the House that they should do something for the large number of small farmers who this year are suffering and, so far as we can see in the foreseeable future, will suffer heavy losses in their incomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I mention that, due to the cuts in the Estimates, more money is necessary through this medium?  Could I point out some of the reductions and say that the gap caused by the reductions made by the Minister in allocations to the local authorities in fields which benefit farmers could be filled to a <Col N="1556" /> certain degree by better provisions in a Bill dealing with relief of rates on agricultural land?  The Minister is not doing this.  He is not living up to his responsibility.  He is taking away money from local authorities in order to save the Exchequer.  Whether or not he has the money is a different matter.</P>
      <P>If the Minister came in here and said: &ldquo;Deputies, I cannot do better than this at this time, the kitty is bare; I have not got the wherewithal to do the things which I myself advocated in 1972; I have not got the Lsd to do them; therefore, this is the best I can do&rdquo;, we would say: &ldquo;O.K. Probably better times are coming.&rdquo; Perhaps this is why the Minister has given this Bill a life span of 12 months only, which is unusual and which is out of line with previous Bills dealing with relief of rates on agricultural land.  Perhaps it is because he is going through a rough time.  Perhaps it is because of the £27 million which the Minister for Finance got the other day.  Perhaps he told the Minister: &ldquo;This is the distance you can go because I am not giving you another &lsquo;bob&rsquo; to increase it.&rdquo;  Perhaps that is why he has not introduced a better Bill.  Fair enough&mdash;if he says that, we will say: &ldquo;Maybe you will be able to do better next year.&rdquo;  Maybe he will not be there next year and it would be better for the country if he was not there if this is the sort of trick he is to play on farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not very pleasant for a Deputy when he becomes a Minister to have to eat his own words.  That is what the Minister is doing.  He is swallowing the £17.  The farmers are demand-a lot more than that.  We say &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; to every word Deputy Molloy quoted as issuing from the mouth of the Minister when he was a Deputy in Opposition in 1972.  We say he was right.  We said so then.  We do not agree now that this Bill is sufficient. There has been a lapse of almost three years.  There has been a serious deterioration.  An SOS is going out from farming organisations for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Government to come to the rescue and the aid of farmers.  We are <Col N="1557" /> echoing that now and saying to the Minister: &ldquo;Can you not or will you not do better than this? &rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's puny effort to alleviate the rates problem has been aggravated by direct Government action since 1972.  The rate in Donegal this year is £9 in the £, the highest ever in the county, and this rate is doubly high in the farm situation which exists.</P>
    <P>This measure will be of no assistance and nobody in Donegal will thank him for his puny effort.  I am sure those sentiments will be re-echoed in every county.  It must be remembered that during the lifetime of this Bill we will have, for the first in farming history, income tax imposed over and above the burdens that there are on our farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not relevant and the Deputy must know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This aid will be of no consequence to those people who will be paying rates higher than ever before.  Such people also have another penal tax to pay.  The Minister should catch himself on and abolish this system altogether.</P>
      <P>Without great difficulty the Minister could have increased the employment allowance.  After all, the farmers cannot afford to employ as many workers as they did in 1972.  In my view the Minister could afford to double that allowance.  Such a move would not have cost him a half penny more. There will be less demand on that allowance because farm workers are joining the queue with other workers at the employment exchanges.  The queue of unemployed farm labourers is increasing daily and this queue, like that of other workers, has been created by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through this Bill the Minister had an opportunity of remedying the situation.  However, the Minister's remedy for unemployment in agriculture is not sufficient.  The allowance of £17 is exactly the same amount as that paid in 1972 when farmers had their best year.  Surely there is <Col N="1558" /> an argument for doubling, even trebling, this employment aid.  To increase this aid would not have cost the Government anything more than it cost in 1972.  By not increasing that allowance the Government are saving money.  It will cost less to administer the scheme than it did in 1972 due to the unemployment problem in the farming community which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has in part created.</P>
    <P>This is the second dirty trick within a week played on the farming community and the population in general.  The Minister for Finance added substantially to farmers' costs by increasing the price of petrol and in doing so created a greater need for assistance for farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will be of no assistance to the farming community. The Government will save money when it is introduced at the expense of the farmers in the same way as the Minister for Finance did last week.  Farmers can see, by the action of the Minister for Finance who evidently is not prepared to give another bob over and above the proposals contained in this Bill in the farm workers allowance, no ray of hope that a serious effort will be made to ease their lot and tide them over what we hope will be a temporary situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill falls far short of what I, the public, the farming community and farm workers expected but it is outstanding in one respect.  If one delves into the records of this House one will see that some of our present Ministers when in Opposition said that everything contained in this Bill should be done away with and that we should have a new Bill dealing with rates on agricultural land. At least four Ministers were of that opinion in the past.  These men had their chance to do something about this but they went back on their word. Their bluff has been called tonight. The Bill is an insult to the farming community, farmers and farm workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> When in Opposition the present Minister for Local Government was a great man to defend rural workers but when he got a chance to help them he turned his back on them. There are many things contained in this Bill which have no reference to the present situation.  The farming community expected that this Bill would contain some reference to farm tax and to show those who were caught in that net but there is no reference to farm tax in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the matter of the primary allowance which is not being granted and which, I think, should be given.  It is to this aspect that I shall relate my remarks.  That has a lot to do with the submissions made by the various farming organisations to the Government, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and, I believe, the Minister for Local Government as well.  I believe there should have been included in this Bill a complete derating of land where a man is paying income tax on that land on a valuation basis.  I believe that should have been included in this Bill and that we should be passing money for that purpose.  If a person is caught in that net the £100 valuation in any county will mean that that person will pay £500 rates, plus the farm tax levied on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rates, as such, are something that are demanded regardless of one's ability to pay.  Every Member of this House will agree that it is right and proper that whatever the taxation system we have&mdash;call it rates or anything else one likes&mdash;it should have some bearing on profits, income and on the ability of the person to pay.  I would ask the Minister to seriously reconsider that aspect.  Within the last few days there have been men coming to Dublin fighting for their cause on the land, to keep people on the land. They expected that those people caught in the tax net would be given some relief under the Bill being discussed <Col N="1560" /> here tonight.  But what they have said has fallen on deaf ears.  As far as I can ascertain, nobody will listen to them.  They can sink or swim as far as the Government are concerned because the Government do not seem to consider how these people will live.</P>
    <P>There is the example here of land under £20 valuation being derated.  It was derated last year and the year before.  God knows, it is a lot more difficult for a man with a £20 valuation, with a wife and a family, to make a living in 1974 than it has been since the days of the Famine. Have no doubt about that.  Even during the thirties in the days of the economic war when one had not much income, at least £1 would purchase something with which to feed one's animal but that is not the case today.</P>
    <P>I come now to the famous £17 per workman.  Was there ever a greater insult done than to print that in this year of 1974?  We have had decimilisation, devaluation, the green £.  Yet a Minister of an Irish Government can come in here and tell us there is going to be an employment allowance of £17 per workman available off the rates if one has a workman, or a farmer's son works on the farm.  I should like to ask the Minister one question.  There are many farmers who do not want to fill up the form to get that allowance this year for their sons at home on the land because they are afraid the Revenue Commissioners will assess that son as having an income equivalent to agricultural wages.  Will the Minister tell me whether or not that is so?  Can the Minister tell me if it can be used? Silence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very important question.  Can a man, with safety, sign in order to gain the £17 abatement in respect of his son and know that that young man will not have to pay, perhaps, four times the tax on the £17 gained by the family? Will the Minister answer that question in his reply?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister would say at least that he would answer the question but there is silence. Is that not a shocking state of affairs? We have Bill after Bill introduced here and a Minister will sit there and will not even say that he will answer a straight question.  I hope the Minister will because there are many people looking forward to the answer and I hope it will be a good one.  The sum of £17 per workman does not mean much nowadays.  If a man lived any distance at all from Dublin it would not even take him to an All-Ireland and home the same day.  Let us be fair about it.  He would not have a big day out; neither would there need to be a whiskey strike to ensure that he could exist on that £17.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly the Minister must be aware that people are leaving the land in rural areas.  That has been the case for many years, something that has happened all over the world.  People tend to move to the larger cities, to the urban areas, into what we term the brighter lights.  I cannot understand why we do not avail of this opportunity to help out the farmers. We had the experience the other day of the butter allowance disappearing under some EEC regulation dug up overnight.  It did not exist at all in the last couple of years.  It is a wonder the Minister did not dig up another to get rid of the £17 per workman abatement of rates because it is like something he would do.  Why would the Minister not increase it to almost £100 to encourage farmers to have men working on the land?  What good is £17 to a farmer with a valuation of £22 who applies for that abatement?  He might have three or four other younger children.  The maximum number of cows he could keep would be 18 or 19.  He may not be in the best of health.  Yet all he will receive in relief of rates is £17.  Not only that but the Minister certainly is aware that that man's son will not qualify for unemployment assistance because the social welfare office will decide that his maintenance <Col N="1562" /> in the house is more than the means test would allow for unemployment assistance.  Therefore, the young boy remains at home on the land. Even if the father has 20 cows he could not possibly make £1,000 net profit this year.  Yet he is supposed to support his wife, probably a son of 18 or 19 years of age and, perhaps, a couple of other younger children all of whom are supposed to live off that small holding.  But, when the winter comes, he will get from the State only £17 and he will not even qualify for unemployment assistance and, if he does apply for the £17, he is not sure that the Revenue Commissioners will not try to snatch some form of income tax from him.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be doing a good job with regard to this Bill if he placed it under his arm, brought it back to his office and brought in something new worthy of discussion here.  The Minister may smirk and smile but the day of defending the rural worker has disappeared.  The Government are being caught out in this bluff and well the people know this.  I could go on and on but the Minister knows the position with regard to farming at present.  The Minister knows how difficult it is to keep people working on the land.  It is the first time these people have been caught in the income tax net. The fact that they were not so caught in the past was an encouragement to people to work on the land.  But that day has long since vanished.  Yet the Minister comes in here and says: &ldquo;It is still £17 abatement of rates, no more, no less.  I said when in Opposition it should be done away with.&rdquo; Yet, when he becomes a Minister, he introduces the very same thing regardless of the cost of living, what has happened since or of the position obtaining in the farming community. The Minister would be doing a worthwhile job if he redrafted the Bill, having considered the submissions made to him, and gave some relief to those people caught in the farm tax net. Surely they deserve to be considered &mdash;as they have asked&mdash;and not be placed in the position of being caught in the two nets.</P>
    <P>But, if we oppose this Bill, it is <Col N="1563" /> obvious that the Minister will have a majority because the people around him will stick by him in government for as long as they can.  They do not care what happens the farming community. The Government should think over it because the consequences could be serious.  The Minister should consider raising the £17 to something worthwhile and completely exempt from rates the man caught in the farm tax net.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine my remarks mainly to the question of a rebate in respect of agricultural workers. This Bill is not going far enough in this regard.  When there is reference to agricultural workers many people think solely in terms of men employed by farmers but there are also many farmers' sons concerned.  In these days when there is much talk of women's lib, we must not forget about the many farmers' daughters who stay home and do a lot of work on the farm, especially in cases where there is no son to help.  Surely the relief should apply in respect of these people, too.  This is something that we have been taking up for years past with the county committees of agriculture. The £17 allowance is unrealistic today.</P>
      <P>Deputy Meaney raised the important question as to who can avail of this relief.  The position is that if a son is employed on off-farm work he is not taken into consideration in respect of the relief.  In order for the relief to apply in respect of a son, he must have been employed on the land for the full year in respect of which the claim is made.  This is very unfair. It precludes from the provision a boy who would find it necessary to work outside the farm for, say, six months in the year because his father's farm might not be big enough to provide him with a living for the whole year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another hardship clause is that which precludes the allowance being paid in respect of the son of a man whose valuation was less than £20. I am in favour of farmers whose valuations are more than £100 being brought within the income tax net because it is my view that such a <Col N="1564" /> person should be taxed but no one should be asked to pay two taxes.  In regard to the man whose valuation is between £20 and £50, there is relief of rates on the first £20 but if the man indulges in any off-farm employment, he will only qualify for relief of half his income tax in respect of that employment.  This Bill afforded the Minister an opportunity of increasing the £20 level in respect of rates relief.  We all know that farmers who come within the lower valuation bracket must seek off-farm employment. This is especially so at present because everybody knows that a man could not make a living on a small farm.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Molloy has said, we are not opposing the Bill.  Little as it may be, it is better than nothing.  We can expect that during the coming months there will be redundancies in so far as agricultural workers are concerned. This is a problem that would probably affect the Minister's area more than mine because there are not many farmers in my part of the country who can afford to employ labourers because of the high wages paid to these people.</P>
    <P>The £17 allowance, inadequate as it is, should apply also in respect of the daughter of a farmer.  I ask the Minister to consider this suggestion and also to consider increasing the £20 valuation to £30 for derating purposes.  This would help the person who had to seek off-farm employment and who, at present, would be paying more in tax than he had ever paid before.  Many people do not realise that the son of a farmer, be the farmer big or small, who engages in off-farm employment is entitled to relief of only half what his income tax would be otherwise.  So far as the daughters of farmers are concerned we must ensure that there is equal status for them.</P>

      <P>We have had four speakers from the other side of the House.  Deputy Molloy's comments were reasonable enough and, as usual, Deputy Callanan's comments, while a bit off the beam, were reasonable also.  The remarks of the other two Deputies made it clear that they <Col N="1565" /> did not know what they were talking about.  It is not unusual to find this happening in the House.  People make comments that are so far removed from the facts that it is difficult to comment on them at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy wanted to know why the period of this Bill should be only 12 months.  The reason is that it is an interim measure.  Legislation will be necessary in the coming year and the present allowance will be reviewed before the end of next year.  The £17 allowance will be reviewed also. Deputy Molloy is correct in saying that for a number of years I have been expressing the opinion that the £17 was a waste.  I still believe that to be so.  But there are people who believe otherwise.  In any case, this is one of the matters that will be dealt with in the coming year.  Since the official Fianna Fáil view seems to be that the allowances should be abolished, I would be prepared to do what I could in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the point of view put forward by Deputy Molloy. On July 4, 1972, he said, as reported at column 546, Volume 262 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I would be inclined to lean towards Deputy Tully's argument in that field.</P>
      <P>He said also, as reported at the same column:</P>
      <P>... The fact is that the level of £17 was originally intended to act as a stimulus to farmers to employ agricultural workers or to keep them in employment.  The validity of that is very much in doubt now.</P>
      <P>That was fair comment.  The Deputy is now in the same position as I was during his days as Minister and I, now, am prepared to say what Deputy Molloy said then.  Having said that, I intend to allow the allowance to continue and I shall leave it at that. I think Deputy Molloy mixed up two sets of figures&mdash;the £15 and the £20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The £15 limit is on the valuation of a land holding which may be occupied by an agricultural employee who was covered by unemployment allowances.  I do not know in which way I should attempt to deal with Deputy Cunningham's remarks. Vulgar abuse in this House seems to have become the order of the day with everybody abusing the Minister concerned or the Chair in the hope that somewhere in the papers a line will appear saying that a certain Deputy said something sensible.  I cannot find anything sensible in Deputy Cunningham's remarks.  He refers to the rates having been increased in Donegal and he asked why something should not be done by way of relief.</P>
      <P>I would point out that 77 per cent of all holdings of land in the country as a whole are of less than £20 valuation. These holdings are all derated. So far as Donegal is concerned 91 per cent of holdings are of less than £20 valuation.  Therefore we are talking about the other 9 per cent.  They are partially derated and there are a few big ranches.  If Deputy Cunningham wants to cry about the poor farmers with the big areas of land who are not getting the rates devaluation he hoped they would get, and because they may have to pay income tax or whatever the rates are, while everybody who is employed in any other job pays his tax and his income tax, I will cry no salt tears over them.</P>
      <P>I was a little surprised that Deputy Meaney seemed to fall into that trap too.  He talked about something which is not a matter for me and which could not be included in the Bill, that is, whether or not the £100 valuation farmer should have to pay rates.</P>

      <P>If everybody in the country was allowed to decide what kind of payment he would make to the State, he would pay as little as he possibly could.  As regards the £100 farmer, by the time the various allowances which he will get are taken away, he will not be too hard done by at all.  Most certainly the farmer <Col N="1567" /> who has to pay income tax will be doing pretty well.  Like other Members of this House, I believe that anybody who is due to pay income tax should pay it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

I would not go too far along that line, because it is only petrol that is involved, and other users of the road will have to pay the full amount on it, while the farmer who is getting this rebate in his rates will not be using so much petrol except when going to Mass on a Sunday or going into the shops or into the town on Saturday night.  He has not so much to complain about.</P>

      <P>Somebody said farm workers might be inclined to leave the land.

The life blood was drained away from the land and Fianna Fáil did nothing about it.  They now talk about the danger of unemployment in agriculture. I do not believe such a danger exists, and most certainly there will be nothing like what occurred during the long years of Fianna Fáil rule.</P>

      <P>The amount being given here, the £17, is very small.  It certainly will not encourage any farmer to keep a man.  The question was asked why we should not do something about female employees, and Deputy Callanan answered the question himself.  He said the girl who stays at home does a great deal of work in the house, that she works as much as the man.  This is not an allowance for girls or women who work in a house.  This is an allowance for men <Col N="1568" /> who work on the land.  When I was on the far side of the House and before I went deeply enough into it, I also felt, as Deputy Callanan does, that there might be a case for the female agricultural worker, not the girl who works in the house, not the farmer's wife who would be at home anyway. I do not believe any allowance should be given for them.  This is for people who work on the land.</P>
      <P>Deputy Meaney also asked&mdash;and this is a matter which has nothing to do with me&mdash;whether if a man has a son who works on the land that son will have to pay income tax if the farmer applies for him as an agricultural worker.  Whilst it is not a matter for my Department but for the Department of Finance, I would say that if there is a man working on the land, whether he is a son of the house or not, and he is receiving a rate of wages that is higher than the tax free allowance made to anybody in this country, why should he not pay his share of income tax the same as anybody else?  Is there any good reason why only the man who is engaged in industrial work, only the man who has no farm and who depends on his wages, should be the only one to pay income tax?</P>

      <P>Deputy Callanan is a very decent man and usually makes very good contributions to this House, but he seemed to miss two points.  If the man is not employed full-time on the land, he is not entitled to the allowance at all, and the fact that he must certify that he has been working a full year is correct.  Why should he be allowed to work in a job somewhere else and get an allowance for working on a farm where he does not work except when he comes home in the evening perhaps to help his father doing something around the farm?

But for the fact that there was a change of Government, would Deputy Cunningham like to say what that rate would be today?  We are paying over £3 in the £ for health and housing charges.  Everyone knows that now. Deputy Cunningham is suggesting that we put extra onto the Donegal rates. In fact, we have taken over £3 in the £ off that rate.  In other words, rates would be that much higher if we were not in power.  Every farmer who pays rates would not have any remission on health and housing if Fianna Fáil were in office because they did not believe in doing that.  They talked about de-rating houses alone and said they would not include agricultural land.  You cannot have it both ways. The simple fact is that we are subsidising the rates to this amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that legislation will be required again next year.  Either the introduction of this legislation to continue rates relief on land was forgotten until the last minute or this continuing Bill is being used as a device to maintain the position as before.  We are told that the Minister will take another hard look at the Bill prior to its being brought in next year.  In my opinion, the Minister forgot all about this Bill until the last minute, and therefore, he did not give it enough thought.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been in office since March, 1973.  There was plenty of time to have a look at this Bill, particularly when such strong views were expressed by members of the Coalition Parties when in Opposition. They expressed those views not alone about the size of the employment allowance but also about the valuation limit on farmers employed as farm labourers.  I thought that the £15 allowance had been increased to £20 but I realise I was mistaken.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not make any change in the law as it stands.  Over the years there have been continuing Bills affecting rates on agricultural lands.  In the years past, two Coalition Governments were in office and these were the only periods when no improvements were introduced in the continuing Bills.  When Fianna Fáil brought these Bills before the Dáil they made changes which were intended to improve benefits, allowances and the effectiveness of this legislation.  The last Bill which I brought before the House in 1972 increased this valuation limit for farmers who were seeking employment as agricultural labourers from £5 to £15.  That was an improvement. No improvement has been carried out in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the opinions expressed two years ago, it is disappointing that no thought has been given to this <Col N="1573" /> area.  The Minister made it clear that he is totally opposed to the spending of this £500,000.  He said the way it was being spent was a joke.  This is a very serious statement and two years have elapsed since it was made.  He tells us now that next year he will have a hard look at this and might do something about it.  We have not been inundated with that much legislation that the Minister did not have time to study this short, simple matter and make a decision on it.  It is expecting a lot from us to accept the argument that he will have a good hard look at it next year.  If he said that it had been changed under the Exchequer and Local Financial Years Act, 1974&mdash;which changed the financial year to December as against 1st April&mdash;that this had come on him suddenly and all he could do was ask us to support the Bill to keep the remissions and reliefs in operation, that he forgot all about it but would definitely try to implement some of the views expressed when he was in Opposition in next year's Bill, if he had said that those were the facts we would accept that.  It is hard to expect that this could have happened since the Minister has been in office for the past 18 months.  His supporters will be very disappointed that he is not making any contribution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify a couple of points.  Perhaps the Minister mixed up some things I said with what was said by other speakers.  My point was that this £17 should be increased and I hope he will consider doing so.  When speaking about females I was not talking about females who work in the house.  I fully appreciate that the wife should not be entitled to relief, but where there is no son and a daughter comes home and goes out to work on the farm, it is a different matter.  Whether we like it or not, it sometimes <Col N="1575" /> happens that the daughter drives tractors and works generally on the farm.  I maintain that she should be as much entitled to relief as a son. You could not give the relief where there is a son and daughter at home, but where the daughter works on the land helping her father she is as much entitled to get relief as a son.  The Minister probably thought I was referring to the housekeeping end of it.</P>
      <P>My other point was that the Minister should go up from £20, that there was nothing to be done for the £20 man because the rates are taken off him.  I am referring to the man with rates of between £20 and £50 who has off-farm employment.  He is caught at present because he gets only half his relief on income tax.  If the Minister could help by moving the £20 up to £30 or higher so that he would get 100 per cent relief it would be appreciated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the matter of £17, I am now in the same position that Deputy Molloy was in when this came up on the last occasion when he said he found it difficult to make up his mind between the point of view being put by one side of the Opposition&mdash;myself &mdash;and the other side of the Opposition &mdash;Deputy Clinton and Deputy Bruton, I think&mdash;since we seem to have different points of view.  I felt the £17 was no good; the others felt it should be increased.  Tonight we have Deputy Molloy who agrees with me that the £17 is no good and we have Deputy Callanan who says it should be increased.  We shall have to consider it.  In regard to the man who has a valuation over £20 and has a job, it is a bit much to expect that he should <Col N="1576" /> get special concessions.  If he has a job he is doing pretty well and if he is over £20 valuation and is getting the remission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1974,</P>
      <P>a copy of which order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 2nd December, 1974.</P>
      <P>The object of the draft order is to continue in force the Housing Act, 1969, for three years ending on 31st December, 1977.</P>
      <P>The Housing Act, 1969, is a temporary measure which will expire on the 31st December, 1974, unless continued by an order made by me after it has been approved by resolution by each House of the Oireachtas.  The purpose of the Act is to reduce the loss of habitable houses by providing statutory controls over their demolition or change of use.  This it does by requiring generally that the permission of the local authority must be obtained for the demolition or change of use of a habitable house. In dealing with an application for permission the local authority must have regard to the state of repair of the house and the adequacy of the supply of housing available in their area.  The authority can refuse permission or they can give it subject to conditions, either requiring the provision of alternative accommodation or the making of contributions towards the cost of providing it. Where permission is refused, or granted subject to conditions, there is a right of appeal to the Minister against the decision of the authority.</P>
      <P>The Act came into force in July, 1969, and returns received from local authorities since then indicate that it has been reasonably effective in reducing the loss of habitable houses to the housing stock.  In my view, the the effectiveness of the Act cannot be judged by these returns alone because its very existence must provide a deterrent against indiscriminate housing losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1578" /> Activity under the Act has, as one would expect, been almost entirely in the cities of Dublin and Cork.  Since it became law in July, 1969, the number of applications for permissions made to Dublin Corporation up to 30th September, 1974, was 691. Of these 424 were granted and 267 were refused.  Cork Corporation received 146 applications in the same period and of these 107 were granted and 39 were refused.  Where permission is refused, or granted subject to conditions, there is a right of appeal to the Minister against the decision of the local authority.  Up to the end of last month 313 appeals were received.  Of these 12 were invalid because they were not received within the statutory period, 58 were withdrawn, 157 were determined and 86 were under consideration.</P>
    <P>While satisfactory progress has been made in achieving the house building targets set by the Government, I consider that it is still essential to retain for a further period the controls provided by the 1969 Act.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is similar to one that came before the House in December, 1972.  The Minister's words in introducing it are almost identical with the words I used myself on that occasion.  It does not leave me very much room to find some ground on which I can differ from the Minister. I should be happy to see that he is continuing something, in the introduction of which I was involved on another occasion, as was my predecessor, who introduced the 1969 Housing Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister points out that most of the activities taking place under this order are in Dublin and Cork, and those two authorities refused permission under the 1969 Act in 306 cases.  This seems a very small number when one considers the total housing stock and the amount of building activity which took place until recent months.  Perhaps the application of the 1969 Act is not as rigid as the House desired originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" /> The Minister opened a conference at the Royal Marine Hotel this Tuesday under the title, &ldquo;Our Architectural Heritage, The Case for Caring&rdquo;.  I was a delegate to that conference from Galway County Council.  I was in full agreement with many of the views expressed at one of the lectures I attended, where the subjects were streetscapes and the part that history has played in our heritage.  Some of the speakers there very strongly made the point that many of the older houses in parts of towns throughout the country might be retained and reconstructed and possibly the Government and local authorities should be encouraged to do more of this work.</P>
    <P>The lecturers demonstrated the points they were making through slides and photographs of works carried out in other countries, particularly in Scotland.  One gentleman showed slides of what one might decide on casual observation of the photographs, were very derelict and old buildings but had some quaint character.  They may not have had any great architectural value but the fact they added character to a town must also be taken into consideration when deciding if houses should be demolished.  It could be said this is more expensive than building new houses, but in many cases it could be a cheaper form of providing houses than building new ones.</P>
    <P>The 1969 Act was introduced to ensure that habitable houses were not demolished without permission and that those seeking demolition would be obliged either to make some compensation or to provide alternative accommodation.  One could see the spirit of that Act being complied with where a developer, anxious to demolish an old house, promised to provide alternative accommodation.  This, however, was probably destroying something of great character which formed part of our architectural heritage.  This would have some meaning for the people.</P>
    <P>I am afraid most modern architecture is very stereotyped.  Most of the architects in this country must come in for some very heavy <Col N="1580" /> criticism.  There seems to be very few architects responsible for housing and public building here who have contributed anything of architectural merit.  They put up very functional buildings but they are lacking in the design and the ideas which the old architects had throughout the centuries. One has to look back to find good buildings worth viewing, buildings which have had great thought and design put into them and which are beautiful structures today.  If one was to spend an afternoon in appreciation of good architectural works in this country&mdash;this is also common throughout the world&mdash;one would not look at modern buildings. Architects are becoming very functional in outlook and are allowing their clients' limited financial resources to determine the extent of the contribution they will make and the monuments they will leave behind them.  We seem to be left with monuments of glasshouses in the office blocks and public buildings erected in our large towns and cities.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider advising local authorities to take into consideration the character of towns.  They should prohibit the demolition of old buildings which could be reconstructed.  It is very easy for a health inspector to go in and say a building is inhabitable because of the dilapidated interior condition. However if a structural engineer looked at it he could decide, that with modern construction methods, it would be possible to retain that building.  This would not interfere with the streetscape or change it in any way but add to it.</P>
    <P>The Housing Act might perhaps be applied in this area.  We have tended to use it merely as an instrument to block any reduction in the overall housing stock.  It states that if alternative accommodation is provided by the developer in a particular case he can be deemed to be making a good case for demolition.  That seems to emphasise that the sole purpose of the Act is to maintain the housing stock. I believe we should raise our sights a little above that and see if we could retain the structure of our existing <Col N="1581" /> towns, our streets and the individualism which different areas have.  Many people find this very attractive.  The people of Galway regard it as an old town, rather quaint, with beautiful old buildings, although much of its quaintness and attractiveness does not come from the beautiful buildings but from the character created by the old streets and old forms of construction. Some of these are not beautiful but when they are combined together they present a pleasant visual image to those who pass by.  This Act is the instrument under which the local authorities can ensure that such buildings are not demolished in the future.</P>
    <P>A fine of £100 or £10 a day can be imposed under this Act.  The Minister should have a look at these fines we had in the Planning Act, 1963.  He has seen some of the amendments I put down where I raised the figure to £1,000.  In many cases such a fine might not prove a deterrent.  These fines would apply only where a person has deliberately contravened the Act. A much heavier fine should be imposed on such people as it would act as a greater deterrent.</P>
    <P>Many people who want to demolish houses may have in mind a development costing up to £6 million or more.  The cost of the development outside the gates of Leinster House will probably run to £6 million.  Many of those large developers are involved in huge financial outlay.  They have their own pressures bearing down on them.  They have to pay high interest rates and their bank managers are calling for their money.  The mere threat of a fine of £500 is merely a joke, to use the Minister's words on the previous Bill we discussed tonight. I ask the Minister to give some thought to all of these fines.  It would probably involve a small Bill to amend the 1969 Act and he may think that is too much bother.  We would let such a Bill through very quickly.  I certainly hope he will accept our amendment on the Planning Bill because these fines were unrealistic from the day they were decided on.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say I had an opportunity, when bringing this Order <Col N="1582" /> before the House to mention this fact. I agreed with those who made the argument and have been of that mind since then.  The judge who decides these cases has the discretion, since the Act allows him to go to £1,000 or even £50,000, to decide what level of fine he will impose.  The maximum in the Act will not always be the maximum fine he imposes.  A high maximum could be put in those Bills.  It would probably require another Bill. We can only debate the matter now and oppose it if we do not agree with it.  I will not go that far tonight.  I accept the order but I ask the Minister to bear in mind the point I made about fines.</P>
    <P>People who do not agree with the decision of local authorities in relation to their application for demolition orders under the Housing Act, 1969, can appeal that decision to the Minister. We have had agreement in the House with regard to an independent board deciding planning appeals under the 1963 Act.  The Minister knows we have been in agreement on this for a number of years now that he has studied the files in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Dáil is adjourned for five minutes I will get it, if I have not left it in Galway.  All the Minister has to do is to ask the Department officials who are sitting beside him if decisions were made on <Col N="1583" /> that matter.  The principle agreed by the former Government that planning appeals should be decided by a board completely independent of the Minister and the Department of Local Government should also apply in the case of appeals against local authority decisions under the 1969 Housing Act.  There is a question of development involved.  Permission to demolish may influence the value of a site to the extent of many thousands of pounds.  If we agree with the principle of having an independent group removed from politics making such decisions in relation to planning, then it must also apply in relation to decisions made under the Housing Act. I am surprised that the Minister did not say today that he would also ensure that appeals under the Housing Act would be decided by an independent group of people.  If he suggests a planning board, we will consider it. It should certainly be removed from the head of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we could extend the operation of this order to cover the retention of the character of our towns and cities and to encourage our local authorities by word and financial aid. The Minister should try to make provision in his Estimate for assistance to local authorities who undertake the reconstruction of old houses.  It is easy to express the sentiment that one is in favour of reconstructing centre city areas with dwellings, bringing back the hearts of cities, but if there is not positive action to back up the words people can become very cynical of statements made by politicians.  The cost of land sites, as the Minister has mentioned in relation to the Dublin area, forms the most inhibitive factor to housing development in the heart of cities.  A very valuable contribution could be made in this area by the reconstruction of old residences which have fallen into decay and where people have their eye on them for commercial development.  The local authorities should be more strict in applying the Housing Act.  In many cases they could undertake the work and lease those dwellings, whether <Col N="1584" /> they be houses or low level flat dwellings, to local authorities for accommodation.</P>

      <P>Not really.  It has to do with whether you demolish houses.  If I am not allowed to refer to the type of people who will live in them you are being far too restrictive. This could be a major contribution in the housing drive.  One must conserve what one has and build additions to it.  If we set our targets on building new houses and ignore the existing housing stock much of what we do will be dissipated through the erosion of existing houses.  There is a responsibility to ensure the conservation of existing houses in city centres and other areas.  The power under the 1969 Act would prove of great help in this very valuable work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in supporting the motion for continuance of this order.  A very wise move was made originally, but it came rather late in the day, particularly in regard to Dublin, because prior to its introduction unauthorised demolitions were the order of the day.  Relatively good houses were demolished without any permission being necessary under the old Housing Act.  Today this city is like a pock marked city, littered with derelict sites, because we had inadequate legislation to control such demolition.</P>
      <P>Although this is a good measure I find a few defects in it.  A number of houses in this city are allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that the corporation cannot refuse permission for their demolition.  There is thus a tendency on the part of speculators to allow property to deteriorate so that they can get orders for demolition. Our legislation is inadequate to deal with such speculators.  When the houses have deteriorated and they apply for permission to demolish them, the local authority cannot reasonably refuse permission.  This is a glaring defect in the Act.  I hope some other measure can be introduced which will deal with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> A defect in this Act is that there is no necessity to publish in the papers notice of an application by a person to demolish a house.  The public are not aware of the fact that there may be an application with a local authority for permission to demolish a house.  This is an important weakness. It may be argued that permission to demolish will not be granted unless the application is accompanied by planning permission for a building. This can be argued, but I suggest that there should be a separate notice and it should be compulsory that a person contemplating demolition will publish in the papers the application he has made for such permission.</P>
    <P>I know of a case in Chapelizod at the moment of a number of really good habitable houses, houses which are in sound condition&mdash;the architect has vouched, as has the local authority architect, that these houses are in sound condition&mdash;which are the subject of an appeal by the landlord in relation to their demolition.  It can be said that it will go to the Department. However, the fear in these people's minds is that they are told the landlord may win the appeal and they are going to be removed because these houses can be removed, with the result that these people who have lived so many years in them may find themselves uprooted.  This is a great danger.  The onus is on them to put up their case, especially where houses are in a sound condition and this is the fear they have.</P>
    <P>A further point is that it can be argued that compensation may be paid to them, but I remember in Inchicore Rowntree's factory decided to take over a whole avenue of houses, about 26 houses, and they demolished them. putting an end to that avenue for the people who lived there for 40 or 50 years.  They offered a sum of £500 but some of these people were 68 years of age and the compensation was intended as a contribution towards the cost of a house.  That sum might be all right as a deposit but a person of that age cannot get a loan, not being a good security at that age.  I know one couple living there for 40 odd years and they ended up at night, he going to a hostel <Col N="1586" /> in York Street and his wife to another in Cork Street.  They said goodbye each night and he went into one hostel and she went into another.  We need to consider this compensation provision because the word does not mean an awful lot.  We may say: &ldquo;Give them money&rdquo;, but it should not be sufficient to talk in terms of doing that.  We should see that they are adequately housed.  The onus should not be left on the local authority in a case where a private landlord might decide to dispossess a person when he wants to demolish so say: &ldquo;There is some money in compensation&rdquo;, because that money today may not provide alternative accommodation.  This is something which should be borne in mind and if we are coming in with changes, we might seriously consider this matter.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to see how we might change the Act to provide that applications for demolition of houses will be published in the Press. It is available to public representatives on local authorities but it is not sufficient because the public should be kept informed.</P>

      <P>We can see now the wisdom of the action of the then Government in bringing this Bill before the House five years ago.  As a result of the experience since that time, we can in future legislation guard against some of the abuses which, despite the Act, are still operating.  As Deputy O'Connell has pointed out, one need not publicise an application to have a house demolished, nor is there a register kept of these applications. There is not the same procedure as there is in relation to planning application where the applicant has to go through a certain ritual in order to be given permission or to be refused. Recently in Dublin City Council we took action on this matter and asked that each member be notified of any application for permission to demolish or to change the use of a house, and the City Manager is doing this now. He is notifying all 45 members of any such application and we therefore have a chance to oppose an application, if we think it right to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that since the Act became law in 1969, the number <Col N="1587" /> of applications to Dublin Corporation was 691, of which 424 were granted.  It is almost five years so it is almost 100 houses a year.  As we know, there is very little private building of houses in Dublin city area and if the corporation build about 2,000 dwellings a year, one realises the serious loss that 100,000 houses a year is.  Very often permission to demolish is given as a last desperate effort by the corporation because the owners have allowed the property to deteriorate and run down and one sees often how conveniently a camp of itinerants is to be found near a house for which an application to demolish has been made, with the result that after a while the residents say: &ldquo;Do something with it; knock it down&rdquo;, because the neighbourhood is being affected first, because there is a rather ugly building and secondly, because all kinds of people are using it, and the local authority in its wisdom may well select the lesser of two evils and give permission to take the house down.  This, of course, defeats the whole purpose of the Act.</P>
    <P>There are various sections in the Act which enable a local authority to preserve houses either by carrying out repairs themselves and billing the landlord with the expense or forcing him to do them, but this procedure is very slow and I do not know if it is practical.  If you start interfering with some private landlord's property, he may well claim that you have damaged it and a local authority does not wish to become involved in that kind of litigation.  The House will agree with the extension of the Act as far as it goes.  But in the light of the experience gained in the past five years the Minister might well think about how he can make it a better Act in the future, because we are spending millions of pounds on new dwellings every year and it is just as necessary to try to conserve the existing stock of houses.  Apart from the living accommodation they provide, the whole character of the city might change by reason of wholesale demolition.</P>
    <P>I have seen parts of suburbia <Col N="1588" /> knocked almost overnight.  I saw houses in a road in Ballsbridge some time ago before the Act came in disappear at the weekend.  These were houses which in my young days were very fine stately homes but in a weekend they were demolished.  I know that cannot happen now as quickly and in fairness to the local authorities and the farmers of the Act, I must say that most local authorities will not give permission unless a planning permission has been given for the redevelopment of the site, but in between the two things happening, a house can deteriorate and apart from actual demolition there is this matter of the change of use.</P>
    <P>The Dublin 4 area which I represent is probably the most sensitive area in the city because people move in there and claim that a house is exempt from the Act and carry on a war of attrition against the local authority and local residents and in some cases succeed.  That is no reflection on the Act or on the local authority apart from the fact that the local authority has not the necessary staff to ensure that the law will be carried out.  Often a whole terrace of houses goes.  One person moves in. Packing cases appear on the front lawn.  The people next door feel that it is time to get out.  The house is vacant and obsolescence creeps along the terrace until eventually people say that it should be pulled down, that it is almost derelict.  Some very fine houses are destroyed and the character of an area is changed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure as far as possible that the conditions laid down in the Act are stringently applied to all applications.  If he is approached by a local authority for extra staff to carry out this work I hope it will be forthcoming.  It is bad economics to spend millions of pounds providing new dwellings while at the same time dwelling houses are being taken over by developers and speculators or are allowed to become obsolete by neglect on the part of the owner.  Where a preservation order is made in respect of a house because of some architectural merit we do not provide money for the owner to <Col N="1589" /> maintain it.  Perhaps we are a bit hypocritical in this respect.  We say to the owner that he must preserve the house, that it is Georgian or Edwardian, but we do not provide the necessary funds to him for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister may reply that grants are available.  It would be impossible to preserve a house on Merrion Square as a family house with a small grant.  In fact, we are encouraging wealthy speculators to acquire property from less well off people.  A special fund is required for the preservation of these houses.  This would pay dividents in many ways.  It would ensure that the housing stock would not be reduced by the deliberate action of landlords or by neglect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion.  I was surprised that it was necessary to bring such a motion before the House.  I thought that what is contained in the motion was written into the Act and that it would remain law until it was amended.</P>
      <P>There is a very serious problem in the Dublin area.  The number of applications was 691 and the number granted was 424.  That is a very high figure and reflects a great weakness. The entire position must be examined. The houses in question are habitable. They have been allowed to run down. In some cases, because of the rent restriction Act the rent was too low to allow the landlords to spend the necessary money on them.  In other cases speculators moved in and allowed the property to decay.  In some cases there was deliberate vandalising as I and Deputy Moore know. In the area that we represent people were employed to strip lead off a roof and to remove slates and to reduce the house to a shambles.  This happened over a period of time and then the corporation came in and eventually the breaking down process took place because the house was deemed to be beyond repair.  The attitude is somewhat lax.  Quicker action should be taken.  The 1969 Act should be enforced rigorously.  The persons concerned should be brought before the courts and they should be made to preserve the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> It takes a considerable time to revamp houses and to make them reasonably habitable.  The existing grants system is not adequate to meet major alterations required to put this type of house in order.  A comprehensive grants scheme for this type of house would in the long run represent a saving of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Houses are being knocked down because people have not the necessary money to make them habitable.  I am making the point that if houses are allowed to decay because of lack of money that represents a complete loss and defeats the purpose of the motion before the House.  This type of property should be made habitable. The alternative is to build outside the city.  Building is expensive.  It also means that people are taken from the city centre area even though we have a commitment to the maintenance of the population in the centre of the city.  If we are forced to knock down houses in the city progress cannot be made in the matter of populating the centre city area.</P>
      <P>I attended an oral hearing in the Custom House recently.  An order was made that a number of houses in my constituency were to be demolished. Evidence was given by engineers that the houses were old but were not obsolete.  I know the Minister's mind on this, that he is very severe in respect of appeals and if he has to grant one that it is because there is no alternative.</P>
      <P>The houses should not be allowed to get into such a state of decay.  This motion extends the privilege to 1977. In the interim we should devise a system and introduce effective legislation. There is legislation but it is not effective.  The legislation should ensure that persons who buy these houses will not be allowed to vandalise them or allow them to decay further with the result that after a period of time the Minister or the local authority has to make the inevitable decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to review <Col N="1591" /> this entire matter to ensure that it is tightened up and the necessary moneys made available to make the houses habitable.  Even if that means a complete review of our rent system we should do this.  We should bring the system up to date so that people who put money into these houses will get a fair return while ensuring that reasonable accommodation is available where people wish to live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this continuing order.  The Housing Act, 1969, was probably one of the more enlightened pieces of legislation but, as other speakers have pointed out, its operation needs to be considered again and certain amendments made in the light of the experience gained since the legislation was passed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy mentioned that under the Housing Act appeals are to the Minister for Local Government and he also referred to the new planning Bill which envisages the setting up of an appeals tribunal.  Obviously this is an anomaly that must be rectified and I would ask the Minister to bring in an amendment to the present Act as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>With reference to the question of appeals, in the Housing Act, 1969, there is no right of third party appeal. Surely that right is involved in matters such as the demolition of a house and the effect on a community.  The need for an amendment in this case must be as obvious to the Minister as it is to my colleagues on this side of the House.  If a developer applies for permission to demolish a number of houses or to change their use or any other planning or development proposal, surely the community have the right of third party appeal against the demolition of the houses, just as they have the right of third party appeal against the decision of the local authority with regard to the planning application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment on the replacement system as it operates at the moment.  Recently a man who had been involved in negotiating a property came to see me.  He was acquiring a house with the agreement of the <Col N="1592" /> people concerned and, in fact, he had made a business arrangement with them.  What was involved was the demolition of the house; he was replacing the house but not in the same local authority area.  It happened that the man had the house in the city but the other people involved in the transaction wanted to live in County Dublin.  However he could not get permission from the corporation under the Housing Act, 1969, to demolish the house because the other house he was providing was not in the same local authority area.  I am not sure if the interpretation of the Act by the officials of the corporation was at fault or if it is the Act itself that is at fault.  Surely this is an anomaly that needs to be rectified. The fact that the house replacement was in another area should not have affected the application for demolition. It is obvious that the Minister will have to amend the Housing Act, 1969, and I would ask him to consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>There are many fine, old houses throughout the country but they are let fall into a bad state of repair by the local authorities or the Land Commission when they purchase them.  I would cite the example of Kenure House in Rush.  This was a fine mansion surrounded by 300 or 400 acres of land which was acquired by the Land Commission to be allotted to local farmers and market gardeners.  A certain amount of land was purchased by the county council for housing and other purposes. While these transactions were going on the house was left uninhabited and, consequently, it fell derelict. There is a responsibility on authorities such as the Land Commission or the council concerned to take proper care of old mansions when they come into their possession.  I realise the main problem is money and there is also the question of the responsibility of the Land Commission.  They are responsible only for the land, not the house.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider encouraging large public companies to adopt&mdash;for the lack of a better word&mdash;these old houses immediately <Col N="1593" /> the land is acquired by the Land Commission or the council.  The companies might be given tax relief and they might then revamp the houses and hand them over to the local community for use as a community centre.  I do not think this could be done by way of grants.  It is an ongoing matter, where the company concerned would look after the house during the years to see that it is kept in good order.  The best encouragement would be a system of tax reliefs or tax incentives.  Perhaps the Minister would think of this suggestion when he is considering the amendments which everyone agrees are necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for the way they have received this Bill. I assure them that the interesting points made by them will be considered when we are dealing with the new Housing Bill, which must come pretty quickly.  There have been a number of interesting points made with regard to the conservation of houses by Deputy Molloy.  He knows my views on this matter, not alone with regard to Dublin, Cork and Galway but as it affects every town and village in the country.  We have a situation where houses are being let go to rack and ruin perhaps because the person who owns them is unable for financial reasons to do the necessary repairs or, alternatively, because the owner is so rich that he does not worry about them.  However, I am heartened by the good social principles of the Deputies who are prepared to support the idea that these houses should pass into public ownership and be used as useful housing units.  As Deputy Molloy pointed out, even though a number of the houses are not of great architectural beauty they are still fine examples of buildings of past days and they are solid structures.  This suggests the houses should be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my policy and I have informed local authorities accordingly on a number of occasions.  Recently I have repeated by way of circular letter than I want a survey of all <Col N="1594" /> those houses carried out.  An Foras Forbartha have been asked to prepare any documentation they can on the number of such houses, the type of houses and what they consider would be the best way to deal with them.  Each local authority has been asked to find out if they can do something to ensure that proper action is taken with regard to the preservation of such houses.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with the view that the building of houses is not the be all and end all unless we are able to preserve our housing stock.  No matter how many houses we build the leak at the bottom of the barrel will drain away so many houses that year after year we will require extra ones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy says so, I will accept his word.  Deputy Molloy said that they should be conserved under this but I would point out that the 1969 Act provides that:</P>
      <P>Permission to demolish can only be refused on grounds of housing shortage.</P>
      <P>That may not be so easy in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>To prove a housing shortage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that the house could be used for this purpose and it must be a dwellinghouse used as such.  It is a complication which might be difficult to get around in some cases but I agree that we should do something about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy also referred to the question of the fine.  In the debate in the Seanad on 19th December, 1972 the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important matter raised is the question of the £100 fine and the continuing fine of £10 per day, or the six months prison sentence. These are stated in the Act and continued by this motion in order that cases of this kind can be heard and dealt with in the District Court.  If the fines were higher it would lead <Col N="1595" /> to litigation in higher courts which can be a lengthy business.</P>
    <P>I would agree that this was, perhaps, at the time a valid reason.</P>
    <P>In regard to the publication of notice and the right of a third party to appeal, the Parliamentary Secretary said on the same day:</P>
    <P>the interested parties under this Act are local authorities and the Act applies to the conservation of the pool of habitable dwellings.  Planning does not enter into this.  In the case of the Planning Act anyone who is interested in planning and the safeguarding of the environment has a right to object.  In this case all that is involved is the conservation of housing.</P>
    <P>So, in fact, there is no appeal nor is there a notice to be published but I agree with the idea which Dublin Corporation members have introduced that notice should be given in good time to the members of the councils and corporations.  I would go further and say that a lot of the senseless demolition which had occurred, and I do not want to blame anybody because, perhaps, we are all to blame, before this Act was introduced should not have been allowed.  It is very wrong that there should have been demolition since this Act was introduced.  I would be very much opposed to the action of any corporation or council approving of the demolition of houses which could be made habitable.  Whether there is compensation offered or not is beside the point.  They should not get permission and I would ask the members of local authorities to ensure that in the areas they represent this sort of thing is not allowed.  We hope to consider it in the next Housing Bill and in the Planning Bill as far as possible we will attempt to tie this up. The only trouble is that under the 1969 Act a local authority gives permission to demolish and nothing can be done about it.  They can demolish it if they apply for a change of use or if they apply to erect something on it after they demolish then the Planning Act comes in.  We must ensure if we can in the new Planning Bill that something like this is written in.  I do not <Col N="1596" /> know whether it will be possible to tie it in securely enough but pending the introduction of new housing legislation we should attempt to ensure that this sort of vandalism&mdash;it is vandalism whether it is carried out by a private individual, a firm, or a local authority &mdash;should be prevented.  I would be very anxious to ensure that this is done.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made by Deputy Molloy that appeals under the 1969 Act should be handled by An Bord Pleanála.  There is a distinct difference between the two types of appeal.  I do not think An Bord Pleanála is the correct way of dealing with it.  However, it is another day's work and we will have another look at it.</P>
    <P>There was a reference by Deputy Moore to local authorities who would be anxious to do the right thing but might not have enough staff.  All I can say is that if any local authority applies to me for sanction for staff for this very necessary work I will be prepared to give it very favourable consideration. This is something which must be dealt with in the proper way and there is no point in telling a local authority they should do something and then saying they are not entitled to have the necessary staff to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy knows who usually pays local authority salaries. In view of the fact that we have taken so much off the rates this year it should be a lot easier for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell talked about houses being allowed to deteriorate by intending developers.  Section 5 of the 1969 Act allows a housing authority to require a house to be made fit for human habitation where they are of opinion that a person has, for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of the Act, caused or permitted the house to deteriorate to the extent that it ceases to be a habitable house. I understand that recently in Paris the Government made a decision which would not be too acceptable in Dublin at present.  They decided that anybody who had a house on any of the main thoroughfares had to put it into <Col N="1597" /> a proper habitable condition.  If they could not do so themselves they had no option but to sell it to somebody who could.  It makes Paris look a lot better but it has been a great hardship for certain people who had to sell property which had been in their families for years.  One can see the necessity for ensuring that property is properly looked after.  While an individual or a family may own property all of us will die and our houses will be there after our time.  Nobody has a right to allow his property to deteriorate to the extent that it has happened in this country and particularly in this city.</P>
    <P>There is at present consideration being given to the question of a type of fine to be imposed on people who deliberately allow houses to deteriorate so that they can say they are uninhabitable.  It is one way in which we could prevent the smart guy from buying up property in some parts of the city, allowing it to deteriorate and in some cases helping it to deteriorate and eventually being able to demolish it on the ground that it is not fit to be put into habitable condition.  If such people had to pay dearly for their investment we would be getting somewhere near preventing this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>The centre of this city and the centres of a number of other cities, towns and villages had been allowed to deteriorate before the whole concept of planning was properly approached.  Even since then it appears there are attempts made in city and town centres to allow property to deteriorate.  I am grateful to the members of Dublin Corporation and various other bodies who are co-operating with the Government to stop this.  I made an appeal that they should attempt to acquire such property and build houses for the public on it.  No matter what political party they belong to or whether they belong to a political party at all, people who do this are public-minded people.  I am glad they have accepted it and are as interested in it as I am.</P>
    <P>While this measure will continue the operation of the Act, we must at some time in the future amend the Act.  It has been looked at and the <Col N="1598" /> points made in this debate will be taken into consideration when we are looking at it again and I hope that, when it comes before the House, it will receive the same kind of consideration that this measure has received so that what we all want done will be done.</P>

      <P>This Bill aims to raise £3½ million extra, a tiny fraction of the cost of the health services.  The Minister said it is a mere 10 per cent of the cost of providing limited eligibility classes and their dependants with hospital and specialist services, maternity and infant care services as well as drug subsidy.  This £3½ million represents less than 3 per cent of the total hospital and specialist services cost.  The sum for which the Minister is asking is so tiny that I cannot understand why he is asking for it.  I cannot understand why he should think fit to burden the working <Col N="1599" /> classes with this weekly imposition.  It is an unfair burden in these days of rising prices.  It is unfair for many reasons.  What is not obvious is the fact that the upper income group are actually having their hospital costs subsidised by the State, subsidised by those who will have to bear this burden of a health contribution.  To me, this is deplorable.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the cost of a hospital bed to a person in the upper income group bears no relation whatever to the actual cost to the State of such a bed?  I will give a concrete example: the weekly cost to the State of a bed for a patient in Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin was £109 last year.  This year it must be very much more.  A private patient in the upper income group pays a mere £35 to £45 a week for the same bed.  The upper income group patient is subsidised to the tune of nearly £70 per week.  That is something we do not seem to realise.  I go so far as to say that the middle income group patient is subsidising the upper income group patient under our present system of health services.  This is quite wrong socially.</P>
      <P>Who is subsidising whom?  We are talking about subsidising the middle and lower income groups, but actually the reverse is happening.  The Minister and his Department obviously approve of this inverted socialism.</P>

      <P>These are some of the finer nuances.  I describe the Minister's imposition as a discriminatory tax on a particular section of our community.  There should be fair play and this is not fair play.  The middle and lower income groups are experiencing a very rough time at the moment with spiralling prices.  Many people are suffering serious privation. There is a ground swell of protest which is growing in volume every day. We should heed the fact that there is a crushing burden already on a certain section of our community.  We all know it is the last straw which breaks the camel's back and this parlous situation is being reached.  This very <Col N="1600" /> minor sum should be found from the Exchequer by way of taxation.  It should not be an imposition on a section of the community least able to bear it.</P>

      <P>As I said, this imposition will be a heavy burden.  I disagreed with it in 1971 and made clear the reason why I disagreed.  At the moment there is a serious inadequacy in our hospital services.  I tried to get a patient with a serious eye condition an appointment to have her eyes examined and I was told that the earliest an appointment could be made was next February.  If people are asked to pay to cover limited eligibility then we must make sure they get that to which they are entitled. If we are going to take in an extra £3½ million then let us put it to some use, such as improving out-patient services and bed services. These services are not being provided and people are not getting what they are entitled to; there is a serious problem with regard to these services. I can say that quite honestly.</P>

      <P>The Minister said in his introductory speech:</P>
      <P>It is evident that the provision of limited eligibility services at 15 pence a week and £7 a year has been exceptionally good value and compares very favourably with private health insurance schemes.</P>
      <P>This limited eligibility was provided before.  We had it under the 1953 Health Act.  We cannot talk in terms of this providing value.  We can talk about the £700,000 which was the cost of the beds.  The patients paid 10s. a day.  We had these services for years.  This 15p a week is not good value.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister has not taken sides on the question of whether the flat rate contributions are regressive because they do not take into account the person's income. The Minister has not given us his views on this.  My views on it are very clear.  It is wrong to apply a flat rate contribution when people have different incomes.  It is wrong that it should be applied uniformly across the board.  The Minister's predecessor assured this House that the Revenue Commissioners had set up a highlevel working party to plan the change-over to a graduated scheme in the health contributions.  We were told that in June, 1971.  That is three years ago.  Will the Minister tell the House what has happened in regard to this working party?  Have the plans been formulated?  Are they about to be implemented and, if so, when will they come into effect?  Why were they not incorporated into this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note a statement by the Minister that he proposes to begin shortly a review of the present system of financing our health services.  This is a very good idea.  It is long overdue. I commend this move by the Minister. I would ask him to consider now setting up an all-party committee of the Dáil to review and examine the various aspects of the health services and <Col N="1602" /> to see what can be done.  The Minister could take that initiative now.  This would do what Deputy Coughlan has suggested, that is, take health out of the area of politics.  We have too few Dáil committees.  If the Minister did this it would be an excellent initiative. It would be a major step.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to that suggestion.  If such a committee were set up we might see some positive work done.  An all-party Dáil committee was set up some years ago by the then Minister for Health, Mr. MacEntee.  It examined the various aspects of the health services to see how they could be improved.  If we set up a committee now, we might come up with some very good proposals for altering the structure of our health services, and decide how they should be financed in the interests of the entire country without party interest being involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1603" /> I have been critical.  I hope constructively. I am aware of the warning in the Minister's speech that there will be little real growth over the next two years and that this will have serious implications particularly in relation to the growth in tax revenues.  This is a serious warning and we should pay heed to it.  This Bill to raise £3½ million should be looked at again.  It should be a temporary measure only.  If what I read is true, there is a serious breakdown in the operation of the scheme in relation to the £7 a year being paid by the farming community.  I should like to know what percentage of the eligible farmers are paying it.  I notice that in the Western Health Board area the percentage is very low.  Is it worth pursuing if the level of co-operation is so low?  We should be told these things.  I should like the Minister to spell out in greater detail the review he has in mind and I should like him seriously to consider my proposal. Because of our stringent economic situation at the moment, we have to accept this Bill.  I do not think it is the answer.  I have expressed my views and I hope the Minister will accept them in the spirit I have offered them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small amending Bill covering a very small section of the Health Act.  I would urge the Minister to deal with the defects in the health services which, as I see it, mainly concern the dental and ophthalmic services.  The people in the lower and middle income groups have their difficulties and I regret that they cannot get some subsidy for their teeth under this Bill. The other aspect to which I would like to refer is the £60 valuation.  It is correct to say that this £60 valuation was introduced when the financial level was £1,200 but the latter figure has since gone to £1,800 and to £2,250 for a particular section while for the farmers it remains at £60.  There is something unjust and unfair in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out to the House that this amendment is based on Fianna Fáil legislation but that legislation was aimed at providing for the most needy.  It is difficult to see <Col N="1604" /> how the Minister, who stated that our finances are limited and that there will be difficulties, cannot continue to extend the hospital services to the upper income group.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Adjournment Debate: Butter Price Increase.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The citizens were shocked when they heard the news of the savage increase in the price of butter announced this week.  First, I should like to quote from a leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Tuesday, December 10, which gives a clear indication of what is involved and the manner in which the increases took place.  The editorial states:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the increase in the price of butter has been sneaked into the pipeline and will emerge later on this week to further infuriate and depress the shopper.  The size of the increase is iniquitous (it was 5p last month) and the manner of allowing the news to get out reprehensible in the extreme.</P>
      <P>&mdash;an increase in its price will be felt immediately, especially by those who already have to budget carefully to make their wages, pensions and salaries go round.  For such people there is no choice, given a further rise except to cut down on the amount of butter consumed. And winter-time is hardly the right moment for this kind of rationing.</P>
      <P>But this kind of clinical manipulation of subsidies and prices is only done at the expense of the public which indeed, has long ago given up the task of understanding what agriculture is all about.</P>
      <P>The decision to remove the subsidy was made by someone utterly out of contact with the public and its problems.  It is a demoralising decision, too....  But ordinary humanity should demand that the Government hold up for the moment its latest increase.</P>
      <P>They are the words of the <i>Irish Independent,</i> a paper that is normally sympathetic to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> We now have a situation where the political con-men now in Government who presented to the people 20 months ago a 14-point plan to control prices and to reduce the price of foodstuffs use a backdoor method to increase the price of butter.  This was made known to some people on Saturday and it meant that the shopkeepers who became aware of the decision withdrew their stocks from sale and people who could afford to pay were unable to obtain butter.  People are unable to obtain butter until such time as the Minister makes an order.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here to answer this debate.  Was there some difference of opinion with the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is normally called upon to answer questions raised in relation to prices?  For some unknown reason the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will be replying to this debate.  However, the political con-men are here in some form or another.  The housewives were shocked and horrified at this increase in the price of butter.  If taken with the increase imposed in October of 5½p, an increase of 17 per cent, this increase brings the price of butter to 41½p. This December increase amounts to 11 per cent.  In February the price will increase again by 2p, an increase of 6½ per cent, bringing the price to 43½p while in September there will be a further increase of 1½p or 4 per cent, bringing the price to 45p.  This all amounts to an increase over a 12-month period of 41 per cent.</P>
    <P>Is this what the Government calls price stabilisation?  Is this the type of price stabilisation we have been promised?  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has not been here for some time and it is probable that he is not aware of the arguments put forward in relation to Government policy in the recent debate on the petrol price increase.  In that debate many Ministers indicated that it was Government policy to increase the price to cut demand.  We have a situation now where not alone have they endeavoured to cut demand for petrol but also to cut the demand for one of the necessities of life, butter.  The <Col N="1606" /> Government want to take butter from the table of the ordinary person.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the debate on the increase in the price of petrol we were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there was something else involved other than the cutting of demand; there was also the question of reducing the speed limit. However, as the Minister cannot reduce the speed limit in this regard, I wonder what his alternative is.  The alternative appears to be that if people cannot buy butter they must buy margarine.  The price of butter has been put beyond the reach of the average worker and, with so many people unemployed, there is no doubt that many will be without butter over Christmas and in the future.</P>
    <P>We are told by the National Dairy Council that there will be a drop in domestic butter consumption of 10 per cent.  We will probably have a build-up of this butter mountain we heard so much about in the past.  It may well be that this was done by design; it may be a feed the Russian campaign.  It is probably the intention to feed the Russians at 12p per lb. while depriving our housewives of one of the necessities of life.  It may be that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries may have a suggestion to make, just as the Minister for Industry and Commerce had in relation to the conserving of fuel by the reduction of the speed limit.  Will the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries now suggest that people should eat fried bread now that butter will not be available?</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the Government wish to curtail by price increases the necessities of life.  In the past we heard a lot about the 14-point plan but can the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries explain how the Government aim to control prices and reduce the price of foodstuffs?</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that this is as a result of the green £.  This party supported the green £ with the proviso that essential foodstuffs would be subsidised and some portion of the £50 million would go towards subsidising the necessities of life.  The Government have no desire to subsidise or to <Col N="1607" /> alleviate the distressed people, many of whom are unemployed, with many more to become unemployed over Christmas.  This ever-increasing spiral of people on the dole, the lengthening of dole queues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that while it was difficult under normal circumstances for a person in full employment to have the means to purchase the necessities of life the people in the dole queues have no chance of purchasing butter.  Perhaps the Minister will have further suggestions to make.  Perhaps he will suggest &mdash;now that cars will be off the road and people will be using margarine&mdash; that this is done in the interests of people's health.  They can have plenty of exercise and eat non-fatty foods.  I am sure the Minister will have some reason to present to this House and to the public why they should do without butter in the future and why the Government are putting this necessity of life beyond their reach.</P>
      <P>Much can be said about the type of tactic to which we have become accustomed&mdash;the &ldquo;budget of the day Government&rdquo;.  We had a budget on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. We have had a budget every day this week so far.  One wonders what will be taxed next.</P>

      <P>It may well happen that before Christmas there will be a turkey tax to knock the stuffing out of the country altogether.  It would not be beyond the bounds of possibility that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would think up some such scheme.  But there is no doubt that it is a serious matter for the people who have not got the necessary means.  I would draw attention to the fraud and deceit of these political con-men in Government who promised a reduction in food prices; who promised people <Col N="1608" /> that they would not alone stabilise prices but would reduce the price of essential foodstuffs.  As part of Government policy they are now making the essentials of life so dear that consumption will be reduced.  That is the stated policy of the Government.  I do not blame the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is not aware of this.  The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and indeed other Ministers have suggested that this was a necessary action.  They spoke about a petrol leak but we shall have a butter leak from the North now in circumstances in which people are permitted to take £52 worth of goods back which, in terms of butter, would amount to approximately 247 lbs. per traveller.</P>
      <P>What will the Government do about that?  Have they thought up another scheme to deal with the butter leak? They are a Government who have operated on the basis of leaks since they took office&mdash;a leak here, a leak there, an unofficial leak&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will develop the point I am making.  We had here last evening a so-called responsible Minister <Col N="1610" /> basing increases on what he called discretionary spending.  He based justification for an increase on what a newspaper editor said.  Where is he this evening?  Will he call this discretionary spending, he who, for so long here&mdash;in company with his other fellow Socialists&mdash;bled white, blue, and pink blood on behalf of the people?  Where is he this evening when he realises that there are thousands of people in Dublin city who no longer can think in terms of bread and butter matters as something mundane and commonplace but who must now accept that bread and butter have become luxuries which they cannot enjoy?</P>
      <P>In the matter of the subsidy which has been removed and which, we are told, makes this increase necessary, I would ask the Minister who has graced the House with his presence why the subsidy would not at least have remained until the end of the fiscal year.  I know there is an obligation that certain subsidies be removed. But surely there was no need to remove this one until the end of the fiscal year which, this year, is 31st December.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will realise, as I do, the circumstances which have been created in which the people are unable to purchase all those foods which are so essential.  For example, in the matter of meat and cheese people are now unable, because of the escalation which has occurred in prices in that area, to purchase them. Formerly they had at least the satisfaction, especially in a house where there were many children, of being able to buy some butter.  They will not be able to do so from now on.  I appreciate that Deputy Keating, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if he were here, could, in his damping-down fashion, offer us the solution that people need not have children and we could have an extension of this philosophy.</P>

      <P>I should explain why I am here instead of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, since the query was raised.  This subsidy, that has now been withdrawn, has been on the Vote of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries since the days when the milk price allowance was paid. This was paid to enable us to sell butter to Britain and to various other parts of the world at give-away prices. It should have been removed when we joined the EEC.  It is being removed now from the Vote of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and that is why I am here to reply to Deputies Dowling and Tunney.</P>
      <P>For a number of years I had the honour to represent in this House the major portion of that area represented now by Deputy Dowling and I found the people there to be very decent.</P>
