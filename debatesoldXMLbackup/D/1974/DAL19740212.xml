    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give details of exports, if any, of residual fuel oil from Whitegate oil refinery in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Trade statistics are not compiled in respect of individual firms.  Total exports of residual fuel oil in 1973 amounted to 443,000 metric tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say at which time of 1973 most of these exports took place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The quarter in which most was exported was the first quarter when 153,000 metric tons was exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary state what amount was exported in the last quarter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 97,200 metric tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the knowledge which everyone seemed to have had last September and October with regard to the approaching fuel crisis, surely the Government could have taken some action to prevent these exports of 90,000 odd metric tons of oil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in regard to oil imports to this country is that the British and Irish markets are integrated and the refining industry, because of its failure to secure the ESB <Col N="380" /> contract, has had to contract for a supply of refined oil to export markets.  If the contracts which existed last year had not been filled, there would have been immediate repercussions in Britain and the supply of oil to our own markets would have been curtailed.  On balance, the situation was one of advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in common with our EEC partners are committed to the objective of establishing an economic and monetary union in the Community, this being one of the obligations undertaken at the time of this country's accession.  A more closely knit Community, of which economic and monetary union is a concrete expression and in which there is a concerted approach to the solution of Community problems, is in the interests of all the member states but particularly the smaller ones.  A necessary condition of progress towards such union is parallel progress in the elimination of structural and regional imbalances occurring in the community. This must entail increased emphasis on regional, social and other <Col N="384" /> policies which actively promote convergence of economic conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about the Government's attitude in regard to the stated policy of economic and monetary union in the European Community by 1980.  Has the Minister anything to say on that, in view of the problems now arising in the Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy would have understood me.  I stated in my reply that the Government favour economic and monetary union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in my question to imply that we do not favour it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we both believe as far as this country is concerned that we should have it.  As far as we are concerned it means a levelling upwards to the economic, social and regional advantages that so many other parts of the European Community have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government's attitude to the implementation of this by 1980 depend on an effective regional policy being implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Our attitude is in favour of achieving this goal.  The speed at which it is achieved will, of course, depend on the readiness of all the members of the Community to work towards that goal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <P>All remuneration, whether consisting of basic earnings or overtime earnings, is chargeable to income tax in the ordinary way.  The exclusion of any particular type of earnings from the tax charge would create undesirable anomalies and complicate an already very complex tax code.

I do not therefore propose to introduce legislation to provide exemption on the lines suggested by the Deputies.</P>

I would remind the Deputy that the pay-related benefit scheme, which will come into operation in April next, will improve the standard of living of sick and unemployed workers by providing an earnings-related supplement to the existing flat rate unemployment and disability benefits.  This scheme should do much to safeguard such workers on a continuing basis against the pressure of inflation.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The capital budget provisions for programme and non-programme expenditures are open to constant review and adjustment throughout the year in the light of current conditions of investment needs and resources availabilities. These factors may give rise to temporary internal adjustments in programme allocations.  For this reason it is not the practice to publish statements of the position in advance of the definitive outturn figures of expenditure and resources which are made available in detail at budget time.  At that stage, any adjustments that have arisen between estimates and outturn can be considered in the light of the overall budgetary review of the economy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of containing the growth of Dublin is implemented mainly by encouraging development in other parts of the country.  The creation of employment outside Dublin reduces migration to the city, thus restraining its growth. This is one of the objectives of the Government's regional policy, which is implemented, for example, through the systematic improvement of infrastructure <Col N="397" /> and through our schemes of industrial incentives.  Measures have been taken under this policy to make provincial areas more attractive financially than Dublin for certain kinds of investment.  Industrial grants are obtainable at higher rates outside Dublin, and, since last year, the rate of stamp duty on certain contracts for the construction of office blocks is higher in Dublin than elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are clear indications that they have been sufficient to attract more industries to less developed areas than would otherwise be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not appear from past practice over many years that the differentials in favour of the non-Dublin area just are not sufficient to make any real impact on development throughout the country and with a view to restraining the growth of Dublin?  In other words, they are not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One may argue about this.  The truth, probably, is that, no matter what financial incentives were given by the central Government in any country, there would be some industries which would prefer to locate themselves in highly developed urban areas.  On that account there are probably some industries in the Dublin region which, if they were not located in the Dublin region, might not have come to the country at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many in Dublin that could have been elsewhere if they had not been induced to come here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already informed Deputy Blaney, we will continue to look at this and be advised by the people who are in the best position to know, that is, the IDA.  It is probable that no matter what incentives and encouragements are given, some industries will decide to locate in the developed urban regions because the infrastructure may be there which may not be in the more remote regions.  We are anxious to distribute industry and our own domestic regional policy and, we hope, whenever it arrives, the regional fund of the EEC, will make it easier to locate industry in the less-developed regions.</P>

      <P>I accept that small farmers in common with other borrowers may find current interest rates rather onerous but, as the Deputy will appreciate, the rates chargeable by the banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation reflect the high interest rates now prevailing in the international money market.  Farmers can, however, get loans at reduced interest rates in certain circumstances.  For example, World Bank Loans which are channelled through the ACC and the banks are available at 11¾ per cent.  Small farmers can get unsecured loans subject to a maximum of £600 at 10 per cent from the ACC.  Finally, under the farm modernisation scheme recently announced by the Minister <Col N="401" /> for Agriculture and Fisheries interest subsidies ranging from 5 per cent to 9 per cent will be available towards approved farm investment.  Additional aids to small dairy and tillage farmers would not be feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the special cases being dealt with by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, is it the Minister's knowledge or experience that it is generally the large borrowers who get the lowest interest rates and the small borrowers, who need it most, who are charged the higher rates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to generalise as far as interest rates are concerned, because there are a variety of factors involved, including the creditworthiness of the applicant, the purpose for which the loan is sought, the duration of the loan and so forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making to the Minister, in the hope that he will be able to do something about it, is that the creditworthiness of the small borrower is worsened by virtue of the fact that the small loan requirement usually involves paying a higher rate of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the matter is still under consideration between the people involved.  I would point out to the Deputy that this consideration arises out of the unanimous advice of the all-party Public Accounts Committee which drew attention to what it considered to be the wasteful and possibly dangerous duplication between the Department of Finance and other agencies of the State and local authorities, all seeming to do at the one time a number of identical functions, and they sought to have the matter rationalised.  I want to give the assurance that nobody at present involved in county development work has anything to fear by reason of any rationalisation that may take place.</P>

      <P>I am not saying any such thing, nor did the Committee of Public Accounts.  What the Committee of Public Accounts unanimously said was that there was unnecessary and undesirable duplication of functions which probably led to a duplication of expenditure in some cases.  What we are doing now is trying to have one well-organised arrangement instead of duplicating the whole machinery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the committee said in its report for the year 1968-69 was the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee feels that it is <Col N="417" /> administratively untidy and perhaps inefficient to have the Department of Finance involved in operations which seem to be more appropriate to the enlarged functions of the Industrial Development Authority.  It also questions, from the point of financial control, the expediency of paying grants from the fund for a type of activity which is clearly within the sphere of Bord Fáilte Éireann, simply because the latter's funds were fully committed in the year under review.</P>
    <P>In the report for the following year the committee had this to say:</P>
    <P>State assistance for industrial, commercial and social purposes is made available by such agencies as Bord Fáilte Éireann, Gaeltarra Éireann, the Industrial Development Authority, the Agricultural Credit Company, Fóir Teoranta, Roinn na Gaeltachta, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and the special regional development fund.  While the committee accepts that each agency has a special functional area, nevertheless it is concerned lest there might be an overlap of functions.  The committee agrees that it is a matter of policy that the different aspects of State assistance should be handled by different agencies competent to deal with them.  Nevertheless it is inclined to the view that some rationalisation might be profitably carried out.  The administrative costs of servicing these various agencies is quite considerable and the cost of maintaining an efficient system of liaison between them so as to avoid overlapping cannot be insignificant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that stricture entirely.  I submit that the Taoiseach's motion violates the Standing Orders providing for Private Members' Business.  It flies in the face not only of that Standing Order but in the face of the rights of individual Deputies.  To put the Standing Order on the record I shall quote it.  It is Standing Order No. 83 and it is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Order Paper shall be confined to Questions.  Private business and Government business on Thursdays and on Tuesdays and Wednesdays during the period when the ordinary yearly resolutions voting <Col N="424" /> money for public services or imposing taxation or the Bill implementing such resolutions are under consideration.  On other Tuesdays and Wednesdays, Government business or Private business, as the case may be, shall be interrupted between 6 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. to take Private Members' Business: Provided that a member of the Government may move, without notice, at the commencement of public business on any Tuesday or Wednesday that, on that day, specified Government business, or Private business, as the case may be, shall not be interrupted if under consideration at that time fixed for taking private members' business. Such motion shall be decided without amendment.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a number of points directly on this Standing Order. I should like, by way of explanation for some Deputies, to explain that private business as referred to in conjunction with Government business is not Private Members' Business.  I understand that private business in this context is business of the nature of a Private Bill in connection with the statutory provision for a hospital or some other institution.  We have had some instances of this.  I remember the Meath Hospital Bill, and, in current time, we had the Leopardstown Hospital Bill.</P>
    <P>These institutions were set up by ancient charters and for which provision was not made in our ordinary statutory legislation.  Apparently, in the early days of this Assembly it was decided that there should be some provision and that provision is under what is known as, &ldquo;Private Business&rdquo;. Apparently, it gets precedence because otherwise a Bill prepared by a parliamentary agent outside this House may have to wait a long time before coming to the House.  That has nothing whatever to do with the Private Members' Business to which I now refer.</P>
    <P>The provision in this Standing Order is that the Order of Business shall be confined to such business, that is, Private Business and Government Business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> ... during the period when the ordinary yearly resolutions voting money for public services or imposing taxation or the Bills implementing such resolutions are under consideration.</P>
    <P>The ordinary yearly resolutions were before this House in the pre-Christmas session and it was only because sufficient time was not available to discuss these yearly resolutions, in other words, the Estimates for some of the Departments, that they were passed <i>en bloc</i>.  It was agreed that a token Estimate for £10 in the case of each Department whose Estimate had not been passed during the ordinary period of business would be introduced in this session.  Therefore, this session provides for extraordinary financial resolutions and, consequently, this is a period when, under this Standing Order, Private Members' Business must be taken unless the motion as moved by the Taoiseach defeats the right of Members in this respect.</P>
    <P>The financial business now before the House is not financial business in the ordinary course.  It is not financial business such as that described in this Standing Order&mdash;ordinary yearly resolutions.  Therefore, the Taoiseach cannot rely on this Standing Order as a means of denying Private Members' Business.  He can rely on it only to the extent that he moved a motion deliberately under this Standing Order to prevent Private Members' Business being taken.</P>
    <P>Having said that, and I think what I have said will stand up to any examination, I may comment on the fact that this Government announced that they would be open Government. This is one occasion on which they are definitely closing the ordinary Members' opportunity to examine Government policy in one crucial and important respect.  When we were in Government there were frequent requests from Deputies who are now on the Government benches and, more particularly, Deputies of the Labour Party, seeking longer time&mdash; time over and above the ordinary&mdash;for Private Members' Business, but we never denied Private Members' Business <Col N="426" /> where an objection was taken by the Opposition against any such denial.  I am not suggesting that in our time we did not announce on the Order of Business, as the Taoiseach has announced, that it was proposed not to interrupt Government Business to allow time for Private Members' Business but we never denied a specific request for taking Private Members' Business in any period when Standing Orders provided for the taking of such business.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach reminded us that at our request time was given last week to debate a motion.  We requested Government time, not Private Members' time, to debate a Government motion on a matter of grave concern to the people.  I am still within the restrictions imposed on me by the Chair but I wish to comment only on what the Taoiseach said.  The Government did not give us time to debate that motion; instead, they introduced a substantive motion of their own and our motion on prices was treated as an amendment to that substantive motion. Therefore, Government time was taken up with a substantive Government motion and not on an amendment from the Opposition.  The amendment happened, then, to be incidental by deliberate Government decision, to the Government's motion.  On the grounds of fair play I appeal to the conscience of this open Government to permit open discussion in this House.  In recent times we have had displays of arrogance from members of the Government. We had such a display no later than today when the Minister for Finance displayed not only arrogance but cynical arrogance in replying to questions from Deputies on this side of the House.  We had another incidence of similar behaviour on Sunday last when, on Radio Éireann, the Minister responsible for these services was arrogant to a person who, in one sense or another, might be deemed to come within his employ.</P>

I submit that we are completely within our rights under this Standing Order to request the ordinary facility for discussing Private Members' Business.  If we are not given this facility it will be only because the Government move deliberately and by their majority will ensure that time would not be given us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement by the Taoiseach in introducing this motion could, with fairness, be described as a tissue of inaccuracies.  A number of those inaccuracies have been pointed out already by the Leader of this party but I would like to add to them by indicating that the Taoiseach referred to the fact that in this session last year there was no Private Members' Time.  May I point out to the Taoiseach that this House did not meet for this session last year, that it did not meet until after the general election when the Government were faced with a budgetary situation, that it adjourned for a month or so, having already adjourned for a week, and that the Government then prepared their budget.  Of course, we were then into financial business.  Therefore, the case put forward by the Taoiseach so far in support of this motion has been singularly unconvincing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the proposed amendments to the Standing Orders of this House, amendments that were supported enthusiastically by Deputies opposite, including members of the Government, it was proposed that Private Members' Business be carried on in this House throughout the year and not merely as is the present arrangement in sessions when major financial business is not before the House.  We are entitled to <Col N="428" /> ask what is the reason for this sudden lack of enthusiasm for Private Members' Business?  The Leader of this party has pointed out fairly that this Government are a self-styled open Government but that more and more they are closing in on themselves and are beginning rapidly to be reminiscent of one at least of their Coalition predecessors which arranged that this House would meet on one day per week only so that they might cover up their internal difficulties and avoid being exposed to the questioning and criticism which is normal here and which is normal in any healthy democracy.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that under the Rules of this House certain Private Members' motions are able to obtain precedence, that precedence had been claimed for a motion in my name which is on the Order Paper and which calls for substantial reliefs in various forms of income tax allowances and for adjustment thereafter in relation to the cost of living index, I submit every Deputy was entitled to assume that that motion would be debated this evening.  Therefore, the Taoiseach's motion now before the House is directed not only to the proposition that we should not have Private Members' Business today but is specifically directed to the proposition that we should not discuss today the motion in my name.</P>
    <P>That motion asks Dáil Éireann to call on the Government, in view of the inflation now raging in the economy and the consequent hardship being inflicted on most income tax payers and in particular on those with very low incomes who were never intended to be subject to income tax, to increase substantially the personal, earned income, marriage, child and age allowances under the income tax code and to provide by legislation that, thereafter, such allowances be adjusted annually in relation to movements in the cost of living index.</P>
    <P>Despite their self-styled open form of government, I submit the entire attitude of this Government is the direct opposite to that, that their actions are building up more and more to those of a Government who are trying to avoid discussion, to <Col N="429" /> cover up, to avoid criticism and who are unduly sensitive to criticism from whatever quarter.  I have given some examples of this.  Another instance I might give is the fact that this Government, by deliberate decision, brought about a situation in which we did not proceed with a series of programmes on television in which there would be discussion between members of the Government and the Opposition in relation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that matter is in order at this juncture.  The Deputy must confine himself to the subject matter of the motion, which is purely a procedural one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit there is more involved in this than procedure.  What is involved here is a proposal by the Government to stifle further the criticism they would normally expect to get from the Opposition even if they were doing a reasonably good job and, in the light of the job they are doing, the criticism they are certain to get.  I suggest it is relevant to consider the general attitude of the Government in considering the merits of the motion in the name of the Taoiseach.  The record of the Government in the matters I have mentioned is such that it is clear the Government are endeavouring to prevent, wherever they can, any means of discussion or criticism and, as I said earlier, they are becoming unduly sensitive to criticism from whatever quarter.  This motion is simply another example of this mentality on the part of this self-styled open Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit also, that because the motion in my name had obtained precedence under the Rules of the House and, therefore, was due to be discussed this afternoon, it is open to us to examine why the Government particularly did not want to have this motion discussed today, which is what the Taoiseach is proposing.  I am suggesting the content of this motion is a matter of urgent public importance for the reasons set out in the motion. Apart from that, I submit one could reasonably have expected that the Government would welcome the <Col N="430" /> opportunity of having the motion discussed at this time having regard to the situation in relation to the proposed national pay agreement.  I do not think it is a matter of dispute that what is involved in this motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot advert to the subject matter of his motion now.  He will have to confine his remarks to the question of whether the business under discussion should be taken today.  We cannot discuss the merits of any other matter or motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to discuss the merits or otherwise of the motion in my name.  I am suggesting I am entitled to argue that the motion in the name of the Taoiseach is a motion to prevent discussion of Motion No. 17 on the Order Paper and that, without discussing the merits of Motion No. 17, it should be open to us to consider the reasons it should not be discussed, which is what the Taoiseach is proposing.  I am suggesting also that the case put forward by the Taoiseach is singularly unconvincing, which makes it all the more necessary for us to examine the possible reasons&mdash;the reasons he did not give&mdash;for supporting the motion, which he is asking the House to do.</P>
      <P>On that basis one might have expected that the Government would have welcomed the opportunity to discuss the subject matter of Motion No. 17.  I should have thought the Government would have welcomed the opportunity to spell out in as much detail as they thought feasible their intentions in regard to the content of Motion No. 17.  Thus, if their intentions were, as one would hope, that by so doing the Government could assist trade unionists in making up their minds as to how they should vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>That Government business, as <Col N="431" /> ordered today, be not interrupted if under consideration at the time fixed for taking Private Members' Business.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that Motion No. 17 under the Rules of the House had obtained precedence and, but for the motion of the Taoiseach, if passed, would be discussed this evening, in those circumstances the content of the Taoiseach's motion is, in effect, that the House today will not discuss the motion in my name in relation to income tax allowances.

I do so very much on the grounds already made and that is that the business proposed to be taken is not of the nature that was envisaged in Standing Order No. 83 which would have given to the Government, and has given to Governments in the past and, no doubt, will be given to Governments in the future, the right under that Standing Order to dispense with time being given for Private Members' Motions.</P>
      <P>While the Private Members' Motion that would have immediately come on and will come on at the commencement of Private Members' Time, is undoubtedly of very great importance and significance and timely from the point of view of its introduction here prior to the composition of the various elements of the budget that we will see in due course, I think that this operation of precedents procedure, which is laid down in Standing Orders, is one which, perhaps, is really the cause of the whole situation here this evening.  To explain that I should say that the motion which stands in my name, following the motion in Deputy Colley's name, is the one which sparked off the precedents procedure and that when I put in this motion as the only way in which a Private Member in the true sense in this House could get a say on the most vital issue that may be before us either now or in the future, it was by the operation of this particular Standing Order that I sought precedence for Motion No. 18 on the Order Paper today.  Subsequently, as was his right and the right of any other Deputy who had a motion prior to that for Private Members' consideration, Deputy Colley would then have claimed precedence and, therefore, is entitled to precedence for his Motion No. 17 on today's Order Paper, as against my motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that it is not item No. 17 <Col N="434" /> that the Government are really backing away from, but item No. 18 which is not only topical but, perhaps, would be highly embarrassing to the Government and, indeed, to the Taoiseach himself and to those who spoke in 1949 on the subject matter of which Motion No. 18 now forms a part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates that he is moving very close to discussing the subject matter of his motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that fully, but in my efforts to try to be relevant and understood in what I am trying to contribute on this matter of my objection&mdash;the cessation or the non-provision of time for Private Members' Motions&mdash;I think it is necessary to differentiate between the motives underlying the Government's and the Taoiseach's denial of this right here this evening.  That should not possibly be confused in the public mind with a rejection of Deputy Colley's motion in regard to taxation and the reliefs of taxation, but should be directly related to what I think it is&mdash;a backing away or a shying away from a firm resolution of May, 1949, which, as I say, would be highly embarrassing to the Government and front bench spokesmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, let me now say that if I were given time it was my intention to have sought from the Fianna Fáil Party precedence over their precedence, but in this event neither of us apparently, is going to have an opportunity to discuss either of the two motions.  Therefore, my appeal in that regard does not properly arise until this matter has been determined by the House.  I think that item No. 18 on today's Order Paper is the more vital and embarrassing one.  It is that item from which the Government are backing down.  They have to face it sooner or later.  Putting back the business today and not giving us time will mean that if, in fact, we get time tomorrow evening it will be the week after next before item No. 18 on today's Order Paper will be arrived at.  If we are denied time today and tomorrow it will be a <Col N="435" /> fortnight from today before the item will be taken.  I cannot see that that duration of time will save the Government the embarrassment that Motion No. 18 will create.  Neither can I see how any Government at this juncture in this session can really put to this House with a straight face the proposition that the business to be conducted here today is of such a nature that it is entitled to preclude the right of Private Members or Members of the House discussing Private Members' Motions.</P>
    <P>I persist in saying again that there is no other way open to me, or to the only other Deputy who does not belong to one of the organised parties, in which my right and the right of my other Independent colleague in this House can be preserved, except by preserving the traditional and long-established right of time being provided a couple of times a week, particularly from this session onwards, to enable any and all Deputies, regardless of whether they belong to a big party, a small party or no party at all, to have an equal say and an equal right to put before this House, the Deputies and the Government, their views on any particular issue.</P>
    <P>This is a denial of that right particularly in the case of the Independent Deputies.  There are only two Independent Deputies.  The fact that there are only two does not take away from the fact that their right is being filched from them.  The Opposition can and will in various ways fight the issue with the Whips of the Government Parties to provide for time for any particular matter.  Independent Deputies have no such right or facility.  This is a denial that should not be lightly passed over by this House.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach, no matter what are his reasons at the moment&mdash;and those reasons do not seem to conform with what is contained in Standing Order No. 83&mdash;to reconsider the idea and to let us get on with Private Members' Time, beginning this evening, so that these rights will be preserved and the voice <Col N="436" /> of those who do not belong to an organised party of any size will have that right continued and maintained.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be unreasonable about this but I would like to point out to the three Deputies who have spoken, all of whom are former Ministers, that the procedure adopted here is nothing new.  I have here before me a report of a Dáil Debate in 1961.  The then Taoiseach, the late Mr. Seán Lemass, moved precisely the same form of motion as I moved.  As most Deputies know&mdash;and certainly as the three former Ministers know&mdash;it is not the practice, when financial business is before the Dáil to take Private Deputies' Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition is aware that it has now become a well established practice in this House to take Token Estimates, mainly because they are not disposed of; this did not arise only last year; it arose in previous years.  Deputy Colley referred to the fact that last year the House did not sit; that is true; it did not sit until after the election.  In 1969 the election was not until the Summer. Private Deputies' Time in that period was taken on ten occasions.  In 1970&mdash; the year in which there was no election&mdash;it was taken on one occasion only in that period of the year.  It has been, as I say, the practice not to take Private Deputies' Time when there is financial business.  The reason financial business was put down today was precisely to facilitate the Opposition who asked that the Constituencies Bill be not taken.  In order to accommodate the Opposition, we deferred the taking of it and now we are criticised for not giving time to Private Deputies' Business even though we gave it six hours last week.  Although the Dáil disposed of the Second Stage of the Constituencies Bill in December, the Opposition still asked us to postpone it and we agreed to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the Government are concerned, we want to be as reasonable as possible in the ordering of Business, and that includes Deputy Blaney's motion or anybody else's motion.  As <Col N="437" /> far as I am concerned, I do not mind where criticism comes from, inside or outside the House.  I have taken a fair amount of it in my time, sometimes at close quarters and it does not upset me. I suppose I should pay particular attention when I find Deputy Blaney, Deputy J. Lynch and Deputy Colley on the one side.  Maybe Deputy Blaney will be in the RDS before the weekend is out.</P>

      <P>As far as we are concerned, I want to be reasonable about this but we fixed the Business precisely to suit the Opposition. Having done that, we are now criticised for the way in which it was ordered.  As far as the Government are concerned we are prepared to discuss with the Whips any reasonable arrangement for the ordering of Business.  But it was in order to accommodate the Opposition that we deferred taking the Constituencies Bill and ordered Business in the way in which it has been done.  I think that is a reasonable approach.  The procedure in most recent years shows that there was no very clear pattern; in fact, on other occasions the time given was: nil in one; one day in another; ten in another and, in two other years, it varied between 20 and 13.</P>
      <P>As the former Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass said, in regard to the general practice&mdash;it was not the procedure, when there was financial business before the House, to provide Private Deputies' Time.  That was in 1961&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare (Agricultural Employees) Regulations, 1974: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Social Welfare (Agricultural Employees) Regulations, 1974, proposed to be made by the Minister for Social Welfare and laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 20th day of December, 1973, under subsection (4) of Section 10 of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, be approved.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these regulations is to bring male and female argicultural workers into the pay-related benefit scheme from the start.  That scheme is provided for under the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, and the necessary order has been made to bring it into operation from the beginning of the next income tax year on 6th April, 1974.</P>
      <P>The scheme is designed for persons whose social insurance covers them for disability benefit, maternity allowance and unemployment benefit.  Pay-related benefit will be paid as a supplement to these flat rate benefits during periods of incapacity for work or unemployment. Benefit will be based on the claimant's earnings in a previous income tax year and particulars of these earnings will be supplied to my Department by the Revenue Commissioners. The scheme will be financed by pay-related contributions levied on employers and employees. These contributions will amount to 3 per cent of the employee's current earnings up to a ceiling of £2,500 in the year, the employer paying 2 per cent and the employee 1 per cent.  They will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners through the income tax collection machinery, mainly by way of PAYE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Act was introduced and, indeed, during the course of its passage through the Oireachtas, it was envisaged that the scheme would, initially, cover only persons paying the ordinary flat-rate social insurance contributions because of the difficulties encountered in arranging a system of collecting pay-related contributions outside that sector.  The persons covered by the scheme would thus all be in industrial, commercial and services-type employment.  With the abolition from 1st April, 1974, of the remuneration limit of £1,600 for social insurance in the case of non-manual workers, all employees in those employments will be brought within the scope of the pay-related benefit <Col N="443" /> scheme.  The main groups of workers not included in the scheme although insured for disability benefit, maternity allowance and unemployment benefit purposes were male and female agricultural workers.  Section 10 of the Act, however, gave power for the making of regulations to extend the scheme to cover classes of employees other than those paying the ordinary rate of social insurance contribution.</P>
    <P>It had always been the intention to have the coverage of the scheme as wide as possible and to bring agricultural workers in particular into the scheme as soon as it was feasible to do so.  With this in mind, officials of my Department and of Revenue continued to explore the matter after the Act had been passed.  As a result of their examination, the Revenue Commissioners have agreed to undertake the collection of pay-related contributions from employees in the agricultural sector from 6th April next.  It will, therefore, be possible to bring agricultural workers, both male and female, into the scheme from the start and regulations for that purpose have been prepared as provided for in section 10 of the Act.  That section, however, requires that drafts of the regulations must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations cannot be made until the draft has been approved by resolution in each House.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations which are the subject of this resolution will apply the provisions of the 1973 Act to persons employed in agriculture for whom the special agricultural rates of social insurance contributions are payable by including pay derived from employment in agriculture in the definition of earnings reckonable for the purposes of pay-related benefit and contributions.</P>
    <P>I recommend these regulations for the approval of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am naturally very pleased that the provisions of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, will shortly come into operation.  Of course, this Act is one which was piloted through the House by my colleague.  Deputy Joe <Col N="444" /> Brennan, when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  The Act is a significant step forward in the development of our social insurance scheme and it helps bring our code into line with the social insurance codes in the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>The Act, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, was designed to ensure that insured workers would receive unemployment and sickness benefits which would have a reasonable relationship to their normal income and would complement the flat rate payments. Benefits over the years had to be increased quite considerably. Nevertheless it was easy to appreciate how the system as it stands could not give the advantages which are apparent in the pay-related benefit scheme and those who suffered a severe drop in their standard of living when unemployed or ill were naturally very anxious that this scheme should be implemented.  I have no doubt they will accept that the extra charge on their income when they are working will be well worthwhile.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil were in office they were criticised by the then Opposition for not bringing in the Pay-Related Benefit Bill earlier.  However, I think it is now appreciated that the problem in a country such as ours, related not only to the collection of contributions but to obtaining accurate information regarding incomes, is a very complex one.  When we were satisfied that the necessary machinery was available and capable of giving the required information there was no hesitation in bringing in the measure.  This measure had in fact been promised by us in the <i>Third Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> The date of its implementation, the 6th April, 1974, was also criticised as being delayed too long but quite obviously the problems facing the then Minister for Social Welfare are now understood by the present Government because the date nominated by us has been adhered to by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in the motion before the House proposes to bring agricultural workers within the scope of the scheme by regulation.  I support him in this.  I think it is only <Col N="445" /> fair to say that the previous Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Joe Brennan, was also anxious that the agricultural workers should be included as soon as it was possible to do so.  In fact he promised to bend all his energies before the implementation date towards overcoming the problems so that he would be able to bring them into the scheme.  There is no need for me to emphasise the fact that the agricultural worker is a highly skilled worker.  He works in our most important industry.  There is no need either for me to emphasise that we should ensure that he gets equal treatment with his co-worker in any other sphere of our economic life.  The decision not to include agricultural workers for the time being was taken by the previous Minister simply because of the difficulty of obtaining precise information in relation to income. The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that this problem has been overcome.  Perhaps he might give us some details in his reply.</P>
    <P>The former Minister pointed out, when the Bill was going through the House, that he was making provision to enable agricultural workers to be brought into the scheme by regulation and that coverage would be extended to them as soon as possible.  He had to decide at the time whether he should hold up the whole Bill and deprive other workers of these benefits while endeavouring to find a solution to the problems relating to agricultural workers, or whether he should proceed with the Bill and, in the meantime, between the time the Bill was enacted and the date of its implementation, endeavour to reach a solution to the problems while at the same time ensuring that, having reached a solution, enabling power would be available to include agricultural workers immediately. The Minister for Social Welfare at that time pointed out that the Minister for Finance was investigating the position and that as soon as a solution was arrived at he would be delighted to include agricultural workers in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I intended to raise a question about the position of domestic workers in relation to the pay related benefits scheme but, in reply to a question on <Col N="446" /> Thursday last, the Parliamentary Secretary told me he was having this aspect of the matter examined.  There is one other point I should like to raise.  In the explanatory note to the original document which was circulated, it is stated that the Revenue Commissioners will supply particulars of the earnings reckonable for this purpose and will collect the pay related contributions mainly through the PAYE system.  I should like to know what is meant by &ldquo;mainly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I am very pleased that the agricultural workers are now being brought into the pay-related benefits scheme.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will continue to develop this scheme to include other workers and in particular that he will extend the scope of the scheme.  As was pointed out when the Bill was going through the House, while to begin with it was intended to cover certain aspects only, such as unemployment and illness, the intention was eventually to extend the scheme to cover pensions and other such matters.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will continue to develop the scheme.</P>

      <P>I should also like to welcome this order.  It raises the whole status of our social welfare benefits schemes.  I note that it is an on-going operation and I hope that this time next year we will see further improvements. Like Deputy Faulkner I had intended to raise the matter of people in domestic service but, as he said, the Parliamentary Secretary has already replied to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask him one other question which he may have answered elsewhere.  How would a self-employed worker be affected?  Would he have any benefits coming to him or would he have to pay tax?  He certainly would not have to pay an employer's contribution.  I should also like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the case of a worker who is not liable for benefit under the Redundancy Payments Acts.  He has to work at least 20 hours a week before he qualifies for redundancy payments.  Is he penalised in any way under this <Col N="447" /> order and, if so, would the Parliamentary Secretary look at that matter?  I welcome the order.</P>

      <P>I welcome the contributions made by Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Moore.  Undoubtedly there were difficulties with regard to the inclusion of agricultural workers in the pay-related benefits scheme.  The Minister was extremely anxious that they should be included and, after further investigation and discussions with the Revenue people, it was found possible to include them.  I am glad Deputy Faulkner agrees with the desirability of doing this when it was found possible to do it.</P>
      <P>Questions were raised about the self-employed and about pay related pensions.  These are both areas in which it is very desirable that extensions should be made.  It is Government policy to have as full and as comprehensive coverage as possible under the social security system.  Some progress has already been made on the question of the self-employed. This was not an easy task, as I am sure Deputies will realise when they recognise that the percentage of self-employed in this country is approximately 31 as compared with 7.5 in Great Britain.  This presents a very considerable problem in extending coverage to them.  However, we have been giving this matter active consideration at home and the Government, apart from that, had included in the social action programme of the EEC as a priority the question of examining the position of persons within the community who were not covered or who were inadequately covered by social services.  This, of course, would affect the position of the self-employed here.  This is not an area which has been neglected by the Government.  Indeed, significant progress has been made in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner raised the question of pay-related pensions.  This is a most desirable development.  There is no question about that.  I am sure the Deputy will also realise that it is a <Col N="448" /> very complex area, indeed, and one to which very serious consideration would have to be given before it could be introduced.  The Minister intends to examine the question of extending pay-related benefits to pay-related pensions after a full examination of all the implications of doing that has been carried out.  I can assure the House that these matters are receiving attention and I welcome the fact that they have been brought to our notice once again here this afternoon.</P>

      <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary what exactly was meant by &ldquo;mainly through the PAYE system&rdquo;.  As I understand it, 3 per cent of the gross earnings of an employee will be sent by the employer to the Revenue Commissioners through the PAYE system.  Obviously there must be some other way in which part of it will be sent because the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; was used.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has not got the reply now, perhaps it would be convenient for him to let me have it at some other date because I would like to know what &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Social Welfare (Alteration of Rates of Contributions) Regulations, 1974, proposed to be made by the Minister for Social Welfare and laid in draft, sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, before Dáil Éireann on the 31st day of December, 1973, under subsection (9) of section 6 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for these regulations arises as a direct consequence of the introduction of the pay-related benefit scheme. Under that scheme, pay-related benefit <Col N="449" /> will be payable to persons in the form of a supplement to certain flat rate benefits during illness or unemployment. The rate of benefit will be calculated on the part of the claimant's reckonable weekly earnings in a previous income tax year, which lies between £14 and £50.  To finance the scheme a pay-related contribution amounting in all to 3 per cent of the employee's current earnings will be charged of which the employer will bear 2 per cent and the employee 1 per cent.  The contributions will be collected by the Collector-General of Revenue through the income tax system mainly with PAYE.  In order to facilitate the collection of contributions, it is necessary to charge contributions on all earnings up to the ceiling of £2,500 in the year.  The effect of this will be that pay-related contributions will be levied on pay up to £700 in the year, which is the equivalent of £14 a week for pay-related benefit purposes. This pay will not attract any pay-related benefit and there will thus be what amounts to an overcharge of pay-related contributions on it.  It is therefore necessary to compensate employers and employees for this overcharge and the most practical way in which this can be done is by reducing the flat rate contributions.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these regulations is to make appropriate reductions in the flat rate social insurance contributions payable in respect of persons who will be within the scope of the pay-related benefit scheme.  The rates being reduced are the ordinary rates which are payable in general by persons in industrial, commercial and services-type employments and the special rates payable by male and female agricultural workers, who are being brought into the scheme by regulations, drafts of which have already been approved by this House.</P>
    <P>The amount of the reduction proposed for the 3 per cent levied on pay up to £14 a week is 42p per week and, as the employer is liable for 2 per cent of the pay-related contribution as against the employee's 1 per cent, his element of the flat rate contribution is being reduced by 28p per week while the employee's element is being reduced by 14p per week.  These reductions <Col N="450" /> being in a flat rate contribution are of necessity themselves flat rate and affect all persons paying the contributions equally regardless of earnings.</P>
    <P>The liability for pay-related contributions will commence as from Saturday, 6th April, 1974, which is the start of the 1974-75 income tax year, and I propose that the reduction in the appropriate flat rate contributions should take effect as from Monday, 1st April, 1974, which is the start of the first contribution week in that year.</P>
    <P>The regulations for this purpose which it is proposed to make under subsection (9) of section 6 of the Social Welfare Act 1952, may not be made until a resolution approving of the draft regulations has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I recommend the draft regulations for the approval of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the motion on the alteration of rates of contribution regulations, I must admit that I was mystified for some time in regard to the price of stamps to the employer and to the employee referred to in the motion.  I was unable to relate its price to the price of the stamp for 1972-73 or 1973-74, but I made some inquiries and I now understand it relates specifically to the cost of the stamp for social insurance purposes only and does not refer to redundancy, health or occupational injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was, of course, a need to reduce the total payments under the pay-related benefit scheme in relation to the stamp and to the percentage of gross earnings, because earnings up to £14 a week, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, did not attract pay-related benefits.  The way in which the deductions were estimated would appear to be equitable. However, when one notes, in the information I have from replies the Parliamentary Secretary gave me to questions the other day, that the cost of the scheme for the next 12 months will be £10 million and the income from 3 per cent of gross earnings, less the reduced stamp contribution, would be £12.7 million, I just wonder <Col N="451" /> why it has been found necessary to have a surplus of £2.7 million over and above the cost of the scheme.  I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would explain this.  I should also like him to let me know when those who will soon be in the pay-related benefits scheme will benefit from the scheme, and also if any other changes will be necessary in the contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner has raised a few points on which I should like to comment.  As the House is fully aware, this is a new scheme and we can only estimate as to what charges might be made against the fund that is being established.  If it is found after the scheme has been in operation for some time that there is a surplus, allowing for normal safeguards against fluctuations and claims, the matter will be re-examined to see whether it is possible either to reduce the cost of the scheme or to pay increased benefits.  It is usual in the case of new schemes of this nature to await a certain period of operation to see how they work out.  When the scheme commences at the beginning of April people will qualify immediately for benefit provided they fulfil all the necessary conditions.</P>
      <P>It is not anticipated at this stage that there will be any increase in the cost of the scheme, but some adjustment of the cost of the stamp would be necessary if there were any increases or additions as a result of budgetary proposals.  Outside that possibility, it is not anticipated that there will be any change in the foreseeable future as regards the cost of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to extend CIE's long-term borrowing powers for capital purposes and also to increase the limit on the board's temporary borrowing powers.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the Bill itself I propose to review briefly the position of CIE in recent years.  As Deputies are aware, there has been a serious deterioration in CIE's financial position since 1969 when the amount of the board's statutory grant was fixed at £2.65 million per annum.  The board's losses have increased from over £3 million in 1969-70 to over £8 million in 1972-73 and there will be a further substantial increase in the current financial year.  The increased losses have been incurred mainly on the railway but the position has been aggravated by a decline into a loss-making situation of hitherto profitable road services.  Increases in rates and fares sought by the board in 1972 were postponed for almost a year pending completion of an investigation by the National Prices Commission and this, of course, has contributed significantly to the losses.</P>
      <P>The investigations carried out by McKinsey &amp; Co. in 1971 showed that CIE's increasing losses were due mainly to inflation and to growing competition from private transport.  The consultants carried out a broad cost/benefit analysis of railway operations and found that even when given credit for all the social benefits which it could be deemed to render to the community, the railway still incurred substantial losses and, leaving aside transitional costs, could be replaced more economically by an all road system.  However, the inclusion of unavoidable transitional costs, mainly costs of redundancy, altered the position and the consultants found that, from a community standpoint, the best course of action was to retain the railway but to selectively modify and develop it so as to bring social costs and benefits more closely into line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE, on the basis of the general <Col N="454" /> recommendations of the consultants, have been developing specific plans for the rationalisation of mainline railway operations and improvements in operating practices which will involve, <i>inter alia</i>, increased capital investment in modernising terminals, rolling stock, track and signalling.  These plans are at present under examination and I hope to secure the early approval of the Government for CIE to proceed on the lines proposed.  Because the costs of the railway consist so largely of labour costs any financial improvement will involve some redundancy but it is envisaged that this can largely be met by natural wastage.  The whole plan will in any case be discussed by CIE with the trade unions.</P>
    <P>By the use of imaginative marketing and promotional campaigns CIE have achieved a considerable increase in the number of passengers travelling by rail.  Almost 12 million were carried in 1972-73 which represents an increase of 8 per cent over 1971-72, which itself had shown an increase of 6½ per cent over the previous year.  The introduction of the new air-conditioned super trains which brought a new standard of passenger comfort, speed and convenience was also a contributory factor.  Dublin suburban commuter rail traffic also continued to expand in 1972-73 showing a growth of 7½ per cent on the previous year.  New push/pull train units were introduced to improve these services.  tons was marginally higher in 1972-73 than in the previous year.  The liner train concept was further developed and the demand for unit load container conveyance and for further extensions of pallets continued to grow.</P>
    <P>There was also an expansion in CIE's road services.  Dublin city buses carried 210 million passengers in 1972-73, an increase of 9.5 million on the previous year.  Sixty-two million passengers were carried on the board's provincial long distance and city bus services, excluding special school services, in 1972-73, an increase of two million over the previous year.  A major bus passenger survey has recently been carried out by CIE and Rail freight tonnage at 3.65 million the information obtained will form <Col N="455" /> the basis of a new overall provincial bus policy plan which is being formulated. In the road freight section the total tonnage carried in 1972-73 was 5.7 million tons which was 2 per cent higher than in the previous year. CIE's shipping and air freight services, which are conducted through Irish Ferryways and Aerlod Teoranta, showed larger turnover and increased profitability in spite of the severe competition in sea and air freight.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as I have already indicated, these improvements have not been sufficient to counteract the prevailing economic forces and the board's deficits still continue to grow. The railway deficit in 1972-73 was £7.695 million, an increase of £980,000 on the deficit in 1971-72. Notwithstanding the increase in the number of passengers carried, a loss of £360,000 was incurred on the Dublin city bus services compared with a profit of £185,000 in 1971-72. The provincial bus services showed a decline in profits from £550,000 in 1971-72 to £319,000 in 1972-73.  Road freight services, however, showed a small profit of £22,000 compared with a loss of £134,000 in 1971-72.</P>
    <P>The existing blanket type subvention paid to CIE will no longer be appropriate under EEC regulations and proposals for a new subvention structure to meet EEC requirements are at present nearing completion.</P>
    <P>The immediate need for the present Bill is to enable CIE to take up a loan of £4 million which has been approved by the European Investment Bank for a term of 20 years at a proposed rate of interest of 8¾ per cent. At present CIE's long-term capital borrowing powers are confined to borrowing from the Minister for Finance and it is necessary, therefore, to extend these powers so as to enable the board to take up the proposed loan from the EIB and also to avail of any other sources of finance which might be found attractive.  It is expected, however, that the Exchequer will still remain the main source of loan finance for CIE's capital expenditure.  Borrowing from sources other than the Exchequer will be subject to my prior <Col N="456" /> consent and the approval of the Minister for Finance, who will be empowered to guarantee such borrowings.</P>
    <P>The EIB loan is related to the board's railway investment programme and will contribute in particular to improvements in passenger train services, wagon load freight services, terminal facilities and the signalling system.  These improvements will enable the provision of faster and more frequent passenger trains with modern carriages and the concentration of freight traffic on fully fitted block trains.  We would hope that these measures will lead to a significant increase in traffic by rail.  By granting the loan of £4 million, the European Investment Bank is helping the railway to remain an essential part of Ireland's transport system and to play its part in the progress of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The limit on the board's capital borrowing powers and on Exchequer capital advances to CIE was increased from £6 million to £17 million under the Transport Act, 1969.  The £17 million provision is now almost exhausted and it is proposed to extend the limit to £55 million, that is, an increase of £38 million.  This sum, together with the board's depreciation provisions, will be available to meet future capital expenditure by the board.  It will enable the board to continue with their policy of modernising their services and improving standards. In addition to the proposals already mentioned for modernising mainline railway operations, CIE are also preparing plans for the improvement of the Dublin rail commuter services.  As Deputies are aware, the Government recently approved in principle of the development of these services to play the maximum role possible in helping to relieve the city's present congestion problems.</P>
    <P>Provision is also being made in the Bill for an increase from £2 million to £5 million in CIE's temporary borrowing powers.  The existing limit of £2 million was fixed in 1958 and is now an inadequate safeguard against possible short-term cash difficulties. This has been evident in recent years when Supplementary Estimates have <Col N="457" /> had to be introduced at short notice to ensure that the board would have sufficient cash to meet their current requirements.</P>
    <P>The contract for the European Investment Bank loan cannot be concluded pending the enactment of legislation, as provided for in this Bill, to extend the scope of CIE's borrowing powers.  The next meeting of the Board of the European Investment Bank will take place on 19th February and, to avoid the possibility of the interest rate on the proposed loan being increased, the intention is that, provided the Bill has been enacted, the contract will be concluded by that date.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, greatly appreciate it if the House would agree to give a quick passage to the Bill.  There will be an opportunity for a further discussion on CIE on the occasion of the debate on my Department's Estimates.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We will co-operate with the Minister by giving this Bill a quick passage through the House.  It must be admitted that the interest rate he has mentioned seems very attractive.  We feel it our duty to give CIE every facility to avail of this very good interest rate and we will not in any way jeopardise their signing of the contract before the 19th February. I say this to assure the Minister of our co-operation.  There will be ample time for us to debate CIE and all other matters relating to the Minister's Department later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice from Bord Fáilte brochures that if one lands at Dublin with Aer Lingus one can travel to any part of Ireland and back for a single fare. This is an admirable thing and undoubtedly it will help to attract tourists from Britain, tourists whom we will welcome with open arms.  In order to do this there must be some form of subsidy involved.  Perhaps the Minister would recommend to CIE that in view of present oil prices and their effect on our overall economic situation&mdash;our balance of payments position will undoubtedly disimprove greatly&mdash;the question of doing something <Col N="458" /> about the cost of freight in regard to agriculture should be considered. Agriculture is undoubtedly our mainstay in fighting our balance of payments deficit.  There has been a tremendous increase in the price of fertilisers, feeding stuffs <i>et cetera</i>.  The Minister might consider some form of subsidy of all agricultural freight rates so as to make our agricultural industry more competitive for the coming year and so improve our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell us when this loan was negotiated.  If it was negotiated during the last session perhaps his Bill could have been before the House in the last session.</P>

      <P>It is wonderful to be able to say some good things about CIE because they have been the butt of criticism for a long time.  It is good to see that they are successful in some fields at least. In other fields they are not successful and it is not always the fault of CIE. CIE seem to be a very necessary aspect of our economic structure and of our social life in view of the large number of employees involved.  I hope they can come up with imaginative ideas in other fields of activity.  I should like to assure the Minister of a quick passage for this Bill in order to facilitate this very attractive loan which CIE have succeeded in negotiating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill as a step forward in endeavouring to make CIE more efficient. I note from the Minister's speech that the emphasis is on rail transport.  This is symptomatic, perhaps, of the appalling tragedies that are happening on our roads.  Our roads are choked with motor cars and continental lorries and they are not <Col N="459" /> geared to this kind of traffic.  As a result we have tragedies every week in our city and throughout the country.  I hope that the Minister will cause an investigation to be held, in association with the Minister for Local Government, into those appalling tragedies which have become an accepted, normal feature of national life.</P>
      <P>According to the Minister's brief a development of our rail system is envisaged. Our rail system served the country very well in the past.  We can see with hindsight that mistakes were made in closing certain branch lines in the country and particularly in Dublin where suburban areas are now being developed.  I hope that with the co-operation of CIE and the other authorities responsible for making provision for people who have to travel that we will see an improvement in the future.</P>
      <P>I should like to express the public disappointment with CIE's city bus services.  There is a general feeling of dissatisfaction in regard to the Dublin bus service.  An investigation should be carried out to improve the lot of those people in the city who have not an alternative means of transport.  As one who travels around the city on buses a good deal I am in a position to speak of the defects in the bus system.  It may be necessary to carry out some research or investigation into the workings of the bus transport system in Dublin city but it should be borne in mind that this greatly affects those living in outlying areas who are entirely dependent on the bus service.  Bus times can be very unreliable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies opposite for their courtesy and consideration in getting this Bill through.  The time schedule, as the Deputies are aware, is very tight. The Bill must be with the Seanad tomorrow and be signed by the President five days afterwards which will be a couple of hours before the loan can be signed.  The loan was negotiated in December and the Bill was <Col N="460" /> introduced on the first sitting day of this session, last Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Barrett has stated, the rates of interest are very attractive. They may be altered next month and we must remember that the only way they can go is upwards.  I hope it will be possible for CIE to conclude this loan and have it available to themselves almost immediately. The morale in CIE, in my view, is improving.  The imaginative way in which they sold their rail passenger transport has been very effective.  It has not alone been effective in attracting passengers to the train service but it has been effective in improving the image of CIE, a most beneficial effect.  One of the greatest effects is the way in which it has raised the morale of those involved in the rail service in CIE.  They are now proud to work in the company.</P>
      <P>Anybody who travels by CIE appreciates the service, courtesy and efficiency.  About a fortnight ago when one of the mainline trains was 1½ hours late there were complaints, an indication of how unusual such a delay is with CIE.  If such delays were common CIE would not have received any complaints.  A large number of the trains leave on time and arrive on time and are comfortable and clean. The passengers are also able to obtain acceptable food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure what Deputy Barrett means when he referred to, &ldquo;going one way and returning free&rdquo;.  This is an ordinary commercial attraction CIE offer and there is no more greater element of subsidy in it than the plastic spoon tied on to a bottle of orange squash on sale in a supermarket. It is an attraction to get people to travel by train.  CIE's argument for &ldquo;going one way and returning free&rdquo; is that if a person books to travel they will have to send a train to bring that person back and it is in an effort to fill the trains going in both directions that they have introduced this system.  It would not be possible under CIE regulations to give a subsidy for the carriage of agricultural produce and it will not be possible in future to give a blanket subsidy to CIE.  Each amount of money will have <Col N="461" /> to be justified for specific reasons such as social reasons or reasons of that nature.  It will not be possible any more to give a blanket subsidy as we have been doing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also referred to the cost of oil in our balance of payments. This is something which I believe has not yet been appreciated in our country.  The change in our standard of living which the cost of oil will bring is not appreciated.  Oil doubled in price in November and again at the end of December.  Oil now is four times the price it was last October and this is bound to have an effect on our standard of living but it is something which may be helpful to CIE.</P>
    <P>However, it means the transferring of a large amount of money, not to entrepreneurs but directly from this country to the Arab nations.  It means the transferring of some of our wealth to the countries of the Middle East who are the beneficiaries of this increase.  They are the people who are going to get it but we must find some other way, from a balance of payments point of view, of earning money so that this will not be detrimental. In our own personal lives this will cost each of us something extra per annum, whether it is in the price of petrol, the price of heating oil for our houses or the extra cost of manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>A discussion on oil is basic to any discussion on the economy at the moment. However, this is a fact we have come to realise.  It is the most serious economic fact we have had in 25 years.  In fact, the war situation was more easily handled at the time because it was a case of unavailability of goods and they were rationed out the best way possible.  This is a different matter; this involves enormous increases in prices which affect everybody in their everyday dealings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmons mentioned the bus service and road passenger service. I dealt with these matters in my opening address.  A survey is being carried out at present on the provincial bus service with a view to reorganising it and selling this service to the general public.  I agree with everything the Deputy had to say <Col N="462" /> about the bus service in this city but I do not think CIE can be blamed for it.  It strikes me as very odd to see 50 or so cars with one passenger in each at a junction in the city while stuck in the middle of them is a bus that would carry all these motorists home more comfortably.  The Minister for Local Government, in conjunction with my Department, is investigating ways of improving the flow of traffic so that buses can be given a free run. Such an improvement would encourage more people to use the bus service.</P>
    <P>The cost of private transport may now benefit CIE and attract more people onto the city bus routes.  If one can get buses running freely, speedily and cheaply more people will leave their private cars at home; but the more people use their private cars the more difficult it is for the city buses to have a free run through the centre of the city.  A lot of thought will have to be given to this problem in Dublin and the other cities.  I feel the public will be pleased when they see the plans which CIE have for the future of their organisation in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm an order which was made by my predecessor under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, on the recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission, relating to the supply and distribution of grocery goods and also to confirm a related amending order which I have made.</P>
      <P>I would like to start by stating briefly my attitude in relation to the great changes in distribution which have occurred, most particularly in the food trades, and which are still occurring.  In the first place, I would say that progress means change, and change must, regrettably but inevitably, hurt some people.  To the extent that supermarkets, group buying, self-service and other modern developments mean greater efficiency, and consequently a reduction in ultimate costs to the consumer, I welcome these developments, and I shall do nothing to prohibit the general improvement of efficiency and economy by these means.  I recognise that the supermarket and the chain store have special advantages to offer the public, and that the public are entitled to these advantages.  At the same time, the independent trader, &ldquo;the small man&rdquo;, has a service to offer in other ways which his larger competitors cannot match.  The public are entitled to this service too, and the independent trader is entitled to protection, not from legitimate competition from the new media of distribution, but from any abuse of the economic power which they can build up.  It is my determination to protect the small trader from such abuse, and I believe this Bill goes no small way to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> Lest there be any misunderstanding of any intentions, I would like to make it clear that I have no intention of guaranteeing economic survival to any and every individual trader.  Even for the small shop, there are modern developments in methods of presentation, in promotion, in co-operative organisation which are probably essential to successful carrying on of the business.  I intend to make it possible for the individual shopkeeper to survive and prosper by his own energy, initiative and adaptability to new methods, but whether he actually shows these qualities will remain, as always, up to himself.  In a changing world, he will have to change, and no one can do it for him.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Bill itself, which, as I have said, is intended to give effect to orders made following an inquiry which the Restrictive Practices Commission undertook on their own initiative following numerous complaints of unfair trading practices in the grocery trade.  Almost 100 witnesses were examined in the course of the inquiry.  They included representatives of consumer interests, of distributors, both wholesale and retail, of manufacturers, of voluntary groups and of multiple supermarkets.</P>
    <P>The principal issue considered at the inquiry were:</P>
    <P>(a)  the allegation that large buyers, particularly supermarket chains, were able to secure from suppliers terms which were unfairly discriminatory against independent traders;</P>
    <P>(b)  the allegation that large buyers were thus enabled not only to have an unfair advantage in competition but also to adopt unfair methods of retailing; and</P>
    <P>(c)  the contention that a consequence of this situation would be the disappearance of many more small retailers and the attainment by a few large buyers of a position of complete dominance.</P>
    <P>The commission in their report make a distinction between &ldquo;standard terms of supply&rdquo; and &ldquo;supplementary terms of supply&rdquo;.  They define the former as the terms, usually in printed form, which are open, and seen to be <Col N="465" /> open, to all trade customers.  Supplementary terms are other terms which individual firms may negotiate, privately as a rule, with suppliers.</P>
    <P>The commission found that the standard terms of supply of many important suppliers were operated in such a way as to discriminate unfairly in favour of large supermarket chains and against independent retailers and wholesalers.  They recommended that standard terms and conditions of supply should be published, should be strictly observed in application, should be open to all traders meeting the relevant conditions and should not be set at unreasonable levels in such a way as to discriminate unfairly against any trader or to exclude new entrants.</P>
    <P>The commission found that suppliers were also operating supplementary terms of supply in the grocery trade.  These terms related to promotions, long-term supply agreements, advertising and merchandising.  Promotions are offers of a product at reduced prices for a short period, generally a fortnight, and advertising allowances are usually linked with them. Long-term agreements are agreements providing for the payment of extra rebates to firms which achieve agreed increases in sales.  Merchandising means, in the context of the inquiry, the activities performed by employees of suppliers in promoting goods in their customers' outlets.  The granting of these supplementary terms reflects the bargaining power of supermarket chains who were the main beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>The commission saw serious objections to these supplementary terms on the grounds that they were of an arbitrary character, favoured unfairly large-scale buyers, facilitated the application of pressure and abuse of economic power and resulted in unfair discrimination.  On the other hand, the commission considered that negotiation from strength and the securing of trading advantages are inherent in competition in a progressive industry and they felt, therefore, that an outright prohibition of supplementary terms would be unrealistic and recommended that instead suppliers should be required to apply these <Col N="466" /> terms in an equitable manner and without any unfair discrimination.</P>
    <P>The commission found also that there was discrimination in the granting of credit in favour of large supermarkets and they recommended that it should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>There are arrangements in the grocery trade whereby groups of manufacturers give terms to traders which are related, not to purchases from each individual manufacturer, but to aggregate purchases from all members of the group.  The commission considered that such arrangements involve a restriction of competition and lead to uniformity of pricing and they recommend that they should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>The commission considered that the use of &ldquo;loss leaders&rdquo;, that is, the practice of selling certain items below purchase price stimulated competition and should not be prohibited.  They considered, however, that advertising by supermarket chains of such prices in newspapers and other media created an unfavourable and misleading impression of prices in small independent outlets and increased the domination of the trade by large financial interests. They recommend that such advertising should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>On 21st February, 1973, my predecessor made an order giving effect to the commission's recommendations. The order departed from the recommendations in two respects.  First, whereas the commission had recommended that advertising allowances would be strictly related to services to be performed, examination has shown that this would be unenforceable in practice, and since the practice is not generally regarded in the trade as of particular value anyway it was decided instead to prohibit it completely.  Secondly, following representations that there was the possibility that Irish manufacturers might lose orders from large buyers because the order would impose on them restrictions not applicable in practice to foreign suppliers, the order provides for throwing light on any developments of this nature by requiring traders who import direct from suppliers abroad to register the full terms <Col N="467" /> and conditions of such purchases with the Examiner of Restrictive Practices, as our home suppliers have to do. Any attempt by traders to evade their obligations under the order in this way would be a serious matter, and I have made special arrangements to have a close eye kept on developments so that I may be able to take quick remedial action should that be necessary.</P>
    <P>The purpose of paragraph (a) of article 3 (3) of the order was to implement the commission's recommendation that where a supplier adopts quantity terms for the supply of grocery goods such terms should be set at realistic levels consistent with the encouragement of efficiency and economy in distribution.  The article as originally drafted however could be held to oblige a supplier in, say, Dublin, to charge a higher price for goods supplied to a customer in a remote country area than to one in Dublin.  While a supplier is free to do this it was of course never the intention that he should be obliged to do so.  To achieve the original intention it was necessary to amend the order.  I made the necessary amending order on 18th October, 1973, and I availed of the opportunity to make the article in question more precise and to simplify it.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me that the orders, by removing certain special discount advantages which are at present obtained by some distributors, could result in the general public paying more for their purchases.  This should certainly not be the case.  The orders specifically provide for reasonable discounts related to bulk purchases.  What they seek to prohibit is discount advantages over and above the economically justifiable level which some distributors could otherwise be able to demand by reason of their purchasing power. It is obvious that if a particular distributor loses sizeable special advantages of this sort there may have to be some increase in certain of his retail prices.  However, it can be assumed that where a supplier gave such special discounts he met the cost, not out of his profits, but by charging <Col N="468" /> more than he would otherwise do to his other distributor customers.  If, then, suppliers' prices to certain distributors go up by a certain amount, their prices to others should come down by an equivalent amount; and prices to retail customers of these distributors respond accordingly.  There is on this basis no net increase, but prices and costs are more equitably spread.  In actual practice however I would expect worthwhile economies in distribution costs to be achieved, since the highly uneconomic practice of having manufacturers deliver their goods in comparatively small parcels to a multiplicity of shops would be discouraged.  The economies resulting from a discontinuance of this practice should help to keep global prices down.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that suppliers may increase prices to certain of their customers as a result of these orders and that there is no guarantee that they will correspondingly reduce them to others.  I do not think there is any great danger of this in present conditions of competition, but in any event I have every confidence that the vigilance of the National Prices Commission will ensure that it does not occur.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, provides that orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas. The Bill now before the Dáil is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the orders. With a Bill of this kind, the orders which it is proposed to confirm may not be amended by the Oireachtas but must be accepted or rejected as they stand.  The matters with which the orders deal have been the subject of a lengthy and painstaking public Inquiry and report by the Restrictive Practices Commission.  The orders will go a long way to ensure fair play for the small shopkeeper and his customers and should put an end to the unfair practices in the grocery trade which have been so much complained of in recent years.</P>
    <P>I regard it as very much in the spirit which I have outlined at the outset, and I have no hesitation in recommending this Bill to the Dáil.</P>
    <Col N="469" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one which must be received with utmost reservation at the present time.  The Minister pointed out that he intends to be vigilant and that the Prices Commission will be active in monitoring the whole situation.  It is strange that in these times of raging price inflation these orders do not confer benefit on the consumer.  My colleague, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, brought in orders in March of last year in response to the examination already referred to carried out by the Fair Trade Commission over a long period.  In so far as the Bill seeks to safeguard the small trader from unfair competition, nobody can quarrel with that.  But it might tend to do other things and I appeal to the Minister to keep the situation under constant review.</P>
      <P>This Bill could bolster up the inefficient small trader and act against the more efficient and progressive trader.  Another effect could be to create a monopoly position among wholesalers.  Evidence is already available, even since my colleague first made these orders, that monopolies are being created in the wholesale distribution trade.  If that happens, we are really putting money into the pockets of the owners of the monopolies and we have no guarantee that the consumer will benefit in any way. We must remember the consumers at all times.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of what can happen when big monopolies move in to press out small businesses.  They may reach a stage where they tend to recoup themselves for any damage done while building up the monopoly.  The Prices Commission can check my statements, but I feel there is evidence that some of the big monopolies in the wholesale distribution trade which are tending to become bigger these days, are showing very large annual profits.  I do not know whether this is of any benefit to the consumer. For this reason these orders are fraught with danger for the future and particularly for the future welfare of the grocery trade and of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> A healthy sign is at present developing in the distribution field.  Retailers co-operatives are developing and expanding. They form a competitive bulwark to the wholesale monopoly. Real competition can take place in such circumstances.  All small traders are not members of retail co-operatives. I wish they were, because with the combined purchasing facilities which retail co-operatives can place at their disposal, small retailers can be in a position where they can compete and have healthy competition with the growing monopolies among the wholesale houses.</P>
    <P>The wholesale distribution trade in this country is virtually in the hands of three big concerns at the present time.  In recent times one of these has tended to become bigger and more powerful and to have greater economic power, than could possibly be possessed by any group at the time the former Minister made the order. I am reliably informed that this amending order we are confirming can result in a 5 per cent increase in profits to the wholesale distribution trade.  By this I mean the wholesale houses who are rapidly growing into a monopoly.</P>
    <P>The only real challenge to these monopolies in the wholesale warehouse business is the retail co-operative if it is sufficiently open to encompass without any restriction all the retailers who wish to participate. The Minister may be putting the cart before the horse in confirming these orders before he introduces legislation on monopolies.  I do not think the Minister has the necessary power without introducing a monopolies Bill or some legislation for the control of monopolies.</P>
    <P>We admit these orders may prevent supermarkets charging prices as low as they might otherwise do; in fact, it will result in their having to charge more for products.  If, as was shown by the examination of the Prices Commission, the benefits conferred on supermarkets by the original system of buying direct from manufacturers in large quantities and getting advantageous discounts was reacting to the detriment of small traders, that system could not be condoned.  Since the <Col N="471" /> former Minister made the order last March, I have a fear it has tended to create a monopoly in the wholesale distribution trade and this could have very serious effect on the small traders.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider the introduction of legislation with regard to monopolies; it need not necessarily be to control them.  Many monopolies have resulted in more efficient operation and better distribution with a distinct benefit to the consumer, but the reverse has been the case with regard to some monopolies. Some of them have too much economic power and this can be to the disadvantage of the small trader.</P>
    <P>We are now experiencing serious inflation and price increases are announced almost daily.  Today a trader gave me a circular he received from his supplier warning him that prices may change from the time he orders until the invoice is received. The impression given is that traders are lucky to receive the goods.  The scarcity of commodities has a bearing on the orders we are making now.  I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility that the small trader may not receive the goods or get the particular brand he wishes to sell.  The single purchase&mdash;what the trade calls &ldquo;the drop&rdquo;&mdash;encourages or perhaps obliges the purchaser to buy in large quantities.  If this is the case he will be obliged to buy the leader brand that is selling best on the market and is more expensively advertised.  This can have an effect on the small producer who has not the marketing power of the well-known brand.  We do not want to mention names but we can think of many brand names for jams, biscuits and so on.  That danger is inherent in the confirmation of these orders.  I am not trying to score points in my comments here; I realise the intention is good but the outcome could be different.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already sounded a warning note that there must be a good deal of surveillance of what will happen under these orders.  We all know the family grocer has had a difficult time.  In the past he was frequently asked to carry a considerable <Col N="472" /> amount of credit and to give a personal service to his customers but he found himself being passed by the big combines who could purchase on better terms.  While retail organisations have come to the rescue, I am not convinced all retailers were quick to grasp the opportunity to become members.  Perhaps some of the retail co-operatives are a little monopolistic.</P>
    <P>This should not be the case. Retailers should be assisted by the Prices Commission or some other organisation connected with the Department to get the full benefits of combined purchasing that is available so that they may offer real competition. In that way the consumer will benefit as a result of this competition.</P>
    <P>We are passing through a strange phase now in rapid development and changes in distribution practices, as the Minister outlined in the early part of his speech.  It is only natural that efficient traders will always find ways and means of improving their own cash flow and outlets.  But we must keep two things primarily in mind: that production will not be stunted and that the consumer will not be overcharged for what he is buying.  In between these two is the whole question, and problem, of distribution. If we can achieve efficient distribution to ensure that traders are not in any way victimised, one against the other; that restrictive practices do not operate unfairly to put people out of business but that efficiency, better distribution and rationalisation will be given a full chance to develop.  This I think, is the big task that underlies any effort which anybody responsible for consumer prices and for better production must be interested in at the present time.  I hope we are aware of what can happen from the time goods are produced until they come out of the basket in the home.  It is something which concerns everybody. However important it is&mdash;and I am fully in favour of giving a fair deal to the small retailer&mdash;the small retailer must grasp the opportunities available to him to create efficiency and take part in the power purchasing accessible now only in large measure to the bigger combines and supermarkets.  I think he can; there is sufficient <Col N="473" /> organisation building up, and retail co-operatives, to enable the retailer to take part in these better combines which will give him the same advantage as those who have the marketing power at the present time.</P>
    <P>We could easily move here in the wrong direction in the interests of protecting a very important section of the retail community.  This is the warning I would like to sound so far as this side of the House is concerned.  Orders made last year may not have the same relevance this year in view of rapidly changing circumstances, particularly in relation to supplies and to monopolistic situations rapidly developing.  And there are some giants being created in the wholesale distribution trade today. We should ensure that any monopolistic advantages they are getting ultimately will be passed on to the consumer, but&mdash;and this is where we must support the Minister in the confirmation orders&mdash;that, at the same time, they will not result in putting the small retailer out of business; will not just bolster up inefficiency in the matter of the retail business.</P>
    <P>Towards that end I advocate that the retailer should be assisted and encouraged to avail of the opportunities now presenting themselves by joining one or other of the good retailers co-operatives, thereby entering into competition with the very strong wholesalers in the distribution trade, rather than seeking protection from this House to enable him to remain in business if he is not himself making an effort to avail of the opportunity to protect himself and be as competitive as are the giants, because the tendency today in monopolies is something which could be rather serious.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying again to the Minister that monopolies legislation is overdue, monopolies legislation that will act as a watchdog to ensure that where monopolies are being created ultimately they are for the benefit of society and for the consumer. Some of them are.  Most of them ultimately can turn out to have the very opposite effect to that which they sought originally.  I was very young when transport was an open <Col N="474" /> competitive business in this country.  I remember two bus companies on one occasion reducing prices to the extent that one company had free fares on the journey from a part of Donegal, Carrigart, to Derry city.  Ultimately one of them got possession and then we paid for the cheap rates we had had until the monopoly was created.  This was before the days of the Public Transport Act.  I mention it only as an example of how competition ultimately can lead to a monopolistic situation where, eventually, the consumer pays.</P>
    <P>I see inherent in the Minister's confirmation of these orders&mdash;which the House will give him without a division&mdash;that a serious situation could develop unless there is continuous vigilance by the Prices Commission over how this operates.  I would ask the Minister to think seriously about the urgency of legislation to deal with monopolies, to think seriously about encouraging and making it possible, by any means available, for retailers to become part of some of the retail co-operative organisations which will give them the same economic power as that of the big wholesalers at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House long.  I want to compliment the Minister on the speed with which he has introduced the Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1974 and to say that on behalf of all the small traders in the Dublin north west constituency.</P>
      <P>I think the following part of the Minister's speech is terribly important:</P>
      <P>At the same time, the independent trader, &ldquo;the small man&rdquo;, has a service to offer in other ways which his larger competitors cannot match.  The public are entitled to this service too, and the independent trader is entitled to protection, not from legitimate competition from the new media of distribution, but from any abuse of the economic power which they can build up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection of the small retailer throughout our community is of the <Col N="475" /> utmost importance.  Of note in past years&mdash;with the combines set up in this country&mdash;has been the purchasing power and efficiency with which they could obtain large amounts of goods from abroad, bring them into this country and sell at a profit margin which was way above that of the small trader or those in less favourable conditions.  At one time some of the larger retailers in this country imported up to 55 per cent of the goods they offered.  They purchased these outside the country at reasonable rates and various checks on the general set-up were involved.</P>
    <P>Nobody can substitute for the family grocer, the local shop where one can always go in and out, get things marked up and where personal attention is given.  Nowadays one is confronted with the very impersonal service in supermarkets.  I wish to express agreement with the previous speaker that we here have a very general interest in the proposed Monopolies Bill.  The sooner it is introduced the better.  In the meantime, the Minister is to be complimented on introducing this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that in the calm and controlled economy of 1972, a Bill such as this would have been very welcome and, indeed, desirable. Now, however, I cannot but regard it as a cynical exercise when we have absolutely raging price increases, no control whatsoever over what the consumer is paying for his foodstuffs from one week to another and apparently no effort whatsoever being made to restore or to cut down the enormous increases being granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a Dáil comment today that the Government parties would not be like Fianna Fáil and have two budgets.  I submit that we are having a budget every week with price increases and, therefore, more money from VAT going into the Exchequer. Therefore, one cannot be blamed for viewing this bit of window dressing with a cynical eye.  Not alone are we in a serious situation but we are in a critically serious one in relation to food prices, and the Minister has <Col N="476" /> the audacity and the gall to come in here to try to sell this as being something concrete towards price stabilisation.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister doing about the deliberate hoarding of phosphates by big combines who are making it virtually impossible for smaller farmers to manure their lands?  What is he doing about the price of animal feeding stuffs?  Very little indeed.  One would suspect that the Minister does not know what is going on around him if one were not aware that the Minister is an intelligent man who must know.  A worse condemnation is to ask what is he doing about it.</P>
    <P>I must come to the conclusion that no positive action is being taken by the Government in relation to prices. Week after week the housewife is paying more and more for the same items.  Where will it all end?  Does the Minister seriously think that the introduction of a Bill such as this will benefit the consumer in this era of galloping price inflation?  I submit that if this is the Coalition's answer to pegging prices they have failed miserably. I am informed that at least 1,300 items have had price increases in the past 12 months, perhaps many more.  This has happened under a Government who made one of their election planks the pegging of prices. Indeed they implied that by doing away with VAT on food there would be a reduction in food prices.</P>
    <P>How can one take seriously this Bill and the sentiments expressed in it when the Government have failed so miserably on a much larger issue? The Minister has said the National Prices Commission will keep a close eye on prices and ensure that the terms of this Bill will be implemented. I wish him luck.  I hope he succeeds. Each one of us here represent poorer sections in the community who do not know what has hit them.  They were expecting a Utopia when the National Coalition with their open Government came in.  But what they have got is far from it.  What they have got is a living hell, week after week trying to meet their bills, to feed their families, to try to ensure that their children have enough nourishment to carry <Col N="477" /> them on from week to week.  I do not think I exaggerate the position when I say we have arrived at a crisis stage in relation to prices and this Bill, though it might have been very laudible in the controlled and calm economy of 1972, will have absolutely no bearing on what the consumer ultimately will have to pay for groceries.</P>
    <P>The sentiments in the Bill are laudable and nobody would disagree with them, but let this not be a substitute for courageous and positive action to ensure that we will not have other types of monopolies who will get away with any type of price increase they seek.  I refer to the prices of phosphates and animal feeding stuffs because the Minister and the Department have not been able to control these prices and farmers are going out of business.  I, who represent a community of small farmers regretfully say that in this House.</P>
    <P>Then, can the Minister blame me for throwing a cynical eye on this type of hogwash he brings before us as an excuse for doing something positive. There is no doubt that the action requiring to be taken needs to be much more drastic and revolutionary if we are to bring about a situation in which housewives know from week to week what they will have to pay for their goods.  We will have to do something more than increase the finances of the Government Information Service so that they can spew out their Gospel-like propaganda.</P>
    <P>The people are not being fooled and we on this side of the House will not be taken in or fooled by this sort of window-dressing.  I know the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a difficult time and that some of the price increases are outside his control but he could control many of them. The Government could do something about this matter but this is a typical dilemma in a situation in which you have a Government of extreme conservatives and extreme socialists.  You end up by getting nothing done.  If they were all extreme socialists or extreme conservatives you would get some action because they would have a co-ordinated policy.  Now, because of this dilemma and because of the <Col N="478" /> exhibition we saw here last week from Government speakers in relation to prices the people have lost complete confidence and faith in the Government to control the price of foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us when it will all stop, when can the housewife be sure that for any two consecutive weeks she will be able to go out and pay the same price for her groceries.  I would also like the Minister to tell us how he will ensure that there are no under the counter deals even after this Bill is introduced.  How do the Government intend to seek out and punish the hoarders who at the moment are hoarding phosphates and fertilisers on a massive scale?  It could be foodstuffs in the very near future. What type of protection have the community got against those manipulators?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has always expressed himself as being very concerned with the plight of the less well off members of our community.  I am surprised that he has now let things get out of hand the way they have.  We get no pleasure on this side of the House out of preaching gloomy facts but, nevertheless, we have an obligation as an Opposition to try to ensure that the people realise that this Government have failed totally to control prices because (a) they are divided among themselves about how to do it and (b) because they have been led up the garden path by certain advisers they have brought in from outside.</P>
    <P>How will the orders in this Bill break the monopolies and the rings in the grocery business?  We can assure the Minister that he will get every help and assistance from this side of the House but there is no good in saying he will do something about these people unless he does it.  The solving of that problem will be a very hard experience for the Minister.  Does he seriously think that this Bill will stabilise prices or reduce them?  The Minister may say that this Bill is to protect the smaller retailer but does it protect him?  It ensures that big groups should not seem to be getting an advantage over their smaller competitors  <Col N="479" /> but it is absolutely naive to suggest that the introduction of a Bill such as this will make these big capitalists turn away an order when they could get it for an extra 2½ per cent discount.  You will have wholesale abuse in this matter.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is as concerned as I am that something is done about the soaring food costs in the country but the difference between the Minister and me is that he is in a position to do something about it and I am not. If the Fianna Fáil Party were in Government at the moment we would not have the prices shambles we have. I urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to devote all his energies and his well endowed intellect to solving this problem.  As a socialist, he would then be performing his most important function, that is, looking after the less well of members of the community.  It might pinch the richer people but their standard of living does not drop like that of the poorer people.  They really get belted in a situation such as we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will bring some small relief to the consumer.  In my opinion this is getting away from the main problem, which has not to do with monopolies or small retailers, but has to do with excessive profiteering by manufacturers and others.  That is where the kernel of the problem is.  Unless and until the Minister attacks that problem he will have a similar situation.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in solving the problem but, if we are to take the performance of the Government up to now&mdash;and I mention the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; deliberately because, perhaps, the Minister is not his own master&mdash;the future is very bleak indeed.  The sooner the people get a chance of putting in a Government over there who will do something about prices the better it will be for the Irish people as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to mention one particular type of restrictive practice but, before doing so.  I should like to take up a point made by the <Col N="480" /> last speaker about poor people.  The number of poor people in this country has trebled since this Government took over and allowed prices to increase without control.  It is not the unemployed who are poor now.  A man who had a reasonable income last year on which he lived comfortably is now a poor man.  He is poor because of indecision and lack of guidance on the part of the Government.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to a restrictive practice which was brought to the notice of the Government day in and day out and about which they have done nothing and, unfortunately, about which they do not seem to be going to do anything, that is, the scare scarcity technique used by monopolies of one kind or another, and about which, when he was over here, the Minister urged that this, that and the other should be done.  The Minister knows the technique well. You take one commodity and create a scarcity scare.  At the time there is probably an application with the Minister for a price increase.  The formula of applying for a price increase to the Minister is more honoured in the breach than in the observance at the moment, as he well knows from the coal situation in Donegal which has been brought to his notice quite often by letter, by Dáil question, and by debate in the House.  People are thumbing their noses at the Minister on the question of prices.</P>
      <P>What is worrying the people now is not only high prices but a scare situation which comes first.  The rumour gets around.  It pays these people to deal in rumours first.  The rumour is that a commodity is scare, that it is going off the market, that there is no more available, and a demand is created at any price.  Up goes the price and the following week there is plenty of the commodity but the public have been brain-washed and there is a rush for the commodity. The Minister is doing nothing about this.  It is one of the worst restrictive practices I know of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This applied in the past to coal and petrol.  The Government should have said to the people over the Christmas period: &ldquo;There is no scarcity of petrol.  The quantities of petrol in <Col N="481" /> the country are sufficient to maintain a reasonable allocation.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot control the price of raw materials or manufactured goods coming into the country which we must import and for which we must pay the price demanded.  That is fair enough; but what about the barley situation and what about the grain situation?  At a time when animal feeding stuffs were controlled at around £50 per ton the millers bought the produce of the 1973 harvest and, immediately it was bought, the lid was lifted off the controlled price for animal feeding stuffs.  It was alleged that competition between the millers would maintain reasonable prices.  I am sure it was not said that that competition would keep down prices.  It is not long since the price was £50 per ton, roughly, and now the prevailing price is somewhere between £80 and £90 per ton and nearer to £90, of course, than £80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know why the Minister is not restricting those practices. He is bringing in this Bill to control restrictive practices which will create financial problems for poorer people.  Every day every paper carries indications of unfair prices charged, illegal prices charged, and higher prices being charged than the controlled prices, and nothing seems to be done.  At least, that is what the people think.  This is the playback we get at all our meetings.  Does the Minister know that, when a few people congregate, all the talk is <Col N="482" /> about prices, lack of control of prices and higher prices being charged than the controlled prices?  Will he make a statement about the coal situation in Donegal and in other places?  Will he make a statement about the very many other complaints which he is getting?</P>
    <P>This seems to be only the first instalment of something larger.  What about the mergers?  Is this the first instalment of something bigger to deal with the people who are creating the necessity for this Bill?  I think it is only tinkering with the whole problem which is due to the circumstances of 1974.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to indicate the number of prosecutions but I do not know whether these were actual prosecutions in respect of overcharging or in respect of not displaying prices.  This is not getting at the real root of the problem.  Where a commodity price is officially increased by the Minister the bigger merchants go out of that item and the small shopkeepers do not find it profitable, so that these shopkeepers are victims just as much as the public.  In a rural area a small shopkeeper must stock a large variety of articles and these people are in the hands of the larger combines which cut their profit margins very low so that not only the public but also the small shopkeepers are at the mercy of the Minister's inactivity.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill is good enough or goes far enough and I think it will have no effect on the restrictive and dishonest practice of creating a scare situation before a price increase. I understand there will be, or perhaps there is, an application by the petrol and oil companies for increases. I was informed by telephone in the past few days that one petrol company in Donegal is charging 3p per gallon more for fuel oil this week for central heating <i>et cetera</i>.  I do not think there is permission for this increase.  I am bringing it to the Minister's notice; perhaps he will do something about it, perhaps not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>This commission met about two or three years ago and I happened to be one of those who <Col N="483" /> gave evidence at it.  I think it worthwhile to go back and trace the history of what is the real cause of this Bill. I believe it was H. Williams who opened the first self-service store in Ireland in Henry Street some 14 years ago when the self-service business came to this country.  Fantastic changes have taken place in the food business since then.  It is hard to believe supermarkets began operating 14 years ago.  Their development and the manner in which they have been put over to the public represents for the food industry, I think, one of the greatest achievements of any industry. When H. Williams opened I remember reading in the papers where the average citizen thought they were mad, that goods would be stolen left, right and centre from the shelves.  From that, the supermarket business developed and the first thing we had was multiples setting up stores throughout the country.  The only way the small men could compete in those days with the multiples was to form chains which were called retail groups.  In turn, the wholesalers organised and formed wholesale groups.  You then had the three people in the food industry as you have to this day, the multiples in their own right, the retail groups comprising most of the independent retailers and wholesale groups, retailers who had been trading with wholesalers down the years and joined wholesale groups.</P>
      <P>It made me smile to hear some Opposition spokesmen speak of rising prices because this is nothing new in the food trade.  Anybody who has been in it has seen rising prices not only this year but over the last seven or eight or 10 years.  It is only fair to say that many price increases in the past year have been due to no fault of ours but to imports.  The first criticism many shopkeepers will make of this Government to day is that they are too tight on price control.  Many of them have said to me that if the Opposition were in Government now prices would be higher than they are.  Margins have certainly been cut in the last 10 months and nobody can deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to make <Col N="484" /> sure that multiples will not be able to buy on better terms than groups. One must be realistic and say that the small man must join a group today if he is to survive.  If he has a small supermarket of 1,000 or 1,500 square feet he must join a group, whether wholesale or retail, if he is to survive because he will not have capital to buy 20 cases or 50 cases of this or that. Interest rates are too high.  The idea of both retail and wholesale groups is that they will buy so that the small man can get the advantage.  No doubt multiples were getting unfair trading terms from manufacturers, and were even pressurising to get these terms.  It is common knowledge that they were getting advertising allowances, that manufacturers were putting staff from their own organisations into the multiple stores to see that their stocks were kept properly topped up, that they got rebates at the end of the year and that they often got 14 to the dozen, whereas groups were getting only 13.</P>
    <P>I am really surprised that there is nothing in this Bill about trading stamps.  I have always maintained&mdash; and there can be no doubt of it&mdash;that trading stamps have certainly put up costs in any store that gives them out. Trading stamps themselves cost 2½ per cent and stamp companies go to firms and say: &ldquo;We will increase your turnover by 22 per cent and in that way you will get back the money you spend on trading stamps&rdquo;.  I think the figure is 22 per cent or in that region. But this is not how trading stamps work.  If anybody, as I have done, makes a survey of different stores, it is shown that shops which are giving trading stamps, apart from bread and butter lines, are always higher than shops that are not giving these stamps. It is commonly known in the grocery trade that the housewife really knows the prices of only six, seven or, perhaps, ten items when she goes into a foodstore.  This is very true.</P>
    <P>Any housewife knows the price of a pound of butter or two pounds of sugar but when it comes to tinned fruit, oranges, apples, onions and so on the customer does not know.  The shops do not charge for trading stamps on the eight or ten items the <Col N="485" /> price of which everybody knows but on the other articles.  Of course there are loss leaders in certain stores.  I do not think there is any harm in having loss leaders because in any grocery store there are the good weeks and the bad weeks.  If somebody wants to promote his shop it must be, first of all, clean, the displays must be good to encourage the housewives to buy and there must be special offers to encourage people to get the best value they can.  It is high time this Restrictive Practices Bill was brought into operation but I would like to see the Minister having a special look to see whether it is true that trading stamps are costing the public millions of pounds every year.</P>
    <P>I notice that almost 100 witnesses were examined in the course of the inquiry.  I met many of them.  They represented every section of the food industry.  There were small men, big men, wholesalers and multiples and each of them said his piece.  It is high time that multiples, retail groups and wholesale groups were guaranteed that all will buy at the same price. That is only fair.  Let there be no doubt that the way for the small shopkeeper to survive is to join either a retail chain or a wholesale chain and to see that he gets a fair deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as far as it goes but I do not believe it goes far enough.  We on this side believe that there are many imported commodities over which the Government have no control.  During the last election campaign I had to canvass a very poor area.  When asked about the cost of living I told the people honestly that the cost of living would go up and that the only thing we could do was to try to increase social welfare benefits and wages to meet the cost of living.  The canvassers for the present Government were following me telling the people definitely that they would hold the cost of living at the level it was then at and would control it.  I would credit the people on the opposite benches, particularly the Minister, with being very intelligent men.  I claim that that was a dishonest promise which they knew well they could not fulfil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> Deputy Cunningham said the grain crop of this country was bought for £50 a ton.  I sold good barley at £45. That grain is now being sold to people at between £80 and £90 a ton.  What attempt was made to control that? We had An Bord Gráin abolished with the stroke of a pen.  They bought the grain and subsidised it for the west, the non-grain growing areas.  They sold it at a fairly reasonable price. But merely because of a clause in the Treaty of Rome&mdash;a clause I cannot find&mdash;An Bord Gráin was done away with.  It was to be replaced by a co-operative but that has not been done.  We have a free-for-all now. The result is the price now being paid for feeding stuffs.  The Government have failed miserably to do anything about these things.  There is no use in anybody saying they can control the price of oil.  That is outside our control.</P>
    <P>I agree with the last speaker on the question of the small shopkeepers.  I never had any use for supermarkets. I remember some years ago being away at an international conference. I came home of the opinion that the small shopkeeper would disappear before the small farmer.  The only hope for the small shopkeeper is to co-operate, which is what the small man must do in all areas.  If this Bill does anything to control prices it will be a good thing.  I am with it as far as it goes.</P>
    <P>Because I have maintained that you cannot control certain prices I am told: &ldquo;You are as bad as the rest of them.  We were told it could be done.&rdquo;  I know there are certain things you cannot do but there are certain things that can be done and have not been done.  We know that the sale of petrol was held up in anticipation of the increase of 4p a gallon.  There was not enough control to ensure that people would not hold on to petrol. Now that there is to be another increase the Minister should tell his colleague to ensure that the petrol pumps are not closed for a week beforehand.  This is the type of thing to which the Government should be alive.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill well.  However, I am <Col N="487" /> very sore about this matter because we lost a considerable number of votes in towns because we would not come out and tell a lie.  That is a thing I will never do.  I knew well we could not keep the cost of living at the point at which it was but the present Government said they could do it.  The general public swallowed it but they are very disillusioned at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>A previous speaker referred to trading stamps and I agree with him in condemning them.  This Bill and the statutory rules and orders which it will implement are based on a 34-day inquiry, the report of which was issued on 29th September, 1972. It is the Fair Trade Commission's report of the inquiry into grocery goods for human consumption.  That was a public, sworn inquiry and a much tougher and far more searching inquiry than the previous inquiry into the grocery trade.</P>
      <P>In the course of that inquiry it seemed to me, when acting in a professional capacity and as a participating member who had to ask numerous questions and cross-examine many witnesses, that there was little justification for trading stamps except to the point that they were an incentive to people to purchase and to give a little extra to the housewife for her own pocket.  One must remember that trading stamps are based on the selling price of the product.  If there is a rise in the price of the goods up go the number of trading stamps, but somebody has to pay for the trading stamps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no use saying that they are paid for by the seller of the goods. In the first instance they are but in the long run they are paid for by the purchaser of the goods.  They give a false benefit to the purchaser.  I can see no economic justification for the use of trading stamps except in the very limited way I have referred to. This brings me to a matter in which I slightly disagree with the previous speaker.  In that very careful and full report, in paragraph 273, the commission came to the conclusion that it was a matter that if there were any <Col N="488" /> ills concerning it it would have to be dealt with by independent legislation and not by the code of law dealing with restrictive trade practices.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with the previous speaker when I say that it is a bad thing economically because it has an inflationary effect.  At that inquiry&mdash; I had better declare my colours at this stage&mdash;I appeared for Spar, Mace, VG and ED wholesale and retail groups.  They were wholesalers who came together with retailers in an effort to assist, particularly, the smaller and medium sized family grocer because at the time of the formation of those groups the small and medium retail grocer had no method of protection or help.  That was the reason for the birth of these organisations.</P>
    <P>These organisations have their counterparts in continental countries although they are separate autonomous units and work independently. These groups have managed to help and, in many cases, save the existence of the family grocer because at the time they came into existence we had in this country the emergence of large super stores commonly referred to as multiples.  At that time these multiples, and I am afraid they still do, obtained undue advantages, price-wise and trade-wise, from their suppliers, namely the manufacturers.  That was because these multiples have large financial power in the market place and when they go to a manufacturer they are able to dictate terms.</P>
    <P>The effect of trading to date in the grocery trade has been for these multiples to get an unfair advantage by being quoted better terms than even wholesalers are getting, or are able to obtain, for the benefit of their retailers.  In many cases, and there is plenty of evidence to support this, the wholesalers are buying five or ten times the quantity of a particular multiple owner but the multiple owner gets better, or at least equal, terms to what the wholesaler gets.  It should be borne in mind that that wholesaler when buying is buying for people who are in business in a small way and he is taking the cost and expense of distributing and delivering <Col N="489" /> these goods all over Ireland, right down to the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>If it was not for these wholesale groups there would be far fewer grocery businesses in the west, and in my constituency. These groups were born out of sheer necessity and by virtue of that necessity and the work they have done, they have saved the livelihood of many a family in rural Ireland. They have helped to provide a living for people who work small and medium size grocery shops in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>It does not take a lot of investigation to see the areas where the multiples operate.  They operate in areas of big population.  Their advent has resulted in the abolition of a large number of family grocers in such areas.  It may not be appreciated by the people who read and swallow the publicity gimmicks that a lot of these family businesses have given traditional employment to other families in the area.</P>
    <P>The measure being introduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been long sought by small grocers.  The number of people who have been forced out of the grocery trade runs into hundreds if not thousands. I should like to remind the House that there are about 40,000 to 50,000 people dependent on the grocery and distributing trade.  This is a very important fact.  I was surprised at the cold water Deputy Crowley was throwing on this Bill.  He comes from an area which I thought would be very interested in a statutory measure of this nature.  However, in so far as my constituency is concerned, I am giving my wholehearted support to this Bill.</P>
    <P>This inquiry elicited certain facts, expressly or by implication.  It was discovered then that the multiples were able to get such terms of trade that the minimum period of time in which they had to pay their bill was 30 days but, with careful manipulation, it was spread to 90 days.  The money that the multiples were getting as ready cash found its way to the London money market that night. Basically these multiples, having obtained unfair terms of trade, used <Col N="490" /> that money as money brokers in London and they were not trading as grocers at all.  Deputy Brennan may grin, but let him not forget that for 34 days I sat in on that inquiry and I think that I was the person responsible for having elicited that information.  If a man wishes to do business as a grocer he does business as a grocer.</P>

      <P>It was relevant and was appreciated by the commission. However, those people, being able to get these terms of trade, were able to offer loss leaders, to play havoc with the market, to sell butter or whatever they wished at give-away prices.  But the traditional family grocer was not a money broker or a moneylender and what was he to do?  He was being hammered by the big boy up the road.  I can assure the House that the manufacturers are delighted to have these statutory rules and orders: they want a baseline so they can stand up against unfair pressure from the bullyboys in the market place.  That is being said quite freely in the grocery trade and is well understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many irrelevant matters have been brought into this debate for the purpose of having a slap at the Minister in relation to price control.  I wonder if Deputies read the papers today and took note of the comments concerning feedingstuffs and whether at the same time, they remembered all the screams from various sources concerning the Minister's confirming the conclusions of the Prices Commission.  It is well known that the Prices Commission are doing a fine job.  They are an absolutely non-political body.  Their job is a tough one, one which must be executed in very difficult circumstances. Any Deputy who comes here and endeavours to make capital out <Col N="491" /> of prices, prices that are being dealt with by the Prices Commission, is not being honest.  I can only hope for a cessation of that type of debate and comment so that we might have a little honesty in the market place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is entitled the Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1974, and it is my intention to refer only to those serious matters that were raised and which are relevant to the Bill.  Last week Deputies had the opportunity of a fairly lengthy debate on prices, and if they wish for another such opportunity they shall have it soon when the Estimate for my Department comes before the House.  The debate on the Bill before us ranged rather widely.</P>
      <P>I wish to express my thanks to the Opposition spokesman on Industry and Commerce for what was an informed and a constructive speech, a speech to which I listened with interest and with some benefit.  Deputy Brennan concentrated on what are the central points of concern to both of us.  However, in relation to his expressed opinion that these orders do not confer any benefit on the consumer I would say that in a narrow sense that is true but, then, that is not their objective.  In a broader sense steps which are good for the general health and efficiency of distribution and which create, first, an environment in which the family trader can thrive and give his service and, secondly, which stop some of the restrictive practices in the area of distribution, are undoubtedly a benefit to the consumer, though not an immediate one.  It would be very difficult to stop all restrictive practices: people are very good at thinking up new ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan raised two points. He agreed, as did every Deputy who contributed to the debate, that the small man has a place in distribution. This Bill is one confirming orders introduced by my predecessor.  It is not a party political effort.  It is not possible to quantify in money the personal knowledge, the snippets of conversation, <Col N="492" /> the kindness and the individuality of treatment that one receives from the family grocer.  These qualities are precious and render the whole business of shopping more human, more pleasant and are a real benefit to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan raised the question of whether there would be a bolstering of the inefficient small trader.  That is a real question but I do not think that will happen because of such factors in relation to the small trader as general commercial pressures and because of efficiencies of scale from the big people. Even with protective organisations such as the co-operatives or the chains, the small trader has no option but to seek efficiency.  Whatever we may wish for small traders, if they do not endeavour to sharpen their efficiency all the time they will go to the wall.  Regardless of the contents of this Bill the general pressures are such as to guarantee a growing efficiency of small traders.</P>
    <P>The second point raised by Deputy Brennan referred to the creation of a monopoly situation.  I agree entirely with the point made concerning the need for a monopolies Bill.  We shall have such a Bill here soon.  I acknowledge that we inherited a Bill of this nature.  Our predecessors had given thought to the matter although the Bill we intend introducing may not be the same as the one they had in mind.  The one we inherited will be improved and added to.  It is a measure that is needed. When this other Bill is being discussed the situation will be that monopolies in this context will form more than 50 per cent of the trade of the country. That is not being approached in the amalgamation of wholesalers at this time.  I recognise the significance of the warning issued by Deputy Brennan but I do not think the situation is yet reaching the stage to which he referred. However, it is something that we must watch and about which we shall soon have power to do something.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the genesis of this Bill and of the orders and if one puts in a nutshell the general direction of the conclusions of the Commission of inquiry into Restrictive Practices, it will be seen that the large multiple chains under the <Col N="493" /> regime that was investigated by that commission were in a relatively favoured position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the wholesalers. That was the circumstance of the time.  The recommendations made by the commission are the basis of these orders and of this Bill and were concerned to redress the balance away from the large multiples and towards the wholesalers.  I think they will have that effect.  When you redress a balance it is possible that you tilt too far the other way and if this happens appropriate action must be taken. This is quite possible and it seems to me correct to work at it.  The position will be kept under close and continuous review by the Examiner for Restrictive Practices.  If the tendency to increase the power of the wholesalers <i>vis-à-vis</i> the large chains tilts too far we will redress it.  It is a real danger and it is worthwhile that attention be drawn to it.</P>
    <P>The question arises whether the small shopkeeper can get the same variety of goods as previously.  Irrespective of whether these orders were in force, there is a tendency, whether in large or small outlets, to get fewer lines and it is easier for the large outlets to do this.  There is a tendency for the less successful brands to disappear, there is a narrowing of the range of goods available and this is inherent in the growing efficiency and intensification of distribution.  However, distribution is a complicated matter, opposite tendencies can operate at the same time.  There is the tendency that nobody wants the small orders of the rarer lines because they are a nuisance for the distributor and the wholesaler. These orders will not prevent a trader from getting the same variety of goods as before.  It is true that in order to get best terms some traders may confine their orders to a limited number of lines but I do not know if there is any easy way to overcome it having regard to the intensification of distribution. Ultimately consumer demand will overcome it if the consumers are educated and want the wider range but I do not think that tendency is intensified.</P>
    <P>It is true that there is also a tendency away from the past situation where suppliers provided small quantities <Col N="494" /> at best prices.  In doing that sometimes there were hidden diseconomies which helped to keep prices up and which were inflationary. No matter how they were covered up by the pricing policy with regard to supplies&mdash;the system whereby a manufacturer would supply small orders to a multiplicity of outlets&mdash;as matters intensify the tendency of costs to rise continues and this is seen to be uneconomic.  In the past the public were offered a wider choice but sometimes this was at the expense of building in costs, of building in price increases that did not need to occur.  At this time we are right to put price considerations ahead of considerations of the maximum facility in regard to small lots and a wide range of products.</P>
    <P>Deputy White mentioned trading stamps and I should like to make some comments on that matter.  My predecessor announced his intention of abolishing them.  I have read a number of statements he made over a period of months and I think I am reflecting his thinking accurately when I say his opinion shifted away from prohibition and towards regulation. I do not think I am distorting his views on that subject and I may add this is my own opinion.  People like trading stamps; they may do a little saving with them and acquire certain objects they might not otherwise get.  Perhaps a woman might get a few things for the house she would not get if she had to put away the odd pence.  I do not think trading stamps are very important either way but my intention is regulation rather than prohibition.  What I do not like in the Irish context is that there is no significant competition.  If we had competition and regulation we would overcome many of the drawbacks.  I do not like prohibiting anything; the fewer prohibitions there are the better. If people enjoy getting trading stamps and if they are regulated to ensure they do not do significant harm, my attitude is not in favour of prohibition.  I hope to have the report of the National Consumer Advisory Council before the summer.  I do not want to tie them to a date because many of the people concerned are <Col N="495" /> giving their time and do a lot of work. However, I hope to have the report in late spring or early summer and we will move the whole matter on a little.</P>
    <P>Deputy White said goods should be supplied to all at the same price.  It is the objective of the orders that people pay the same regardless of whether they are big or small dealers but not regardless of the quantity they buy. The business of having a discount for the large order is perfectly reasonable and proper because there are some economies.  However, it is the objective that regardless of whether the purchaser is big or small the price is the same and that is desirable and progressive. There is provision for a variation of price by reference to whether the purchaser is a wholesaler or a retailer.  The object is to permit lower prices to the wholesaler than to the retailer; that is proper and natural on the part of distribution.  We have had a useful debate and my opposite number made a serious and helpful speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad I was asked that question.  We have had a consensus that it is essential if the small man is to survive that he should get into some kind of protective organisation.  Deputy Brennan praised the retailers' co-operatives and commended them and I should like wholeheartedly to do the same thing.  Whether they are co-operatives or other groups, they are essential and are a necessary protection.  At their invitation I visited a number of them. I believe I have good relations with them and I am open to suggestions or requests from them about any way we could facilitate their growth and strengthen them.  I am glad I was reminded about them so that I might have an opportunity of putting my comments on the records of the House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, and of certain other services administered by that Office, including a grant-in-aid; and of the Public Record Office, and of the Keeper of State Papers and for the purchase of historical documents, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the main Estimates for the six Votes for which I am responsible amounting to £34,022,000 were, in common with a number of others, passed without <Col N="497" /> debate shortly before Christmas.  The supplementary sum of £10 now being moved will enable the House to discuss the main Estimates for the six Votes and the Supplementary Estimates of £4,427,000 recently circulated.</P>
    <P>These are made up as follows:</P>
    <P>Vote 20: Office of the Minister for Justice&mdash;£95,000.</P>
    <P>Vote 21: Garda Síochána&mdash; £4,332,000.</P>
    <P>On Vote 20 a sum of £89,990 is required to meet increases in salaries, wages and allowances; £5,000 is needed for a grant to the Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC); and a further sum of £10 to provide for the introdution of a new scheme for the payment of compensation for personal injuries inflicted.  A grant of £5,000 to FLAC is part of a Government allocation of £200,000 in respect of child care services in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>On Vote 21 the items which require additional funds are: salaries, wages and allowances, £3,800,000; travelling and incidental expenses, £400,000; Post Office services £90,000; clothing and equipment £30,000; witnesses' expenses £12,000.</P>
    <P>I propose, as is traditional, to give a brief resumé in respect of the period since the last debate on the Estimates for the Department of Justice of the most noteworthy developments in the various services for which I am the responsible Minister.  This I consider to be a useful procedure, because, for one thing, it ensures that the records of this House will contain a handy summary of facts and figures to which reference can be made by anybody seeking information about the Department's work.  Since, however, this is the first debate on the Estimates for the Department of Justice since the National Coalition Government took office as well as the first debate for me as Minister, I think it would be opportune for me to say a few words at the outset to indicate what I consider to be the most important areas of concern to me.</P>
    <P>My basic concern must be the security and safety of the State.  Unless <Col N="498" /> the State and its citizens and its institutions can be kept secure from attack no progress can be made in the fields of economic or social reform.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we have within our society at the moment a small group of organised subversives whose presence constitutes a threat to the security of the State.  Some time ago a spokesman for the group indicated that they did not seek a confrontation with the State for it was inevitable that in such a struggle the State would win.  He was, of course, quite right in this and a look at the last 50 years shows that every subversive group which challenged the authority of the State was doomed to failure. I hope his comrades heed his words. I should like to compliment the gardaí on their success in this area and to reassure them, if indeed they need reassurance at this stage, that they have the full backing of the Government and I hope of every Member of this House in their fight against subversion.</P>
    <P>I indicated that peace and security were necessary if we are to make progress in economic and social reform. I am charged as Minister for Justice with control over a great variety of social legislation&mdash;adoption, the whole area of family law, which raises the problem of deserted wives, their rights against their husbands and rights to the family home, annulments, guardianship of children and also the question of rent control, ground rents, landlord and tenant law, censorship of publication and films.  There are other areas for which I have responsibility with a highly important legal content such as the Land Registry, Public Records Office, Charity Commissioners and the operation of the courts themselves.  Indeed, it could be said that these latter activities also have a high social content.</P>
    <P>When one hears them listed out it will be noticed that some of these areas require legislative changes.  Steps towards bringing in those changes have already been taken and I will deal with them in more detail later in my speech.  What I want to emphasise at this stage is that while they are all urgent it is not possible to <Col N="499" /> introduce all these reforms instantly. What is possible is a steady programme of reforming legislation right through my term of office.  I intend to see that this programme is carried through to a successful conclusion and I want to emphasise that in drawing up the reforms I will be in touch with groups who have a knowledge or special interest in the particular area in question.</P>
    <P>We are entering a particularly critical phase of Irish history with the Sunningdale communiqué, the formation of a power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland and the approaching formal conference to confirm acceptance of the agreed communiqué that was signed at the end of the Sunningdale Conference.  These events have within themselves the capability of achieving peace for this island and it is important for that reason and for the continued security and welfare of this State that these initiatives succeed.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer very briefly to the agreed communiqué issued at the end of the Sunningdale Conference in December and, particularly, to two of the elements in the communiqué that concern me as Minister for Justice.  First, there is the Law Commission that has been set up jointly by the Irish and British Governments to consider all the proposals that had been put forward at Sunningdale for dealing with the problem of bringing to trial persons who commit crimes of violence, however motivated, in this island and to recommend as a matter of urgency the most effective means of dealing with those who commit those crimes.  Secondly, there is the police authority to be set up here, appointments to which will be made after consultation with the Council of Ministers of the Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Law Commission have already begun their work.  As regards the setting up of a police authority enabling legislation will be necessary and initial preparatory work of gathering information and ideas has already begun.  I will shortly be having consultations <Col N="500" /> and discussions on the matter with the Garda authorities and the Garda Representative Bodies before bringing my proposals before the House.  I fully recognise the importance of having their views on a matter of such fundamental importance to their Force.</P>
    <P>The police service, its well-being and efficiency must be and is high among the concerns which affect me as Minister for Justice.  We are fortunate in this country in having a police force on top of their job and it is a great source of satisfaction that this should be so.  The increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to which I will refer later will help them in their task of combating serious crime and subversive activity.  I should like to add that I will continue to be in close consultation with the Garda authorities with a view to strengthening further the efficiency of the force at every level with particular emphasis on training and deployment of personnel and the provision of all necessary equipment.  The gardaí have had significant success in dealing with subversive activities here.  In the year 1973, 171 persons were arrested and charged with offences that are scheduled offences for the purposes of the Offences against the State Acts.  In the same period 330 rifles, 290 pistols and revolvers, 518 grenades, 15 rockets, four rocket launchers and a sizeable quantity of explosives were seized by the gardaí, a truly horrifying arsenal.</P>
    <P>The stringent controls that have been in operation for some time now with regard to the use and storage of explosives are being continued.  The controls which were extended during 1972 to certain ammonium nitrate mixtures, sodium chlorate and nitrobenzine are also being maintained. I am aware that this has caused inconvenience to commercial users of the materials concerned but I know that they will appreciate how necessary it is to have the existing security arrangements.  The protection of life and property is of primary importance and, so long as the situation requires it, the Government will strive to ensure that materials for bomb making do not get into the wrong hands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> At the outset I should like to refer to the general crime situation.  The crime figures increased again in 1972 but the rate of increase was much less than in 1971.  These are the latest figures available.  I am pleased to be able to say that the indications are that the steep upward trend of recent years may have been halted.  In the year ended 30th September, 1972, 39,237 indictable offences were recorded as against 37,781 in the previous year, an increase of 3.8 per cent.  Two thirds of these consisted of offences against property without violence, mainly larcenies, and I would remind the House that larcenies, generally, even where the value of the money or goods stolen is trivial, are indictable offences. In the vast majority of the cases of offences against property, either with or without violence, which were recorded during the year, the value of the property stolen was less than £50.</P>
    <P>Offences against the person have been almost constant over the past four years, but offences against property showed a small increase of 4.4 per cent over the 1971 figure.</P>
    <P>Proceedings were instituted by the gardaí in respect of 15,705 indictable offences known to them or 40 per cent of the total.  The overall detection rate fell to 43 per cent as compared with 46 per cent in the previous year.  In the Dublin Metropolitan Area the detection rate was 34 per cent while in the rest of the country it was 58 per cent. For some of the more serious crimes, the detection rate was as high as 90 per cent while for certain categories of less serious offences against property it was as low as 37 per cent.  I should mention too that a significant proportion of some relatively minor offences are extremely difficult to detect.  For example, in 1972, 2,271 bicycles were reported as stolen but proceedings were instituted in 131 cases only.</P>
    <P>One has to be careful when drawing comparisions in the matter of detection rates but it may be of interest that the detection rate for England and Wales, exclusive of London, in 1972 was 50 per cent, while the rate for the London area was 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>I invite Deputies to read the valuable foreword that the Commissioner <Col N="502" /> of the Garda Síochána has written to his report on crime for the year ended 30th September, 1972, copies of which are in the Library.  In it he refers to some of the special measures that are being taken to combat the increase in crime.  In the Dublin Metropolitan Area where 60 per cent of indictable offences occur, the increase in crime in 1972, as compared with 1971, amounted to only 0.7 per cent, while I am glad to say that provisional figures for the 1973 crime year show a drop of 2.4 per cent on the 1972 figures.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 30th September, 1972, the number of persons charged with summary offences was 190,152 as compared with 198,157 in 1971. Road traffic offences continued to constitute by far the greatest category &mdash;135,074 persons were prosecuted for road traffic offences in 1972 as compared with some 147,442 in 1971. The prosecution of these offences involves a tremendous amount of Garda time being spent in court and I am investigating the Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure which recommended the extension of on the spot fines to a wide range of motoring offences.  More than 200,000 &ldquo;fine-on-the-spot&rdquo; notices were issued for contraventions of the parking by-laws and similar offences and in 82,443 of these cases there were prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are in the front line of defence of our institutions and the laws which shape those institutions.  Their task, in a modern society, is a difficult and complex task and I want to say, and I am sure I speak for everybody in this House when I say this, that they are doing a good job, and that their work is appreciated.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance that their work and role in the community are appreciated and understood by the public at large.  We must seek to ensure that no alienation between the police and public grows up, for unless the police have the continuous goodwill and co-operation of the community in which they serve they cannot perform the functions of a police force.  But this is a two-way process <Col N="503" /> and the gardaí have the delicate and difficult task of so comporting themselves and carrying out their duties that they ensure for themselves continously the trust and confidence and, most important of all, the friendship of the community.</P>
    <P>One way in which this can be achieved is by increasing public awareness of the job of a police officer, by showing them the difficulties he encounters and by telling them of the strains and stresses he has to endure.</P>
    <P>I intend to see that relations with the public in this regard get the attention they deserve and need.  In this connection I might say that the making of a documentary film of the Garda Síochána has been proposed. <i>Prima facie</i> it seems a good idea and I am having it examined.  In this area of relations with the public, both the Garda band and the Garda choir have done much valuable and enjoyable work and I take the opportunity of thanking them.  I was glad to see the return of the <i>Garda Review</i> and would like to compliment the editor and his board on the high professional standard of the issues which have so far been published.</P>
    <P>From time to time allegations of misconduct of varying degrees of seriousness are made against individual members of the Garda.  Some of these are untrue and many others malicious or wildly exaggerated.  There may be room for concern in a small number of cases but in this area of relations with the public it is important that the public be satisfied that if there should be such cases there is a firm and impartial method of dealing with them.  I am satisfied there is but I am not satisfied that the public are so aware.  This is a delicate and difficult area because invariably emotions run high and tend to cloud objectivity on the part of the complainant.</P>
    <P>For the sake of relations with the public and bearing in mind what I have just said about their importance, this field could be looked at.  This will only be done in close consultation with the representative bodies within the force for I am aware that they are <Col N="504" /> concerned to ensure that the good name of the members they represent will be maintained and that should there be any deviation from a proper norm of behaviour the guilt of the deviant will not affect by association the general body.  I am happy that the problem is not a serious one and I only mention it to highlight the fact that public relations is a two-way exercise.  The Government, and I am sure I speak for the House, are grateful for the work the gardaí are doing and we must be prepared to assist in that work.</P>
    <P>One of the most important ways in which the Government can make their contribution is, obviously, by providing the necessary financial resources for manpower increases, new equipment and so on.  The House will be aware that the Government have recently decided to increase Garda strength, and the necessary arrangements are being made so that the extra 500 men may be recruited as soon as possible.  I am not in a position to say exactly how the extra 500 men will be distributed, beyond saying that a substantial proportion will certainly be assigned to Border areas and the remainder wherever the Garda authorities deem that the greatest need exists.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that the provision of extra numbers does not, of itself guarantee that the force has all the means necessary to do their job.  Of equal importance, from the point of view of overall efficiency, are factors such as training, manpower deployment, management techniques, and, of course, the provision of the most up-to-date equipment available.</P>
    <P>These aspects are receiving close attention at present by the Garda authorities and by my Department.</P>
    <P>I might mention that a working party is in existence examining the question of Garda uniform with particular attention to devising a suitable summer dress.  I am giving to this working party all the encouragement and assistance they feel they need.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial increase in the provision for equipment, including Garda cars, the purchase/resale of which has recently been made the subject <Col N="505" /> of expert examination by the Government operations research unit. I envisage further examinations of this type to ensure that maximum benefit is secured from expenditure on equipment. Another development in this area which I hope will prove to be a significant aid to efficiency is the use by the Garda Síochána of computers. The computerisation of Garda pay is nearing completion and a committee representative of my Department, the Garda Síochána and the automatic data processing unit of the Department of the Public Service are at present examining the possibility of further use of computers.  Already two projects are on hand, one related to criminal statistics and the other which will be designed to assist the gardaí in location of stolen vehicles.</P>
    <P>Generally, I see the use of computers by the gardaí, which is an inevitable development in this day and age, as an alternative means of storing information of the type which the gardaí already acquire and file in the course of their normal duties.  They will be used to provide a better information retrieval system.</P>
    <P>I think it is right, at this early stage of developments, to emphasise that everybody concerned in this matter, including, above all, the Garda authorities themselves, are very much alive to the fact that computerisation of police data is something which, so to speak, has to be watched.  I want to make it clear, therefore, that even if the gardaí do not get a computer of their own, and have to share the use of one with some other branch of the Public Service, it will be a fundamental requirement that the Garda section of the operation will be self-contained so that only the gardaí will have access to the stored information giving criminal records and the like.</P>
    <P>In fact, one of the first issues discussed by the committee to which I have referred, was security of computerised police information.  I am assured that the system can be so arranged that it will be technically impossible for anybody other than authorised personnel to gain access to the information on computer.  Part of the security arrangements will involve <Col N="506" /> the training of gardaí as computer operators so that the various routine listings and so on produced at the computer centre will be handled only by members of the force.  The information on computer tapes will be just as inaccessible to people who are not authorised to have access as it is at present on Garda files and records.</P>
    <P>Another important point which I want to stress in relation to computerisation is that the only information stored on computer tapes will be what is needed for police purposes.  As I have already said, the information stored will be of the type already collected and filed by the gardaí in the course of their normal duties.  I say this to reassure those who might fear that this new technique could have &ldquo;1984&rdquo; overtones about it.</P>
    <P>A new Garda unit, the traffic corps, commenced operations early in April last and is at present operating in Drogheda, Portlaoise, Mullingar, Naas, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Thurles, Tralee and Bandon.  It is hoped that the unit will be operating in the remaining major centres in the near future.  The unit was set up to concentrate on the enforcement of the traffic laws and the prevention of road accidents.  The duties of the new traffic corps are to supplement, not to replace, the efforts of the force in general in this field.  The unit carries out checks on motor vehicles including checks on tax and insurance.  Among other things, evasion of payment of motor tax will be sought out more thoroughly by the traffic corps.  In addition one of the more important functions of the unit is the detection of the offence of drunken driving.</P>
    <P>In this regard I should point out that the penalty for drunken driving is imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, or, at the discretion of the court, a fine not exceeding £100 or both such imprisonment and such fine and on conviction by the court a person is, in addition to the penalty already mentioned, automatically disqualified from holding a driving licence.  Let me say for those who think otherwise, that I, as Minister for Justice, have no power to remit such disqualification.  I would <Col N="507" /> like to issue a warning that, owing to the operation of the traffic corps, there is now a far greater probability, than heretofore, of drunken drivers being apprehended.  I would, therefore, urge all drivers who may be tempted to drive their cars after consuming intoxicating liquor to think again in the matter, in their own interests, apart altogether from the other very serious considerations involved.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is not possible to give firm figures at the moment, but I would like to mention however that a special return was compiled in respect of the first four Garda divisions in which the corps was established, namely, Louth-Meath, Leix-Offaly, Longford-Westmeath and Carlow-Kildare, and it was ascertained that a total of 17,799 offences were detected by the corps in the period April-July, 1973, inclusive, which is a very high figure by any standard.  One would be justified in thinking that this corps has been a big factor in the reduced number of road traffic deaths and injuries recently announced and I thank them for their work.</P>
    <P>Work is well advanced on the installation of the most modern equipment in the new radio control centre in Dublin Castle and it is expected that the complete scheme will be fully operational within the next three months.  When completed, the centre will be among the most modern and sophisticated of its kind available.  Radio communication is generally now at an acceptable level in most areas but the existing radio network is of a temporary nature.  A permanent radio network is being planned in co-operation with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and preliminary work has already been done in connection with a pilot survey in certain areas.  This survey will be a joint project between the gardaí and the engineering branch of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and work is expected to commence on the survey within the next month or so.</P>
    <P>The juvenile liaison officers' scheme <Col N="508" /> continues to operate successfully and since the initiation of the scheme over 7,600 juveniles have come under the care and supervision of the juvenile liaison officers and only 13 per cent of these became involved in offences thereafter.  One sergeant, 11 gardaí and two ban-ghardaí are serving full-time as juvenile liaison officers in Dublin; in Cork one sergeant and two gardaí are engaged full-time and one ban-gharda is engaged part-time on the scheme while in Limerick there is a sergeant full-time on juvenile liaison work.  Waterford has one garda fulltime on these duties and Clonmel, Drogheda, Dundalk, Galway, Kilkenny, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford each have a garda serving part-time on the scheme.</P>
    <P>The function of a juvenile liaison officer is to maintain contact with any juvenile assigned to him.  The juvenile may be one who has committed an offence and, having been warned, has been committed to the care of a juvenile liaison officer.  The officer may also be given the care and guidance of a young person, who, though not known to have committed an offence, may be regarded as likely to get into trouble by reason of unsatisfactory behaviour, such as persistent truancy, running away from home, staying out late at night, being unruly at school or at home, behaving in a disorderly manner and frequenting undesirable places.  These cases come to the notice of the officer through teachers, parents, school attendance officers or the gardaí.</P>
    <P>Each juvenile liaison officer receives two weeks on-the-job training when he, or she, joins the scheme and basically this training is in practical case work.  Apart from maintaining contact with those juveniles assigned to them juvenile liaison officers are active in all aspects of youth work. They maintain an active liaison with youth clubs, boxing clubs and the various youth organisations.  Two additional officers have recently been allocated to Dublin and one to Cork in connection with the scheme and the question of further expanding the Juvenile Liaison Officer Scheme is at present under investigation by the Garda authorities.  In addition, <Col N="509" /> arrangements are now in hand for a juvenile liaison officer to lecture each class of recruits at the training centre on the role, objectives and other aspects of the work of the juvenile liaison officers.</P>
    <P>An analytical study of the scheme has been undertaken.  It is expected that the report of this study will be available in the autumn of 1974 and the report will then be examined with a view to ascertaining how the future management of the scheme can best be effected.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me that the present training course for Garda recruits is too short and consequently too shallow in its content.  I share the concern of those who have spoken to me on this subject and I intend to initiate studies into the whole area of recruitment and recruit training. I am anxious to see that only the very best possible type of recruit is accepted into the Garda and that the best use is then made of him by a thorough and comprehensive training course.  And in addition to training the recruit, I feel there is a real need for refresher training for serving members certainly during the first half decade or decade of their service.  I intend to have this area examined together with the area of recruit training.  One of the problems in dealing with this up to now has been the pressure of space, but it may be possible to overcome this difficulty.  I want to assure the House that I regard these problems as urgent and of vital importance to the future well-being of the force.</P>
    <P>I am conscious to the point of being embarrassed by the poor standard of many of our Garda stations.  They are old, uncomfortable relics of another age, many being RIC barracks taken over and remaining virtually unchanged for the past 50 years.  Unfortunately, all cannot be brought up to standard or replaced simultaneously. A special building unit has been set up within the Department to concentrate exclusively on building projects for all the services for which the Department is responsible and in the case of the Garda Síochána a housing officer, of superintendent rank, has been appointed with a view to speeding <Col N="510" /> up progress on the provision of accommodation.</P>
    <P>The construction of a new divisional headquarters was completed in Waterford in July, 1973, and system built stations were completed in Askeaton, Bunclody, Carnew, Clane, Delvin, Kinnegad, Moate, Graiguenamanagh and Portlaw.  A new station constructed in the traditional manner was completed in Belturbet.  In addition, construction of a new building to house the communications centre in Dublin Castle was completed.</P>
    <P>New stations are in course of erection at Bunbeg, Multyfarnham, Newport (County Mayo), Raphoe, Rosmuc and Skibbereen and contracts were placed recently for the erection of new stations at Ballinahowan, Ballynacargy, Clonroche, Corofin, Kiltullagh, Lecarrow (Knockcroghery) and Rosslare Strand.  Working drawings and a bill of quantities are being prepared for a new district headquarters in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and it is expected that a contract will be placed in the near future.  Working drawings and a bill of quantities are also being prepared for new divisional headquarters in Limerick and it is hoped to place a contract within a few months.  There will be no avoidable delay in this or any other scheme and unofficial publicity campaigns, apart from their essential unseemliness, cannot produce any more speed.  Sketch plans have been approved for new district headquarters in Castlerea, Granard, Kanturk, Killaloe and Newcastlewest and for a new station in Castleblayney. The Office of Public Works are now proceeding with the necessary arrangements for the preparation of working drawings and bills of quantities and it is hoped to place contracts later in the year.</P>
    <P>The planning of a new headquarters in the Castle for the Dublin metropolitan area and a new technical bureau in the depot is proceeding. Major improvement schemes have been completed at Coolock and Howth Garda Stations.  Schemes are being carried out to Store Street Garda Station and to the Garda stations in Sligo, Longford, Blanchardstown <Col N="511" /> and Recess.  Contracts have been placed for major improvement schemes to Enniskerry and Naas Garda Stations and schemes have been approved for Finglas, Mountjoy and Whitehall Garda Stations in Dublin and for the Garda Stations in Mullingar, Lusk, Cabinteely, Ballyconnell and MacCurtain Street in Cork.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner has furnished a list of about 150 Garda stations in need of replacement and 250 in need of major improvement and the Minister for Finance has approved of an allocation of £2.5 million over the next five years to finance this programme.  Even in these days, when millions are casually referred to, this is a large sum of money and is the real earnest of the Government's intentions in this area.</P>
    <P>Law reform is an aspect of my Department's work which is of special concern to me, and particularly so in the field of family law where there are many matters requiring urgent attention.</P>
    <P>Because of my concern in this area I have, in consultation with the Attorney General, recently established an informal Committee for Law Reform, consisting of myself, as Minister for Justice, the Attorney General, Mr. Justice Brian Walsh of the Supreme Court and an Assistant Secretary of my Department.  The purpose of the committee is to examine areas in which law reform&mdash;both on the criminal and civil side&mdash;is urgently needed and to establish working parties or groups to examine particular aspects of the law, concentrating at the outset on matters that are of a social as well as a legal nature.  Each working group will, either at the end of their deliberations or from time to time, make recommendations to me as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The various working parties will consist of members of the Judiciary, of both branches of the legal profession, of persons engaged in social and charitable activities, of representatives of bodies active and knowledgeable in the particular field, as well as of officers of Government Departments involved in the problems being examined. <Col N="512" /> This is an experimental approach and I shall be watching it with the advice and assistance of the Attorney General.  Should it prove successful, it can be continued and one could foresee it developing into a full-blown Law Commission.</P>
    <P>I attach great importance to this law reform programme and the implementation of it will proceed with all possible speed, subject to the limitation that the expert persons needed to translate proposals into legislation are thinner on the ground than I would like and this perhaps is the first problem to be overcome.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to refer to the question of legal aid.  As Deputies will be aware, we have had since 1965 a statutory scheme of legal aid in criminal matters and for some years past legal aid has also been given in <i>habeas corpus</i> cases under an informal arrangement between the Attorney General and the Minister for Finance, where the High Court or the Supreme Court recommends the grant of legal aid.  In the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1973, I took the opportunity of extending the statutory scheme in two important respects&mdash; firstly, to make legal aid available for the hearing in the court of sentence where the accused has been sent forward for sentence&mdash;and for any subsequent appeal against sentence&mdash;and, secondly, to make legal aid available for all preliminary examinations in the District Court.  Previously legal aid for preliminary examinations was restricted to cases of murder.  Legal aid in civil as well as criminal matters is nowadays universally regarded as a fundamental human right and I have always felt that civil legal aid must come here sooner or later.</P>
    <P>We are probably the only member of the Common Market which does not provide legal aid in civil matters and, indeed, our membership of the Community imposes obligations on us to introduce a measure of civil legal aid in certain areas.  This is a question to which I have given much thought and I have decided, as I announced recently, to set up an informal committee to advise me on the introduction of a system of civil legal aid.  The committee <Col N="513" /> will consist of representatives of both branches of the legal profession, a representative of FLAC, officers of interested Government Departments and the chairman will, I hope, be a judge.  The precise terms of reference and the membership of the committee are at present being settled but I expect to have the committee established and working very shortly.</P>
    <P>This is an opportune moment to pay tribute to FLAC, the voluntary organisation of law students who, with some professional assistance, have been operating in recent years a legal aid and advice service.  These students deserve the highest praise for the very valuable work which they are doing in an area of social need.  As I stated in the opening part of this speech, a grant of £5,000 per annum to FLAC is now proposed as an earnest of the Government's recognition of their work.</P>
    <P>Recent legislation includes the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1973, the Charities Act, 1973, the Auctioneers and House Agents Act, 1973, the Genocide Act, 1973, and the Courts Act, 1973, and I hope to be introducing several other Bills in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure continues with its most valuable work, and I take the opportunity to thank its members.  They could be forgiven for thinking that the lack of action in regard to so many of their reports denotes a certain ingratitude.</P>
    <P>Reports of the committee not yet implemented deal with jury service, the criminal jurisdiction of the High Court, appeals from conviction on indictment, proof of previous convictions, the interest rate on judgement debts, the jurisdiction and practice of the Supreme Court, the organisation of the courts, the liability of barristers and solicitors for professional negligence, the &ldquo;fines-on-the-spot&rdquo; system, court fees and the execution of money judgments, orders and decrees.  The matters dealt with in these reports are being examined and I hope to introduce amending legislation, where necessary, in due course.</P>
    <P>I extended the terms of reference of <Col N="514" /> the committee to include such matters, including matters of substantive law, as the Minister for Justice might from time to time request the committee to examine and I asked them at their early convenience to examine and make recommendations on the substantive law as to the desertion of wives and children, the attachment of wages and the desirability of establishing special family tribunals.  They were also asked to examine at the same time the legal procedure in regard to maintenance of spouses and children, affiliation, declarations of legitimacy and guardianship and custody of children.  I am glad to say that the committee have completed their investigations and, as I said at the recent AIM Seminar, I expect to have their recommendations in the very near future.  After publication I will be available to interested persons and organisations for discussions on the report.  Drafting of amending legislation will then commence as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Two separate reports dealing with different subjects have been presented by the Landlord and Tenant Commission. The first report deals with the renewal of occupational tenancies under the 1931 Landlord and Tenant Act.  The commission's second report deals with extensions of the rights of renewal and of outright purchase given by the Landlord and Tenant Acts of 1958 and 1967 to what may best be described as ground rent tenants.  The second report covered <i>inter alia</i> the renewal of the tenancies of sports clubs in certain circumstances. Certain of the recommendations in the commission's second report, including those dealing with the grant of a new type of lease to sports clubs, have already been implemented, with some modifications, in the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971.  A comprehensive Landlord and Tenant Bill has been drafted on the basis of the two reports of the commission that I have mentioned.  I hope shortly to be in a position to submit this Bill to the Government for approval with a view to its introduction.</P>
    <P>In recent months I have had <Col N="515" /> discussions with representatives of tenants in Cappoquin, County Waterford. I have also had representations from tenants in Marino Crescent, Clontarf, Dublin.  Both the Cappoquin tenants and the Marino tenants feel that there are anomalies in the law which adversely affect their interests. I advised these tenants to put their cases before the Landlord and Tenant Commission and I understand that the commission are dealing with both cases.  When I have the commission's recommendations I will be in a position to consider the question of changes in the law.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noticed that I included in the Supplementary Estimates I mentioned earlier, one for the payment of compensation under a scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  This is the scheme to which I have referred, in reply to Dáil questions, a number of times in this House with particular reference to the victims of the Dublin bomb outrages of December, 1972, and January, 1973.</P>
    <P>The Government have now approved of a detailed scheme of compensation. Briefly, compensation will be payable by a tribunal for personal injuries received in the course of crimes of violence.  The injuries must merit an award of at least £50 and must have been sustained since 1st October, 1972. Compensation will be on the basis of common law damages.  I am now in the process of setting up the tribunal and its organisation to administer the scheme and when I have done this&mdash; which should take no longer than a week or two&mdash;claimants will be in a position to get in touch with the tribunal itself.  I may add that the tribunal will be entirely independent in determining claims.  I recently caused copies of the scheme to be laid before the House.</P>
    <P>Entry into the EEC has affected my Department in a number of respects, principally in relation to the Communities' Court of Justice and the treaty provisions regarding right of establishment and approximation of laws.</P>
    <P>The Council of the European Communities <Col N="516" /> has issued a considerable number of directives and regulations to implement the treaty provisions regarding free movement of persons and services.  One of the effects of these directives and regulations is to require member states to liberalise their regimes of entry and residence in respect of nationals of other member states availing themselves of the right of establishment, right to supply services and right to free movement of workers.  The European Communities (Aliens) Regulations, 1972, accordingly confer rights of entry and residence on certain categories of persons who are nationals of member states of the Communities.  These regulations take account of the special transitional provision in regard to free movement of workers that has been made in favour of this country in the Treaty of Accession to the Communities.</P>
    <P>The right of establishment and the right to supply services has already been extended to some occupations in respect of which I am the appropriate Minister.  As a result, Irish nationals or companies who wish to engage in the sale of intoxicating liquor, to act as auctioneers and house agents or to deal in arms, ammunitions and explosives can establish themselves in these occupations or supply the services in question in any state in the Community on the same basis as nationals or firms of the host member state.  Conversely, nationals and companies from other member states can establish themselves here, or supply relevant services here, on the same basis as Irish nationals and Irish firms&mdash;in other words, they must comply with Irish law in all respects if they want to engage in those occupations here.</P>
    <P>As far as this country is concerned, no change is needed in our existing legislation governing these occupations because our law does not discriminate against non-nationals.  Similar provisions have been applied to pawnbrokers and moneylenders by virtue of a directive on freedom of establishment for banks and other financial institutions made by the Council on 28th June, 1973, but <Col N="517" /> member states have been given until the end of 1974 to apply the provisions in the case of these two occupations.</P>
    <P>A draft directive on the freedom of lawyers of member states to provide certain services in other member states is at present being studied by a working group established by the EEC Council. The proposed directive would permit lawyers of any member state to provide legal advice and also to engage in advocacy before the courts in other member states on a temporary basis in pursuance of a professional engagement. Under the draft directive, member states would be required to remove any restrictions based on nationality which would hinder this freedom to provide the legal services concerned. There is continuous consultation with both branches of the legal profession on the draft so that account can be taken of their views in deciding the line to be taken in the working group discussions.</P>
    <P>As a result of our entry into the EEC, there will be an important new body of law in the financial, industrial and commercial fields to be dealt with by our courts.  The newly-established relationship between our courts and the Court of Justice of the European Communities is of particular interest to my Department.  New procedures are required in this context.</P>
    <P>In December, 1972, two sets of regulations were made under the European Communities Act, 1972, so as to link up our judicial system with the European Court.  These regulations related, respectively, to rules of court and enforcement of community judgments. The European Court (Rules of Court) Regulations, 1972, provided a basis for any new court procedures made necessary by this country's membership of the European Communities.  The second set of regulations&mdash;The European Communities (Enforcement of Community Judgment) Regulations, 1972 &mdash; were necessitated by the treaty provisions whereby judgments of the European Court and certain decisions of Community institutions are enforceable in the member state concerned under the rules of civil procedure; these regulations provide for enforcement of <Col N="518" />&ldquo;community judgments&rdquo; under the procedure here for enforcement of civil judgments of the Irish courts.</P>
    <P>The European Communities (Judicial Notice and Documentary Evidence) Regulations, 1972, which were also made under the European Communities Act, provide that judicial notice shall be taken of the treaties governing the European Communities, of the Official Journal of the Communities, and of decisions of, or expressions of opinion by, the European Court of Justice; these regulations also provide for the proof in evidence of the treaties and of certain Community acts, judgments and documents.</P>
    <P>The treaties confer on the European Court jurisdiction to give rulings concerning the interpretation of the treaties, the validity and interpretation of acts of institutions of the Communities, and the interpretation of the statutes of certain Community bodies. National courts may refer questions of this kind to the European Court and the making of rules of court in connection with such referrals is under consideration by the Courts' Rules Committees.</P>
    <P>I should mention, in this general context, that the European Court, represented by its President and five judges, with an Advocate-General and the Registrar of the Court, paid an official visit to this country in November, 1972.  There have also been a number of visits by judges of our courts to the Court in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>The Community institutions and the member states are continuing with the work of harmonising their legal provisions which have a direct bearing on the establishment and functioning of the Common Market.  To this end a number of Conventions have been prepared or are being prepared under the auspices of the EEC.  My Department is directly concerned with three particularly important Conventions. These are the EEC Conventions on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Civil and Commercial Judgments, on Bankruptcy, and on Private International Law.  The first-named Convention, which applies to maintenance orders as well as other civil <Col N="519" /> judgments, came into operation, as between the six original member states, on 1st February, 1973.</P>
    <P>In signing the Treaty of Accession the new member states undertook to accede to this Convention, subject to any necessary adjustments to be negotiated. These negotiations are now proceeding.  It appears unlikely that the Convention will come into force for this country for some considerable time.  Meanwhile, as the House is aware, negotiations are in progress with Britain with a view to working out a suitable interim arrangement for the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders.  I hope that the position will be reached where I can introduce legislation to give effect to the arrangement on our side during the next session.  Assuming that the legislation is enacted before the Summer recess, the agreement can be signed and implemented shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>The draft Convention on Bankruptcy is the outcome of approximately seven years' work by eminent jurists from the six original member states.  This draft is now being considered by delegates from member states of the enlarged Community, including representatives from my Department, meeting periodically in Brussels.  The report of our own Bankruptcy Law Committee has recently been published and proposals for the amendment and codification of our existing bankruptcy provisions are contained in the draft Bankruptcy Bill and the draft Bankruptcy rules which are appended to that report. The relationship between the draft convention and the recommendations of the Bankruptcy Law Committee is being examined Departmentally.</P>
    <P>A private international law convention is also being prepared under the auspices of the Commission of the European Communities.  This convention will deal with the law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations and the law applicable to corporeal and incorporeal property. A preliminary draft of the convention is at present being considered by a committee of experts consisting of delegates from the various member states.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> I was aware when I took office of the need for some changes in the adoption laws.  I have had extensive discussions with persons knowledgeable in the field, the societies, social workers, the board itself.  As a result, I am now in a position to put proposals to the Government.  I hope to have amending legislation introduced during this session. I confess I had hoped to be further advanced at this stage but the discussions took longer than I anticipated. I am grateful to all who had discussions with me.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board made 1,402 adoption orders in 1973, 111 more than in 1972.  The proportion of children placed by adoption societies was 84 per cent compared with 83 per cent in 1972.  Seven hundred and fifteen of the orders made in 1973 were in respect of boys and 687 were in respect of girls. The board continues to hold sittings outside Dublin so as to facilitate prospective adopters.  Forty-eight of the total of 94 meetings held during the year were held in various centres outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>There has been some increase in recent years in the number of aliens registered as being resident here for three months or more.  The number so registered on 31st December, 1972, was 6,118, as against 6,088 on 31st December, 1971.  These are the latest figures available.  Roughly 226,000 temporary visitors came here in 1973 from places other than the North of Ireland and Great Britain, as compared with 211,000 such visitors in 1972.  This is an increase of 7 per cent.  The figures do not include British born subjects who are exempt from control on a reciprocal basis.</P>
    <P>In 1973, 98 persons were naturalised as compared with 89 in the previous year.  This brings to 3,115 the total number of all persons naturalised since 1935, when provision for naturalisation was made.</P>
    <P>In 1973 the Film Censor examined 865 films with a total footage of 3,502,868.  The number of films examined by the censor in 1972 was 791 and the footage examined in that year was 2,775,852.  Of the total of 865 films which the censor examined in 1973, 650 were passed without cuts, 195 <Col N="521" /> were passed with cuts and 20 were rejected.</P>
    <P>The Censor issued 247 limited certificates. The Censorship of Films Appeal Board considered appeals in respect of 13 films.  Six of the appeals were rejected.  One film was allowed for general viewing with cuts, four for limited viewing without cuts and two for limited viewing with cuts.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made to me from time to time that persons under age are admitted to films issued with a limited certificate.  While I have no reason to doubt that in general exhibitors of films do their best to comply with the conditions of the certificate, I would urge exhibitors to take all possible steps to ensure that the conditions imposed by the Film Censor are met.  I recognise that there are difficulties in enforcing any law based on an age differential. Nevertheless, I have brought these complaints to the attention of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, with a view to ensuring that persons under the age specified in a certificate granted by the Film Censor are not admitted to these films.</P>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to the increasing amount of unsolicited pornographic material received in the post from abroad and I would like to take this opportunity of warning parents to check the post coming to their homes.  In addition, complaints have been made to me about the quantity of paperback pornography available and I am considering possible measures to deal with this undesirable development.  I share the concern expressed by those parents and organisations who have contacted me on the subject.  I particularly deplore the fact that some Irish publications consistently carry material quite obviously intended to provide sexual titillation even if so far they have avoided penalisation by the law.</P>
    <P>The Censorship of Publications Board examined 251 books and eight periodicals in 1973.  Four books were examined as a result of formal complaints from members of the public and 247 books were referred to the board by officers of Customs and Excise. The board made 219 prohibition <Col N="522" /> orders in respect of books and five in respect of periodicals.</P>
    <P>Appeals for revocation of prohibition orders were examined by the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board in respect of two books and two periodicals.  These appeals were successful.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1967, a prohibition order imposed on the ground that a book is indecent or obscene ceases to have effect after 12 years.  By virtue of this provision 393 prohibition orders in respect of books ceased to have effect on 31st December, 1973.</P>
    <P>In the Public Record Office the amount of material being transferred continued to grow.  The main intake of documents in the office consists of the transfer of records from the principal and district probate registries and from the courts.  During the period under review a large quantity of legal papers was received from solicitors and others.</P>
    <P>When I took office the outstanding feature on my political or departmental horizon was the amount being written about the prisons in a critical way and the considerable unrest that appeared to be inside the prisons themselves.  Much of what was being written was highly critical and certainly suggested to the public that conditions in our prisons, principally Mountjoy and Portlaoise, were extremely bad and that our prisoners were being treated in a degrading and inhuman way.</P>
    <P>I now want to put the record straight.</P>
    <P>Although I was fully briefed by my officials on every aspect of our prison system and on the plans for improvements and developments then existing, I decided to refrain from public comment until I had seen for myself the conditions obtaining in every prison and place of detention.  I, therefore, went on a tour of inspection as soon as time permitted.  During the summer months last year I visited each institution under my control.  I inspected accommodation, sampled the food, looked at sanitary, recreational and educational facilities, <Col N="523" /> spoke to the staff and spoke privately to a number of offenders in custody. I was satisfied that, as a result, I had acquired some insight into and a good deal of knowledge of our prison regimes.</P>
    <P>The facts that I discovered were far from depressing.  I found that our prisoners were well fed, well clothed and well housed.  I found that the prison buildings were old but within the limitations of their age were in good condition and the physical accommodation available for the prisoners was clean, bright, dry and reasonably comfortable.  In addition, I found that there were open institutions for young offenders and one such institution for adult offenders. None of these institutions could be termed prisons in the normal meaning of that word.</P>
    <P>I could not co-relate what I had seen with what I was reading in the media and I decided that it was necessary that representatives from the media should see our prisons. Accordingly, I arranged for a party of journalists to visit all the prisons and places of detention for which I am responsible.  I know that some journalists were disappointed that they were not included in the group that visited the prisons, but the party had to be kept to a reasonable size or it would not have been possible to have the visit at all and it was this consideration that caused me to limit the journalists to representatives from the four groups publishing daily papers, a representative from RTE and one from the <i>Garda Review</i>, the latter being a specialist journal with a specific interest in this field.  I think that as a result of this visit the public now have a more balanced idea of what our prisons are like and the regime that is maintained within them and I think are satisfied too that they are not the degrading and inhuman places as alleged.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that I was satisfied with everything I saw.  I found that in two areas principally there was room for improvements and these were in the field of education and work in <Col N="524" /> the adult prisons.  Improvements in these two aspects, however, are inextricably tied up with the physical accommodation available.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal now with the plans which are in hand for redeveloping and re-constructing some of our prisons.</P>
    <P>I was asked, in a parliamentary question by Deputy Noel Lemass in November last to state what plans existed for prison developments when I took office.  I am not quite sure whether the object was to get on the record of the House what the position was at the change of Government or whether there was, additionally, some kind of implication that I had been seeking to claim credit for what my predecessor had done.  I take this opportunity to recall to the House that I had already clearly placed on the records of this House&mdash;as well as saying it elsewhere&mdash;that I was glad to be able to say that a considerable amount of development work had been done and was being done when I took office. My concern is to see that the progress continues and that further improvements are made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I will deal with our other custodial centres in a moment but first I want to outline the plans for development and improvements to both Mountjoy and Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>The problems that had to be faced with regard to Mountjoy stemmed mainly from the limitations imposed by the lack of space for development, from the age of the building itself and from the fact that it is accommodating a greater number of prisoners than we would wish.  As can be appreciated, with a &ldquo;chock-a-block&rdquo; prison it is difficult to begin a rebuilding programme and a fundamental decision had, therefore, to be taken on whether it would be possible at all to modernise the place or whether a new prison should be provided and Mountjoy closed altogether.  These matters were examined in great detail and when all the factors were weighed and assessed it was decided to take the former course.  A feasibility-and-cost study was made of the most effective way of modernising Mountjoy and plans have <Col N="525" /> been drawn up and are now being further refined.  The plans will be implemented in stages with one wing at a time being vacated and it will follow a course along the following lines.</P>
    <P>Phase I entails the building of a new corrective training unit and this is now nearing completion, near the site of Mountjoy Prison.  It will accommodate about 100 selected adult male prisoners in modern and comfortable surroundings.  Those detained there will have liberal living conditions and it could be said that the unit will not be a prison in the conventional sense.  It will function rather as an educational and training establishment in which the courses and programmes will be intensive and the emphasis will be on rehabilitation and re-socialisation.</P>
    <P>Phase II, which entails the modernisation of the existing wings of Mountjoy, will begin when the corrective training unit is ready for occupation, which will be about the middle of this year.  The overall modernisation programme includes re-roofing, the provision of new reception and visiting areas, improved sanitary and washing facilities, the reconstruction of the administrative block and the provision of new facilities for work, recreation and education.  The whole programme will take about 5 years to complete and is expected to cost in the region of £2 million at present prices.</P>
    <P>New officers' quarters will be built outside the walls of the prison in the garden of the Governor's house.  Contract documents for this building are ready and it is hoped to invite tenders shortly.  The work is expected to take about 18 months to complete.  When this building is completed the existing officer quarters will be demolished and a new building for inmates who are ill will be erected on the site.</P>
    <P>Apart from these major developments, other improvement works are proposed for the Mountjoy complex, such as the replacement of the fire mains and domestic water supply, the provision of a new reservoir, plant house and ESB sub-station and wall building and repairs.  The objective is to have these particular works completed <Col N="526" /> by about the end of this year. The Portlaoise prison compound also suffers, to much the same extent as Mountjoy, from lack of space.  Fortunately, however, the Department owns the farm adjoining the prison and it is proposed to utilise some of this land for building purposes and for the provision of additional amenities. The most important development to the existing prison compound itself will be the demolition of the old county jail buildings which are used mainly as store rooms at present. This cannot be done until a new stores building is provided and detailed plans for the building are already drawn up and it is hoped to place a contract within the next few months. The new stores will also be located in the farm area close to the exit gates of the existing compound.  The stores will take six months to complete.</P>
    <P>The demolition of the old county jail buildings will provide much needed space in the prison compound to enable new service buildings for work, education, indoor recreation, <i>et cetera</i>, to be provided.</P>
    <P>A new self-contained unit, which will provide maximum security conditions for about 50 prisoners will also be built and when that is done it will be possible to begin work on the existing cell block, which needs to be modernised.  Plans for this modernisation include the flooring of each level of the block, the provision of new sanitary facilities, recreational areas, hobby rooms, <i>et cetera</i>.  A new officers' quarters will also be provided outside the perimeter walls.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly now with the other new developments in the adult prisons.</P>
    <P>Arbour Hill, the former military detention barracks, is being converted to a civil prison and work has already started on the building of the necessary service and ancillary facilities. The contractors have given a completion date of August, 1974.  The prison will accommodate about 100 adult males.  This will provide further relief to Mountjoy.  Cork Prison, which was also acquired from the military authorities, is also being <Col N="527" /> modernised and adapted and this, when completed, will provide accommodation for about 100 offenders. Cork and Limerick are now operating as local prisons catering for those from the southern countries serving sentences of two years and less. Mountjoy is accommodating prisoners from other parts of the country and those serving over two years.</P>
    <P>Plans for the provision of a new women's prison to replace the existing prisons in Mountjoy and Limerick are under consideration.</P>
    <P>It might be appropriate at this stage to deal briefly with the medical services available in Mountjoy as they have been the subject of some considerable comments.</P>
    <P>Medical services are provided by a visiting general practitioner, who examines all prisoners on committal or as soon as possible thereafter and calls every day to the prison to see any prisoner who requires treatment. Those requiring specialist treatment are referred to an outside consultant.</P>
    <P>A section of Mountjoy&mdash;the C wing &mdash;is designated as a hospital area and prisoners with minor medical conditions are housed there.  A fully equipped dental surgery is maintained and the service is provided by a visiting dental surgeon.  Offenders requiring specialised medical attention or surgery are referred to outside hospitals.</P>
    <P>A visiting psychiatrist holds a clinic once a week by arrangement with the Eastern Health Board and psychiatric treatment is also provided, on an outpatient basis, at the Usher's Island clinic, which is also under the health board auspices.  Where residential psychiatric care is necessary, as in the case of prisoners with more serious mental illnesses, the prisoners are transferred to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, which is run by the Eastern Health Board, or to district mental hospitals as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that there is no suggestion that C Wing is or is intended to serve as a hospital in the normal sense of that term. Likewise, there is no suggestion that <Col N="528" /> the prison is self-contained and self-sufficient in the matter of the provision of psychiatric care.  When I took office I found that a deliberate policy decision had been taken by my predecessor&mdash;and I will say straight away that on the information available to me, it was the right decision&mdash; that there could be no question of our attempting to duplicate, within the prison service, the highly specialised and very expensive medical and psychiatric services that are being provided by hospitals and clinics for the general public.  Even if there were no limit to available finances, there is &mdash;and not only in this country but generally&mdash;a shortage of the highly trained personnel needed to provide such services.  It would be wasteful, to the point of absurdity, to attempt to provide a comprehensive psychiatric service within the prison walls and, for this reason, the policy is that prison inmates who need this kind of service are sent out for it.  It is, therefore, quite misleading for people to refer to the number of hours per week spent by specialists within the prison.</P>
    <P>Consultations are at present taking place between representatives of my Department, the prison medical officers and the psychiatric services division of the Eastern Health Board to ascertain what changes might be needed.  In addition, an informal committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Henchy is investigating the psychiatric and related areas and as there are representatives of my Department on this committee together with members from the Eastern Health Board proper liaison will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with the two areas to which I referred as needing improvement, that is, work and education, and discussing prison policy generally, I think it appropriate to describe at this stage the centres for juveniles and the open centres including Shelton Abbey, the open centre for adults.</P>
    <P>St. Patrick's Institution, the closed detention centre in Dublin catering for juvenile offenders in the 16-21 age group, has now a well developed <Col N="529" /> educational unit.  Under an arrangement made with the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, the unit is staffed by teachers from Scoil Eanna in Cabra, who are currently providing the services of one teacher full-time and 13 teachers on a part-time basis.  In addition, two teachers from the College of Technology, Bolton Street, make their services available for late evening classes. There are remedial classes and classes in academic and manual subjects for the more advanced.  Further space is currently being provided for engineering subjects through the conversion of the ground floor of an existing building and work will be completed on this shortly.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and the principal of Scoil Eanna and his staff for the excellent service they are giving in St. Patrick's.</P>
    <P>The open centres at Shanganagh and Loughan House, Blacklion, County Cavan, between them cater for almost 100 youths.  This means that more than one-third of all youths sentenced to detention may serve their sentences in an open environment under very liberal conditions. The numbers there vary from time to time but it is my policy to use the facilities to the maximum extent possible. Educational and recreational facilities are being extended in these centres and a new gymnasium and instructional classrooms will be opened in Shanganagh later this year.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that a site is being acquired in the Dublin area on which it is hoped to build a new detention centre for juveniles, which will afford considerable relief to St. Patrick's and will enable some structural modernisation to be implemented there.  The drawing of plans for this new centre will commence as soon as the legal formalities connected with the purchase of the site have been completed. A new detention centre for juveniles is also being planned for Cork.  A six-acre site opposite the existing Cork Prison has been acquired for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Shelton Abbey, which was formerly <Col N="530" /> a Department of Lands forestry training school, has been functioning as an open prison for male adults since February, 1972.  The number detained there over the months since then has varied up to 20.  The selection of prisoners for Shelton is done very carefully and only those convicted of less serious offences and those serving fairly short sentences are transferred there.  Work there up to the present has been confined to clearing and improving the grounds and adapting and improving the building but plans for the future include the provision of facilities for education and for a more purposeful work programme.  Even though we have brought this institution into use, on a limited basis, before all the planned facilities could be made available there, the results so far indicate that this has been a most successful venture and it is hoped to be able to increase the population there gradually.</P>
    <P>From what I have said about existing conditions and the major developments that are taking place in our larger prisons, it will be apparent that the objective is to ensure not only that all offenders can serve their sentence in reasonable conditions but that those who are willing to co-operate will be given the maximum possible aid and encouragement to turn over a new leaf.</P>
    <P>It is frequently alleged that our prison system is based on the principle of punishment for wrong done, whereas&mdash;so the argument goes&mdash; prisons should exist only to rehabilitate offenders.</P>
    <P>As to that, the first point I would make is that no person, no institution and no system can rehabilitate anybody. In human terms, at all events, the only person who can rehabilitate a person who needs rehabilitation is himself. All a prison system can do&mdash;and this it should certainly strive to do&mdash; is to create conditions in which, as I have said earlier, he is given the maximum possible aid and encouragement.</P>
    <P>However, rehabilitation is not and cannot be the only consideration.  If it were, then, to put it plainly, quite a number of the most hardened criminals in prisons all over the world should be <Col N="531" /> released because the unquestionable fact is that many of them offer no prospect whatsoever of being rehabilitated. Yet, as we all know, they cannot be released and the community would not stand for their being released.  To say this is very far from saying that punishment, in the sense of retribution, is, or must be, a factor in imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Certainly, in the practical realities of prison life, there is no question of anybody being given punishment for punishment's sake.  The concept of retribution does not enter into it even in the slightest degree.  What does and must enter, though, as well as the concept of rehabilitation, is the concept of the protection of society, both in the direct sense of keeping a potentially dangerous prisoner locked up and, much more important, in the indirect sense of a deterrent to others.  There are, of course, people who will argue that imprisonment is not a deterrent to others and is no protection to society. Nevertheless, those who commit serious crimes, particularly crimes of violence must expect that they will have to serve substantial terms of imprisonment. I think society would be very apprehensive, indeed, if such an expectation were to be removed.</P>
    <P>Yet, as I have already said, rehabilitation is an aim and a major one. But it is not something which a prison administration can achieve by waving a magic wand.  Offenders committed to custody are, in general, people who have failed to conform to the standards of behaviour society finds acceptable.  All the normal forces and influences which operate for the good of the individual have failed in their case.  Parents have failed, schools have failed, welfare organisations have failed and, in many cases, psychologists and psychiatrists have failed.  In the light of all of this and, bearing in mind that over 80 per cent spend six months or less in custody when remission is taken into account, is it reasonable to expect a prison system to have spectacular success&mdash; or is it fair to indict the system if it, too, fails?</P>
    <P>Whatever success is possible in this <Col N="532" /> area can only be achieved where the offender himself makes a conscious effort to rehabilitate himself and seeks help and support.  I accept that facilities and services for rehabilitation, perhaps more than any other facet of our prison system, need to be further developed so that every prisoner who is serious about reform is not only helped but helped to the maximum extent.</P>
    <P>There are two areas mainly where development and improvements are necessary and these are education and work within the prisons.  Only about 1 per cent of prisoners could be described as well educated and very many are either illiterate or read and write imperfectly.  Work within the prisons has tended to be &ldquo;occupational&rdquo; in character, that is to say, its principal purposes have been to keep the prisoners occupied during working hours and to have them service and maintain the prison at the same time.</P>
    <P>Many prisoners are people who have drifted in and out of unskilled occupations or have been unemployed for long periods.  It is not easy to do much about this in the short space of time the majority of offenders spend in custody but I hope that some improvements can be made even in relation to them.  The area where I would see the best prospect for improvement, however, is in relation to the longer term offenders, those serving 12 months and over, who are, perhaps, the category that needs it most.</P>
    <P>I am appointing a co-ordinator of education and a co-ordinator of employment for the Prison Service to add further momentum to the development and expansion of education and &ldquo;training-orientated&rdquo; employment in the prisons and recruitment of these persons should take place shortly.  I would here emphasise again, what I mentioned briefly earlier, that already we have been getting great and much-valued assistance from the relevant vocational bodies and further assistance is promised in the near future as soon as facilities are available. There is no question of recruiting teachers where the services of teachers <Col N="533" /> are made available to us by the vocational education committees.  It is these specialists who have been devising and who will continue to devise educational and other related courses and programmes.  My Department's role will be one of co-ordinating these services and initiating ideas for new programmes or courses.</P>
    <P>I have said already that the new corrective training unit later this year will provide very modern facilities for about 100 selected offenders but side by side with this, the appropriate services will be developed in our existing prisons as well.  My Department has already sought the help of the industrial training authority, AnCO, with a view to the establishment within the prisons of AnCO-recognised industrial re-training courses for adult offenders.  We are also investigating whether apprenticeship and other courses for juveniles in St. Patrick's and the other juvenile centres could be set up.  AnCO courses have already been used with considerable success in the past in cases where it was possible to allow conditional release to selected offenders to attend them and I intend to continue to develop this system as far as possible. Where it would not be possible to release offenders to attend such courses, those serving longer sentences or in respect of whom some risk to society might still exist, it may be possible to develop some equivalent courses in the institutions.  Before I leave this topic there is one other aspect I should like to mention.  In a very real sense the rehabilitation of offenders is a matter for all of us.  It is a matter for the particular community in which the offender has lived and for society as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is society and not the prison sentence that stigmatises the offender and, in this regard, trade unionists and employers alike have an important role to play in helping him to reestablish himself and resettle and begin to live a useful life again.  We must, of course, recognise the limitations which an economy such as ours, which has not yet reached a full employment level, places on the employment of persons released from <Col N="534" /> custody.  I believe that the availability of worthwhile employment to exprisoners is a key factor in their rehabilitation but we cannot hope to achieve the success we would like until such employment is freely available.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated in speeches elsewhere that the alternatives available to courts at the moment ought to be looked at again with a view to devising some form of penalty which would deal with the many situations where a fine is inadequate but a prison sentence is too severe.  I have in mind persons being deprived of leisure, having to do compulsory social work, serving sentences at weekends <i>et cetera</i>.  This is an area in which I intend to initiate studies during the coming year to see what changes can be effected.  This will probably involve the courts and in this regard I might mention that I have indicated to the Judiciary that I would welcome visits to our prisons by those who have not already visited them.</P>
    <P>Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, I have considerable power to allow prisoners conditional release or what is commonly known as parole. I can attach conditions to this release requiring the prisoner to report back at night and to report back at weekends and by virtue of this power, which is used widely, can introduce variations in the sentences as mentioned above.  The decision will have to be taken as to whether the proper person to introduce the variation is the court imposing the sentence or the Minister who supervises it or some third party&mdash;some independent authority&mdash;and this is a matter of some fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>The system of conditional releases is operating very successfully up to now and last year up to 600 conditional releases were granted.  The system permits considerable flexibility to allow releases for work, interviews, compassionate family reasons <i>et cetera</i>, and it is effective because it is flexible.</P>
    <P>The area of offender treatment is a complex one and one which the countries of Western Europe&mdash;and of course farther afield &mdash; have been closely examining for some years past.  To an <Col N="535" /> increasing extent, professional and specialist disciplines are making a growing contribution to the analysis of the many problems involved.  Through our membership of the Council of Europe and the United Nations we are in regular contact with the prison administrations of other countries and at meetings and seminars officers of my Department partake in the exchange of ideas which is so important if we are to keep abreast of modern techniques and practices.</P>
    <P>While dealing with the subject of sentencing policy I might mention that a recent resolution from the Council of Europe on the subject of the treatment of those convicted of the less serious type of offence proposed alternative measures to imprisonment. While some of these measures, such as week-end imprisonment, have not been introduced here, some of the measures, for example, fines and short-term probation periods combined with intensive supervision by a trained probation officer are part of our system.  These measures as well as the suspended sentence are available to the courts in this country and there is evidence that they are being used to an increasing extent particularly since the availability of welfare officers to the courts to provide the specialised supervision of offenders has become more widespread.</P>
    <P>The Welfare Service of my Department has been strengthened and expanded in the past 12 months and this will continue.</P>
    <P>On 1st April, 1972, there were 24 serving officers in the service and there are now 47.  Recruitment will be continued until the number reaches about 80 officers.  The service is no longer confined to Dublin and we now have welfare officers available to the courts for the supervision of offenders placed on probation in the other cities and in the larger towns.  The aim is to have officers available to the courts in every area.  In addition, welfare officers are now attached to every prison and place of detention. There are about 1,000 offenders under supervision in the community by the Welfare Service, many of <Col N="536" /> whom might otherwise be in custody if this service was not available.</P>
    <P>This year the Government announced the allocation of additional funds for the improvement of child care services and my Department, being one of the three Departments involved in this area, was allotted £80,000 of the total amount made available.  It was decided that from this money a fund should be established for the Welfare Service, the aims of which would be to assist the families, particularly the children, of offenders in custody with travelling expenses incurred in visiting close relatives in custody and to help young people on probation or those being discharged from centres of detention who may have accommodation, employment or other difficulties. It will be confined to cases of very urgent need which are not being met by other agencies in this field at present.  This is a new development which I hope can be administered in a flexible manner so as to deal quickly and effectively with cases of real need.  It will be operable in a few months' time.</P>
    <P>It has been also decided to make grants available to voluntary bodies that are establishing hostels for homeless boys who come to the notice of the Welfare Service and for boys on probation.</P>
    <P>A grant of £35,000 has been paid to a religious order who are providing such a hostel in Ballyfermot and other smaller grants will be paid to groups in Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    <P>The total number of prison officers serving at present is approximately 620 and a further 70 officers are being recruited at present by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I have been conscious of the severe strain which has been placed on prison officers in Mountjoy and Portlaoise in the recent past.  This has been caused mainly by the actions of a small minority of prisoners who have attempted to form a so-called prisoners union and have engaged in an on-going campaign of disruption inside the prisons.  They have been supported <Col N="537" /> and encouraged in these actions by groups outside the prisons&mdash;some of them well known for their antipathy to the State.  There was also disruptive action from another group of prisoners, the purposes of which was to pursue a demand for political status.</P>
    <P>The effect of this situation on the prison staffs was severe.  Staff were frequently exposed to physical assaults and intimidation.  Prolonged periods of overtime became the norm and working conditions generally deteriorated considerably.  Deputies will be aware that recently I effected transfers of prisoners between prisons which has considerably eased these problems.</P>
    <P>Most of the group which can broadly be described as high security subversive prisoners are now housed in Portlaoise.  A small group of other high security prisoners are in the Curragh. This arrangement is a temporary one and when extra accommodation becomes available in the civil prisons they will be reallocated.  At this point too, I would like to pay tribute to the members of the Defence Forces who have carried out duties at the Curragh which are not normally part of their duties and are necessarily distasteful to them but they have carried them out loyally and without complaint.</P>
    <P>A start has been made in providing a comprehensive programme of training for prison officers.  Five induction courses have been held since July and these have catered for a total of 64 officers who were recruited since 1st May, 1973.  The induction courses which at present are of four weeks' duration, are designed to give new officers an appreciation of the purpose of the prison service and how it operates in the context of related services, such as the welfare service, the Garda Síochána and the courts. The aim is that at the end of the induction course, the newly-recruited officer will be thoroughly familiar with, and be able to carry out, his essential duties within the prison service.</P>
    <P>The programme of training envisages that, as well as the induction courses for new recruits, suitable <Col N="538" /> courses will be provided for all officers above the basic level.  The aim is that all training activities within the prison service will be co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>My hope is that in the not-too-distant future a special training centre can be provided for prison officers. In the meantime training will be expanded so as to provide the staff of the prison service with the necessary knowledge and skills and to develop the attitudes essential to the effective performance of their duties and to give them a sense of job satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The prison staffs have carried out their duties with great loyalty and there has been far too little public recognition of the debt we owe them. I take this opportunity to thank them.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this subject of prisons I want to state quite clearly that the responsibility for the prison service is mine and that any criticisms concerning its administration must be directed at me.  This is part and parcel of the job of Minister for Justice.  Any instructions or directions issued in the administration of the prison service are issued on my general authority and within the policy guidelines as laid down by me and subsequently are my responsibility.  It is wrong and unfair to point a finger at or attempt to blame any particular public servant for carrying out my directions.  If blame is to be attached it must be attached to me and if a finger is to be pointed it must be pointed at me.  I have complete confidence in the officers of my Department engaged in the work in this difficult and sensitive area.  It is mischievous and unfair to attack these efforts when what they are doing is loyally carrying out policy as approved by me.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the burden and responsibility which I have in this area and it is my intention to seek advice to assist me in discharging this duty. The ultimate responsibility being mine, it must also be my privilege to decide from where I seek this advice. During the past year self-appointed bodies have sought to advise me and direct me on this question of prisons and have been critical when I choose not to accept their advice or offers of help.  In gathering the help I will, first <Col N="539" /> of all, bring together the various funds of experience within the Department, including the prison governors and staff, the welfare service, the chaplains and medical officers and also the experience of bodies, such as the visiting committees, which have a function in relation to the prisons.  I am considering the establishment of an advisory committee representative of these people.  I am, indeed, conscious that prisons, imprisonment and prisoners are matters of great importance in our society requiring constant care, attention and study and it will be my intention to see that they get it.</P>
    <P>The next area of my Department's responsibilities that I want to deal with is that relating to the courts.</P>
    <P>We will all agree that persons who appear before our courts, whether they are there because they have civil business to transact or because they have come into conflict with the law, are entitled to have their cases dealt with expeditiously and fairly.  It is, therefore, of paramount importance that our courts should have all the resources necessary to the expeditious and fair discharge of the business coming before them.</P>
    <P>The continuous growth over the years in the volume of court business has accelerated in recent years especially, as one might expect, in Dublin.  The number of cases set down for hearing in the High Court has doubled in the past four years.  The overall volume of Circuit Court business has increased by 46 per cent in the past ten years; in the Dublin Circuit Court criminal trials have increased by 67 per cent and criminal appeals by 119 per cent in that period. The business in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court has increased by 70 per cent in the past ten years, the increase since 1970 being more than 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>This sharp increase in court business, coupled with the fact that the full time of a member of the judiciary from each of the three courts concerned is taken up with sittings of the Special Criminal Court, had overtaxed the time of the judiciary, with the result that serious <Col N="540" /> arrears have arisen in the High and Circuit Courts and a few sittings of the District Court had to be cancelled.</P>
    <P>Being very concerned at this situation I arranged, as a first step to remedy it, to provide additional judges and justices.  The Courts Act, 1973 provided for an increase from six to seven in the statutory number of ordinary judges of the High Court and an additional judge has now been appointed to that court.  Since 1971, the Circuit Court has had 11 judges including one &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; judge. With the recent appointment of an additional &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; judge that number has now been increased to 12.  The question of increasing the statutory number of ten &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; Circuit Court judges, including the President of the court, is at present being examined.  The number of justices serving the District Court has been increased from 35 to 37, including the President of the court, by the recent appointment of two additional &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; justices.  The question of appointing a further &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; justice is at present being examined.</P>
    <P>While the appointment of extra judges is a most important contribution to improving the situation, the procedural machinery in the courts must be examined to see how it can be changed or streamlined, or both, so as to ensure the most efficient discharge of court business.  I have, therefore, as indicated earlier, arranged for an urgent study to be made of some of the reports of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure which contain recommendations and suggest changes that could help considerably in improving the situation.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the accelerated growth in the volume of court business in recent years has had its greatest impact in Dublin.  One of the effects of this has been to create serious court accommodation problems in the one area in which I have direct responsibility for the provision of such accommodation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will already be aware, from Press statements issued last year, of <Col N="541" /> plans to erect a large complex of court buildings on a site that has been acquired at Smithfield, Dublin and, as a temporary measure, to provide, on another site in the vicinity of the Four Courts, urgently needed accommodation for the Dublin circuit court and for the Children's Court.  It had been expected that by now the temporary additional accommodation would have been built and ready for occupation but unfortunately, certain difficulties arose, which, I am confident, will be resolved very shortly.  I am now hopeful that this very urgently needed accommodation will be available in about a year's time.  In the meantime every effort has been, and is being, made to relieve the accommodation pressures. For example, temporary prefabricated offices have been provided in Chancery Street for the district court staff; existing accommodation has been rearranged to provide more office space; accommodation beside the Four Courts has been provided on a temporary basis for use as an additional district court for &ldquo;traffic&rdquo; cases; the President of the district court has made a determination the effect of which is to divert more Metropolitan District Court business to Dún Laoghaire; and an additional court has been provided for the circuit court from existing accommodation in the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>Dublin is not, of course, the only area in which there are serious court accommodation problems.  Problems of an acute nature have arisen elsewhere but, because of the constraint placed upon me by reason of the fact that the problem in one or two of these areas is at present <i>sub judice</i>, I do not propose to go into the matter further.  I hope Deputies will appreciate my position.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I should like to refer to before I pass on from the subject of the courts.  Deputies will, of course, be aware that the business of the District Court in the provinces was disrupted last year by industrial action taken by District Court Clerks in pursuit of a claim for pay parity with their Dublin colleagues. I am glad to be able to report that a basis for the settlement of the claim has since been agreed with the staff. <Col N="542" /> Briefly, the basis of the settlement is a productivity scheme, involving the reorganisation of the provincial District Court office and staffing structure, which has been cleared by the Labour Court as conforming to the terms of the Employer-Labour Conference National Agreement, 1972.</P>
    <P>In the Land Registry, the upward trend in the volume of work of recent years has continued; the number of applications for registration increased from 52,700 in 1972 to 58,200 in 1973.  This represents an increase of approximately 11 per cent over the 1972 figure.  The arrears of work while still very high decreased by 12 per cent during 1973.  I am aware that delays in registration are causing considerable hardship but every effort is being made to reduce them.  The reorganisation of the legal/clerical structure of the Land Registry which was carried out in 1970 has increased the output by 23 per cent over the corresponding period for last year. Other proposals which are being implemented should lead to further improvement in efficiency.</P>
    <P>However, I am still extremely concerned about the arrears in the Land Registry and in particular about arrears in the Mapping Branch.  The Mapping Branch has also been reorganised recently on the same lines as the legal/clerical side with a view to providing a more efficient service. In addition, I have recently obtained sanction for an extra 12 posts in the Mapping Branch and I have arrangements for the attendance by some of the staff of the branch at special training courses.  A sophisticated type of copying machine will be installed in the branch shortly which, as far as I am aware, will be the only one of its kind in use in this country.  I expect that as a result the issue of copy-maps to the public will be speeded up.  I am also arranging to have the accommodation at present used by the branch redesigned to provide better working conditions.  I have arranged that I will be kept regularly informed about the arrears position in the registry as a whole and, in particular, in the Mapping Branch and I shall take other remedial measures if there <Col N="543" /> is no appreciable reduction in the arrears in the near future.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question last July I indicated that I hoped to introduce at an early date a system of payment of Land Registry fees by cash.  This system will obviously facilitate most solicitors.  The existing system of payment by Revenue stamps will continue to operate for those who find it more convenient.  The necessary staff for the implementation of the new system have been assigned and an order has been placed for the office machinery.  It is necessary to have these machines specially constructed and because of this there is some delay in the delivery date.  I am informed however that it will be possible to have the new system operating at an early date.</P>
    <P>There has also been a general increase in the volume of work arising in the Registry of Deeds.  The number of deeds registered has gone up from just over 46,000 in 1972 to almost 51,300 and this upward trend is likely to continue.</P>
    <P>As a result of representations which were made to me that the service provided for searchers in the Registry of Deeds was inadequate I had an examination carried out and the staffing cadre has been increased.  This, I hope, will eliminate cause for complaints.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests are a statutory body originally incorporated in 1844. Their main functions, which are now derived from the Charities Act, 1961, are of an administrative character. They have power to advise charity trustees, to institute legal proceedings and to certify cases to the Attorney General with a view to his instituting such proceedings, power to frame <i>cy près</i> schemes, to accept gifts for charitable purposes, and to dispense with the publication of advertisements of charitable devises and bequests.</P>
    <P>The commissioners have a long and distinguished record of public service. The last report which the commissioners made to me is in respect of the year 1972.  Cash totalling £140,630 and stocks to the nominal value of <Col N="544" /> £7,600 were transferred to the commissioners during that year and at the end of the year the nominal value of investments standing in their name was some £2,806,000.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all bodies and commissions which are associated with my Department.  It is heartening to note that so many people are prepared to devote their valuable time and expertise as well as their leisure hours to work of national importance.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his speech on introducing his first Estimate.  It was a lengthy contribution and one must admire his stamina, first for producing the speech in his Department and secondly for delivering it with such clarity and articulation in the House.  However, there is one matter I brought to the attention of the Minister on a number of occasions, namely, that of providing the Opposition spokesman with a sight of the Minister's Estimate speech at least some 12 or 24 hours before he reads it in the House.  This applies to other Departments also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall repeat what I said in case it does not get a clear run on the record, namely, that I <Col N="545" /> would ask the Minister to consider a suggestion I made to him on a number of occasions.  No matter what party are in Opposition, the Opposition spokesman to the Minister who introduces an Estimate might be given sight of the speech at least 12 or 24 hours before its introduction here.  On past occasions I also expressed the view that the Minister of the day dealing with an Estimate might be concerned if he had new schemes to announce of which he might not wish to give the Opposition spokesman notice.  That is fair enough.  The Minister could provide a document from which he could delete sections he might not wish the Opposition spokesman to see.</P>
      <P>The document would be given on the honour system and in a spirit of confidentiality.  If that honour system were broken, if any confidences were revealed or if there was one breach of the system, it could be abandoned. It would be most helpful to the Opposition spokesman and would make for a better debate in that the Opposition could <i>seriatim</i> deal with the various items in the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>On this occasion I regret to say the Minister's speech was fairly predictable in that it dealt with working parties, committees and consultative groups, all comprised of worthy people, all of them proposing to produce conclusions on the various findings, after which the Minister would decide what legislation would be necessary.  One finds that basically very little new matter has been produced. As I shall not have an opportunity of concluding this evening, I intend tomorrow quoting a letter which states that 99 per cent of the material would have been introduced in the House by Fianna Fáil.  Unfortunately in February last year the people thought otherwise and now we are in Opposition.  Fianna Fáil did not have an opportunity of continuing what the Minister produced this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our intention, as an Opposition, to ensure that the aspirations and ideals set out in the Minister's speech will be pursued by us vigorously until <Col N="546" /> such time as all of what is in the Minister's speech comes to fruition.  We believe the only way that much of what the Minister has said can come to fruition will be by the production of legislation on the floor of this House.  We will pursue it by speeches outside the House, inside the House and by Parliamentary Questions.  May I pay special tribute in this respect to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Malley.  Much of the Minister's speech contains a lot of the groundwork done by him, Deputy O'Malley, in the Department of Justice.  Whereas the Minister himself has paid tribute to him on another occasion, it would have been fair to have mentioned him in his Estimate speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he will make more specific mention of him and pay him greater tribute for the work he has done in the Department of Justice.  Certainly in his short time as a very young Minister&mdash;possibly one of the youngest Ministers for Justice we have had&mdash;he discharged his duties with dignity, honour and courage.  There is no gainsaying that. I believe that within another six months or a year the real work of the Minister's predecessor will be clearly seen.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was a long one; it was a speech which indicated that, as he said himself, his basic concern must be for the security and safety of the State.  As spokesman on Justice for the Fianna Fáil Party, I should like to say that we share that basic concern.  As has been said by the Leader of the party, we will do nothing on this side of the House which will upset that concern either by word or action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When in Opposition the Minister was indeed very critical of much of the actions taken by his predecessor.  Now he finds himself in a very difficult Ministry indeed and possibly receiving quite a considerable amount of criticism which was previously directed at his predecessor.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate, and will be conscious of, the probable unfairness of quite a lot of the criticism levelled at the former Minister for Justice.  I mention <Col N="547" /> the Minister's colleague, Deputy Gerry L'Estrange.  Over the past 12 months much has happened in this country to cause concern in the area of law and security and, when the vocal Deputy L'Estrange was in Opposition, weekly, if not daily, or, indeed, hourly, he was in this House on his feet decrying the Government for not taking action in various areas in which we see the present Government finding it difficult to deal with.  For the past year the significant silence of Deputy L'Estrange is very noticeable.  What has happened that Deputy L'Estrange no longer comes in here and expresses the concern, proper concern, about the security of the country that he expressed so much when he was in Opposition?  It is not indeed, as if nothing has happened; a lot has happened in the last 12 months.  It is understandable that the Minister did not deal with it in his Estimate speech because he does not use his own speech, his own words or actions with which to whip himself. It is easy enough to understand his reason for omitting a number of matters which were certainly a cause for concern in the security of this country over the past 12 months.  He does not mention, of course, the mishandling by his colleague&mdash;the Minister for Defence&mdash;of the <i>Claudia</i> affair.</P>
    <P>There is no mention, good, bad or indifferent, of the helicopter affair in the Minister's Estimate speech.  I am sure he will deal with that when he is replying.  There was also the arresting of 15 alleged members of the IRA some hours before Mr. Faulkner was to meet his Unionist Party.  At 4 o'clock Mr. Faulkner had concluded the meeting with his party; at 5 o'clock&mdash;if my information is correct, and it is subject to correction&mdash;14 of those individuals had been released.  There was obviously no evidence against them to support a prosecution and they were, properly, released.  Indeed, it is much to the credit of the Garda Síochána that they were released.  We know of other countries where the police force, on the instructions of the Government of the day, might not have taken the same action as did the Garda Síochána on that particular day.  This is another <Col N="548" /> matter the Minister did not mention &mdash;the selective application of the law to bolster up Mr. Faulkner at that time.  On this side of the House we say, and I am sure the Minister would agree, that the law must be applied universally.</P>
    <P>Another matter the Minister did not mention&mdash;nobody has heard much about it in the recent past but I am sure, again, the Minister will deal with it in his reply&mdash;was the proposed introduction of section 9 of the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861.  If I remember correctly, the Minister's party, ably assisted by their colleagues in Coalition, the Labour Party, were critical about the manner in which the Fianna Fáil Party were enforcing the law.  Here the Minister goes back to an 1861 Act; he operates section 9 of that Act, or he hopes to do so.  I do not think there has been any prosecution under it to date&mdash; an Act of 1861 which we say is very clearly inoperable.</P>
    <P>He has a law reform enforcement committee sitting at the moment and it will be interesting to hear from them how section 9 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, may or will be operated.  At the time the Government announced that they intended to operate or, should I say, resurrect this Act, I articulated very clearly many of the reasons why this party felt that Act was inoperable. We still hold that view.  However, as I have said there is a committee to examine this and other matters leading to the Sunningdale communiqué and matters arising therefrom.</P>
    <P>In the context of law reform generally in this island, the committee might take this particular point into consideration. If this party are proved to be wrong in our criticism of the proposed reactivation of the 1861 Act we will be the first to admit it, but to date nobody has suggested that we are wrong.  The Minister has brought this Act up from the bottom of his legislative bag.  Because it was produced in Victorian times it is not necessarily bad and, as I have said, if we are proved to be wrong in our criticism we will say we were wrong.  The <Col N="549" /> Minister reactivated it shortly before or after Christmas but we have not heard too much of it since.</P>
    <P>The Government have a formula. You say you are going to do something, you say you are doing it and you say you have done it.  This kind of thing distinguishes the present Government's public relations and in this respect the GIS have exceeded themselves.  The Minister mentioned in his long speech today a number of legislative instruments which have been brought into being in the past year.  As I understand it, all of them effectively are extensions of proposed Fianna Fáil legislation.  The Minister mentioned on a number of occasions matters which he has brought up again today in his speech, particularly the area of family law reform.  Perhaps the Minister has to say it often to get his message and his good intentions across. I have no doubt his intentions are good but there is a need and an urgency to produce a vast amount of legislation in this sphere, apart altogether from the fundamental duty to maintain the institutions of this State.  In this the Minister will get every assistance from this side of the House.  I ask him to concentrate on the whole area of family law reform.  If he distinguishes himself in that one area as a reformer of the confused and unfair family law which exists, he will receive the gratitude of all the people of the country.</P>
    <P>In the next 25 minutes or so I intend to confine myself to one matter.  Later it is my intention to deal with family law reform, legal aid, the Garda Síochána, prisons, courts and ground rents, all areas of great concern to our people.  However, in the legislative sphere, the area of famly law reform must concern us most during the lifetime of this Dáil.  I believe the Minister when he says he is concerned about it, and Fianna Fáil share that concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister articulated an earnest of that concern by attending an AIM seminar in the Burlington Hotel recently. He expressed his opinions on an area of family law reform which he has covered in his speech today. Once again, he promised he would treat it as a matter of urgency.  The Minister said that during his 12 <Col N="550" /> months in office he met quite a number of groups and personages. Let me say that the Social and Individual Rights Committee of Fianna Fáil also met quite a number of groups.  Our spokesman on justice, with a backup of members of our organisation with special knowledge on these matters, met groups like CARE, AIM, FLAC, St. Vincent de Paul, judges, justices, barristers and solicitors, organisations like ACRA and the Marino Tenants Association whom the Minister mentioned in his speech and who are so concerned about the problems of ground rents. We met the Cappoquin tenants; we met members of the Censorship of Publications Board.  We had discussions with them as groups and as individuals.</P>
    <P>The Minister will see from this that if he were active in the past year so were the Social and Individual Rights Committee of Fianna Fáil.  They will continue to be active on behalf of all the groups who come to us to articulate their points of view.  The Opposition have an important role to play for the type of group I have mentioned. They can responsibly instil a sense of urgency by speech or parliamentary question into the Government Minister when they are pursuing&mdash;I put that in the best sense of the word&mdash; towards a proper conclusion, namely, bringing about the resolution of the problems posed to them by these particular groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister devoted quite a considerable part of his speech to the area of family law reform.  As mentioned earlier, he attended a meeting of the AIM group in the Burlington Hotel some weeks ago.  It was a week-end seminar attended by some 500 to 600 people, not all of them women.  There were many men there too, indicating their concern for the problem of the deserted wife and so on, in our society. The Minister said that in July he extended by warrant the terms of reference of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure to include such matters as substantive law as the Minister for Justice might from time to time request the committee to examine.  In the same month he wrote <Col N="551" /> to the chairman of that committee, Mr. Justice Brian Walsh, to say that at their earliest convenience they should examine and make representations to the Minister on the question of substantive law, the desertion of wives and children, the attachment of wages and the desirability of establishing family tribunals.</P>
    <P>The Minister also asked the committee to look into the procedure, including limitation period, in regard to maintenance of spouses and children, affiliation, legitimation and guardianship and custody of children.  He made the point, and he makes it again in his Estimate speech, that the committee have completed their investigation into that aspect of what he asked them to examine and that he would expect them to have their recommendations in the very near future.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate when the committee might make those recommendations known to him.  The sooner he deals with areas of immediate concern to the House in the area of family reform the better it will be. I do not expect the Minister, and I do not think anybody else expects him, to come into the House with a whole plethora of law codifying the area of family law reform.  I believe the Minister, and every person in his Department, will have his time taken up for a considerable number of months, if not years, bringing about the codification of the whole area of family law reform.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters which the Minister could deal with urgently and they come under the three heads of deserted wives and their maintenance, matrimonial courts and free legal aid for litigants.  He could also deal with a number of very serious anomalies in the law unfavourable to women.  I should like to mention briefly, and deal with the matters in more depth tomorrow, the abolition of the criminal conversation action, the clarification of the position in regard to divorces obtained in England and the abolition of the wives' domicile. In this respect let me point out to the Minister a number of anomalies which he could deal with urgently, and <Col N="552" /> which I am sure will be dealt with by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  It is no harm to have all these matters placed on the record of the House to ensure that there be easy reference for Deputies to matters relating to the problems I have outlined. The Minister's speech will serve as a ready reference which Deputies can go through from time to time, refer to during Dáil Debates and see what parts of it have been dealt with, have yet to be dealt with and the reasons for other parts not being dealt with.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the area of anomalies and to deal specifically with one anomaly which must cause this House concern.  I refer to the whole question of illegitimacy and how the society in which we live actively discriminates against an innocent child. Where a decree of nullity is granted in civil law by the High Court as the law now stands this, retrospectively, bastardises all children of that &ldquo;marriage&rdquo;. I place the word &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; in inverted commas.  This, of course, does not apply where there has only been a canonical decree of nullity as the State does not recognise such a decree as annulling a marriage.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion in the document which I have before me that our Constitution may discriminate also in Article 41, which gives the family certain inalienable rights and it refers to the family as being based on marriage and so on.  It suggests that only the legitimate family have these important and fundamental rights.  This is one example where a decree of nullity is granted in civil law by the High Court when the nullity is a fact retrospectively children of that marriage become illegitimate.  As I understand it&mdash;the Minister may help in this respect&mdash;that is the position of those children, the subjects of annullity of marriage under the Succession Acts.  Do the Succession Acts apply there?  My answer to that would be &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is another area I mentioned. A wife, of course, by definition, takes her husband's name and, in doing so, also takes his place of domicile.  In Ireland we recognise a foreign divorce decree as dissolving an Irish marriage <Col N="553" /> if both parties are domiciled in the foreign jurisdiction granting the divorce.  I do not think anyone can argue about this when both the Irish husband and wife set up their permanent home in, say, England or Canada. The position is unusual when the law presumes a wife to be domiciled in Montreal or Birmingham with her deserting husband.  What I am saying there is that, if a husband deserts to Birmingham or Honolulu or Timbuctoo, so far as the law is concerned the wife is domiciled with the deserting husband in any of those places which I have mentioned.  On the basis of this legal fiction&mdash;and it is a legal fiction&mdash; the law presumes the wife at all times to be with her husband.</P>
    <P>These are one or two anomalies which the Minister might consider. They are not too difficult to overcome and they could be dealt with reasonably quickly.  Family law reform relates to the position of children in our society.  The present juvenile court must be a source of grave concern to the Minister.  We believe that the juvenile court should be abolished and replaced with a new court where a district justice would sit with two lay assessors.  The main function of the court would be to advise on the treatment of young offenders.  Such a court, of course, would have a continuing interest in and responsibility for those they send for treatment or sentence, and regular conferences to review their cases would occur.  A special report on a child's background should be obligatory in every case where a child is to be sentenced and should be examined by the court before imposing sentence.</P>
    <P>That would be in line with the Minister's speech where he points out the sentencing policies of our courts. I think it would be on all fours with what the Minister suggests.  Here, as in the matrimonial court, procedures should be kept as simple as possible without undue emphasis on rules of evidence.  In other words, these courts would be reasonably informal on the basis that they are courts and enjoy the full protection of the Constitution. They cannot be brought into disrepute by too much informality. <Col N="554" /> When we are dealing with children we do not expect them to be dealt with like adults.  In these cases before the suggested new children's court, free legal aid should not only be available but should be offered.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the report of the committee established by the Bar Council, on the inadequacy of legal representation in the children's court.  This report went, I believe, to the former Minister for Justice.  The committee established by the Bar was made up of Mr. Declan Costello, now Attorney General, who was chairman and convenor, a barrister, Mr. Kevin Liston, junior, Mr. Ercus Stewart and Mr. Peter O'Sullivan.  The Committee were given power to co-opt and at their first meeting co-opted Mr. Erwin Millarden.  The last four are all respected members of the junior Bar and Mr. Costello was a senior counsel enjoying the respect of his senior colleagues and of the Bar in general as a practising barrister.  He is now Attorney General and I am sure he would be in a position to re-inforce a report which was sent to the Minister's predecessor by the committee on which he sat as chairman and convenor.</P>
    <P>One of the most worrying aspects of the report was that the vast majority of young persons who came before the courts effectively did not receive legal aid.  I will give the House a number of statistics.  In 1965, the number of cases heard was 8,882, legal aid applications not available, two granted.  In 1966, the number of cases heard was 10,777, legal aid applications again not available, one granted. In 1967, the number of cases heard was 9,832, legal applications 14, one granted.  In 1968, the number of cases heard was 12,287, legal aid applications 18, four granted.  In 1969, the number of cases heard was 13,654, legal aid applications six, two granted. In 1970, the number of cases heard was 16,586, legal aid applications 40, 13 granted.  In 1971, the number of cases heard is not available to May, 1971, but there were 40 legal aid applications to May, 1971, and 13 were granted.</P>
    <P>An organisation which was mentioned <Col N="555" /> by the Minister, and proper tribute was paid by him to it, namely, the FLAC organisation came into being sometime around 1971, and the young aspiring lawyers in the Free Legal Advice Centres organisation, with the help of qualified legal personnel, came to grips with the matter of legal aid applications and brought to the attention of those people who were not aware of their entitlement to legal aid, such entitlement.</P>
    <P>I should like to be associated with the Minister in his tribute to FLAC. Undoubtedly they have distinguished themselves and it is only proper that the Minister should now propose to give them the £5,000 which they were promised in the budget.  They are still looking forward to that £5,000.  I would hope that the Minister will be able to announce at the conclusion of the debate on this Estimate that the FLAC group have the £5,000 banked. This would be a great help.  Perhaps the Minister would do it as an earnest of his intentions.  It is equally good to see that the Minister is setting up a committee on legal aid in civil cases. This is a matter which we on this side of the House brought to the attention of the Minister in the last Dáil session.</P>

      <P>During the energy debate in the last session and again during the recent economic debate I put a number of questions to the Ministers concerned and I made a number of suggestions and proposals. During the recent economic debate I did not receive any answers to the questions I put, which I understand the Minister for Industry and Commerce said would merit consideration. During that debate in December I also indicated I was aware of an Opposition's responsibility and I might say that I now have no wish to <Col N="556" /> rock the national boat any more than I had then.</P>
      <P>However, events since then have more or less caught up with us all, and the time seems to have come now when the Government must tell the House and the people what is happening and end the confusion that has been part of this oil crisis.  In fact you could liken the Government to the boy on the burning deck that Hal Roach speaks about and who is completely oblivious of everything going on around him.</P>
      <P>One of the suggestions I made at that time was with regard to increasing our storage capacity.  I do not know of any action that has been taken in this matter since that time. If any action has been taken, we have not been told about it.  Surely the immediate problem should be tackled by erecting more storage.  I put down questions to the Minister for written answer today.  One question was to ask the Minister for Transport and Power the total storage capacity in the Whitegate Oil Refinery.  The reply to that is 356,000 tons.  Another question was to ask the Minister for Transport and Power the total storage capacity for oil products in Dublin, excluding that used by the ESB and the Gas Company, and the answer was 250,000 tons.  That gives us a total storage capacity of 606,000 tons.  I would like to know from the Minister if this total tonnage has been used to the fullest capacity and what is the position in regard to the amount of oil in storage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, we have nothing but confusion.  The people now have to meet the price increases which have taken place in Britain and which I understand have been applied for here by the oil companies.  Seven days' notice is all that is required now in what is known as the British outer zone, but up to 5th December last oil companies in this country, like all other companies who proposed to increase prices, had to go before the Prices Commission, and I understand that two months' notice had to be given.  On 5th December last, for some reason or other, this whole system was dismantled and all that is <Col N="557" /> required is that the major oil companies give seven days' notice of their intention to raise prices.  They are not seeking permission but merely notifying the Minister for Industry and Commerce that they are going to increase the price by whatever amount is in question.</P>
    <P>We would like to know why this system was dismantled on 5th December last.  There must have been some good reason for the Government taking this action.  If the major or the multi-national oil companies hold a big stick over our Government we would like to know about it, and if they got away with it, wrongly, we would also like to know about it.</P>
    <P>The oil companies are now seeking 8p a gallon on petrol, from next week, 5½p on heating oil and 7p or 7½p on diesel.  The big question is: where does this extra money go?  Admittedly the Arab countries have increased their prices twice.  They also increased them around 31st December.  Naturally the companies would be entitled to an increase.  However, in the energy debate in December we were told that there were 35 to 40 days' reserves of all descriptions of oil in storage in this country.  Will these price increases be applied to what is already in storage?  Thirty five days or five weeks brings us back to around the beginning of January.  I issued a statement to the Press and warned against this.  The head of one of the major companies took me up on this and said I must have been writing with a gold-plated pen.  I can assure him I write with an ordinary biro, whatever he writes with.  He said there was no foundation whatever for this.  He also said that the crude oil from the oil-producing countries to which the increases on 31st December applied is only now trickling through to here.  Therefore the increases they are now seeking should only apply to what is imported from now on, according to that statement; it should not apply to what is in storage.</P>
    <P>We sincerely hope the Government or the Minister for Industry and Commerce will take some action to prevent these vast increases being applied to whatever is already in storage. <Col N="558" /> If we take the previous figure mentioned&mdash;and it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce who said this was in storage&mdash;of 350,000 tons and if we were to apply only 6p a gallon across the board, it comes to something in the region of £5,250,000. That is the kind of money that people will have to pay, and pay to whom? It will not go in the form of taxation to the Government.</P>
    <P>The Arab people should not be made the scapegoats of this whole energy crisis.  Far from it.  They were treated far too badly by many of these multinational oil companies for many years. We believe that the profits of these multi-nationals are way up this year, and it would be totally wrong and unjust if these people were allowed to continue on these lines at the expense of the Irish people and the Irish consumer market.  Therefore it is of the greatest importance that the exact position be spelled out, and even if the Government or the Minister for Industry and Commerce permits as he must permit under the present system, these price increases at the end of seven days, he should ensure that they do not take effect for at least four to five weeks from now so that what is already in storage will not be affected by this increase.</P>
    <P>I have already made suggestions as to what might be done to ease the situation.  Again, I emphasise that in my opinion the importance of increasing our storage has first priority.  Apart from being able to buy oil before it goes up, as it has been going, storage could also be used in another way. Signs of the oil crisis were evident last summer to many people and I am sure were evident to the Government long before they hit us.  By erecting more storage and keeping it filled to capacity we could, if we had done this some months before Christmas&mdash;and it is not impossible to erect the tanks which I think can be quickly erected if the oil companies co-operate with the Government&mdash;utilise part of what had been in storage now when prices are high. When, in all probability, demand and prices ease in the summer months we could replenish our stocks.  Proper storage capacity could serve as a buffer to <Col N="559" /> level out prices in the present period if the problem had been tackled in time. Stocks could be replenished in the summer when demand will be less and when, probably, some of the oil-producing countries will be selling it at a lower price than at present.</P>
    <P>There is another fact that has come to light regarding how the Government handled the crisis.  We know about the energy conference now going on in America and how consumer countries have been invited to attend in an attempt to counteract the increases imposed by oil producing countries.  We learn from the Press that we were not even invited to this conference and that our Foreign Minister is representing us there as an observer.  Why is it the foreign Minister?  Why is it not the man in the gap, the Minister for Transport and Power, who should be <i>au fait</i> with all these matters pertaining to oil and whose job it is?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Government why is there not a person properly qualified, or the Minister responsible, representing us at the oil conference?  We also learn from the Press that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is accompanied by an official from his own Department and another from the Department of Finance but there is no official from the Department of Transport and Power.  It is all-important to have a top official from that Department present at any oil conference because it is that Department's job to sort out the confusion of the energy crisis in which we now find ourselves.  That is the Department in which this special oil committee was set up to try to find a solution to the problem.  It is totally wrong that they are not represented there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the long term solution, we must aim at building our own refining capacity.  At present we use approximately 5 million tons of oil. We can only refine 2½ million tons of <Col N="560" /> crude oil.  We are completely dependent on a surplus from the British oil refineries for the other 2½ million tons.  We should take the necessary steps immediately to build further oil refineries so as to provide for our own needs.  We should also take the necessary steps to ensure a proper source of crude oil for ourselves.  What action has been taken in diplomatic circles with some of the Arab oil producing countries in the past months?  Has any been taken?  The French, British and West Germans, our colleagues in the Common Market, have all taken action and sought out sources of their own and made diplomatic contacts. We should at least have tried to do something.  They are bartering armaments; Britain is bartering something else, but we also have something we could consider, perhaps not a very big thing.  Last week the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to some of my suggestions as small but I think this is important.  We have dairy products in which we have dealt before with the Arab people.  We could concentrate in this field.  Even if they do not eat meat they use dairy products.  This is only another suggestion.</P>
    <P>We demand an investigation into the prices at present proposed or applied for by the oil companies.  The whole structure, as it now stands, should be investigated because of the dismantling of the price structure which existed up to 5th December last.  We also want to know if the new prices will apply to what is already in storage and, if so, where the profits will go.  If you apply 6p per gallon across the board these profits are quite significant.  If these profits are being made, our people have a right to know about them and a right to expect that this would not happen at their expense.</P>

      <P>I do not doubt the Deputy.  It is true that the public regard us as throwing up our hands in horror and running before this crisis as before a rising tide.  We seem helpless and hopeless and have attempted to do nothing about it. Further, the public were denied any reliable information.  Earlier today the Minister said we were calling for rationing.  Certainly, if the crisis had been what we were told it was earlier, rationing should have been introduced immediately because people, those who could afford to do so, were storing oil they did not need, and actually depleted stocks as a result when they had been told a panic situation had been reached.  There was no rationing.  We now know from the reply the Minister for Transport and Power gave myself and Deputy Moore in the House last week that we brought in more oil during these three panic months of chaos when we had traffic held up outside petrol stations than in the three corresponding months in the previous year.</P>
      <P>Nobody told us what amount of oil we had at any given time, what we might get in, or how much we were capable of storing but the denouement came when price increases were accepted <i>ad lib.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk about prices.  The two speakers have rambled over a whole set of areas partly the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Power and partly mine.  The kernel of the question is the matter of price rises. I am asked first, with great innuendos, who wielded the big stick, why we changed the system of price control on oil and on petrol on 5th December last, the suggestion being that people are not told things.  If Deputy Barrett or others had been willing to study the appropriate National Prices Commission Report they would have seen the matter set out and discussed.  The National Prices Commission was set up by the previous Government.  Its composition is unchanged.  It is very representative. It is doing a difficult job fairly and with general respect from all sides.  If he wants to set about thumping them he should say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say a word about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>He asked questions which concerned them.  If he had been a little more familiar with the facts he would have known they concerned them.  I referred the matter of price control in the on-going world crisis in regard to oil to them.  They reported to me and they urged that we take four steps.  The dilemma which was discussed&mdash;of course people can be ignorant if they refuse to acquaint themselves with the sources that are available&mdash;was this: if we did not pay an amount of money for our crude comparable with other countries we would not get any.  It was necessary for us to pay the world prices and also to pay them fairly quickly, because it would be no good coming back in two months, which <Col N="563" /> was the then arrangement.  On the other hand, we did not want to pay more than was necessary.  Therefore, as a result of what they recommended and what I accepted in the light of these two considerations&mdash;not to pay more than we had to but to pay enough to get it and to make the price changes quickly so that we would not be starved and squeezed out of it&mdash;we did a number of things.</P>
      <P>Firstly, we lifted the two month requirement.  Secondly, we tied our prices to the outer zone in Britain.  Of course in Britain the prices are processed by their prices commission so that there was a processing of the application not by ours but by theirs. We locked on to their price.  The National Prices Commission have the on-going responsibility to monitor changes continuously, which they are doing.  That was a mechanism through which we had the possibility of responding quickly, which was essential. If Deputy Barrett wanted two month delays he should say so but if he recognises the need for prompt response then he must accept that we have to make rapid changes.  Our prices were fixed at the British level, with the monitoring of their prices commission and with the further monitoring because of the major shareholding by the British Government in BP, one of the biggest companies, so that they have a great deal of information about it.  It gave us then a position comparable with our competitors in industrial terms and in consumption terms. It gave us the possibility of responding quickly.  It did not increase our costs above theirs and it kept us in balance with them.  Those were all desirable and obvious things and the reasons for them were set out in the NPC Report. They recommended, I accepted, nobody wielded a big stick and the reasons are perfectly good reasons and the actions were perfectly correct and appropriate actions which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now let us talk about the stock situation.  Deputy Barrett got himself on to the front pages of the papers talking about £5 million worth of profits and talking about lack of information. If Deputy Barrett would avail himself of the documents that are put out he would have known the things that he produced with a flourish as the answer to his questions.  He was told the total volume of storage by the Minister for Transport and Power. The essential point is that our stocks on 31st December were 358,000 tons. That is enough to last for approximately 40 days, in fact a little less. That brings you to the 9th February. The chief executive of Esso in this country who is also, if you want to assail him, the previous Government's appointee to the board of the IDA and a person of some reputation and stature in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>He said, and if Deputy Barrett can prove the contrary he owes it to this House to tell us, that the price increases for the crude date from the 1st January.  Do the arithmetic by assuming that no oil comes in&mdash;of course it has been coming in in January and February&mdash; the oil that we had on 31st December was used up on 9th February and the oil that has come in since 1st January is paid for at the higher prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If you have 358,000 tons in stock on 31st December and that lasts you 40 days the stuff that <Col N="565" /> came in at the higher price on the 1st January and on the following days is now, as he says, trickling through.</P>
      <P>In Britain yesterday the prices went up.  In our case we have applications and we will certainly have more.  It is proper that we respond quickly.  It is very unpleasant for all of us but to hoard it up two months when the British price had gone up would simply mean that we did not get it. If that is what Deputy Barrett wants he will have to say so.</P>

They can be disbelieved if you want to but you will have to give reasons.</P>
      <P>If it is true that we had 40 days' supply, if it is true that the higher price was paid for the crude coming in on 1st January, then it is appropriate that when that crude gets through to be consumed the consumer pays the higher prices.</P>
