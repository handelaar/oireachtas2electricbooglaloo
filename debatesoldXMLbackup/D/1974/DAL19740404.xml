      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Regulations, 1974 (S.I. No. 16 of 1974) be and are hereby annulled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was anxious to get clarification on a couple of points relating to these regulations and as the statutory period for consideration of the regulations by the House had almost expired, the only course open to me was to put down a motion.  I was not sure of the position in regard to the income tax year and the fiscal year.  I understood that the income tax year would continue to 31st March while the fiscal year would end on 31st <Col N="1502" /> December and that the pay-related year would also end on 31st December. I was not clear as to whether this would in any way affect the situation in regard to reckonable earnings which are reckoned on the previous income tax year.  I also wanted to question whether dividing £2,500 income by 50 would, in fact, be equal to a 4 per cent allowance.  I further wanted to find out what the situation was in relation to a person who became ill immediately before the end of the tax year.  I made some inquiries about these matters and I satisfied myself in regard to them and, therefore, if the House would so consent, I wish to withdraw the motion.</P>

      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I might add for the information of the House that in relation to the pay-related benefit scheme a most intensive campaign of publicity was carried out.  The Department have had a very favourable response from interested parties in the scheme to the very extensive explanatory advertisements which appeared in our national Press, also to the special booklets which were made available to both employers and employees. It could reasonably be expected that at this stage all interested parties are aware of how the scheme is intended to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this Bill through both Houses and I should have a fair idea about it.  It was not clear then what method we would use of applying credits to those who were not insurable before the limit was removed.  Not many people know how they stand in that respect.  What method has the <Col N="1503" /> Minister adopted in order to give those who have re-entered insurance following the abolition of the limit the necessary credits to make them eligible for immediate benefits under the pay-related scheme?</P>

      <P>When people have fully read and begun to understand this budget, they will wonder why we wisnessed the euphoria from the Government benches yesterday.  It was obvious that the euphoria was one-sided.  Many of the Labour Party backbenchers stood and applauded the Minister. That effort succeeded in bringing only two of the Fine Gael backbenchers to a similar stance.  One wonders to what extent there are already misgivings among the Fine Gael Party in relation to this budget.</P>

      <Col N="1505" /> We adjourned last night at 6.30.  The previous night we witnessed the effect of the guillotine on the Constituencies Bill and not only the manner in which the guillotine was imposed but the fact that the Minister for Local Government deliberately shut out any comments from this side on the Final Stages of the Bill.  One can contrast that with the four or five wasted hours yesterday when the Government had to adjourn because they had no business to bring before the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This situation arose almost immediately after the Minister finished his budget speech.

      <P>The main purpose and function of the budget, especially in the circumstances of this year, ought to be to chart the course for economic expansion not just for the year immediately ahead but for the reasonably foreseeable future.  To do this, the strategy of the budget should deal with the factors which in any way tend to inhibit that economic expansion.  As everybody knows, the main factor in present circumstances is inflation and its main ingredient is rising prices at an inordinate rate. This budget fails miserably in trying to attain these two fundamental objectives for curbing the price rise. It deliberately&mdash;and I might almost say callously&mdash;adds to the inflation spiral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual report of the EEC, commenting on Ireland's position as a <Col N="1507" /> member of that organisation, predicted that in this country costs and prices will probably climb rapidly. The report went on to advise that the main task of the Irish authorities in 1974 would be to reduce inflationary pressures.  In particular they advised that the net borrowing requirement for the 1974-75 financial year should be held at the level at that expected for 1973-74.  For this to be achieved it would be necessary to curb the rise in public expenditure and to consider an increase in taxation&mdash;I am not making any comment on that&mdash;especially by taxing certain types of income which have been exempt from tax.  The report advised that the very large proportion of the budgetary deficit which is financed by monetary means should be reduced.</P>
    <P>This is the type of advice we have been given by an independent organisation interested in our welfare and in our economic and financial performance especially in the year ahead. What has happened?  If we add to the increased borrowing for capital purposes the £66 million deficit which this budget has deliberately and negligently provided for, we find that Government borrowing for the year will amount to a colossal sum of £320 million, an increase of about 40 per cent over that of last year.</P>
    <P>That is the first big problem which this budget creates.  We all know that borrowing has to be paid for out of current income.  We all know that if anybody borrows money ultimately he will have to make it up in the following year or years.  At the rate, the Minister is now borrowing, a huge deficit is being built up and it will come to be met out of current taxation. The Minister made no effort to provide for that borrowing this year and hopes, like Micawber, that something will turn up for him in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The question arises of what this borrowing is for.  For the year 1973-74 current spending rose by 20 per cent over that of the previous year.  For the coming year it is expected that current expenditure will rise by no less than 25 per cent.  With capital <Col N="1508" /> spending the percentages are more or less reversed this year.  For 1973-74 spending was about 27 per cent higher, whereas for the coming year a 20 per cent rise is projected.  The relevance of this is that when it is necessary to boost the growth of the economy it is capital spending which adds to productive capacity.  Capital spending should be stimulated.</P>
    <P>This was the policy which we in Fianna Fáil as a Government pursued for many years.  We pursued it successfully.  The Minister seems to be preaching a new doctrine, that is, more current spending rather than more capital spending, which will achieve the required boost in output. It would be interesting to know how this view came about and how it can be sustained.  I am sure it is not likely that prudent consideration of what would be the best for the economy decided this particular policy.  It is much more probable that what happened was that the Minister being faced with many expensive demands for more money and at the same time being urged not to increase taxes because of the forthcoming local elections, simply had to continue on a course well known to us from earlier Coalition Governments of spending now and paying the bills later.</P>
    <P>In short, this is a political budget designed for election purposes.  These purposes cannot claim under any circumstances to meet the needs of the economy.  We know that this budget will have disastrous results on the inflationary trend and will quickly erode the social welfare increases and the income tax allowances which the Minister has given&mdash;welcome as they are.  They will quickly erode the benefits and tax allowance increases.  We can say that they are not adequate to take account of the ordinary inflationary trend that might be expected without the added inflation spiral that this budget will create.</P>
    <P>The Minister already knows that he will not get credit very easily.  The warnings to the private sector contained in the Minister's speech apply only to that sector but not to the Minister himself.  The warnings to use capital only for productive purposes <Col N="1509" /> make interesting reading in relation to what the Minister himself now proposes.  The Minister is going to apply this new doctrine to his own advantage.  The Minister has one doctrine for himself and one for the private sector.  The Minister will apply it for the benefit of his own affairs.  The Minister will increase borrowing by about 40 per cent this year and he has not dared to suggest that all of this extra credit will be used for productive purposes.  We know the difficulty that arose in borrowing last year.  We know the disastrous results of the national loan. In the course of the year the Minister, as he boasted yesterday, raised the rate of interest on savings by 3 per cent.  The interest on the ordinary account in the Post Office was raised from 4 per cent to 7 per cent.  The Minister would have to increase these rates to about 15 per cent and even more; otherwise he will be giving back less to these ordinary citizens who lent money to him than he has taken from them.  This is all because of inflation which has been given impetus by this budget.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask what changes have occurred to make more foreign borrowing desirable.  Foreign borrowing this year compared with last year is going to increase to a considerable extent, as we can see from page 7 of the Capital Budget 1974.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that we know he is desperate for money, the Minister knows too that he cannot find it here at home.  He tries to justify this inflationary deficit budget by the unsustainable claim that last year's deficit budgeting created expansion at the rate of 7 per cent.  I want to repeat this and hammer it home.  What last year's budget did was to wipe out the economic growth that had already taken place before the budget effects could be seen.  Instead, it created stagnation.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Government again that in their latest quarterly bulletin the Economic and Social Research Institute stated that growth took place in 1973 in the first half of the year.  Most of that had <Col N="1510" /> passed before the 1973 budget could possibly have had any effect.  Therefore, in the second half we had this virtual stagnation to which I have referred.  It would be no consolation to the Government to plead the oil shortage as an excuse for this, because we know that the oil shortage and the price increase began to bite only in the first quarter of this year. To use the Minister's words in his budget statement, I might add that the welcome rise of 6,000 in employment last year took place in the first half of 1973, again a rise for which the Minister's Government or his last year's budget cannot possibly claim any credit.</P>
    <P>I have stated that the increases in social welfare payments and income tax allowances are welcome.  Of course the Minister had no alternative to making these increases unless he was to drive the beneficiaries into the ground altogether. He knew that because of the increases given in the British budget he had to stretch the limit to increase the social welfare payments.  He knew as well that, because of the successful negotiation of the recent national wage agreement, substantial tax allowances had to be given.  He has failed miserably to match up his performance with his promise.</P>
    <P>In a speech last Monday to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce I referred to the type of increases that ought to be made available.  I said that because of the overall increase in our growth of 6 per cent caused by our entry into the EEC, on that basis alone without taking any account of inflation, the income of the lower groups, and particularly the social welfare groups, should be increased by 8 to 10 per cent.  When I add to that inflation, which I estimated at that time to be 13½ per cent&mdash;the Minister said 14 per cent yesterday and I think we are entitled to anticipate without any exaggeration that it could be 15 per cent&mdash;the Minister should have raised social welfare benefits not by 18 per cent but by 25 per cent.  Well before this year has passed the social welfare beneficiaries will find that the increases the Minister has given are only paper increases and notional increases because <Col N="1511" /> of the deliberately increased impetus he has given to inflation.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the matter of income tax allowances the Minister has failed to match up the rate of income tax allowances provided for in the 1972 budget. I might mention that at that time we gave an increase of £1.25 in the old age pension to take one example.  That was a 25 per cent rise and inflation was then much lower than it is now, running at some 8 per cent or perhaps a half percentage point more.  So, where are the real improvements in the social welfare payments?  We know too that the improvements in the income tax allowances, even without new factors emerging, are too little by half.</P>
    <P>The Minister's own table under the heading &ldquo;Income Tax Payable under Old and New Systems on Earnings of a Married Couple with Three Children&rdquo; illustrates that point.  Taking a man with three children earning £2,000 a year, his tax savings will be £41.40. I submit they should have been well over £100, even up to £125.  Add to this the fact that these people must pay up to £150 a year extra&mdash;this is a factor which must be taken into account&mdash;for the new pay-related health scheme.  Where is the tremendous benefit the Minister has given to the ordinary wage earner and the ordinary salary earner in this budget? I say it is completely inadequate.  I might well say it is almost an insult to those he purports to benefit.</P>
    <P>Coming to another aspect of the Minister's speech, I should like to know what has become of the Fourth Programme for Economic and Social Expansion.  Where are the great advocates of economic planning?  Where have all the great advocates gone whom we used to hear from in the Fine Gael and Labour Parties when they were in Opposition?  In his speech the Minister expressed the usual clichés about giving credit and paying tribute to members of the National Economic and Social Council but he completely ignored their advice in connection with the formulation of a national economic and social programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> The Minister said that because of the uncertainties in the international situation&mdash;I am paraphrasing what he said&mdash;it would be unreasonable and futile to attempt to formulate such a programme in current circumstances. That completely misses the point.  It is in conditions and times of economic uncertainty that the Government should take the lead in formulating economic programmes.  When things are going well, when the future is reasonably predictable, the ordinary units of production, businesses, industries, farmers, know well how to take care of that situation.  They react to progress.  They react to conditions of certainty to their own advantage and to the advantage of the economy generally.  It is only when there is uncertainty, it is only when the people are not sure of what the trend is, that the Minister and the Government should formulate their economic plans and programmes so as to inform the public what course to follow in different and changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed completely to take account of this need and here again is another example of how the Government are creating doubt and uncertainty in the minds of those on whom we rely most to improve the economy and increase our prosperity.  One of the great defects of this Government is the absence of any coherent economic policy.  This has lead, as we all know, to much doubt and uncertainty and has created this kind of doubtful climate which could very quickly destroy confidence in our continuing social and economic expansion.  This doubt and this uncertainty is evident in very many areas of economic management at this time.  For example, we have the continued uncertainty about new legislation for mortgages and takeovers. This was promised for last summer, then for the autumn, then for before the end of the year and then for early in the new year.  Now I believe we will be lucky if we see anything in relation to mergers legislation before the summer.  At long last &mdash;I will give the Government credit for this though not much credit&mdash;<Col N="1513" /> we have seen the new mining tax legislation.</P>
    <P>But what about the question of building societies and housing finance? After all the initial huffing and puffing of the Minister for Local Government and of the Government in this sphere, it was followed up by stopgap subsidies only for the building societies.  We still do not have any clear picture of what new arrangements are to be made&mdash;indeed, if any &mdash;in relation to helping young people seeking homes for the first time.  Certainly, there is no indication in the budget.  No attempt has been made to deal with the problems of these people in any way.  The combination of higher house prices and interest rates puts house purchase out of the reach of many, not only newly married couples but married couples who have been saving for many years to buy their own homes.  For example, repayments at the present time, on a very modest house, have risen by about 50 per cent, from £40 to £60 over the past few years.  To deal with this certainly there should be a large increase in the size of the grants.  As well as that, I believe there should be a large increase in the size of mortgages. Given that building societies may not be expected to advance the full amount of these mortgages, the Government should have a mortgage guarantee system&mdash;and they had a year in which to do this&mdash;available for those unfortunate people who now find house purchase beyond their capacity.</P>
    <P>The second area of uncertainty affecting building and other development is the likely form of any legislation arising from the report of the Kenny Committee on building land. If the whole of the building industry is not to grind to a halt&mdash;and we have evidence of this already&mdash;it is essential that this legislation be introduced and passed very quickly.  As the House is aware, the Kenny Committee, in its report, said that not only should this legislation be prepared quickly but it should be referred by the President to the Supreme Court in order to remove any doubts that might exist as to the constitutionality <Col N="1514" /> of such a measure.  In the first instance, the Government took a year to consider the Kenny Report.  I believe they should have had their legislation ready for the publication of that report and their statement on it.  However, the public announcement, again, was a suggestion of mañana&mdash;perhaps we will do something about it in the future&mdash;thereby creating and adding to that uncertainty and lack of confidence that have permeated our whole economy in the past year.  Now we do not know when, if ever, this Bill will appear.</P>
    <P>The same kind of uncertainty about the form of legislation and its method of operation applies even more so to the Government's proposed tax changes in the fields of capital and wealth.  Again, having taken more than a year to prepare their White Paper, the public are presented, not with any detailed, carefully worked out set of proposals but with a vague half-baked document, grossly deficient both in terms of the information it provides and the rationale put forward in favour of the changes.  The Minister's statement yesterday was equally vague.  It gave us no further information on how this new capital wealth and acquisition tax will operate. We are told nothing about the numbers who will be liable or the amounts they will pay.  We can contend that the wealth tax, in particular, would have many unfavourable consequences since it will operate at much lower levels than the inheritance tax, more at levels of well-being.  Therefore, it purports to affect the moderately well off people to the advantage of those better off.  I can give examples of that.  The Minister gave an example in the White Paper himself. He seeks to exclude completely transfers of £150,000 within a family, no matter how many transfers take place. At the same time, he intends to include wealth holdings of £40,000 and over.  We all know there are many small family businesses and farms this wealth tax will hit.  On that point &mdash;and when I am speaking about farms&mdash;now that the decision has been taken to put income taxation on farmers, apparently the principle <Col N="1515" /> has been established.  It is not unreasonable to appreciate the apprehension of farmers as expressed by one of their representatives.  Now that the Minister has his toe in the door he will push it more and more. Obviously, they anticipate and fear that the £100 norm of land valuation &mdash;according to a completely outdated criterion, incidentally, the Griffith valuation some 100 years old now &mdash;will be reduced according as the Minister feels it necessary and, of course, as the Revenue Commissioners advise.</P>
    <P>It is estimated by the Minister that 9,000 farmers only will be caught in the first instance.  An estimate was given, I think, in one of the comments last night that each of these would pay an average of £500, making up an income of £4½ million.  The Minister said yesterday he was unable to make any assessment of it and he ignored this completely for the purpose of his budget.  I think it is not unreasonable that this £4½ million&mdash; if it is an accurate figure and I have no reason to doubt it&mdash;would rise quickly to, say, £20 million or £30 million in a year.  Let us look at that and see what is fair and just.  The farmers have said continuously that they are not adverse to paying a reasonable share of taxation.</P>
    <P>In making that point, they indicate that rates are already a heavy imposition on many of them, especially the progressive ones.  Therefore, there would be now a much stronger case to extend the Fianna Fáil policy of relieving homes, to relieving agricultural land from rates, if the incidence of income tax is going to bear more heavily on farmers as time goes on.  It has been pointed out&mdash;and I think the point has been well taken&mdash;that farmers are the only producers whose means of production would be subject to income taxation.  Another point which I think has been well taken is that about 50 per cent of their output, 50 per cent of their product, goes for export, whereas those in industrial production enjoy complete freedom of taxation from profits deriving <Col N="1516" /> from those industrial exports.  This is a point the Minister will have to take into account&mdash;obviously he has not done so at this stage&mdash;in order to ensure that fair taxation will be applied across the board.</P>
    <P>It seems to me the middle group will, in part, be paying for the concessions that will be given to the wealthy under the Minister's capital taxation proposals.  Even more than this, is the total absence of any indication regarding the impact of these new taxes on investment in Ireland, whether by Irish people or by overseas investors.  It is well established that already millions of pounds have poured out of this country following the introduction of the wealth tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the suggested basis on which the new wealth tax would work, many farms and firms, as Fianna Fáil said in their comment on the White Paper, would become vulnerable to take-over by multinational firms.  They are not just industrial firms; they are on the market for farms also.  We know the combined effects of profits tax, income tax and wealth tax would make it virtually impossible for any of these people in ordinary productive businesses&mdash;the Irish firm or farm&mdash;to provide an adequate net income for themselves and to retain any funds for <Col N="1517" /> the development of their enterprises. That is why there is a grave danger that the wealth tax, affecting as it does more the ordinary middle income group, will have a counterproductive effect on any attempt to advance our economy.  In short, the wealth tax will squeeze the category of enterprise it has always been our policy to assist. It has been Fianna Fáil policy to assist the Irish-owned and Irish-financed farm or firm; it has been the backbone of our efforts to provide increased and improved living standards for our people.</P>
      <P>In these few points I have tried to highlight the main defects in the budget. When the euphoria has worn off, when the small print has been read, the full effects of this inflationary budget will begin to bite those the Minister has purported to help&mdash;the social welfare classes and the wage and salary earners.  It will bite very quickly.  I have indicated that the benefits and allowances given are not adequate to meet ordinary inflation, much less the extra inflation the budget will impose.  When this happens the people will know that instead of being a budget to acclaim it is a thoroughly bad budget.</P>
      <P>As I have said many times before, someone will have to pick up the pieces.  The Coalition habit of spending now and paying later has proved disastrous not only for the year of the budget or the year following the leaving from office of a Coalition Government; it continues for two, three, or more years.  I am sure that whoever will be there to pick up the pieces&mdash;most likely it will be Fianna Fáil&mdash;the unpopular decisions that will have to be taken in the interests of expanding the economy will be taken by the only Government who apparently can face up to such unpopular decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no use not increasing taxation or borrowing for current activities when we know that sooner or later it will have to be paid for in taxation. The important thing is that no attempt has been made to cut down Government expenditure.  As I have indicated, current expenditure has been <Col N="1518" /> considerably increased as against a decrease in capital expenditure. Whether it is current expenditure or payment of interest on the borrowing necessary for capital expenditure, it will have to be paid for sooner or later.  When the time comes the people will know that it is they, not the Coalition, who will have to bear the brunt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>If they cannot run the economy they want to wreck it.  That is the only possible interpretation one can put on the attack of the Opposition on the budget introduced yesterday.  It was an attack made last night by Deputy Colley, Opposition spokesman on Finance, in language that was excessive, intemperate and at times hysterical.  It was an attack made this morning by Deputy Lynch, Leader of the Opposition, in language that was more bland, as is his habit, but with exactly the same content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to gather in small compass for the record the sort of terms used by both speakers and to compare them very briefly with the reactions of the media, particularly the newspapers, to the budget.  The opening words of Deputy Colley last night were: &ldquo;fraudulent and grossly irresponsible diatribe&rdquo;.  His last words were: &ldquo;fraudulent and grossly irresponsible&rdquo;. That ran through the text of his entire speech.  He also said that the Government were scrambling around madly, that we were running the economy close to bankruptcy.  This kind of language was used throughout his speech.  It will be interesting when the Official Report appears to count the number of times Deputy Lynch used the words &ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; or &ldquo;disastrously&rdquo;. He spoke about &ldquo;the disastrous results of the inflationary trend&rdquo; and the &ldquo;disastrous results on the national economy&rdquo;; he said there was &ldquo;much doubt and uncertainty about the economy as a whole&rdquo;; he spoke about &ldquo;the doubtful climate which could very quickly destroy confidence, creating and adding to the uncertainty that has permeated the whole economy&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;We know that the continued effect of profits tax, income tax and wealth tax <Col N="1519" /> will make it impossible to have both an adequate income for themselves and money to invest&rdquo;.  He was referring to the small and middle investors.</P>
    <P>The only way to interpret that deliberate and conscious policy of the Opposition, now reiterated twice by their two most important spokesmen, is that having lost power in Government they are now using all of their influence as the largest party in the country to damage confidence, to undermine industrial growth and the health of the economy at the most difficult time in the economy of this country, and indeed of many other countries, since the last war.  That is the objective effort they are undertaking. I thought it was accidential hysteria last night when the shadow Minister on Finance spoke.</P>
    <P>Now I find in a different manner exactly the same content from an ex-Taoiseach this morning.  That is just for the record because, when we come to look at the debate on this budget, as we all have the habit of looking at past budget debates, we will have the Dáil record then; we do not have the newspapers.  Let us contrast this attitude of these two main spokesmen with what some of the newspapers are saying this morning.  Of the four major national dailies I am going to quote two; I am leaving out one that is hostile to us and one, I understand, that is not particularly favourable to us.  Leaving out <i>The Irish Press</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner,</i> I shall quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Irish Independent</i> of this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: <i>The Irish Press</i> is hostile.  I was referring to the attitude to the budget.  <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning says:</P>
      <P>The man-in-the-street will certainly have to scratch around hard for the annual grouse.  The general effect is bland in the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Bland in the extreme&rdquo;, <i>The Irish Times</i> leader says.  &ldquo;Fraudulent and grossly irresponsible,&rdquo; says Deputy <Col N="1520" /> Colley.  <i>The Irish Times</i> leader goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The sceptic will wonder if a soft Budget is a good Budget, and will find some consolation in the ritual abuse which Mr. George Colley, as Opposition Shadow Minister, had to brew up at short notice.</P>
    <P>I think &ldquo;ritual abuse&rdquo; is a good phrase, but I do not think it was, in fact, only that.  One could forgive him if it were only that, but he is someone with vast experience as a previous Minister for Finance and he is someone who does not have the licence that a very new and inexperienced person might claim in Opposition.  It is not just &ldquo;ritual abuse&rdquo;; it is the deliberate damaging of the economy by very irresponsible comment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> leader says elsewhere:</P>
    <P>The Coalition can feel well pleased at the reception the Budget has had.</P>
    <P>And, in outlining the three main aims of economic growth, social reform and equity in taxation, it says, and this is something we can all agree with, that it is difficult to be certain about economic growth but, as to the second and third&mdash;that is social justice and equity&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Ryan has certainly achieved success.  The less fortunate in the community have been well looked after.&rdquo; Finally, <i>The Irish Times</i> leader has this to say in the last line about this &ldquo;fraudulent and grossly irresponsible&rdquo; budget:</P>
    <P>...no banker sitting in Dublin today has any reason to be fretful about Mr. Ryan's handiwork.</P>
    <P>I could go on to the other newspapers. I could go on to mention that the Confederation of Irish Industry are pleased with this budget.  I could go on to mention that the Irish Exporters' Association generally welcome the budget, and so on.  I do not propose to read more into the record, but I cannot let pass, in this brief dealing before I go on to what I really have to say, Deputy Colley's speech without one comment.  It is a comment which relates to an exchange between Deputy Colley and myself when I interjected.  I think <Col N="1521" /> the record shows I interjected reasonably and courteously.  I am quoting from the unedited typescript of Deputy Colley's speech last evening and I cannot, therefore, give a column and volume reference, but this can be checked when the Official Report appears:</P>
    <P>A long time ago the Government made an announcement on mining taxation.  This announcement was followed by a thunderous silence.</P>
    <P>First, after the announcement was made, after a reasonable period the Minister for Finance and I met the mining interests and had a useful exchange and, on that occasion, the Minister for Finance solicited their opinions and views and continuous and detailed lengthy exchanges in a sort of free consultation went on and the results were incorporated in the legislation which has now appeared. At that time, in October, it was said that the legislation would appear at the time of the budget.  To say, therefore, that there was a thunderous silence is factually untrue.  That is the first thing.  Secondly, the date given for the legislation was the date kept.  It was mischievous then of Deputy Colley to proceed as he did. Then he said:</P>
    <P>There have been serious consequences in the industrial development field following directly from that announced decision.  The Government have tried to cover up those serious consequences in the industrial development field.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the word &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; there.  I am quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>Tell us about them, please.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley immediately goes on to change the subject totally and talk about a date for a tariff, totally refusing to mention the &ldquo;serious consequences&rdquo;&mdash;I am quoting his own words&mdash;&ldquo;in the industrial development field&rdquo;.  He creates damage and uncertainty and confusion and, when challenged here, where he is privileged in putting it on the record, he skates away from it.  That is irresponsible and I called that yesterday, and I put it on the record again, a <Col N="1522" /> shyster's technique.  That is what it was.</P>
    <P>In this world economy, of which we are becoming more and more a part, there are a number of crises. We have had a crisis in energy, which is the obvious one.  We have had a crisis in world monetary relationships, which is recognised by fair people who are concerned with these things, a crisis which has produced a devaluation of the currency of which we are a part, sterling, ranging up to 18 per cent, now down to about 16½ per cent on the old Smithsonian parity, which has produced the highest rate of interest historically since the war, worldwide and not just here, which has produced the greatest slump in the stock market since the war, the great bear market just off the bottom of the defence commitment. We have had a monetary crisis in the world.  We had a number of political crises.  We have had a huge speculation in commodities, worldwide, and we have a roaring inflation crisis, worldwide, not just here, and all of this makes an economic storm of a major kind which serious people, who want to make valid criticism and also want to contribute to the weal of their own economy, have to take notice of; and the pretence of the Opposition in all these instances is that not the monetary crisis, not the inflationary crisis, not the commodity crisis, not the energy crisis but the incompetence of this Government is the sole cause of our current economic difficulties and these things, which are recognised to be profound crises in every other country in the world by every economic journal one can read, somehow do not operate here and are not, therefore, a relevant part of any discussion.</P>
    <P>That is the background of irresponsibility the Opposition have brought in, not just to this budget but to the whole of their reaction to these multiple crises, now indeed compounded by a very difficult situation in the European Community.  That is the reaction they have brought&mdash;not to say fairly it is a very difficult time and we do not think we are doing well, but to say rather that it is a perfectly reasonable time <Col N="1523" /> and, if there are difficulties, it is because we are messing.  That is neither honest nor fair and it does not contribute to any sane or reasonable discussion.</P>
    <P>Let us look at this dreadful problem of crisis.  First of all, let us nail the pretence that real incomes are going down.  Certainly prices are rising in an extremely damaging way.  Certainly they are.  I was listening to a BBC commentator talking from Brussels a few weeks ago, as the British election results came in, and someone in London asked him, &ldquo;How will Brussels react to this cliff-hanging result of the general election?&rdquo; The correspondent replied that they had to remember in London that there were only three countries of the Nine that now had stable Governments, Holland, Luxembourg and Ireland.  This immense world economic crisis has produced vast instability elsewhere; not instability and not difficulties of an insuperable kind here but we have the continuing effort of the Opposition to fish in those troubled waters to produce all the damage they can at a difficult moment.</P>
    <P>Last year prices rose in a very difficult and damaging way for any Government but real consumer expenditure adjusted for inflation, rose by 6¼ per cent.  That is a very substantial rise and much larger than the average of the last quarter of a century, much larger than the average of the period of Fianna Fáil Government which ended last February.  Not to recognise that rapid real growth because it is overlain by very serious inflation is neither fair nor honest.  Let us talk about consumer prices last year because we have a consumer price index, and the end of the period for the first quarter of 1973 very nearly coincided with the end of the period of power of the Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>According to the figures of the Central Statistics Office the increase in the quarter from November, 1972, to February, 1973, was 4 per cent.  In the next quarter the increase was 3 per cent, still much too high because it was an annual rate not of 16 per cent per year but of 12 per cent.  It was still <Col N="1524" /> much too high but it was slowing.  In the next quarter it was 2.3 per cent or an annual rate of under 10 per cent and this was down from an annual rate of 16 per cent per year in the first quarter which was Fianna Fáil's final period.</P>

      <P>One can always make an argument that an index includes or does not include certain things, but the point is that the index is drawn up on exactly the same basis from one quarter to the next.  The basis has not changed and, therefore, comparison from one quarter to another is relevant.</P>
      <P>In the third quarter, which was the second quarter of this Government's period in office, it was 2.3 per cent and then, with the onset of two things simultaneously, the energy crisis and this immense and very scandalous world speculation in commodities, it started to rise again.  Bluntly we have been knocked off course, we have seriously been knocked off course to our great embarrassment and, as far as I can say personally, I feel the most intense sense of concern and responsibility. However, to say that our efforts at controlling retail price increases were having no effect is wrong, dishonest and unfair.  To say that the huge result both of commodity speculation and of the oil price rise had no effect from outside is unfair and it prostitutes the level of serious economic debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to compare, therefore, in regard to the imports of inflation, the price rises in the 15 months up to April, 1973, with the nine months up to January, 1974.  In the 15 months up to April, 1973, the average of a whole range of things rose by 47.8 <Col N="1525" /> per cent but in the following nine months, up to January, 1974, they rose by 73.9 per cent.  That means that the commodities being brought into this country in the latter period were rising twice as fast in the nine months between the time we came to power and the end of January, 1974, as in the previous 15 months.</P>
    <P>To try to brush them away and say that this is not relevant is again prostituting the level of serious economic debate.  I want to expand on what is being done in regard to income tax because we, perhaps, have a simplistic situation where one side says it is something very serious and very good and the other side says it is nothing at all.  I should like to refer to what Deputy Colley stated yesterday and my accusation that he was making a destructive and wrecking speech. Deputy Colley said, in my belief in an effort to wreck the national pay agreement, that the budget was fraudulent because workers were induced by this Government to enter the national pay agreement under false pretences.</P>
    <P>If one enters something under false pretences the sequel in thought is that one is free to get out of it again. Deputy Colley's speech, by suggesting that what was done in income tax was insufficient, was an effort to wreck the national pay agreement.  I accused Deputy Colley, and his colleagues in Opposition, of trying to wreck it when it was half-way signed and now that it has been signed&mdash; I believe the Government and the Opposition have expressed pleasure at its passing&mdash;he is trying to wreck it.  As the Opposition spokesman on Finance he is acting in a way which I believe is contributing to wrecking it.  He is taking the lead in wrecking it.</P>
    <P>Let us now take the number of people caught by income tax.  In 1957 there were 185,000 taxpayers and by 1973 there were more than 700,000. This is an enormous expansion in income tax, catching people that it was never intended or expected to catch because there was the total refusal to reform income tax not just in one year.  I should like to state here that it is very flattering for a Government <Col N="1526" /> to hear an Opposition expect us to do everything in a period of 13 months; it is very flattering to do more in 13 months than the Opposition did during the 16 years they were in office. It perhaps indicates their subconscious assessment of the relative abilities of the two parties forming the Government.  There was no reform of income tax and no facing up to this injustice until we came to power. This budget has removed 60,000 people from the tax net.  I must say bluntly that this is not enough but we are laying the basis for raising tax in other ways, from sectors of the economy that ought not to be fleeced but ought to make a contribution. That is the basis for getting a proper balance between income tax and other forms of taxation.  The release of 60,000 people from the tax net is a very significant reform in income tax.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have his opportunity of contributing to this debate.  I should now like to talk about some of the changes in taxation and I am going to take for a single man a lower example in earnings than for a married man with no children and I am going to take higher examples still for a married man with three children.  For the young single man earning £700 per year, and that is a small income, his tax saving is more than one-third of what he pays in tax.  It may be said that is not enough and I agree it is not enough but it is a very significant and major reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well worth doing and it is a serious contribution to lightening the income tax burden on that man.  It is a particularly serious contribution taken in the context both of the social welfare benefits in this budget and in the context of no tax on the so-called old reliables on which the hypothetical single man, whether it is on drink or petrol, might spend a significant part of his income.  In the case of a married <Col N="1527" /> man without children and earning £1,250 per year the reduction in income tax is almost one-quarter.  It may be said from the benches opposite that this is not enough.  Is it not a significant and worthwhile reduction?  When I say &ldquo;almost one quarter&rdquo; I am not bending the figure because the exact figure is 24.62 per cent.  The people opposite may say: &ldquo;more, please&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">

      <P>If bad arguments were made in the past from the Opposition benches, there are still bad arguments coming from there, regardless of who is in Opposition.  In the case of a married man with three children and earning £1,750 the saving in income tax is more than 30 per cent.  Is that significant?  Is it worth doing?  Again we may be told that it is not enough but is it not a move in the right direction?  Is it not a move big enough to be regarded as a significant contribution to lightening the income tax burden on the lower-paid sections of the community?  There is also the significant factor of the releasing from the income tax net of 60,000 people. This is a very significant income tax reform apart from the other reforms in taxation.  It is a wholehearted honouring of what was said in regard to the reduction of income tax in respect of the lower-paid sectors.  If anyone refers to the tables that have been made available he will realise that this release is a sharply graduated one. To take it in its most extreme form, the reduction in income tax in respect of a single person earning £600 a year is 50 per cent.  This is a serious effort towards the redistribution of wealth. The same sharp graduation is evident in all the other aspects of the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The changes are a significant contribution to real income tax reforms and are a wholehearted <Col N="1528" /> carrying out of commitments made by the Coalition.  If the Opposition wish to wreck the national wage agreement, let them go ahead.  This is a difficult time for the economy for very many reasons that are admitted by any neutral observer.  If you want to denigrate this budget and to call it &ldquo;fraudulent&rdquo; that is your right as an Opposition but the people will judge you for it in the long run.</P>
      <P>Let us turn now to something which, because it was not a feature of the budget, was not mentioned by the Minister for Finance.  I refer to no new taxation being put on the old reliables, as they are called.  The people were expecting increased taxation in this field but the Minister's decision is an important avoidance of indirect taxation and this plays a significant part in curbing inflation. Also, it opens a very important gap between our costs for these old reliables and what they cost in Britain because the British have had a huge imposition of tax in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley said that everything possible should be done to stimulate exports.  This was the only creative sentence in his speech.  Does the Deputy recognise tourism as an export service.  Is tourism important in his opinion?  The Deputy is knowledgeable enough and articulate enough economically to recognise that tourism is important and that it is an export service.  The avoidance of increased taxation on the pint and on cigarettes is an important contribution, not only in sparing people from these increases, but in aiding Irish tourism.  It is precisely the sort of action that the Deputy sought but he cannot give credit for it.  There were many silly and hysterical utterances in Deputy Colley's speech but if one concentrates on the economics of his speech, one finds a huge fundamental contradiction that invalidates the economic seriousness of his whole attack.  He wanted more relief from income tax and greater social welfare benefits.  He wanted also less capital tax and a smaller deficit.  The Deputy has been a Minister for Finance yet he wants all of these provisions <Col N="1529" /> simultaneously.  Therefore, what in effect he is saying is that he wants more indirect taxation.  There is no mistaking that.  Let us say it again.  He wants more tax reliefs.  Therefore, it follows that the revenue required will not be obtained from income tax.  He wants more for social welfare so there will have to be more revenue to meet those increases.  He wants a smaller deficit and less capital taxation so the revenue required cannot be raised in this way.  Deputy Colley's party tried to use the machinery of the European Parliament to override this sovereign Parliament by trying to ram indirect taxation on to foodstuffs.  At a time when we are taxed with being indifferent to inflation the Deputy is advocating inflationary measures. What Deputy Colley wanted was increased taxation on cigarettes, on the pint and on petrol.  That would be directly inflationary and damaging to tourism.  That is the logic&mdash;or is it the illogic?&mdash;of economic ignorance. Deputy Colley cannot be said to have the ignorance of a new backbencher. He has the responsibility of being spokesman on Finance for his party yet he is so illiterate economically as not to be aware of a basic contradiction in his whole attack and he dares to use a word such a &ldquo;fraudulent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let us consider now the question of children's allowances.  This is something that ought to be read into the record of the House.  For how many decades have each party in this House wanted unity in this country but how often have we heard the argument that the standard of social welfare benefits in the North was higher than here?  This was a very serious fundamental economic argument.  As a result of this budget, which comes after the British budget, children's allowances for all families with from one child to eight children are now bigger in the Republic than they are in the North or in any part of the U.K.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the people opposite think that is good?  I might add that for one-child families in the North there is no children's allowance <Col N="1530" /> paid whereas here the amount paid will be £2.30 and that for families in the North of eight children the figure is exactly the same as it is here.  I might refer in this context to the relevance of the Minister for Justice's Bill in another area and point out that in the North for families of nine and ten children the figure is 28p and 57p higher, respectively, than what it is here.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with matter relating to the general management of the economy, because here the Opposition have tried to mount a fundamental challenge, in my view of a wrecking, mischievous and economically ignorant kind.  But they have a good deal of support in the country and must be accorded the respect of a party which have governed this country and played a very important role in our national life.  They cannot escape that responsibility lightly, much as the habit of irresponsible opposition has totally invaded their minds in an extraordinarily short time.  They still must be treated as being responsible.</P>
      <P>Any one looking at the Irish economy and trying to manage it and optimise its performance knows that as a small, peripheral economy&mdash; specially in the European context, but at all times for the last half century &mdash;we do not have the strength of the United States or France.  We are a small, delicate economy continuously walking a tightrope.  One may err on one side or the other from the optimum path with growing peril depending on how far one is from optimum position; but that optimum position and that balance is always delicate and there is always a fairly subtle mix of conflicting tendencies that must be balanced to optimise growth.  It will never be easy to manage an economy of this size as long as it remains a separate economy on the edge of a Europe which is large and dynamic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But last night we got a presentation from Deputy Colley&mdash;I am trying to find the quotation so that we can get to some sort of basic debate.  I cannot have a column reference because these <Col N="1531" /> are just typed sheets.  I cannot find the exact quotation I want and I may have to paraphrase, which I shall try to do accurately and fairly.  The point I am making relates to his characterisation of the Irish economy as a free enterprise one.  He suggested there was a conflict between the Labour Party and Fine Gael, that we were trying to have it both ways and that the Labour Party wanted a socialistic economy which was in conflict with our partners in Coalition. This is not a new debate and so I want to refer back to two years ago and I want to quote my predecessor in the Department of Industry and Commerce and Deputy Dr. FitzGerald who was then in the Opposition benches.  On 19th April, 1972, at column 619 of the Official Report the Minister for Industry and Commerce then said:</P>
    <P>The Irish nation has opted on the whole for a private enterprise economy.</P>
    <P>At column 653 Deputy Dr. FitzGerald said:</P>
    <P>The Irish nation has opted very definitely for a mixed economy, a philosophy that I was behind. Our whole approach to industrialisation is that both public authorities and the private sector need to complement each other if the maximum social benefit is to be attained.</P>
    <P>It is not a choice between free enterprise&mdash;which is a figment of the imagination, something which may have existed at some time in the last century, perhaps in the mind of Adam Smith, perhaps in economic text books but certainly never in this country&mdash; and a socialist economy.  The question is: do you recognise that you exist in a mixed economy and do you try to reconcile the different interests and balance them to the major benefit of the different sectors?  That is how we would formulate the question.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley became very cross last night about whether Fianna Fáil had moved to the Right or not.  This question of Right and Left came up. I think there is ample evidence from <Col N="1532" /> their attitude to capital taxation, to mining taxation and to natural resources to suggest that they have so moved.  If they would indicate an attitude on contraceptives it would be interesting to have it.  There is also their attitude to consultants and the question of health services.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of evidence both in the social and economic sectors to suggest that Fianna Fáil have moved massively to the right and are now not the party of a mixed economy which was their pride and the core of their economic policy in the thirties and forties.  One could produce quotations from Fianna Fáil Ministers, not only that but one can produce their actions which are memorials to Fianna Fáil and, I believe, admirable ones.  I believe they are memorials which could be defended. If you talk about free enterprise or a private enterprise economy where is the place for Aer Lingus?  It breaks the rules.  Where is the place for the ESB, for Bord na Móna, for NET, the Irish Sugar Company?  Are you pleased that these exist in important sectors of the economy where free enterprise was not working or do you want to dismantle them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley did not imply that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, but let us face the debate.  I understood that he did imply it.  Let us argue this. I am not being abusive but trying to argue rationally.  I think these are memorials to the creative character of Fianna Fáil and I am very much for them and I want to defend them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there was bi-partisanship in the sense that we wanted a mixed economy.  We still want an economy which gives the possibility of profits and growth to the private sector and which indicates that in the matter of social welfare and the human aspect of the economic life there is a place for the public sector and that these can be <Col N="1533" /> reconciled to their mutual benefit.  I always understood that was the Fianna Fáil position and that I admired in Fianna Fáil.  I think it was a correct economic attitude for them in the 1940s and 1950s and that policy served the nation well.</P>
      <P>I feel with alarm&mdash;and not simply I&mdash;that they are sliding away from that, that because they were so enmeshed in the growth of industry that they took on the attitude of industry completely.  It took them 20 to 30 years to do it but now I hear the authentic voice of big industry which is not even indigenous industry but the authentic voice of big foreign industry in their attitude to our income tax reforms, which are very fundamental.  Please tell me I am wrong and I shall be happy to hear it, because I thought we had consensus about this: that we had a good deal of agreement that the task was to reconcile public and private enterprise in a mixed economy of the sort that is emerging all over the world, the sort Galbraith discusses lucidly and very convincingly in many of his books going back over 15 years and he was a Harvard Professor and Democratic Ambassador to India, not a socialist or a radical.</P>

      <P>We must listen to the argument because it is a serious one. This is crucial to how we develop our economy.  We have to offer circumstances in which this is an attractive place for private investors, indigenous Irish investment and foreign investment.  We welcome that sort of investment.  Personally, I have travelled large sections of the globe in 13 months indicating to foreign investors that they will be welcome in Ireland, that we have an environment in which they can make profits and that we shall be happy to have them do so and that we give very generous advances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy <Col N="1534" /> knows the dates and he knows that that is a frivolous interjection.  Our task is a serious one.  It is to reconcile those national and public interests with private interests.  It is to be clear about the evolution of a mixed economy where both sectors have an important recognised and creative role to play, to make that clear and give that assurance, and therefore to have the basis of economic growth. That is the tightrope between the public and private sector on which I thought there was some consensus until Fianna Fáil went into Opposition and started lurching to what I consider on many issues the attitudes of the extreme Right wing.  I will not try to stop them because that way lies their political destruction.  If that is what they want, so be it.  I will point out that change in their policy.</P>
      <P>Let us come to the question of what one does in regard to the balance between growth and social justice. That is the same tightrope situation expressing itself in another way.  If one goes for growth at all costs that is all right.  You can say: &ldquo;We cannot have any mining profits.&rdquo; If you do that you will not get growth.  One can have growth in mining which does no good to Ireland.  It just makes a big hole in the ground and when the mine is finished people go away. That is growth but it is growth without any social conformity.</P>
      <P>On the other hand we can say we must have more for health, social welfare and education and we must have it now.  One can then load on a tax burden which will sink the whole economy.  One can go too far too quickly in that respect.  The task is to balance those two things.  In that context of the need to create an economic environment of dynamic growth on the one hand and producing a human environment in regard to health, social welfare and education on the other hand, there is a crucial balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say in parentheses that as regards social welfare there were small things&mdash;let us admit that they were not expensive&mdash;which showed an extraordinary and admirable humanity?  For the unmarried women <Col N="1535" /> over 58 in poor circumstances help was very important.  This is very human.  It shows an awareness of a problem.  Help for those families where the husband goes to jail was not expensive.  It was not a big thing. I am not making a song and dance about this.  That reform was needed. The social welfare code was looked at with a heart.  It was easy to do.  It was very important as it indicated the coming of kindness and humanity into the social welfare code.  That is an aside.</P>
    <P>Let us come back to the business of balancing the private and public sectors, of balancing the need to get growth in the economy very attractive to investment and the need to satisfy the growing demands for health, social welfare and education.  There has to be a delicate balance, and one can err on one side or the other.  If one is discussing this balance then one's attitude to a tax on farmers and on wealth is crucial.  It is agreed that industry is taxed enough.  I remember the previous Minister for Finance loading more taxation on industry with, I think, damaging effects.  From the Labour Opposition benches I was then happy to join with the CII and others in asking him to bring it down to the present level.  I think that was a correct decision.</P>
    <P>In my view the levels of income tax are too high.  We are doing our best. The Minister for Finance is doing his best.  These problems cannot be solved suddenly.  This is a very useful reform.  Indirect taxation is heavy enough.  I am glad more was not put on.  I am pleased it is not on food. Where will we get money?  Is it permissible to tax wealth?  That is the basic question.  Consultation can be lengthy and this can be messy.  There is a period of uncertainty, which one could get over by producing a document and saying: &ldquo;There it is.&rdquo; That would be tidier but it would be less democratic.  Democracy is always a little messy.</P>
    <P>We are having a debate on wealth tax.  We will not be such idiots either from considerations of equity, or the economy, or our own political future, <Col N="1536" /> that we will produce the effect which Deputy Lynch said he knew would be produced: that the combined effect of profits tax, income tax and wealth tax would make it impossible to have a good income with enough for investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is this.  There is a great deal of looking at levels, at thresholds and at conditions.  I want to see all taxation, whether on wealth or farmers, as taxation which is designed to produce investment, designed to produce growth and the more intensive use of capital.  Is it wrong to tax wealth?  One may criticise the method. Does one criticise the principle?  Face that and answer that.  Is it wrong to tax farmers with a valuation of more than £100?  On 27th January, 1974, in an interview with <i>The Sunday Press</i> Deputy Lynch said that there is a case for wealthy farmers paying income tax. I agree with him because I feel the same.  But what wealthy farmers? Doctor Seamus Sheehy of UCD, who is a distinguished agricultural economist with whom I have crossed swords on a number of issues&mdash;so I cannot be accused of quoting someone with my own point of view&mdash;said last night that the range of farmers brought under the code could hardly be narrower.  On the one hand we have the Leader of the Opposition saying that there is a case for wealthy farmers paying income tax and, on the other, it is being said that what was introduced could hardly be narrower.  Do you think it is too much? Are you against that?  Answer.  Do not <Col N="1537" /> try to skate out of it.  Let us have a serious debate about this balance between the public and private sector, not with hysteria, or scare words, not with the litany of hysteria which I quoted onto the record from Deputy Colley's last speech, but with an effort towards a meeting of minds.  Let us debate it.  Do you think that farmers who have large incomes should not pay income tax when their farm workers do?  If you concede the principle, then is the practice as embodied too narrow or too wide?  Doctor Sheehy said it could hardly be narrower.  They are questions which deserve answers.  I do not think that the people of Ireland realise how enormous the economic storm in the rest of the world is because things are so calm here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not know how big the difficulties are because the economy is running calmly and because there is trust between the different sectors of the economy.  Mischievous people try to wreck things.  I recommend to people to count the number of times the words &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; or &ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; occurred in Deputy J. Lynch's speech this morning.  It is from the Opposition that the damage and the undermining are coming.  If they cannot run the economy they are determined to wreck it.  It is a dog-in-the-manager attitude.</P>
      <P>We think that the balance of growth and taxation reform, bringing greater equity and social justice through the social welfare code, is the right mix. If one goes too far on the side of creating the private enterprise economy, which is very attractive to investment, one will get growth but also social turmoil.  Whole sections of the population will be alienated. If one goes too fast in raising the standard of improvement under the headings of health, social welfare and education one would create an environment where capital cannot flourish and the economy would be depressed.  The task is to balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition should tell us where they think that balance is wrong.  If <Col N="1538" /> I go back to the basic contradiction of Deputy Colley last night, which has been reiterated today less precisely by Deputy J. Lynch, I should like them to tell us where the balance is wrong. If more tax reforms and more social welfare benefits are required, less deficit and less capital tax, how can these be reconciled?  Is more indirect taxation wanted?  Are more of all the outgoings wanted and less of all the incomings?  We are entitled to ask what the Opposition want at a time like this.  We do not mind how resolute the opposition is, but let it be serious. Do not let the Opposition be as hysterical as what we had last night.  It has been aptly described as &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; in the leading article in <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>Let us face this question of a deficit about which everyone is waxing so indignant.  If we think back a little to Deputy Colley's last budget we will remember that he budgeted for a deficit of nearly £28 million in 1972.  The run-out, in fact, was only £5.5 million.  The world economic situation was much easier then.  The arguments for a deficit budget were much less, but Deputy Colley budgeted for a deficit.  It was a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  We have not economics of the 1920s now.  Keynes has happened.  The Keynesian revolution came 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>There is nothing sacred about balancing a budget.  It is a sort of idiot thing to do if the economic imperatives are for deficit budgeting in a particular circumstances.  It is not impermissible to have a deficit.  There is no vulgarity or obscenity about a deficit.  Deputy Colley had one.  The run-out in Deputy Colley's time was one-fifth of what he budgeted for. Last year we had a budget deficit of over £39 million.  The run-out was £10 million or about one-quarter.  The budget deficit this year is £66 million. This may be, in the words of Deputy Colley, fraudulent or grossly irresponsible. If we are being grossly irresponsible we are being so with advice from many advisers who apparently are grossly irresponsible also.  A lot of our advisers are very important people who are very serious <Col N="1539" /> economists.  Deputy Colley doubted last night whether any reputable economist would make such suggestions.</P>
    <P>We have had advice from the OECD. They say that policy action to stimulate demand and output would seem desirable. The aim of budgetary and monetary policy in 1974, according to them, should be to add about 1 per cent to growth in output.  That is 1 per cent more than a neutral budget would have added.  Last year they advised us to go for a deficit.  In dismissing the simplistic approach to a budget balance they say that the current budget position is among the least sophisticated and the least appropriate. While running a deficit in the current budget the Government can, in fact, inject extra spending power into the economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley asked for more exports.  I agree with him on this point.  I should like more invisible exports also.  By keeping the economy at a high level when there are downturns in the world, unit costs are kept right.  Prices are kept right.  The competitive position is kept right.  This is the most important single contribution one can make towards securing exports. There is one other thing that can be done to increase industrial exports and that is to have selective devaluation.  Is Deputy Colley suggesting that we enter the game of the 1930s of competing devaluation?  Does he want that?  Does he want to go away from sterling?  If Deputy Colley makes statements using the words &ldquo;stimulating exports&rdquo; he has to say how, if he is serious.  We are entitled to expect seriousness from Deputy Colley, if not from all the Opposition.</P>
    <P>In the context of the current world economic situation we are advised from profoundly reputable sources inside and outside the country&mdash;the CII inside and the OECD outside&mdash;to go for growth in order to try to add 1 per cent to the growth that we would get from a neutral budget.  This implies a deficit.  In the past we have had deficits both from the present Opposition and from this Government.  It is a normal, reasonable and responsible budgetary measure which is correct in the circumstances.  In a time of world <Col N="1540" /> economic difficulty to describe as grossly irresponsible the proposals that have been made is grossly irresponsible. There has been gross irresponsibility in this budget debate coming from the Opposition and not from the Minister for Finance or the Government.</P>
    <P>We have hit, in our first year in office, the greatest economic storm that has happened since the war.  The Opposition may wish to decry it or to suggest, as Deputy Colley did last night, that we were hiding behind the skirts or the burnouses of the Arabs.</P>
    <P>Any objective economic commentator in the world would agree that this is the greatest economic storm since the war.  It came on a new Government.  We are just about plumb in the middle of it.  There are some signs that we are past the very centre of the storm and have started moving out now, having moved in over recent months.  We are entitled to compliment both the management and the worker sectors of the economy.  We are entitled to compliment the organisations and financial institutions on their calm and discipline, and on how well they have behaved during this period.  I think I might say, since I am not the person responsible for the budget, that we can compliment the Minister for Finance and his staff on their calm, discipline and their effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Government are coming through this vast test&mdash;which any fair, objective observer admits is a vast test&mdash;tempered, more experienced, more united, more consolidated and more resolute.  In these circumstances, we, and&mdash;more important&mdash; the people of Ireland are entitled to look for responsible opposition.</P>
    <P>We are entitled, and the people are entitled, to be profoundly disappointed at the irresponsibility and the wrecking of the Opposition, and profoundly disappointed at the attitude that if they cannot continue to run the economy they want to wreck it and pull it down.  That is shameful opposition at a time when, more than ever for the past quarter of a century, we need serious opposition.  If we had to have this challenge, which we did not will, and which came from outside economic forces beyond our control &mdash;let us use the cliché &ldquo;economic <Col N="1541" /> forces beyond our control&rdquo;&mdash;I am profoundly happy for this Government that it came when it did.  It has unified us; it has tempered us; it has strengthened us.</P>
    <P>I believe that with the people, sustained by the confidence of the people, and helped by the discipline of the people, we will surmount this economic storm through the actions of the Minister for Finance in last year's budget and in this one better than very many comparable countries, and that we will avoid the pitfalls into which other countries have already fallen.  I believe we will do that.  I believe this will be the objective judgement in three or four years' time.  I am very pleased to be a member of an Administration which faced this challenge and are in the course of surmounting it very well.  I am profoundly pleased to be a colleague of the Minister for Finance who has introduced for the second time a budget which gets the right balance between growth, the demands of equity and the demands of social justice. This budget balances those three things in the correct proportions and that is why it is the correct budget in our present circumstances.</P>

      <P>I suppose one could entitle the greater part of the speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as Deputy Keating's apologia.  The Minister feels he must apologise to the Irish people for his failure&mdash;I could call it his abysmal failure but he might regard the word &ldquo;abysmal&rdquo; as emotional&mdash;to do anything about price control and particularly to do anything about the promise made by the Coalition before they came into office to stabilise prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I noted that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was likely to speak after the Leader of the Opposition I had no doubt in my mind as to what line he was likely to pursue.  We have listened to the Minister on many occasions in this House and it was clear to me that the first thing he would do would be to underline the problems and then make the &ldquo;hit me now with a child in my arms&rdquo; plea, and that he would <Col N="1542" /> also make an attack on the integrity of this party.</P>

      <P>He claimed that the speeches made by speakers on this side of the House were deliberately designed to wreck the economy.  Nobody knows better than he does that this is not so.  It is a similar charge to the charge he made when the first attempt at a national wage agreement failed&mdash;that this party had done their utmost to destroy any prospect of arriving at a national wage agreement. This has been proved to be patently untrue.  I can tell the Minister that I voted in favour of the national wage agreement, not necessarily for the particular agreement but for the principle, because I recognise how necessary such an agreement was for the benefit of the country just as my party have always recognised it.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to describe the problems facing the country and attributed most of them to outside influences. It is remarkable, as I see it, how Coalitions appear to generate crises.  They blamed the break-up of the first Coalition partly on the Korean War.  The second Coalition broke up, if we are to believe the people who were involved in it, because of the Suez crisis.  Now they have the oil crisis.  One would imagine that during our time of office there was never a crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We overcame the crises without making all the noise the Coalition appear to find necessary. I have no doubt that the euphoric acclaim which greeted the budget from the Government benches yesterday evening will have somewhat cooled by this morning particularly when Deputies on the other side of the House begin to realise the damaging effects this budget will have on our economy. Whatever the ultimate attitude of Deputies opposite may be to the budget, I have no doubt about what the people will feel about it when <Col N="1543" /> its full implications become known and when its effects on the economy are seen.</P>
      <P>This is clearly a severely inflationary budget. The Minister stated that he is budgeting for the enormous deficit of well over £70 million in the remaining nine months of this year, or well over £66 million in a full year.  The Minister knows full well the threat inflation holds for the economy generally.  He need never again refer to worldwide inflation as the only source of our ills when he himself is deliberately adding fuel to the inflationary flames and thereby threatening the standard of living of our people.</P>
      <P>Because of its effect on the living standards of all our people we must be very concerned with the inflationary content of this budget.  Because inflation hits hardest those who are on fixed incomes, we must be most concerned of all about the situation in which those of our people who are on low level fixed incomes find themselves as do all of our people who are dependent on social welfare because, quite obviously, they are worst hit of all.  The level of social welfare payments made available to our people is important but even more important is the preservation of the buying power of the money they receive. Therefore speaking only of the actual amount they receive can be very misleading if we do not relate it to the general circumstances in which it is received and if we do not relate it to the cost of living pertaining at the time.  It should be obvious to everybody that the value of any sum of money is related to what that sum of money can purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the inception of the Fianna Fáil Party we have been very concerned about the needs of those who, for one reason or another, are unable to help themselves.  The foundation laid and built upon by Fianna Fáil is sound.  It provides for this and succeeding Governments a sound base for the further development of our social services.  It has always been a top priority with us not only to increase payments each year but to <Col N="1544" /> extend and develop the social welfare code to include more and more people who are in need of help and to improve the quality of their lives, with the ultimate objective of providing a comprehensive insurance scheme involving all workers including the self-employed.</P>
    <P>Let us say here and now that we on this side of the House are not at all satisfied with the increases granted to the various categories of people entitled to benefit under our social welfare code.  It may be the accepted thing for Opposition parties to complain that sufficient money is not being made available for social welfare purposes because of the particular circumstances prevailing at the time of the budget or at the time when the Social Welfare Bill is introduced which affect detrimentally the standard of living of those people dependent on social welfare payments. Sometimes the arguments put forward about the meagreness are without foundation, but who can deny the shocking plight in which those who are unable to help themselves find themselves today?</P>
    <P>The cost of living has rocketed at an unprecedented rate since this Government took office.  The Government, who were elected on a promise to stabilise prices, have done nothing effective about it and hardly a week passes without more and more price increases being announced.  By their inflationary budgetary policy of last year the Government, because of increases in VAT, on clothing, fuel and so on, helped this upward surge in prices.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to stress again that the people on fixed incomes are those hit hardest by soaring prices and, more particularly, those people on low level fixed incomes such as those receiving social welfare payments of various kinds.  There is no way in which they can cushion themselves against rapidly rising prices and, added to their financial worries, there are anxieties, stresses and strains.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government came to office with the greatest opportunity in the history of this country to develop our social welfare services.  They inherited <Col N="1545" /> from Fianna Fáil a buoyant economy, which is the basic foundation on which to build a worthwhile social security system.  On top of that they had available to them the £30 million saved in agricultural subsidies as a result of our entry into the Common Market.  Incidentally I might point out that the Labour Party, of which the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare are members, vigorously opposed our entry into the EEC. Had that party succeeded in keeping Ireland out of the EEC, I tremble to think what money would have been available for social welfare purposes. If the previous Coalition contributions are any guide, then the amount would have been very poor indeed.  It is ironic that the Coalition now claim credit for improvements in social welfare which were made possible by the work of the Fianna Fáil Party in ensuring our entry into the EEC.</P>

      <P>Last year the Government <Col N="1546" /> made available £39 million in the budget for increases in social welfare.  As I have already explained the bulk of this was made up of EEC money.  They dispensed this money in such a way that the very poorest of those in need got only a £1 a week increase in assistance from the State.</P>
      <P>In his budget speech, the Minister said, in the section dealing with social welfare, that social welfare insurance benefits, social assistance payments and children's allowances granted last year far exceeded what would have been needed to cover the increase in the cost of living.  I wonder where the Minister has been living over the past year.  Surely he made that statement with his tongue in his cheek?  In fact the increases granted last year have been eroded long ago in a rampant ocean of inflation; not only that, but the original pension was eaten into to such an extent that pensioners and others in 1973 were worse off than they had been in 1972 despite the monetary increase they received in the 1973 budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Too much stress can be laid on the monetary increases which in inflationary circumstances can be very deceptive especially to the old, who remember the days when money had a very different value from that of today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he ask those who are in receipt of social welfare payments how much they feel the standard of living has improved over the past year.  He would find that none of them would agree with the statement made in his budget speech.  As I have said already, the increase in social welfare last year was £39 million which included the £30 million saved on agricultural subsidies. Since then, we have gone through a year of rampant inflation in which the true value of the benefits and allowances has been very severely eroded.  One would have felt that the Government's objective would have <Col N="1547" /> been to make available this year sufficient money to make up for the reduced value of the pensions and benefits and to add further money to ensure some improvement in the standard of living of people dependent on social welfare.  The least we could have expected was an allocation of money for increases in social welfare considerably in excess of last year's allocation.  In fact, what is the position?</P>
    <P>The position is that the amount made available this year, despite the £66 million deficit, despite the assistance from the EEC, despite the escalating cost of living, is £25 million. This includes money for improvement of public service pensions.  As I do not know the cost of the latter I cannot give the exact figure for social welfare increases, but it must be considerably lower than the £25 million quoted by the Minister in his statement.  This year when the cost of living is infinitely worse than last year, we have less than £25 million made available for increases and we are asking people dependent on social welfare to be pleased with this.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister that the cost of living is likely to rise by 14 per cent to 15 per cent in the coming year.  If after the inflationary budget of yesterday we were to request a forecast from experts what percentage increase there would be in the cost of living in the coming year, I wonder what that forecast would be.  I feel that forecast would be increased quite considerably.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister points out that he is increasing social welfare benefits by 18 per cent, or at least he is increasing some of them by 18 per cent&mdash;social insurance and assistance payments.  He states this will ensure that all beneficiaries will have a significant rise in their real standard of living.  When one takes into account the fact that last year's pension has been seriously eroded, that the items forming the main purchases of those people dependent on social welfare&mdash;food, clothing and fuel&mdash;went up last year by a very high percentage increase, how can he for <Col N="1548" /> one moment suggest that the increases in his budget for social welfare will maintain the standard of living of the people dependent on it, never mind increasing that standard?  This is a ridiculous statement by the Minister It is most unfair because it affects the people about whom he is supposed to be concerned.</P>
    <P>In his budget statement the Minister relied on percentages, which mean very little unless we relate them to figures.  In this instance the figures are low enough.  The Minister extracted some examples from a rather bad situation to enable him to quote the best figures.  However he did not refer in any part of his speech to the single man or woman drawing unemployment assistance.  Here the increase offered is the princely sum of £1.15. Last year this category were given an increase of £1 per week.  Does anyone suggest their circumstances have not deteriorated in the meantime?  Does anyone suggest it is not much more difficult to live now than last year?</P>
    <P>We have only to consider the increases in fuel, food and clothing. Yet the Minister seems to be satisfied that a little more than £1 increase to a total of £7.30 per week is sufficient for people in those circumstances, not to mention raising their standard of living.  A widow on a non-contributory widow's pension gets an increase of £1.15 per week and each child gets an increase of 40p.  Does the Minister consider that this increase compensates for the erosion of her pension in the past year?  Does he think it ensures she can meet the increases in prices and in the cost of living which he has forecast for the coming year and at the same time have her standard of living raised?  It appears to me that neither the Minister nor the Government have seriously considered this problem.  They have relied on the fact that the mention of £1 may confuse those people who remember the time when a £ was worth a £ and they may think that they are receiving a worthwhile increase.</P>
    <P>The vast bulk of the money in the social insurance fund is paid by the <Col N="1549" /> employers and employees and the Exchequer contribution is being steadily reduced.  For example, the Exchequer percentage contribution was 33.16 per cent in 1972-73 and it was down to 31.10 per cent in 1973-74.  It is little better now.  The increases for single people are little better than on the assistance side.  They get £1.30 per week as opposed to £1.15, making a total of £8.50.</P>
    <P>I am relating this to the statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to children's allowances.  The personal rate in Britain is £10 per week.  We are still struggling to reach parity with Britain but we are falling behind. The Minister for Industry and Commerce made much of the increase in the children's allowances and he pointed out that it meant these benefits were better here than in the Six Counties.  The Minister was selective in the case he made but he did not refer to the fact that with regard to social security we were pretty far behind.  I take no pleasure from this. I should much prefer to have a situation where we could say we were on a par with the North of Ireland in relation to all social security payments.</P>
    <P>The increases for child dependants on the contributory side is 40p but in some cases it is as low as 30p per week.  However the most derisory increase is that of 30p per month per child in the children's allowances&mdash; that is about 7p per week.  The Minister does not seem to have any idea of what it costs to feed and clothe a child nowadays.  One would get a very poor pair of shoes with the allowance for two months.  If I were a betting man I would be willing to bet that before July the 30p per month will be absorbed in the sea of inflation which is so considerably assisted by Government policy.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister has said that the changes brought about in last year's budget not only granted increases in rates of existing benefits but extended to the introduction of new schemes to give assistance to under-privileged groups, such as unmarried mothers and handicapped children.  I <Col N="1550" /> do not know why the Minister used the words &ldquo;such as&rdquo; because I do not know of any other schemes introduced last year.  This was dressing up a sentence to give a wrong impression.</P>
    <P>It could be implied from that statement and from a statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he spoke about the new schemes that were to be introduced this year that nobody ever thought of giving assistance to such under-privileged groups until the Coalition came to office.  I would remind the House that by introducing the schemes last year and extending them this year the Coalition are simply extending a system developed during the years by Fianna Fáil.  We should not forget the introduction by Fianna Fáil of schemes giving free travel, free electricity and free television licences to pensioners; the scheme for the care of incapacitated pensioners; the deserted wife's allowance; the old age care allowance and the Pay-Related (Benefit) Act.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated, these schemes also put a human look on the social welfare code.  While I welcome the new proposals in the budget in relation to this matter, I wish to make it clear they are simply a continuation of a policy adopted by Fianna Fáil many years ago.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals to grant the wife of a person in receipt of unemployment assistance £3.10p per week and the scheme to help the wives of long term prisoners and unmarried women over 58 years of age in poor circumstances.  I would, however, again remind the House that down through the years Fianna Fáil have always sought out those who were in need and made provision for them.  Any plan or scheme which helps those in need will always have our full support on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the free electricity scheme.  Recently I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare if he would extend the free fuel scheme to people in rural areas in the same social assistance categories as those who receive free fuel in the cities and some <Col N="1551" /> of the larger towns.  The Parliamentary Secretary was not prepared to do this. He expressed the view that the scheme was not a very satisfactory one and he said he was reviewing the position. I suggest now to the Minister that he should remove the limit on the amount of electricity used by those presently entitled to it and extend the scheme where possible.  This would be of exceptional help to those who are obviously unable to purchase fuel or pay for light as these are now very high in price.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary went into the history of the free fuel scheme and he pointed out that it was introduced when it was almost impossible to procure fuel.  There are two ways in which it can be almost impossible to procure fuel; one is when it is not available and the other is when one cannot pay for it.  In those circumstances the Minister should consider sympathetically my suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to the abolition of the remuneration limit for social insurance and to the scheme for pay-related benefits which is being introduced.  He said these were further desirable developments in a just society.  In case the phrase &ldquo;just society&rdquo; might lead anybody to think that the Pay-Related Benefits Act was a Fine Gael innovation, let me hasten to assure the House that this was a Fianna Fáil measure, a very worthwhile measure piloted through this House by Deputy Joe Brennan, the former Minister for Social Welfare.  All the preliminary work in relation to the abolition of the remuneration limit was done by Fianna Fáil and that preliminary work was quite extensive.</P>
    <P>With regard to our senior citizens, quite obviously the pensions are still too low, particularly so on the non-contributory side.  In a survey I made I found that after paying for food and a few miscellaneous items nothing is left for clothing and other articles regarded in present circumstances as necessities.  When I researched this matter I found that the sharp increases <Col N="1552" /> which have taken place in electricity and heating were only then beginning and so I did not include them.  Even at that time, when an item of clothing was needed, it usually entailed cutting down on food.  We all recognise that food is a particular need of old people and we must do everything to ensure that their income will supply this need.</P>
    <P>On the assistance side, the means test limit has been increased, but only by £1, to a total of £5 per week if a person is to be entitled to the full pension.  On previous occasions, when the pension was increased, the means test limit was also increased.  The limit of £5 per week today for full pension is low, particularly when we take into consideration present money values.  I agree that, until we have a comprehensive insurance scheme, we will always have problems but, if we are to move rapidly in the right direction, we must take cognisance of the inflationary situation in which we live and make proper provision for those on social assistance.  Because all the money for social assistance comes from the Exchequer and from local taxation, our expenditure in this particular respect will be a pointer to the level of our commitment.  We have, therefore, to ask ourselves what kind of employment would be available to bring in less than £5 a week and so ensure entitlement to a full pension. The Minister said a person could earn as much as £11.50 a week and still qualify for a reduced pension.  Would he like to state publicly what the amount of this pension would be?</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with the plight of the widow and the deserted wife on social assistance.  If they are able to take up employment they are not as a rule entitled to assistance because the amounts they earn would be more than the means test permits.  If they cannot take up employment because of family commitments, the position is even more difficult.  We should be more concerned. When the whole week's pension will scarcely buy a pair of shoes, it is time to have a thorough investigation into the matter.</P>
    <P>Statistics available to us in the consumer <Col N="1553" /> price index give some indication of the colossal increase in the cost of living over the year.  With regard to pensioners and others on social welfare benefit and assistance, they do not tell the whole story.  Apart from the fact that the greatest increases occurred in those commodities most used by people on social welfare, such as food, clothing and fuel, it is also true that in general these people buy their commodities in small amounts and that invariably means they pay a higher price.  In assessing the cost-of-living increase, this should be remembered.  The budget has not taken cognisance of this.  A very serious situation faces employed people with families, widows and deserted wives with families, in trying to meet increasing costs from very meagre resources; their situation is, indeed, lamentable and the whole approach in this particular sphere must be revised.</P>
    <P>In the realm of social welfare, in these days of very high inflation we have much to learn from the national wage agreement.  These agreements are negotiated on behalf of the workers by organisations whose purpose it is to defend the living standards of their members and, in that defence, are trying to ensure that these standards are maintained, and rightly so. In the recent national pay agreement the lowest paid workers got the highest percentage increase which was 27.5 per cent over the full year with a minimum first phase increase of £2.40 on incomes up to the level of £18 per week.  The second phase increase, guaranteed for later in the year, would give the lowest paid workers listed a total of £4.13 with a cost-of-living increase based on a 10 per cent increase in the consumer price index over a stated period.  By any standards our social welfare increases are poor by comparison.</P>
    <P>The further reduction in the age limit for old age pensions is welcome. I should recall here that Fianna Fáil introduced retirement pensions for those within the social security system at 65 years of age some years ago.  If we had a comprehensive social security scheme covering all workers <Col N="1554" /> this would apply to all workers.  It is worth remembering that a Minister, in the presence of another Minister, in the course of a broadcast prior to the last general election promised to reduce the age limit for all pensioners to 65 years and to abolish the means test immediately if they were returned to power.  This, quite obviously, had an effect on the election results but, like many other Coalition promises made prior to the election, this one was shelved immediately the Coalition was returned to office.  Reducing the age limit to 68 with the continuing means test is a poor substitute for that particular promise.</P>

      <P>The Minister is making available £100,000 to allow pilot schemes on poverty research to come into operation.  I am in agreement with this provision because any investigation which will bring to light new areas which should be catered for in our social welfare code is to be welcomed.  I should like to impress on the Minister that such investigations should not be used to cover up the fact that not nearly enough is being done to remove poverty which is well known to exist and which should be immediately catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> The rampant inflationary situation for which Government policy must take part of the blame with rapidly escalating prices is itself creating among many of those in receipt of social welfare payments a vast poverty area for which this budget does not do a great deal.  Last year's increases have long since been eroded and it looks as if the increases this year will also be fairly quickly eroded.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has now decided to get rid of the clawback as related to children's allowances, something which he introduced last year.  We have been pressing him ever since he introduced this to remove it.  Fianna Fáil is very proud of the children's allowances scheme.  At the time it was introduced by us it was one of the first, if not the first, such schemes to be introduced in any country.  I have always been convinced that in any children's allowance scheme it should be obvious to anyone that children must be the main consideration.  The change made last year by the Minister took no cognisance of children at all.  An arbitrary figure of £2,500 was laid down above which the clawback operated but there was no reference at all to the size of the family.</P>
    <P>There could be no legitimate argument in this particular area for excluding the consideration of the size of the family.  Under the Minister's scheme, a family of ten children was treated the same as a family with one child.  Where we had a family of ten children the father of which earned a net income of £2,500 the clawback operated just the same as it would in the case of a family with one child with an income of £2,500.  This was unjust and unfair and everybody thought so including the trade unions. The Minister has now recognised the fact that it was unjust and he is now morally bound to repay all the people whose children's allowance was affected detrimentally by the clawback.  The money should be paid back to these people and I have no doubt that the Minister will give favourable consideration to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> People who are depending on social welfare payments are entitled not only to maintain their standard of living but to have it considerably improved. Taking the whole inflationary situation of last year and this year and the acknowledged increase in the cost of living for next year.  I am certain that this budget will not even maintain the position of those who are depending on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The tax situation as outlined in the budget seems to me to be a confidence trick, one which was brought into operation to ensure the acceptance of the national pay agreement. The Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks that every time we criticise any particular action by the Government our only motive is to destroy confidence in the economy and try to upset the national pay agreement.  I voted for the national pay agreement and, therefore, that charge is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I think we are entitled, where we find it necessary, to criticise.  In my view the amount of the reduction made available by the Minister for Finance in income tax is less than was expected and this has been underlined by statements made by a representative of congress.  It was not very clever on the part of the Minister to make this promise and not to carry it out in the manner in which it was expected he would carry it out.  There will always be another day and new negotiations for another agreement and if workers are dissatisfied with what the Minister has given them in this budget they will find it difficult to trust the Minister again.</P>
    <P>As in the case of his social welfare proposals, the Minister dressed up his income tax presentation so that even his own backbenchers were deceived. On page 29 of his statement the Minister states that:</P>
    <P>The main personal allowances under the new structure will be £500 for a single person, £299 at present, £550 for a widowed person, £324 at present, and £800 for a married person, £494 at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister was acclaimed by his backbenchers for that statement but, <Col N="1557" /> of course, the backbenchers did not realise that the Minister was abolishing earned income relief.  They must have been amazed later on discovering that the figures should have read, as they appear in the document that was presented to us sometime after the Minister had concluded his speech, £500 for a single person, £499 at present; £550 for a widowed person, £474 at present; £800 for a married person, £744 at present.  As has been pointed out by speakers on this side of the House, to restore the 1972 position in relation to income tax would have necessitated increasing the allowances by 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>This budget is highly inflationary The people who, in the ultimate, will be most severely and detrimentally affected by it will be the poor and those who are dependent on social welfare payments.  The increases being granted to those dependent on social welfare will be whittled away in a relatively short time because of the inflationary policy which has been adopted for the second time by the Coalition Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall begin by recalling a remark made at the end of his speech by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he said that the economic difficulties which the Government encountered shortly after their formation had solidified, united further and encouraged them as a whole, that they had come out of the experience tempered and with a better sense of unity of purpose than before.  The only apprehension I had on listening to the Minister say that was that it might lead someone to think that before these economic difficulties arose there was any lack of purpose or anything less than 100 per cent unity and solidarity in the Government in which I serve.  I base this statement not only on my observations of the Government from close quarters but because I observe also the quarters from which the criticism comes that one party or the other in the Coalition have surrendered to their partner.  When, on the one hand, we have Senator Browne saying that the Labour Party have sold out entirely <Col N="1558" /> to Fine Gael while the President of the NFA says that Fine Gael have sold out completely to Labour, I am convinced that the Coalition, as a team, are on the right road, that they are in the middle of the road and that they are holding well together.</P>
      <P>The most controversial aspect of the Minister's budget has been the drawing into the income tax net of a small proportion of Irish farmers.  I could not help but derive a certain wry satisfaction from seeing the expression on the faces of two or three Dublin Deputies in Fianna Fáil when the Minister announced his proposals in this regard.  Those of us who, like Deputies Moore and Tunney are Dublin Deputies, know that the kind of voter who puts us into office finds it difficult to understand a taxation system which deprives him of enough of his wage packet to make a serious difference to his housekeeping problems but allows a man who is comparably more prosperous to get away without making any contribution. This measure will be welcomed by city dwellers not because of any vindictive attitude towards people making a living from the land, people who may be their cousins, but because of a genuine belief that no individual ought have to carry more than his fair share of any burden.  Even the most pronounced &ldquo;jackeen&rdquo; would recognise that farmers have problems which do not affect to the same extent people in the industrial world.</P>
      <P>Farmers are at the mercy of wind and weather, of disease and of fluctuating markets.  We know that in many ways they deserve special consideration and that is something which this Government will always give them.  Urban dwellers comprise a very large and growing proportion of the Irish population.  The reasons for this are not reasons of policy on the part of this Government.  The same trend prevails throughout the world. The number of people on the land tends to decrease while the population of urban areas tends to increase. Whether that is a good or a bad trend is a question that I need not go into here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I spoke at a Fine Gael <Col N="1559" /> meeting in Navan.  The meeting was attended largely by a Fine Gael audience and, so far as I could ascertain, an audience which consisted to a large extent of people who were either engaged in farming or who had close links with the farming community. I had gone to the town to deliver a speech on the contraception Bill but, apart from listening to me politely, the audience showed no interest in that subject.  If one disregards the pressure groups on both sides in this issue, it is my opinion that the subject is of much less public interest and excitement than one might be led to suppose.  However, what was of interest to the people at that meeting was the whole question of taxation.  Having heard what a lady present had to say, I was very proud to be a member of the same party as that to which she belonged or, even, to be of the same nation as her.  She was a farmer's wife but she said to me: &ldquo;Do not go back with any idea in your mind that the farmers do not wish to pay their fair share.  Farmers are people who have pride.  They have no wish to be beggars or to be carried on the backs of anyone and they are perfectly willing to make a fair contribution towards the burden which the nation has to carry, whichever Government may be in office&rdquo;.  That lady was concerned merely that the special problems of the farmers be understood and that the degree to which they would be drawn into the tax net would be realistic and not something that would destroy them.</P>
    <P>My opinion on this matter may not be worth much but it seems to me that when allowance is made for reduction of rates and so on, the Minister in his proposals has not gone anywhere near a situation that would justify panic or even serious criticism among the farming community.  I hope that in the words of the lady to whom I have referred the farmers will receive these proposals with fair-mindedness and with pride in themselves. In the weeks leading up to the budget I did not like the noises that were being made in the name of the farmers by a prominent representative <Col N="1560" /> who warned the Government that if tax provisions were applied to farmers the Fine Gael vote would drop.</P>
    <P>That amounted to a threat to the Government that they should not draw farmers into the tax net, whether right or wrong in case we would lose votes.  If the Government had been led and said by that kind of talk it would not deserve to be here; no Government could submit to that sort of talk.  The idea that we might lose a few votes through doing the right thing&mdash;even if it were correct and I do not believe it is&mdash;is something which I hope will never frighten this Government from doing what it has decided to do.</P>
    <P>I think it was the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, who said he thought that the situation regarding building societies and mortgage interest rates had been overlooked in the budget and this, he thought, would concern many people.  He is perfectly right in thinking that mortgage interest rates and, indeed, all interest rates are of serious concern but it is only right to point out that, as he must know, the State is already underpinning the mortgage interest payers to the extent of £2 million, something I think that was never done before. I am open to correction but I think this is the case.  If the State were not putting this very large sum of money into building societies, enabling them to pay an extra 1 per cent in interest to their investors the building societies would be obliged to charge a further 1¼ per cent and their rates would be up by 1¼ per cent.  The Government are already providing that much relief. All interest rates have gone through the ceiling and 1¼ per cent seemed a bigger sum measured against the interest rates prevailing two or three or five or six years ago than when measured against today's interest rates but it is only fair to the Government to remind the Opposition and the community that the Government are already helping to the best of their ability by this device and if that Government aid did not exist mortgage interest payers would be paying a further 1¼ per cent more <Col N="1561" /> than they are already paying.  That does not mean that the Government are happy about the situation.  The whole operation of the building societies is under review and they are being encouraged to economise on expenses particularly on competitive advertising and try to keep costs down and in that way become less obliged to charge high interest rates. The Government are fully aware of the problem and need no warning from the Opposition in that regard.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on proposals for wealth tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax has been mentioned in conjunction with this budget and while I shall not discuss&mdash;it would not be relevant here&mdash;the merits of the proposals in the White Paper, I want to take up a point made in the shape of an interruption by, I think, Deputy Meaney, and which I had heard before.  The White Paper says clearly in its foreword that representations in regard to what will ultimately be legislation are not only acceptable but are invited from the public, any individual or organisation with any interest in the matter.  I have had a number of such representations which I have passed on to the Minister. Probably every Government Deputy has had them and many Opposition Deputies.</P>
    <P>Every argument or criticism or point made in regard to these proposals will be given maximum attention. I could not believe this Government would behave in any other way towards a major revolutionary change in our taxation system, but I cannot submit to the charge that the Government are in any way backtracking by saying and continuing to say that they have an open mind on this matter.  They have published outline proposals.  Something has to be put in black and white before a discussion can be started and when all the views have been heard I hope legislation will result.  To keep on saying, as we have to keep on saying, that the proposal is not in its final form is not backtracking.  To issue a White Paper on a subject like this is the right way to go about it and the wrong reaction from the Opposition is to cry panic and try to frighten people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> In fact, that happened.  In fairness to the Opposition spokesman on Finance, I do not think he came into this yet but this paper was not two days published when Deputy Haughey, who was a former Finance Minister and whose views on such matters, therefore, enjoy some regard, was in the newspaper with the cry that it was the end of private property.  That was not a responsible attitude.  He may not have intended it that way but to me it seemed very much like a deliberate attempt to create panic. If the Government had produced a Bill and pushed it through the House with closure motions and so on without listening to anybody or receiving any representations, without heeding any advice and if the net result of that Bill was to destroy private property, it would be fair enough for the Opposition to shout that private property was at an end.  That is not what happened.  A Government paper has been produced containing proposals and the Government expressly made it clear in their introduction to that White Paper that they wanted views and reactions.  If the Government had made up their mind that those proposals should go through in the exact form proposed in the White Paper there would be no need for a White Paper or to invite representations.  If the Government had their mind made up to that extent they would have produced the Bill and had it passed.</P>
    <P>I realise that Deputy Faulkner, who spoke earlier, resented the implication that the Opposition were irresponsible and trying to wreck the economy.  I quite accept&mdash;I have never known him to do anything dishonourable&mdash;that he had no such intention but panic has certainly been created in some quarters and I am inclined to lay the blame for that on the Fianna Fáil Deputy who, although no longer a spokesman, is because of his history, listened to with some attention when he speaks on financial matters.  He will have some explaining to do when the Bill on foot of this White Paper eventually reaches the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The wrong way of going about a proposal of this kind which is revolutionary, is to produce the Bill and see <Col N="1563" /> what happens, something which in my recollection Fianna Fáil did on two occasions, perhaps oftener but at least on two occasions, which nobody here will have forgotten.  One was the Succession Bill which they produced in 1963.  That Bill was an academic exercise thought up in the Department of Justice.  Some people there thought it might not be a bad idea if we had an inheritance and succession system here such as they have in some continental countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, who comically enough was Deputy Haughey at the time, was induced to come in here and present this Succession Bill which I honestly believe he had not read seriously.  It took a while for the details of the Bill to sink in because the whole question of succession is a complex legal one.  When they did sink in, the public reaction was one of absolute amazement and confusion.  It was an appalled reaction.  The Government at the time held on to this Bill and when everyone had shouted at them they climbed down and altered its provisions very substantially.  The Succession Act, 1965, is a very pale version of the Bill which was introduced in 1963.  Without going into details the Bill of 1963 made a very serious inroad into what has always been taken as a right, which is mentioned in the Constitution, of a person to decide what he will do with his own property on his death.</P>
    <P>It is comical that the man who is now shouting about an end to private property should have been the person who sponsored this attack on private property which was the most serious ever presented in this House in Bill form.  The right way to go about a reform of the succession laws is to do what this Government have done in regard to taxation.  If the then Minister for Justice had been paying attention to his job he would have put out a White Paper on succession and listened to what peole had to say.  He then would have had enough time to make up his mind which part of the proposals to go ahead with and which to water down.  He did not do that.  The Bill came here without a White Paper. <Col N="1564" /> It was revolutionary to a degree which is now perhaps forgotten.  In the end the then Government had to climb down because the people were shouting at them.</P>
    <P>The second instance came also from the Department of Justice but during the incumbency of Mr. Ó Moráin and that was in regard to the Criminal Justice Bill which was introduced in 1967.  That Bill contained a large number of proposals in regard to criminal law, some of them very far-reaching. Some were good.  It contained a series of sections prohibiting the carrying of flick-knives.  But it contained other proposals which made very heavy inroads into what were taken, up to then, to be the rights of the accused person. For example, the unanimous jury verdict which we have always had was changed to a majority verdict in criminal cases so that somebody could be convicted on the vote of ten or 12 jurors.  That never would have been proposed if the English had not made the same change.  The Republican Party at the time did not see anything unrepublican in slavishly following the English in almost everything they did, down to the seven-cornered 50p piece. That Bill caused an outcry.  Everybody who knew anything about law could see that this was the thin end of the wedge&mdash;and not all that thin but a very formidable wedge&mdash;designed to make it easy for the State not just to catch criminals but to convict accused persons.  That is a different thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The right way to go about proposals of that revolutionary kind in the criminal law is to issue a White Paper but, of course, none was forthcoming.  In the end, that Bill died the death.  The Dáil was dissolved in 1969 and that Bill was never revived. It has never been seen here since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of its provisions, the less objectionable ones, may become law in the future but the Bill as a whole has gone.  That is an example of backtracking. That is real running away.  I hope this Government will not be <Col N="1565" /> accused of this sort of thing.  The reason why I have inflicted on the House this <i>excursus</i> into the history of these two Bills is to draw attention to the conduct of the then Government who never had their match for arrogance, walking over people and never listening to what was being said to them.  That was their way of doing things.  This Government have inherited from Fianna Fáil a number of problems which they had not the guts to deal with.  It is approaching this one by means of a paper which explicitly invites representations.  When these are in, the Government will make up their minds what to do and not before, I hope that is enough on the subject of the White Paper at the moment.</P>
    <P>The proposals in it obviously have to be put down in black and white.  One cannot start a discussion in a vacuum.  One must say roughly the lines along which one is thinking.  One may even have to be specific about the lines one was thinking along.  Until that is done, no discussion can take place.  That is a different thing from making up one's mind without discussion, without consultation, without taking advice, and bringing it in in the form of a Bill.  That would be real back-tracking.  If the Government had done that and if Deputy Meaney had uttered the same criticisms of it I would not raise any objections.</P>
    <P>This Government were left with an inheritance by the last Government. Deputy Faulkner spoke about us inheriting a sound and buoyant economy and a social welfare system, the main lines of which had been laid down by his party and which we were only building on.  Nobody wants to take from Fianna Fáil the good things they did.  Deputy Faulkner's defensive tone made me suspect that he thought we were trying to deny that Fianna Fáil in their time had made advances on the social front.  It would be very strange if they had not.  They have been in power for nearly all my life.  They can scarcely expect to be thanked for having made some advances on the social front in a world where everything is moving that way in the space of a generation.  I am willing to give them that credit.</P>
    <P>But they left behind an inheritance <Col N="1566" /> not only of a certain system of social welfare, which is by no means as perfect as Deputy Faulkner thinks, but they left behind an inheritance of nettles too which they had not grasped.  That was a phrase brought into Irish politics by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, when he said that we would have to grasp nettles in regard to the North of Ireland. I do not wish to mock him because I believe that in his heart he meant the best for the North. He detested the violence there as much as we did and would have done whatever he could to stop it.  I do not question his sincerity about that.  He spoke about doing things which might be hurtful to our pride and described them as nettles which we would have to grasp.  Time moved on and Deputy Lynch left Government with his reputation unimpaired as a man who sincerely desired peace in the North of Ireland, but without a single nettle being grasped.  There is now a rank nettle bed in this country of undealt-with problems from which the previous Government ran away and which this Government will have to tackle, and in part have tackled, one by one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch never faced up to the question of the status of the North. I know it is possible to go through his speeches and analyse them and say that it amounts to this, it amounts to that and it amounts to the other. Is this not as good as saying this, that or the other?  But he never went ahead and said that.  It was left to this Taoiseach to say what the people in the North had been waiting for some Taoiseach to say for years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the late Deputy Seán Lemass who started on that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the late Deputy Lemass every credit for his realism. That is not relevant to what I am saying now.  The speech made here by Deputy J. Lynch in response to the Taoiseach a couple of weeks ago was a fine speech.  I admired him for making it.  The fact remains that that particular nettle was never <Col N="1567" /> grasped, to use the words which the Taoiseach used on that occasion.  The reason it was not grasped, I know, was the political necessity which Deputy J. Lynch experienced of holding together a party of shades varying from comfortable, golf-playing, middle-class Dublin professional men at one extreme to a penumbra of gun-hawkers.  That is the only way to put it.  It is not easy to lead a party like that.  We saw the thanks Deputy J. Lynch got for his fine speech here three weeks ago.  One of his own backbench Deputies, a man carrying a name revered in his party, stood up and dissociated himself from what his leader had said.</P>
      <P>The whole question of taxation is another such nettle.  Everyone in the country knows that the income tax code we have inherited has been creaking along and is badly in need of reform.  This reform was talked about by the previous Government but nothing was done.  The whole question of the relationship between local and central taxation was talked about, but nothing was done.  It was left to this Government to do something effective about the rates and now about the taxation structure.</P>
      <P>The Contraception Bill is another example.  I was in the Seanad and had the experience of seeing the then Senator Mullins, figuratively speaking, trample Senator Robinson underfoot, week in and week out, when she tried to have her Bill discussed. The reason given was that the Government of the day had the Bill under consideration and were going to come up with their own Bill.  They never did that.  I say that the reason they did not do it was that they had not got the guts to do it.  This Government will have to grasp nettles by the bushel and they will be stung by them.</P>

We are ploughing into ground which was left rank and covered with nettles by the outgoing Administration.  The taxation proposals may be surprising because the people had got used to nothing being done in this field.</P>
      <P>A warning has been sounded by the Opposition that money will run out of the country if the White Paper goes through in any shape or form. Anyone who is foolish enough to take his money out of the country in response to the panic statement of the Opposition will lose a lot of money. The object of the wealth tax here is to fulfil the Coalition promise to do away with death duties.  Whatever shape the wealth tax has, its object is to do away with death duties so that a man can pay them in instalments over his life.  The proper mechanism for doing that is what is under discussion at present.  We were being taunted here six weeks ago about not having abolished death duties.  I do not hear so much about them now at all.  There has not been so much taunting about them in recent weeks.</P>

It was raised this morning under the umbrella of this debate by the Leader of the Opposition who began his speech on the Financial Statement by another criticism of the way work is done here and how it is ordered by the Government.  I came into the House when I heard the Deputy on the loudspeaker.  Deputy J. Lynch raised the matter first and I would have hoped, since the matter is relevant, that I might have been allowed a little scope to say a few fairly specific things.</P>

      <P>I will deal with it in that sense.  I cannot promise, while I am grateful for that direction, that what I have to say will be all that specific.  This morning the Leader of the Opposition related the early rising of the Dáil yesterday to the closure motion on Tuesday.  I may have missed some of his remarks while I was coming from my room into the Chamber, but I understood him to ask what was all the hurry about the Constituencies Bill when we had five hours to kill yesterday evening.  So far as the ordering of the business yesterday was concerned I answered him adequately I believe but, so far as the deeper significance of what he had to say goes, what would have been the point in allocating&mdash;even if it had occurred to me which, in fact, it did not&mdash;an extra couple of hours to the <Col N="1571" /> debate on the Constituencies Bill?  We would just have had another couple of hours of fool-acting, acting the fool. That is the plain language for it.  We would have had another couple of hours of acting the fool and it would have ended in exactly the same way.</P>
      <P>Again this morning the Leader of the Opposition criticised the application of that closure motion and implied once more that the Government were doing something outrageous.  I was reminded of all the remarks made here on Tuesday by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy and others about how sparing we ought to be in using this mechanism, and how sparing Fianna Fáil had been in using it.  I think it was Deputy O'Malley who said that on one occasion under the previous Government Deputy Cruise-O'Brien came in here with a pile of dictionaries and kept the House for over six hours on the meaning of one word.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is a big enough man, I hope, not to take it ill from me if I say that, if he held up the House for six hours with dictionaries on a single word, he should have been closured. That is what the Government doing their job properly ought to have done.  I hope he will not be angry with me when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, the Leader of the Opposition had another &ldquo;go&rdquo; this morning at the application of the closure motion on Tuesday.  Its relevance, as he put it, was to the hours left vacant yesterday.  This really could have been avoided.  I disliked having to move that closure motion.  It could have been avoided had there been a convention in existence in this House, of the kind I should like Deputy Lalor and myself to develop, whereby time would be agreed for any measure. When that Bill was first introduced, if Deputy Lalor had said that they expected 50 hours, or 60 hours, or 70 hours on the Bill, I am certain he would have been accommodated.  I am not making light of the Bill.  I perfectly <Col N="1572" /> realise that it is a matter of serious concern to the Opposition and that they should have a fair chance to debate it.  The way they debated it ensured that it could not be discussed except in a disorderly way.  If the Leader of the Opposition were to be left with no ground for the complaint which he produced again this morning, the only way that could be done would be by agreement between the two sides that so many hours would be allocated to Second Stage, so many to Committee Stage, so many to Report Stage, and so on.</P>
      <P>If the Opposition&mdash;and I do not mean this aggressively&mdash;can bring themselves to do business with us, and if Deputy Lalor can bring himself to do business with me along these lines, they will not find us ungenerous in regard to the allocation of time.  We will allocate all the time in the world he wants to anything, but let us get it clear what we are doing.  Let us be businesslike and get through the business in an orderly way and not have the kind of zoo we had here last Tuesday, which brings no credit to anybody.  The Government had absolutely no option but to curtail that debate, in spite of what the Leader of the Opposition said.  At the rate of going, as I said last Tuesday, we might have been here until July with no other business done at all.  This morning another Bill arrived on the Order Paper, and I think another one will be in tomorrow or very soon.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Lalor could be authorised to do business with me, we might achieve a major revolution in the manners and methods of this House.  I am afraid that the reason why this revolution has not come about is that the English have not done it.  I am sick and tired of complaining here and elsewhere about how we always wait for the English to do something before we do it. Why cannot we move ahead of them for once?  What is so wrong, so foolish, or so impossible, about Government and Opposition, like sensible people, coming to some arrangement in regard to the allocation of time which would avoid the disagreeable scenes we had here last Tuesday, and avoid all the hours of stupid codacting which proceeded them?  The Minister had to sit and listen to deliberate, wanton rubbish coming from the far side of the House.</P>

I intended that as a jocose observation.  In fact, if you break down what this House costs in terms of hours and minutes it works out, so far as I can calculate it at something nearer £2,000 an hour than £1,000 an hour.  That item alone ought to give us, on both sides, reason to try to arrange our affairs in some more civilised and reasonable way.  I believe the public would thank and respect us for it and we would have no more reason then for the kind of complaint the Opposition felt obliged to voice&mdash; though not, I think, with much sincerity&mdash;here on Tuesday and at which the Leader of the Opposition had another bite here this morning.  I know I am not the most peaceable Member of the House myself.  I am frequently out of order and all the rest but, if the Opposition will do business with us, or with me, in <Col N="1574" /> regard to ordering the House's business effectively, efficiently, they will get all the scope they want.  Certainly there is no intention or wish on the side of anyone in Government, or supporting the Government, to reduce freedom of speech or to closure anybody.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the Parliamentary Secretary with great interest.  No people are more anxious than ourselves to carry on the business of this House in a constructive way and to get Bills through quickly. But the Parliamentary Secretary will have to realise that we lost time last night&mdash;let there be no doubt about it &mdash;through the failure of the Government in ordering business.  We lost almost five hours during which time we could have been debating something. This was for the simple reason that the Government did not put down their Motions Nos. 5, 6, 7 or 8. Had the motions been agreed to or put, we would then have discussed them.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary tried to be very serious when dealing with what the House is costing.  But let that be in the past and let it not happen again.  Let us have a full House at all times.  In the last fortnight as well we had the experience of the House winding up one night, I think, at 8.30 p.m. and there was an adjournment in the middle of another day for a couple of hours through lack of business ordered.</P>

      <P>Anyway, I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary is doing his best.  He is probably a better educated man than a lot of us but the point is that all men are equal here. When the Parliamentary Secretary learns that, he will realise that one cannot dictate to parties in this Dáil. All men are equal and business has to be conducted on a general agreement between the parties.  I shall not say any more about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a contribution from the Parliamentary Secretary and from the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this budget.  I should like first to go back to what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said.  One thing struck me very forcibly and that was that he quoted from newspapers.  Fair enough, that is the general procedure in the House.  But then he started to sort out the newspapers, as between hostile ones and friendly ones.  That is a very bad line of discussion to take and something which should not happen. He started to quote from this paper and that paper all matters that were favourable to the Government on the budget they introduced.  It is the right of the papers to praise or to criticise the budget as they think fit.  They have whole-time men employed on financial matters; they have whole-time correspondents in the Dáil every day.  It ill behoves any Minister to stand up and describe any paper as hostile or friendly.  There is freedom of speech in the newspapers in this country.  The <Col N="1576" /> Parliamentary Secretary said some time ago how freedom of speech should operate.  I resented what he said, as I resented what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies can go back and check what he said.  But I merely want to answer what he had to say lest anybody reading the newspapers later would think it was all one way traffic.  The papers praised and criticised the budget as they saw fit.  He has included in the Official Report all the praise for the budget.  I, on behalf of the Opposition, am going to include some of the criticism of the budget for the Official Report.</P>
      <P>There was one in <i>The Irish Times</i>, on page one, where there is a heading: &ldquo;Boost to Inflation rather than growth?&rdquo; That is criticism.  There is said, on page 16:</P>
      <P>On the other hand the fact that Mr. Ryan has done nothing that will help lower interest rates in general or improve the position of building societies in particular will not help private housebuilders,....</P>
      <P>That, to me, is criticism as well.  On page 9 there is further discussion of the budget and, at the end of the discussion, there are tables of the various allowances for single people, married couples and so on.  Two people writing in that paper actually come to the conclusion that the tax system still discriminates against marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise I shall quote a few from <i>The Irish Independent.</i> The first one <Col N="1577" /> appears on page one where it is referred to as &ldquo;a gambler's budget&rdquo;. There is mention of &ldquo;Gamble No. 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gamble No. 2&rdquo;.  Then we shall go to the back page and see the heading: &ldquo;Accountants say it's a false picture&rdquo;. Lower down on that page there is a heading: &ldquo;No move on rising food prices&rdquo;.  Also on the same page one can see the heading: &ldquo;ICTU: Reserved approval&rdquo; and a further one reading: &ldquo;Furious farmers say: `It's unfair!' &rdquo; That is criticism of the budget.  I want a balanced report in the Official Report against what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said.</P>
    <P>As far as I could see the Minister made a personal attack on Deputy Colley because Deputy Colley seemed to drive home some very sore points to the Minister last night.  When he mentioned many matters the Minister seemed to have a very thin skin.  The Minister is trying to say that Fianna Fáil are against taxation of any kind. He is trying to say that Fianna Fáil want the rich to get away with everything. We do not, and we want to make that quite clear.  He asked us where we stood.  We all know that taxation has to be imposed.  We all know that taxation, which many of us dislike, will probably fall on us.  But we as a party have always said, and I hope the House will agree, that when a person or company is taxed their ability to pay should be taken into consideration.  There were matters being raised here by the Government, likely to become law, and to which we objected on the grounds that there was no reference whatsoever to the ability of people to pay.  One has to impose taxation but, at all times one has to consider the ability of people to pay it and what benefits may accrue to them.</P>
    <P>This budget brought in by the Coalition Government is a very strange one, if you like, and apparently it can be considered, as one paper said, as a gambler's budget.  Let there be no doubt about that.  The Minister has gone for a huge deficit.  He is hoping that things will sort themselves out all right by the end of the year.  He is hoping that late 1974 and the first quarter of 1975 will yield excellent <Col N="1578" /> financial returns to him.  We do not know whether or not that will happen.</P>
    <P>Everybody was hoping that this budget would help to revitalise the economic growth of the country which has come to a complete standstill.  Everybody was hoping and particularly the recipients of social welfare, that they would get allowances comparable to the rate of inflation with which they have had to cope since this Government took office and which will strike at them very hard again during the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>This was a budget which was introduced by a Government knowing that they had not to provide subsidies for agricultural produce, no more than they had last year.  Fianna Fáil believed in our entry to the EEC; so did Fine Gael, but Labour opposed it completely.  There is no mention whatsoever of the sparing of those subsidies.  If provision had to be made this year, out of central funds, for the subsidisation of agricultural produce, at the present time it would take at least £40 million or £50 million, or perhaps, £70 million.  When we entered the EEC, not alone was there money coming in from the EEC fund itself, even though we had to pay money into that fund, but also there was this money on hand.  There is no good anybody trying to say that this money disappeared because that is not the way it works.  This money was on hand.  That is why the Government should have been able to give more to the recipients of social welfare. This budget was part also of the national wage agreement.  This did not happen in the past.  The workers rejected the first proposal for a national wage agreement&mdash;this was their democratic right&mdash;but they accepted the second proposal.  However it was in their minds that there would be liberal increases in the personal income tax allowances.  That did not happen, as I shall show when I am dealing with the various matters in the budget.</P>
    <P>The workers have been let down. The fact that the budget was part of the national wage agreement made it a rather peculiar budget.  The increases <Col N="1579" /> in the tax allowances were forced on the Government because the workers made it plain that they would not accept a package deal. Fianna Fáil believe we should have wage agreements, that there should be orderly wage development.  At the conclusion of the last wage agreement the workers were looking forward to getting fairly large tax-free allowances; in fact, many people wanted a reform of the income tax system.  We have had a partial reform but it has completely militated against the man in the lower income bracket.</P>
    <P>The budget was introduced in a situation where our trading deficit is much larger than 12 months ago.  In addition, the national loan was not fully subscribed.  This money will not be obtained easily because the world monetary market is unsettled.  The Minister is taking a very big risk in budgeting for such a large deficit. Where will he get the money?  He has told us he is depending on several factors but it is doubtful that he will succeed.  However only time will tell. But as the growth rate will be reduced considerably it is difficult to see how he can obtain the money in the country. The question arises whether it is a budget for the local elections.  Is it trying to put across to people in big black print that they are getting everything but will have to pay nothing?  It is all right to read the big headings but when they read the small print they will see they are not much better off and that in a short time inflation will swallow up any benefits given in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is beginning to learn a little.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said a short time ago that they would not backtrack in any way.  I would dispute that statement.  Since the last budget we have put forward our views on many matters to the Minister for Finance.  He has now abolished the famous clawback of the children's allowances and we welcome the change.  He should never have introduced such a proposal.  He has realised his mistake, although he would not admit it during the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1580" /> In the last budget the Minister tried to punish the small investors.  He wanted to include for income tax purposes any money made from lodgments in savings banks.  The provision regarding the first £70 being free of income tax was to be abolished in the last budget but public opinion was so strongly against it the Minister was forced to change his mind within two or three months.  We pointed out this fact to the Minister but he would not listen to what we said.  We shall be bringing many matters to his attention and we hope he will listen to them.  It is in the interest of the country that we have a properly balanced budget, that the growth of the economy is continued and that we have more employment.  It is our job as an Opposition to criticise where we think it necessary.  It is important that the right thing be done and be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach referred to the White Paper on capital gains and wealth taxes. Whether he likes it or not, the fact is that money has flowed from the country at an unprecedented rate.  We do not want to see this happen.  We need our money here, not to have it reinvested abroad.  This has happened and nothing the Minister says will convince people otherwise.</P>
    <P>The document issued should not have been called a White Paper; it would be better described as a discussion paper.  A White Paper means something very definite, where one is on the verge of introducing legislation. The White Paper was issued as a result of the establishment of a Government subcommittee.  It was a foolish move to label the document a White Paper; the proposals should have been regarded as the work of a discussion group.  No matter what is said, millions of pounds have gone from this country and they are not likely to return in the near future.</P>
    <P>Our balance of payments situation is causing concern and it is deteriorating each year.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will make everybody here fed up if he starts groaning again about the energy crisis and the Arabs.  Everything is blamed on them.  We realise there are <Col N="1581" /> problems in this area but the energy crisis cannot be blamed for everything. There is much more involved. We must put our own house in order and it is the duty of the Government to take the necessary steps even though they may be unpopular.</P>

      <P>I have read them often enough.  What I have stated is the opinion of many economists in the country.  The Government are willing to let the situation roll on, hoping it will rectify itself.  They hope nothing will happen before the local elections in June.  They do not care what happens as long as they get as many members as possible elected next June.  That is bad government. It may be good politically for their parties but it will cost the country dearly and we will lose much of our credibility abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the last budget the national loan was launched but it was not completely filled.  In the past we have regarded the national loan as a gauge of what the people think of the Government of the day.  The last loan was a dismal failure, less than one-third of the money Fianna Fáil could have got was invested by the public.  This showed a lack of confidence by the people, most of whom were small investors. The result was that there was a shortfall of money.  Is the Minister going to float a national loan this year and, if so, on what terms?  On the last occasion the Minister extended the closing date for subscriptions.  He said this was because of disruption on the world monetary market.  That was fair enough but he tried to give better terms.  It is the duty of the Government to see that they get sufficient money but they did not persuade the Irish people to subscribe to the loan. <Col N="1582" /> There was a great difference when Fianna Fáil were in office.  At all times and in all circumstances the national loan was oversubscribed. Probably the Minister does not want to hear about this.  It is something that he omitted, as far as I can see, in his budget speech.</P>

      <P>The actual grant offered to any particular industry will, of course, be related to the Industrial Development Authority's estimate of the quality of the industry and the benefits it offers to the country and the region.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, Listowel is a designated area in which a higher range of incentives is available.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the Industrial Development Authority is at present in touch with several companies who are interested in the Listowel area.  I would emphasise, however, that discussions are at a very preliminary stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the present system of examining the credentials of grant-aided industries being established in this country; and if he is satisfied that the present system is adequate to ensure protection for the taxpayers and the employees of such industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the Industrial Development Authority makes a thorough investigation of the credentials of promoters seeking grant <Col N="1583" /> aid for the establishment of industries in this country.</P>
      <P>This examination which involves direct inquiries through the authority's overseas offices, inquiries through banks and specialist agencies and an analysis of company accounts, gives information on the promoters' financial standing, commercial history and current operations and on their general background and status.  I am satisfied that the present system meets the requirements specified by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it right that his Department should have power to scrutinise the accounts of industries establishing themselves here, industries which have been given State grants to enable them to do so, to ensure there will be no danger of these industries closing down, as happened in Tuam last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy may not quite understand the procedure. First, the IDA is an agency of my Department.  Secondly, a very senior member of my staff is on the board of the IDA so that any industrial project comes to him in that capacity.  Thirdly, over the £350,000 threshold all IDA decisions in regard to grants come to the Government through me and they, therefore, reach the Department for scrutiny in that way.  Fourthly, at any time the accounts of the company are available to my Department if we seek them.  Finally, there are occasional bad risks.  There are occasional firms which get money and the investment does not turn out as everyone hoped it would, but it is fair to say, and it is fair to say across political boundaries, in regard to the best as well as the worst, that these are very few. The Industrial Development Authority is very skilled at spotting the bad risk and I understand that, in comparison with industrial agencies in other countries, we back far fewer losers than most others and I have said to the IDA that I would rather run the risk of backing the very odd loser because, if one says to a man <Col N="1584" /> that he must never make a mistake, one inhibits him so much he cannot act creatively.  I am rather pleased with the record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the charges being made by the ESB in respect of the connection of electricity supply to new houses; if he regards these charges as price increases; and if they have been authorised by the National Prices Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, apart from areas in which the rural electrification scheme has been completed, there has been no change in the system operated by the ESB under which a contribution is required for the connection of electricity supply to new houses where the revenue expected from the new consumer would be insufficient to remunerate the capital involved in the connection of supply.  I also understand that the ESB have no standard charge for such connections, each case being examined independently by reference to the capital cost and the likely revenue.</P>
      <P>In areas where the rural electrification scheme has been completed, charges may now arise for the connection of supply to new houses, as a Government subsidy is no longer available in such areas for this work.</P>
      <P>The question of referring these ESB charges to the National Prices Commission does not, therefore, arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is discrimination as between the areas in which rural electrification has been completed and those areas in which it has not?  In the event of a man building a house in one of the latter areas this charge is a substantial burden on him and in very many cases it reduces the Local Government grant to which he is entitled on his new house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking me to comment on matters that do not arise from the question and are <Col N="1585" /> not properly the concern of my Department. I would say, however, that a scheme like this involves the transfer of wealth from one sector of the economy to another.  If a man has electricity going in three miles to his house and is not chargeable then, in the end, someone else pays.  The public pay.  There is no automatic creation of the money required to do this kind of thing.  A great deal of public money has been spent on rural electrification and the Deputy should recognise that what he is now asking for is, in fact, a very significant subsidy in continuation of the very major subsidies that have already been paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be under a misconception here.  I am referring to a new house not three miles distant from any source of supply to houses adjacent where substantial charges are being made. Could the Minister state, first of all, how long this charge applies, whether it has been of a set standard for the whole period and on what basis is it computed?  As a result of the queries I come across I cannot figure out how a charge for a particular house can be compared with a charge for another house.</P>

      <P>A proposal to build a new vocational school in Ringsend to replace the existing boys vocational school there and Mount Street was delayed because the City of Dublin VEC were unable to obtain a site.  It was then decided to build a new school on the existing site at Cambridge Road.  It is now proposed by the VEC to cater for girls at the new school.  This question was not raised or examined during discussions on the original proposal but it is now being examined in the context of the possible closing down of the girls' vocational school at Shelbourne Road.  When these examinations have been completed there will not be any undue delay.</P>

In addition, the Gardaí wear Scotchlite belts.  There are extra advance warning signs on order.  I am aware that in relation to what was possibly the last accident to occur on the road to which the Deputy refers, these warning signs were all in position and were working but despite this a further vehicle approaching, ignored the signs and caused further damage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the need to increase the sum of £1,000 payable in respect of mental stress under the Civil Liability Act, 1961; and the action he intends to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the appropriate limit of damages for mental distress is a complex one and, while I do not exclude the possibility of introducing legislation that would provide for an increase, I have no proposals to do so at present nor would I do so without the benefit of the views of experienced practitioners and others qualified to express an informed view as to the various implications of such a change.  I may add that when the upper limit of £1,000 was fixed in the 1961 Act, this was envisaged as a limit that contained a substantial allowance for future inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made reference to the views of experienced practitioners and others and he has not excluded the possibility of introducing legislation to deal with the subject matter of my question.  Can the Minister say whether, as a matter of urgency, he will seek the views of these practitioners in dealing with this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not seek the views of practitioners because I do <Col N="1596" /> not accept that the question of the raising of this limit is a matter of urgency.  This idea of the acknowledgement of grief is a comparatively new standard of compensation in our code.  As the Deputy is aware, damages are paid normally for loss or personal injury.  The question of the acknowledgement of grief is something that we imported from Scottish law&mdash;the idea of <i>solatium</i> which came, presumably, from Roman law.  It has always been held in Scottish law that this type of acknowledgement of grief was something to be measured in hundreds rather than in thousands but the Deputy will know from experience that in this country the awarding of damages under this head usually involves the maximum because there are matters of considerable emotion involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if the committee of inquiry into the Littlejohn escape from Mountjoy Prison, Dublin on 11th March, 1974, has reported to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already announced, I have received a report of the investigation and I am considering it.</P>
      <P>Since I made that statement, an interview with Littlejohn has been published by the BBC&mdash;and rebroadcast by RTE&mdash;and I have publicly confirmed that his account of the route of his escape up to the time he disappeared from the view of the prison officers appears to be substantially accurate.</P>
      <P>The report which I have received is a detailed one reflecting the complexity of the problems posed in a prison where it is necessary to try to harmonise two conflicting requirements, namely security and a human regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> At this point, three broad conclusions may be stated:</P>
    <P>First, no shadow of evidence has been found to suggest that there was any collusion between any member of the prison staff and either of the escaping prisoners, or any kind of plot involving outsiders.</P>
    <P>Second, there was a combination of unfortunate failures on the part of a number of prison staff&mdash;a small number, but not just one.  These failures were of a nature that must result in disciplinary action, the precise extent of which I have not yet determined. In fairness, I have to take account of a number of factors, including the pressures to which prison staff have been subjected in the last year in determining the disciplinary action but it will be significant.  In accordance with established practice and taking account of the fact that the officers concerned will not be able to state their case in public, I do not envisage making any more detailed or specific statement about disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>The third point I wish to make is that it appears from the investigation that the escape was entirely attributable in fact to the failures I have just mentioned and not to any physical deficiencies in the prison or to any deficiencies in the organisation.  Nevertheless, these aspects of the matter are being looked at thoroughly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry) Richard Barry">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dublin area there are 4,250 general hospital beds available for acute treatment and of those 3,630 were, on average, occupied daily according to the statistics for 1971-72. This represents an average occupancy of 85 per cent.  In that year the number of in-patients treated in these hospitals was 84,219.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital services in Dublin are in general adequate to deal as in-patients with the numbers of patients who are acutely ill.  What has given rise to recent difficulties is the growing volume of accident and emergency <Col N="1607" /> work and the impact this has, not only on the working of accident and emergency departments, but also on the availability of beds for planned patient admissions not in the accident or emergency classification.  An indication of the pace of increase in the volume of accident and emergency work is given by the figures for patients brought to the hospital casualty departments by the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service. These rose from 520 in 1964 to 1,184 in 1972.  Only a proportion of such patients would however require to be admitted as in-patients.</P>
    <P>Various steps for easing this problem have been taken.  As I told the Dáil in reply to the Deputy's question of 6th February, an improved and extended casualty department in Jervis Street is being built.  Saint Laurence's Hospital and James Connolly Hospital have been brought into the accident service.  In addition 40 extra back-up beds for adults have been made available in the Orthopaedic Hospital, Clontarf, and other beds are likely to be provided in the near future.</P>
    <P>A feature of the Dublin general hospital situation which makes it very difficult to cope with this problem of the volume of unplanned emergency admissions, side by side with planned admissions, is the large number of relatively small hospital units.  Proposals have been made for the reorganisation of the Dublin hospitals into a small number of larger units.  I am considering the comments made on those proposals and I hope to make an announcement fairly soon.</P>

I am told that the majority of local authorities, including Kildare County Council, accept the gross income of the applicant and spouse for the 12 months prior to the date of application as the basis for determining eligibility.  It is only where they apply before they start the job and have an income built up working overtime for the purposes of getting enough money to start building or alternatively they wait until a wage increase occurs and apply sometimes before the job is finished that they could be caught, Normally, the local authority have the right to determine the matter themselves.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The new legislation on the Order Paper, which will be introduced after Easter, will not solve the problem Deputy Moore is talking about.  There is no legislation proposed which will, in fact, make building societies loan money at a rate which would, as they say themselves, put them out of business.  This is an entirely different matter.  I do not want the House to be confused about this particular matter.  One of the side effects might be that building societies might be able to have a marginal reduction in their expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that because borrowers are experiencing undue delay in getting money certain builders in Dublin are increasing the price of a house&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that they quoted a fixed price&mdash;by, in some cases, up to £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Builders cannot increase the price of houses because there has been a delay in the payment of loans. If the houses have been completed and they have their certificate of value they cannot get a certificate of increased value on the basis that they are waiting for building societies or any other finance.  They will have to think of a better excuse than that. They will have to have a very good reason to allow them to increase the <Col N="1616" /> cost.  If Deputy Tunney has any case in mind where this has been done for that reason I would be very grateful to him if he would bring the matter to my notice because I can do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people with very limited means who have been faced with two increases of interest rates on their mortgages within the past year are now finding the strain almost unbearable? Does he not think he should have some legislation introduced that would tie this interest rate to a reasonable figure and not remove the subsidy and throw them to the mercy of the building societies again?  Can the Minister do this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained it is not just possible to do that.  There is no financial body which will borrow money and re-lend it at a lower rate than they can afford.  This is what the building societies would have to do if this House insisted that they should loan money at a fixed rate of interest. It would not allow them to pay an interest rate to encourage borrowers to place money with them.  As it stands the building societies, I am quite sure, must be finding it difficult to compete with the high rates of interest which are being paid by other financial houses.  I do not want to give anyone the impression that it is possible just by passing an Act in this House to reduce the rates which are being paid by people who want to build houses and who have to borrow money.</P>

If the Deputy can say where the necessary money would be found for what is being asked by some people I should like to hear it.  If the subsidy was increased it would add another 3 per cent, another £6 million, but I could find better ways of spending that money than subsidising the building societies.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Moore</b> asked the Minister for Finance if a decision has yet been taken on the reported proposals of the Building Societies Association whereby a more permanent method of relieving the burden on borrowers might be devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As recently announced the Government have decided to maintain, for a further period, the subsidy to building societies which was introduced in May, 1973 at an annual cost to the Exchequer of £2 million.  This subsidy enables the societies to reduce interest to borrowers to a rate 1¼ per cent below what it would otherwise be.  Building societies and their depositors also enjoy valuable tax concessions.  These are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  exemption from corporation profits tax&mdash;the White Paper on Company Taxation proposes to give this statutory sanction.</P>
      <P>(b)  interest free of tax in the hands of shareholders and depositors.</P>
      <P>(c)  a composite rate of income tax payable by the societies in respect of interest paid to their shareholders and depositors on investments up to £15,000.  This rate is only 70 per cent of the standard rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  for purposes of sur-tax assessments interest paid to shareholders and depositors is based on the tax free <Col N="1622" /> amounts and not as in other cases on the gross amounts.</P>
    <P>I have decided that the grant of the further concessions requested by the association would not be warranted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me, first of all, thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Has the Minister received any proposals from the Building Societies Association that they would do something themselves in this respect?  There was some report published on this; they have submitted something to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the report to which the Deputy is referring is one which I saw myself in the newspapers to the effect that they had made representations that they, of their own volition, would do something.  At the time the report was published nothing had been received by the Minister for Finance.  Subsequently the Minister for Finance received a request that certain further tax concessions be given but there was no proposal at all that the building societies themselves would do anything.  The situation is not simple. If you give further advantageous treatment to any particular credit agency, it means that you draw away money from some other agency.  The result is that you only start off unnecessary and undesirable movements of money from one agency to another.  These concessions the building societies are getting are greater than are given to any other agency that collects money, and I think in the circumstances we would not be warranted in giving any more at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that it is the borrowers who get the concessions, not the building societies? Is he satisfied that there is no necessity to increase these concessions in view of the rising cost of money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the cost of money is rising.  In fact, the cost of money is 4 per cent higher than it was this time last year, but we are not immune to this international disease of high interest rates; there are some international agencies which are saying the rates of interest should be even higher.  At a meeting of the Council of <Col N="1623" /> Ministers in the EEC recently a new 11th commandment was being urged upon us, that interest rates should be high.  I protested vehemently that this was quite unsuitable to Ireland's requirements or, indeed, to the requirements of any developing country.  We are endeavouring to keep the interest rates as low as possible, and this will continue to be our policy.  As I say, the building societies&mdash;when I say &ldquo;building societies&rdquo; I mean the movement&mdash;enjoy concessions.  These concessions work to the benefit of the investor who is getting a real return of 12.3 per cent on the money lent with a building society, and the borrowers are getting benefit also because of this and also because of the subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the effect to which the withdrawal of this subsidy will have on intending borrowers, can the Minister say if he has any other scheme in mind whereby he can give compensatory support to them in the matter of housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong to assume that the subsidy is going to be withdrawn at any particular stage. We have said that the situation is being carefully watched all the time. The great desire we all have is for interest rates to fall.  If interest rates fell to the level at which they were last year, it would be difficult to justify the continuation of the subsidy at all. However, the situation will be looked at from time to time, and we shall give such help as we believe is warranted by the situation.</P>
      <P>May I also mention, because I think it is often overlooked, that the majority of borrowers from building societies are subject to income tax and the interest they pay on their borrowings is set off against their income tax liability.  Therefore, they do not have to carry the full rate of interest.  The Exchequer comes to their assistance.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Financial Statement made by the Minister for Finance on 3rd April, 1974.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm to scrutinise the increases given to various categories and the various benefits that accrue from the changes in the income tax system.  Many of these are contained in &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.  Many Members of the Government parties cannot truthfully say over the weekend that they have done a great job or that the Minister for Finance did a great job in this budget.  I have no doubt that when the recipients of these benefits look at the small print and read between the lines they will find that they are not a bit better off and any who are will find within a very short time that inflation will have completely eroded the increases on benefits they will have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to detain the House a few moments to look at the present position as regards increases.  The old age contributory pension is to be increased by £1.30.  It will be only £8.50 per week.  At present this is not very much to enable anybody to exist.  It will not get them very far.  This is sad <Col N="1627" /> in view of the fact that they have contributed to this pension through the years.  Many of them have been insured and paying for social welfare stamps for 40 or 45 years.  At the end of their time some of them will get nothing but the pension and will have to accept it.  If they live on their own they will have a meagre £8.50 a week.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have increased this pension much more.  He has increased the contributory pension by £1.30 and the old age non-contributory and the blind pension by only £1.15. These pensions will be drawn by ordinary human beings who must live. You cannot explain to an old age non-contributory pensioner who gets only £7.30 how his neighbour, a contributory pensioner, gets £8.50.  He will say that he must have light, fuel, food and clothes and live just the same as his neighbour.  The gap is growing yearly. The increase in the contributory section was £1.30.  The Minister should have brought the figure up to at least £10 and that would enable him to bring the non-contributory pension up to £9 or £9.50.  Even that would not be enough.  On £7.30, with the present rate of inflation there is no hope of such people surviving.  They are at present in a sad state.  While the Minister is providing £100,000 to investigate poverty, I think he can see real poverty in an old age non-contributory pensioner trying to live on £7.30 a week on his own.  He cannot live on it. The Minister should have realised that and increased the figure by at least a couple of pounds.</P>
    <P>Even in the case of the contributory pensioner, while Deputies will talk of the great job they have done, what is the pension when you have contributed all your life to the pension fund and find when you reach retirement or pension age you will get only £8.50 a week?  I should like note to be taken of the help given to dependent relatives.  I see that persons with adult dependants under 68 years of age in the case of non-contributory old age pensioners will get between them only £10.95.  Many young girls had to leave employment in the city or country, employment which provided good <Col N="1628" /> jobs with security for the future, to go home to care for an aged father or mother.  By doing so they lost all pension rights in most cases and also lost unemployment benefit and assistance because they could not present themselves for employment.  The dependent relative allowance is much too low I daresay the £4.80 here refers to that category.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it does not include all those people.  There are many small farms where a man is trying to eke out a living with ten or 12 milch cows. His aged mother is there.  His sister has to give up her employment in the Civil Service and she is debarred from receiving the dependant relative allowance because it is considered that there is another wage-earner in the house. I earnestly appeal to the Minister to look with special sympathy on such cases.  He would do a good day's work if he enlarged the category of those included among dependant relatives. Also, I think the £4.80 benefit for a young person at present is not a great encouragement to him or her to leave employment and come home to mind an old person.  The benefit of £4.80 is not much encouragement for young people to leave their jobs and go home to mind old people.  An old person in poor circumstances may finally end up in a county home, hospital or institution. This is very sad.  The cost of maintenance for that person would run to about £30 to £40 a week.  To give more than £4.80 to a person to care for the aged would be a much better proposition.</P>
    <P>The disabled person's maintenance allowance was increased by £1.10.  This is very little because the rate is still only £7 a week.  A large number of those people in receipt of this allowance cannot do very much for themselves. Some of them are living with others but there are cases of people living alone where home assistance, as supplied by the local authorities, is needed to supplement their income. The sum of £7 is not enough.  Some of them, who are partially disabled, can go out to meet friends and get help from them to meet the necessities of life.  The majority of those in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowances are unfit for work.  They cannot <Col N="1629" /> maintain themselves on the small sum of £7 which is being provided for them from July, 1974.  What these people are receiving is very small when one thinks of the large savings which accrued from our entry to the EEC.  Savings on subsidies for agriculture alone are very high.  It is sad that all that money has not gone in reality to the people who deserve it and for whom we should care.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances are to help people to rear their families.  The Minister insulted these people when he offered them 30p a month.  The normal month has 30 days.  Therefore, the increase is 1p a day.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made great hay out of the fact that children's allowances are higher here than in Britain.  That is no boast.  We do not want to compare our family life with that of Great Britain.  He wept for the mother with one to eight children.  I hope he will do the same when a certain other Bill comes up here.  It is no boast to compare family life in Ireland with that in Great Britain where contraceptives are freely available, where there is divorce and abortion.</P>

      <P>The changes in the income tax code militate completely against the man in the lower income bracket.  The man in the higher income bracket will gain more than the man who is getting less than half his salary.  It militates against the married allowance.  The Government <Col N="1630" /> said that they have a social conscience and that they are on the right road towards socialism.  If they look at their leaflets they will see that it militates against the man in the lower income bracket.  A married man without a family if he is earning £1,750 will gain £39.47 a year.  If he earns £250 more he will gain £40.10.  This is a small increase of 54p.  This is a ridiculous situation.  A married man with three children&mdash;let us call him a typical Irishman and I hope he will remain so&mdash;if he is earning £2,000 a year, as a result of the Minister's budget proposals, his tax saving will be £41.40.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were taken by ratio, where a man earns £3,000 his tax savings would be approximately £63.  Under this budget, that man will have a saving of £179.  On an income of £10,000 compared with one of £2,000, there should be a saving of five times that on the £2,000. Instead of that, there will be a saving of £41.40 on the £2,000 income and £320.70 on the £10,000 income.  Everybody can see from these figures that the tax code is loaded against the man in the lower income bracket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Great play was made of the fact that the child's allowance has been increased to £200.  Once again, let us take the average man with three children.  When we do away with the earned income relief he is now left with children's allowances of £600.  Before the budget he <Col N="1631" /> had £500, so in reality his gain is only £100.  People who accepted the wage agreement will not accept this as the second bite of the cherry.  A single man earning £800 a year will be better off by £27.35.  I am sure he did not realise he would be getting such a small saving because this budget is part and parcel of the wage agreement. The workers would not have signed the agreement if they had not expected a bonanza in regard to income tax under this budget.  A man earning £1,000 will be better off by £27.85.  That is equivalent to 50p a week.  He expected more than that because he knows, and I know, that 50p will not go very far. The Minister has made a mistake by not being more lenient with those people.  They have the right to vote on another wage agreement.  If this House want national wage agreements to carry on it is only right that there should be orderly wage agreements to help the economy of the country.  This is not likely if the Minister has misled them in regard to the wage agreement with the promises which he made about the budget.  The people thought they were going to get something good. They are in for a rude awakening.</P>
      <P>Farmers are going to come within the income tax net.  I listened today to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who said he was glad they were in.  He said he thought not enough of them were brought into the net.</P>

      <P>The present Government have done nothing to rectify the position.  No incentive has been given to people to stay on the land.  Too often industries are stopped from coming to rural areas.  I am not blaming the Government, but I am dissatisfied about events in my own part of the country.  Industries have been prevented from coming to my rural area on the borders of Cork, Limerick and Kerry.  There are people there who are willing to work but they never get industries.  The opportunities are not being given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad to see rural Ireland being denuded of people.  We should have no doubts about our policies in the matter.  Efforts should be made to keep the people on the land.  Farmers in general will now come within the income tax net.  The Minister said so in his Financial Statement.  I know that there were two schools of thought within the Government on that point. One group held that no farmers should be taxed.  There was another school of thought, led by Deputy B. Desmond, that farmers with valuations of over £20 should be taxed.  That was a ridiculously low amount.  Shame on a man who came from rural Ireland to be fighting for that.  It will go down in history that the Minister introduced farm taxation.  The Minister could quietly have said that he was going to introduce taxation on farmers with a valuation of over £100 but he deliberately referred to a Commission on Income Taxation and said that they recommended that a gradual changeover should be made to a system of assessment based on actual profits to apply at first only to those with holdings of £100 valuation and more.  Why did the Minister refer to that paragraph from that commission's report? <Col N="1635" /> It was the Minister's idea to bring in this taxation and then to work down until the smallest holder in the country was taxed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This committee also recommended that if income tax was introduced it should be introduced instead of rates.  As we all know, rates on private or public property and land take no account of a person's ability to pay.  The Minister made no reference to whether these people will be derated.  He says 9,000 farmers will pay income tax in the first year, out of 170,000.  The fact that it will apply to people with valuations of £100 and over signifies to me that Deputy Desmond is having his way.  The small farmer has gone through a very tough time in the past 12 months.  He depended on the pig industry and what he could do in his yard to supplement his income.</P>

      <P>That has gone completely and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has acknowledged it.  Since the last budget the Government have done away with the subsidy on fertilisers although, under the EEC regulations, they could have been maintained.  Fertilisers were never dearer than they are now.  They were hoarded over the winter.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce neglected to do his duty and stop the hoarding of fertilisers.  Since last year the price has jumped by 70 per cent per ton but <Col N="1636" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce slipped up on his duty and allowed people to hoard fertilisers until the price was raised to an astronomical figure to the small farmers.  Everybody will agree that the farmers have had a couple of good years, but this year is disastrous.</P>
      <P>In the first two-and-a-half or three months of the year milk production is down by three million gallons.  Up to St. Patrick's Day last year, 24 million gallons of milk were supplied to Irish creameries.  That figure dropped to approximately 21 million gallons this year.  That is a sign that the farmer's income is on the way down.  When the Government introduce taxation it should not be done loosely or without a great deal of thought.  They should know what they are doing.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Relief will be provided in the case of farmers the rateable valuation of whose land only slightly exceeds £100 and steps will be taken to guard against avoidance of liability by the fragmentation of holdings so as to bring the rateable valuation below £100.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious matter.  The Minister will have to explain at what time of his life may a farmer divide his farm between his sons.  If the valuation of his farm is £110, at what time of his life can he say: &ldquo;I will give an even divide between my two oldest sons and their valuations will be £54 each&rdquo;?  The Minister has said that he will take steps to guard against avoidance of liability.  The farmer does not want to avoid liability.  Does a young man have to be married?  Does he have to be 21 years of age?  I should like the Minister to explain this.  The net has now been cast and I hope he will not run the small farmers completely out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit from the banks is almost nil at present for agricultural or industrial purposes.  As a rural man, this was brought home to me during the past 12 months.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation were doing an excellent job in providing finance for farmers to build up their holdings.  They entered on a huge expansion scheme in the <Col N="1637" /> knowledge that they would have enough money to give to the Irish farmers. All the economists and agriculturalists will tell you that Irish farming needs an injection of £100 million capital over the next ten years to enable our farmers to compete with their European counterparts.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister allowed £35 million to be lent by the ACC and, as the year went on, he added £10 million to that.  This year it is levelled off at £45 million, whereas what the agricultural community need is £100 million to bring their farms up-to-date and enable them to compete in Europe. Where will the other £55 million come from?  It will not come from the banks because the Government have almost denuded the banks of the money they had.  Bank managers are not giving money to farmers nowadays.  I hear that from my neighbours.  I know it myself because I am not a wealthy man.  What will the ACC do with the big expansionist programme they had in hands?  They were able to go abroad and raise a huge loan within the past 12 months but the Government stepped in and stopped them.  That has not come to light publicly.  The Government may deny it but it is a fact.  As the man said: &ldquo;I know what I am talking about because I have it from the horse's mouth.&rdquo; They should be allowed to go abroad and raise whatever money they want at a reasonable rate to give to the Irish farmers to build up their holdings.</P>
    <P>The question of housing is very near and dear to us all.  There is no incentive in this budget for a private individual to build his own house.  There is no help in regard to the mortgage rate to the building societies.  No reference is made to money being provided to increase the housing grants.  No mention is made of increasing the qualifying income limit for grants and loans. The Minister made a slip in not including that.  Housing costs have rocketed. The price of timber has risen by 110 or 120 per cent within the past 13 months and most of it comes from abroad.  The price of housing has risen out of all proportion.</P>
    <P>We may talk about trying to control the price of housing land but young <Col N="1638" /> people are failing to build their own houses because prices have gone out of bounds.  The Minister should think about this seriously because all public representatives believe that as many people as possible should build and own their own houses.  The Minister would not be far wrong if he made money available at a very low rate to our young people to build their own houses.  The taxpayer might have to contribute but it would be a good investment.  A man who is well housed settles down, gets married, rears a family and is a top-class citizen.  Bad housing is probably the cause of some of our people not being as good citizens as we would like them to be.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister would make special arrangements for people who are not in a position to pay the full rates demanded by the local authorities. We have a scheme which is optional.  It is working only fairly successfully. The Minister should have no hesitation in deciding on the categories of people who should qualify for remission of rates, whether it be remission of half the rates or the rates in full. Having done that, he should provide money out of the Central Fund.  As I said, the scheme is optional but if the local authority adopt it they have to make up any deficit.  That money should be provided out of the Central Fund and payable to the local authority in question.  The same thing should apply to social welfare recipients who are in dire need of water.</P>
    <P>This morning the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that Fianna Fáil are the wreckers, that they are out to wreck the stability and the economy of the country.  We are not out to wreck the economy.  We want to help it.  Fianna Fáil have always stood by the poorer sections of the community and they in return have stood by Fianna Fáil.  I do not want to be quoting here but I know a Labour Deputy who said here before the 1969 election that if needs be they would wreck the economy to come into power.  I shall say no more but the Minister for Industry and Commerce should look back and see what a Deputy of his own party said.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> The budget has been a bad one.  It has done little to stop inflation.  It has done nothing to help the economic growth of the nation one way or the other and this time 12 months we shall be sorry that such a budget was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it can truthfully be said that no Government has been bequeathed a better, sounder or more progressive economy that has the present one.  What has happened since they came into power?  It is sad for me to relate that we now find ourselves in a sea of raging inflation.  We now find ourselves in a country in which the housewife cannot buy the same goods on two consecutive weeks for the same price.  We now find ourselves in a country in which the backbone of our economy, the farmers, are beginning to be taxed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The people know what Fianna Fáil have done for the country.  We have had a tremendous phase of prosperity that would have continued had we remained in office. Unfortunately the people, in their wisdom, selected another Government <Col N="1644" /> but they are paying a high price.  I know at the first opportunity that decision will be changed, no matter how the Minister for Local Government may have gerrymandered the constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>What has the Minister for Finance done with regard to containing inflation?  I admit that the Minister has made a reasonable effort in relation to social welfare benefits and I welcome what he has done but what good are they if we are going to have the same rate of inflation, and some economists predict it will increase in the future?  The social welfare benefits will be of little use.</P>
      <P>Some minutes ago I referred to the doctrinaire policies and ideologies of the Government.  It saddens me to relate that because of their policies, their welshing on agreements entered into by the previous Government, Cork has lost two industries and west Cork has lost an oil refinery.  Because of the behaviour of this Government employment has been lost in my constituency, where we could well do with it.  The prospect of 2,000 or 3,000 jobs would stem the tide of emigration from west Cork for a long time. It is not only the specific industries that are involved; the spin-off industries that would accrue from the establishment of the oil refinery would have had massive economic repercussions in my constituency.  But because we had a Government who welshed, who sold out for the sake of some outmoded, outdated and obscure ideology west Cork were the losers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the reputation of this Government for welshing has not spread too far.  If industrialists from abroad become aware of this kind of behaviour, the IDA will become defunct. It would be a sad day for the country when we could no longer provide employment for our workers and small farmers in rural Ireland.  This is not just an economic philosophy; it must <Col N="1645" /> be a social philosophy where we want to keep people living in rural Ireland, even though the Parliamentary Secretary may not agree with that.  We have strong social obligations to keep families intact, to give employment in their own towns or villages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with me, I am prepared to put on record that I welcome it.  I have never said the Parliamentary Secretary is dishonest; he may be a little naive at times but he is certainly not dishonest.  I accept what he says on a matter like this.  I will give the Parliamentary Secretary his due.  I have crossed swords with him on occasion in the House but he is an honest man.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the loss of employment in my constituency because of the Government's decision, but I am even more concerned about the potential loss that may accrue because of the vague&mdash;perhaps deliberately so&mdash;announcements and statements in the White Paper about wealth and capital gains taxes.  I am not an academic, an economist or an accountant, but it is basic commonsense that companies must have profitability. If they have not profitability they cannot have re-investment and expansion.  If there is not expansion there is stagnation and that leads to death.  Unless the Government radically change their attitude in relation to employers and industrialists we will have very lean times ahead of us.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there is a philosophy or a policy that can overcome the difficulties I have mentioned but I am not aware of it.  There is absolutely no encouragement to our people to invest their moneys at home.  What has happened since the announcement in the White Paper about the wealth and capital gains taxes?  If I am to believe what I am told, the massive exodus of money from the country will have lasting and damaging effects on our economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the capital gains tax were mentioned in the White Paper.  I am sure there were some who thought that this theory had been buried or, at least, severely curtailed as compared with its original form. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach made a speech not so very long ago, a most conciliatory speech, in which he said the Government were prepared to listen to any reasonable arguments against these impositions. I am sure he has had a great many reasonable arguments put forward to him and I hope that the Government will consider now the gravity of the steps they are proposing to take.</P>
      <P>I hold no brief for wealthy people, for those who make big profits out of land or any other speculation, but it is a fact that, when you have a free enterprise economy, you must have the <i>entrepreneur.</i> There must be the opportunities to make money.  What is being done at the moment is to say to these: &ldquo;Do not invest your money in any worthwhile enterprise.  Buy a painting.  Buy silver.  Buy gold.  Buy some useless commodity which will be of no benefit to the economy and you will be safe but, for God's sake, do not put your money into anything productive.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to lecture on this but, as a businessman in a small way, I can see this having tremendous repercussions where the availability of money is concerned.  Instead of investment being encouraged in our economy the opposite will be the case. <Col N="1647" /> There will be a depression.  Any kind of efficient economy needs a constant injection of money otherwise it will not keep going.  We must have available at all times fresh sources of money for the economy.</P>
    <P>It is a popular exercise to go around voicing slogans: &ldquo;Squeeze profits. Take the money off the employer. Take it off the businessman.  Take it off the welathy farmer.&rdquo; Take it off this person and that person.  But these are the very people responsible for the employment we will be able to give in the future.  If we kill the goose that lays the golden egg everybody will suffer.  I know I am now leaving myself wide open to being labelled &ldquo;Right Wing&rdquo;, &ldquo;Left Wing&rdquo;, &ldquo;Conservative&rdquo; and so on.  These are catch phrases that trip very readily off the tongues of some Members on the opposite benches.  If I have got nothing else I have got common sense and it is common sense to me to try to protect and nurture the fragile plant that is our investment.  If we take away the incentive from people to invest at home it is the poorest sections who will suffer initially but gradually the suffering will spread to all the other groups in our society.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that a man like the Taoiseach, for whom I have the greatest respect as a man of intelligence, foresight and integrity, would allow a situation to occur where, instead of having massive investment coming in from abroad, our own people will be sending their money out of the country, a complete reversal of the position that obtained some years ago.  This will be very serious for the economy. It is not something out of which anyone wants to make political capital. It is too serious an issue to start making a political football of it.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister for Finance to consider very carefully the effect of this policy.  The short term effects may not be so great but the long term effects these madcap policies will have on our economy will be truly disastrous.  If we have not investment and a thriving industry, and people who are prepared to take risks with <Col N="1648" /> their own money to start industries and thereby provide employment, we cannot have social welfare schemes or any kind of socialist policy.  We will not be able to give to the less well off or the needy.  I am sure every Member has as one of his principal aims improving the lot of the less well off in our community.  I cannot see the policies and schemes adumbrated here working satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>On the surface the budget may appear to be a reasonable budget.  In the short term it may be a reasonably good budget but I believe it will have long term bad effects on our economy. We must have an expanding economy. We must have a certain amount of inflation in that expanding economy. Inflation is running at a very high rate at the moment and no attempt is being made to stem the tide.  Indeed, the opposite is the case because the Minister has budgeted for a deficit in the region of some £80 million for 12 months.  This is a <i>carte blanche</i> from the Minister for still more inflation at an even greater rate.  We will have to pay the penalty for that. Our exports will become more expensive and less competitive.  Our balance of payments will suffer.  There will be a running down of external reserves which form the backbone of our external credit system.  If that situation occurs, the Minister for Finance will have to take full responsibility for it because of his attitude and because of his policy.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House an expanding economic unit is of paramount importance because we recognise that there are no quick or easy ways of making money in a country unless one is prepared to work and invest substantially of their time, energy and finance.  I want to try to ensure that no long-term damage is done to our economy by some of the schemes that have been propounded and that we encourage our industrialists to retain profits for further investment.  We should be giving them incentives to do this so that they can create more jobs and give more employment.</P>
    <P>It is also very important in that category that we have an active capital <Col N="1649" /> market to which businesses can go for money.  Again, it is my view that we have killed off that market by some of these policies.  In my view we should advise some of the banks and some of the controllers of pension funds to recycle their profits into and invest in concerns like the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  By doing so they would be showing that they have a serious interest in the future of agriculture.  Unless agriculture, like industry, can have available to it tremendous and massive doses of injections of capital it also will die out. The Coalition will be reneging on their promises if they do not take some steps to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>I regret very much the loss of industries to my constituency because of the policies of the Government. Would the Government, even at this late stage not approach the people who have signified their intentions of not going ahead with their development? On my doorstep Burroughs Corporation, a big American organisation, pulled out because they could not trust the Government in relation to their attitude economically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as much concerned about the national interest as the Parliamentary Secretary is.  In fact, I am even more concerned than he.  As far as I am concerned two industries, APCO in west Cork and Burroughs Corporation, on the verge of Cork city, pulled out and did not establish industries which could have had tremendous benefits for this part of the country and for the national economy.  I regret having to say that but one has to say these things in this House and challenge the Government to deny them.  The Government will certainly deny them if they are not true.  If they are true such statements might bring about a belated change in Government thinking in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the people who are suffering because of the Government's madcap policies and not the Government.  The ordinary workers in those areas would have benefited from the establishment of such industries.  The Government, and the Minister in his statement, <Col N="1651" /> have done a disservice to this country by creating that sort of an atmosphere. This may appear to be a good budget in the short term but in the long term it has done nothing to attack the tremendous problems facing us at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Every person is nervous before he hears what the budget contains but everybody this morning heaved a terrific sigh of relief when he learned that the Minister brought in practically no tax increases.  When the Minister finished his speech yesterday there seemed to be a lull.  Everybody appeared to ask if the Minister was not taxing anybody except the farmers with valuations of £100.</P>
      <P>The last 12 months has been the most difficult period for this country since the second world war and for us to go through this difficult period and for the Minister for Finance to introduce a budget with so little taxation is a tremendous achievement.  I compliment him on his decision not to increase the tax on cigarettes or drink because if there is one industry in need of a boost at present it is the tourist industry.  The tourist trade has now got this boost.  Five or ten years ago one of the things we could shout about was that cigarettes and drink were a lot cheaper than in Britain and this enticed those in the middle income group to spend their holidays here.  I have no doubt that as a result of this budget we will see a big increase in the number of visitors from Britain in the coming tourist season. This is a great incentive to the English people to come and enjoy themselves here.</P>
      <P>I should like to compare the Irish budget with that introduced in Britain recently.  In the British budget cigarettes were increased substantially as was the price of drink and the rate of income tax.  Our Minister for Finance has done none of these things.  When I heard the Opposition spokesman on finance speak yesterday on the budget I wondered if he was being realistic when he described the budget as an inflationary one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one can forecast accurately what will happen during the next 12 months.  The actual deficit was only <Col N="1652" /> £10 million during the past year although the Minister had budgeted for a much greater amount.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley spoke of the mismanagement of the economy.  Can the Deputy be serious at a time when a budget such as this, and involving so little extra taxation, had been introduced? Looking at Fianna Fáil Deputies yesterday evening I was reminded of children who had lost their toys.  This was true in particular of the rural Deputies who feared that this budget was too good so far as they were concerned.  Surely they are not being serious when they say that the poorer sections will not benefit from it.</P>
    <P>The Minister began by simplifying the tax code.  It is time that we faced the reality of the taxation system because for too long our system has been out-dated.  It is a system that many people cannot understand because of its complexity.  I compliment the Minister on the change in the rates of income tax.  I do not believe that anybody expected such substantial increases in income tax allowances.  The tax allowance for an unmarried person will now be £500 instead of the previous figure of £299.  This represents an increase of approximately £4 per week.  The figure for a widowed person will now be £550 instead of the previous figure of £324.  This represents an increase of £4.50 per week while for a married person the figure is being increased from £494 to £800, an increase of £6 per week.  For a single person earning £600 a year the increase in income tax allowances represents a net increase of 50.80 per cent.  The net increase in respect of a person earning £1,000 a year is 17.64 per cent and for a single person with an income of £2,000 the increase is 7.22 per cent.  For a married person earning £800 a year there is an increase of 100 per cent while for a person earning £1,000 the increase is 41.96 per cent and for a person earning £2,000 a year the increase is 11.39 per cent.  These figures represent a tremendous achievement by the Minister and are much more than what most people had expected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1653" /> I hear some lamenting that some farmers are to be brought within the tax net.  Farming today is big business.  It is an activity that has the potential and possibility of producing very good profits.  Admittedly, the situation has not been great during the past four or five months but there is no doubt that during the next couple of years the farmers stand to make a lot of money.  It has always been my opinion that to tax a farm worker while exempting his employer who might have a holding of substantial valuation was not just.  Indeed, there was something radically wrong with a system that allowed that to happen.  I understand that about 9,000 farmers will be affected as a result of bringing within the income tax code those farmers who have valuations of £100 or more.  Such farmers would be very few along the west coast.  It is only fair play that since hoteliers, small businessmen and, most of all, the ordinary worker is taxed, the gigantic farmer should pay his share also.</P>
    <P>Regarding the White Paper on capital taxation let me say it is time that a capital gains tax was introduced here.  The allowance of £1,500 in respect of a private residence is a worthwhile exercise.  So far as the wealth tax is concerned it must be emphasised that the proposals are still only in White Paper form.  It is my opinion that this tax will have to be increased substantially.</P>
    <P>With these new forms of taxation and the modification of the existing code we now have a basis for a long overdue modernisation of our whole tax system.  I welcome this development.</P>
    <P>Let us consider now the new allowances for the weaker sections of our community.  I welcome these increases and in particular I welcome the change whereby a person in receipt of an old age, non-contributory pension can claim for a spouse who has not reached the age of 68.  Perhaps this is the most important change in the sphere of social welfare because these couples have been existing on an income of £6.15 per week.  They will now receive £10.95 per week.  I <Col N="1654" /> welcome, too, the increase of £1.15 per week for old age pensioners.  In their last policy document the Coalition said that the qualifying age for the old age pension would be reduced. Last year it was reduced from 70 to 69 years and this year it has been reduced to 68 years.  I hope that the Opposition, too, will indicate in their speeches their welcome for these changes.  It is all right to say that greater benefits should have been given and to say at the same time that we should have budgeted for such a high figure.  They cannot have it both ways.  Revenue must be obtained from somewhere in order to grant increases to the weaker sections.  There is an increase of £1.30 per week in the rate of the contributory old age pension. This brings the total amount to £8.50 and to £14 for a person with an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>In regard to unemployment, there have been two substantial changes in the past few months.  The first is that unemployed people now get pay-related benefits.  In other words, a person who used to earn £35 as a worker gets more than a man who earned £25.  In the second place, the Minister has increased the unemployment rate by £1.20 per week for a single person and £2 a week for a married person bringing the allowance for the latter up to £12.80 a week.</P>
    <P>Particularly in the western seaboard, we should all like to see full employment.  In the last couple of years the population in my country has increased considerably and I should like to see the day when there will be no need for unemployment assistance, when there will be full employment for all.  However, until that day it is important that the Minister should give adequate assistance to unemployed people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>A number of people collecting unemployment assistance do not deserve to be in that category at the moment.  We all know that if a factory comes to an area or to small towns in rural Ireland there might be 200 people drawing unemployment assistance but of those 140 might be <Col N="1655" /> unemployable.  In future budgets it might be possible to separate the genuine employed from the unemployable so that industrialists coming to an area in the country would know the work force in the area.  Unemployable people should be eligible for health benefits, perhaps.</P>
    <P>I had to smile when I heard Deputy Crowley say that the Government are in a fog in regard to industries in Cork.  I do not know anything about Cork but in Donegal we have had a tremendous number of new industries in the last 12 months. As well, a tremendous number of industrial sites have been bought, which is just as important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not believe Cork is any different, particularly in the past year.  The reason for the population increase in Donegal is that we have created a number of new jobs for our people.  As I have said, we have not full employment but at least something is being done to reduce the unemployment figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One problem I run into as a rural Deputy relates to spinsters who have probably spent most of their lives looking after an old father or mother. I should like to see some scheme whereby such single women, when the father or mother dies, would benefit from the unemployment assistance fund.  When either or both parents have died, such women could be anything between 55 to 60 odd years and I do not see why they should not get unemployment assistance in the same way as men do.  I have met many cases of hardship from this point of view.  I realise there is a scheme through which they <Col N="1656" /> can apply to the county council for assistance but these women are too proud to look for this kind of handout. Perhaps in next year's budget the Minister will put such women on social assistance.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House. The words in the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> about the budget speak loudly:</P>
    <P>...no banker sitting in Dublin today has any reason to be fretful about Mr. Ryan's handiwork.</P>
    <P>There could be no louder recommendation of the budget.  Never in the history of this State has a Minister for Finance introduced a more appropriate budget and a more helpful one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties many people have when a budget is introduced&mdash;not only politicians but the media and the economists&mdash;is that of assessing the full impact of the budget and what is being budgeted for.  This is one of the reasons why the media, having to prepare matter for the following day's editions and having to hand it in possibly at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m., find difficulty in preparing it.  It is a formidable task.  That is why I had sympathy for every spokesman on finance while we were in Government.  He had to guess and to speculate on what the budget would contain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As time goes on the people will appreciate that they are no better off because of this budget.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce this morning expressed considerable concern at the wide use of such terms as &ldquo;a fraudulent budget&rdquo;, &ldquo;a confidence trick&rdquo; and so on.' He suggested they were exaggerations, to put it mildly.  Even as the Minister was making his budget speech and referring to increases in various tax allowances&mdash;a married person's allowance was to be increased from £494 to £800 &mdash;there were expressions like: &ldquo;My goodness, there is a £300 increase in my tax allowance.  This is fantastic&rdquo;. Then you realise that the earned income allowance is no longer there.  It was based roughly on one-quarter of the income.  You suddenly found that <Col N="1657" /> instead of being £300 better off you were £60, £70 or £80 better off.  It is the principle of the operation with which I am concerned.  Then you look at money values and you say: &ldquo;Am I even keeping up with inflation? Am I able to maintain my standard of living?&rdquo; The answer in most cases is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  My late father sometimes used the expression that figures cannot lie but liars can figure.  Economists, mathematicians and theorists can confound one but what it boils down to is what it means to the average man or woman.  The average woman knows whether she is buying more than she was previously.  She was told that VAT was to come off food and that there would be a sharp decrease in food prices.  She knows that food prices are still going up. Food prices have gone up by 1.7 per cent which, when added to the amount of VAT which was taken off, means that food prices have increased by about 8 per cent.  These are little deceptions.  The man-in-the-street is not really interested in what anyone in this House has to say unless it affects him in his own pocket.  As time goes on he will realise that the increases which he has been given do not amount to that much.  The increase of 30p a month in children's allowance is an increase of 7½ new pence per week.  I would like some protection if I were to try to tell the mother who must buy a little dress for her two-year old child or a pair of shoes for her three-year old boy that she is getting a great boost in her income&mdash;7½p per week.  The fact is that people are not eating as well as they were a year ago.  People are having to cut down on many of the little luxury items which they enjoyed.  The cost of confectionery, for example, is enormous.  I believe the price of a four ounce packet of sweets here would be about one-third dearer than in the UK.  The cost of living is increasing at an enormous rate.  Everyone knows this.</P>
    <P>We are told we had roughly a 15 per cent increase in inflation last year &mdash;I think it was probably about 18&mdash; and we are told we can expect at least a 14 per cent increase this year.  That <Col N="1658" /> is nearly a 30 per cent increase in the cost of living in a two-year period. Incomes have not increased at that rate.  The Government should take note of the increasing dissatisfaction among many working people with their trade unions.  If this country is to survive we must have national wage agreements. If there is a free-for-all we will not survive and no Government can make us survive.  When you make a deal with people and tell them what they are getting it must be a real deal and later on they must not realise that they have been &ldquo;done&rdquo;.  The commitment of many of the trade union leaders to a political party in Government is giving rise to much suspicion and concern. It will not be enough any more for the trade union leaders to recommend. In fact they recommended a national wage agreement but the workers turned it down.  Deputy Keating, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, tried to blame Fianna Fáil for that.  This was again underestimating the intelligence of the people concerned and saying that they could not think for themselves.</P>
    <P>If we had been in office there would have been an enormous outcry about the effect of this budget on the cost of living.  Any Government can take credit for what happens in the year in which they go out of office.  It was possible to introduce the 1973 budget because of Fianna Fáil's management of the country's affairs.  We managed them prudently.  We were never very adventurous even though we were often called, under the leadership of Seán Lemass, a gambler's Government. If we had gone for a £74 million deficit in a nine-month period or a £66 million deficit in a full year&mdash;very confusing figures but that is how it works out&mdash; we would have been called gamblers. The Government may argue that times have changed but I do not think so. I think you have to pay for what you get.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in answering questions this afternoon, referred to the fact that his colleagues in the Council of Europe, the Finance Ministers, wanted higher rates of interest charged for loans but that he opposed this tooth and nail and that they <Col N="1659" /> decided not to increase the interest rates.  I wonder what their reaction will be when they find him introducing a budget like this.  They enabled the country, in their view, to obtain cheap money by keeping interest rates down. He may well lose his case.  They may say: &ldquo;We decided not to increase interest rates and now you go for a large overdraft which is similar to a budget deficit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are told we will get money from the buoyancy of revenue but if people have to tighten their belts and cannot buy as much as they were buying purchasing will gradually be reduced.  Therefore, the taxes will not come in.  One must be careful.  The Minister for Finance in a radio interview last night stated that we were in a very healthy position, that we had external assets.  We have.  We built up our external assets.  They are somewhere in the region of £400 million.  When the last Coalition Government went out of office they had used up the external assets which were then around £400 million too.  They spent every penny.  We had not got a bean, we were bankrupt.  The Minister said last night: &ldquo;What are external assets for?  They are there in case of a rainy day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government introduced this very generous budget and at the same time they admitted there are rainy days ahead.  If there are rainy days ahead I imagine I must tighten my belt rather than go out on a wild spending spree.  I do not understand the psychology employed here.  Last year, when there was plenty of money in the Exchequer to meet all the requirements, the Minister increased taxation.  This year, with uncertain times ahead and with local elections in June, he arranges for reliefs which he states are generous.  They are not as generous as he states because people are lagging behind the cost of living.  They will certainly be by the time they get those increases in July.  I wonder how many increases there will be on items between now and 1st July?  I am sure the Prices Commission report for the month of March will show the large number <Col N="1660" /> of increases there were in that month. The number of increases granted during the months of April, May and June will be quite large.  In spite of this the Government embarked on something which is bound to have a great effect on our economy later on. I hope things do not go wrong but if they do the financial structure of this country could be demolished. This country will not go cap in hand to its European partners.  The people of this country will not thank any Government which leads them into that position.</P>
    <P>The last speaker referred to the fact that no extra tax was put on cigarettes and he mentioned the effect this would have on tourism.  I should like to remind him that last year the Minister put an extra 3p on a packet of 20 cigarettes, it was the biggest increase ever put on in a budget.  While the Deputy can laud the Government for not hitting the usual commodities this year he need not pat himself on the back too much because there was no need for the extra taxation.</P>

      <P>They did.  The Labour Government increased a lot of things.  They introduced subsidies and they had to to get money for them from somewhere.  However it is not their budget I am discussing.  I must put down a question to the Taoiseach soon to ask him what the purchasing power of the £ is now compared with what it was on 14th March, 1973.  A lot of people would like to know that because it is only by assessing what the purchasing power was on a certain date and what it is at the present date that you know if you are better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Deputies know my interest in the development of our youth services.  I am very disappointed that the Government have not recognised the work and the worth of these organisations.  Youth workers give up their time and work voluntarily to help young people who have got into trouble and also help those who are <Col N="1661" /> not in trouble but might be if those organisations did not exist.  We need an expansion of our youth services. We need money to give leadership training courses to youth workers. We need money to pay for more full-time youth leaders.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Deputy Bruton, has met youth people many times.  He is working on a particular policy and we have got a lot of promises from him.  However, the figure allocated to youth organisations, apart from sport organisations, amounts to only £81,000 this year. The kind of money one should speak of in relation to youth organisations is something in the region of £500,000.  Before the courts in Dublin at the moment there are claims for £8 million for malicious damages. The Government's contribution to try to solve the problem of malicious damage to property is to contribute £81,000 to youth organisations.  The youth workers feel they are only holding the thing together.  If it were not for them the claims for malicious damages might be £16 million.  If the Government were genuinely interested in the youth of Ireland they would have allocated a considerably larger sum of money for youth work.</P>
    <P>The Government are attempting to borrow large sums of money from abroad.  As interest rates get higher and higher the cost of servicing those borrowings will be greater every year. The cost of servicing the national debt has reached an enormous proportion. It is now getting to a stage where we cannot continue borrowing without watching what it will cost us because this money has to be paid back.  When an increase in wages and salaries is granted under a national wage agreement it results in an increase in the cost of products, particularly in labour-intensive industries.  An increase in wages and salaries does not matter very much in an industry where very few are employed but in a highly labour orientated industry, such as the building industry, this can result in an enormous increase in the cost of a house.  A house which cost £5,000 to £6,000 a year ago will cost at least <Col N="1662" /> £1,000 more this year.  This is caused by the increase in the cost of building materials and increased wages to workers.  It is almost impossible for young people getting married to buy a house of their own.  The house which sells at around £6,000 today is not nearly as good as the type of house which sold for the same money two years ago.  With inflation as bad as it is people have to settle for a lot less than they would wish.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see from the Minister's statement that he has budgeted this year to allow the ESB to pay the first instalment on a nuclear power station.  This was a good decision by the Government and I am glad the ESB are not losing any time in going ahead with that.  It will be interesting to know what the full cost of that will be, because the sooner we can do something about our balance of payments deficit, which is getting bigger every year, the better. This is one of the things which should be of real concern to any Government.</P>
    <P>I cannot help thinking it is quite within the realms of possibility, even though this is a 9-month budget, that the Government may decide to introduce another mini-budget after the local elections.  That would not surprise me at all.  However, looking at the state of investment in Ireland, one should have grave concern about it. If we do not encourage people to come and invest their money in Ireland, there will be no jobs for our people.  Reference has been made to the big drop in unemployment in 1973. We all know that when we were joining the EEC it was stated quite clearly that on entry there might well be a certain loss of employment but that it would be of a minor nature, but if we did not go into the EEC the unemployment that would follow would be far in excess of what would occur if we went into the EEC.  The fact that the figure was not higher than it was is due to the Government's handling of the situation through all the years leading up to our accession &mdash;making various grants available for industry, for retraining programmes, all the many things that the Government <Col N="1663" /> of that day did to prepare for our entry.</P>
    <P>More people are leaving the land every year.  I do not know whether this will increase this year more than any other year, but these people have to be absorbed into industry, and if they are to be absorbed into industry, the industry has to be there.  The previous speaker referred with great pride to all the industrial sites that are ready in Donegal, but he made no mention of how many industries were established in the last year.  He said there was an influx of industry in the last year, and then he mentioned industrial sites.  I would be curious to know what he meant.</P>
    <P>Most people are aware that investors are a little bit chary about Ireland at the present time.  They would rather wait and see.  This discussion paper on capital taxation has worried many people, and consequently development has fallen off almost completely in the private sector.  Certainly anything that was started will be continued until finished, but new projects in the development field will not start until there is more certainty about the future. I know the Leader of the Government is aware of this, because I have spoken to many people who voted for his party and who have been to see him about this.  I know people who want to see him and who would warn him that the implementation of badly thought out and badly researched proposals can do a great deal of damage.</P>
    <P>When is this happening?  This is happening at a time of uncertainty and instability, to use the Minister's own words, throughout the world.  This is happening at a time when we can least afford it to happen.  I have always said that people will forgive a Government for anything except losing them their jobs.  The Coalition did that the last time and they stayed out for 16 years.  When people would say to me: &ldquo;You have been in too long&rdquo;.  I used say: &ldquo;You never ask the question why we have been in so long.&rdquo; If the present trend continues, a whole new generation of people will shortly be nodding their heads with a certain awareness as to why Fianna Fáil were in office for 16 years and why, from the time <Col N="1664" /> Fianna Fáil go back into office they will be explaining to people then who did not remember when the Coalition were last in what had happened.</P>
    <P>At the moment the indications are not good at all.  I do not think the Minister for Finance inspires confidence in anyone.  It seems to me he is unable to answer very simple questions that are put to him.  One question in particular was that dealing with taxation of farmers, where he was maintaining that no new law or resolution was needed, although section 18 of the Act states specifically that profits from farming are exempt from income tax This is something which the Minister. introducing into his budget a new sector of the community for taxation purposes, should have known.</P>
    <P>One of the matters mentioned by the Minister that he has not budgeted for are the claims for anomaly increases under clause 18 of the national wage agreement in the public service I have no idea what these claims amount to, but he could be referring to thousands or hundreds of thousands&mdash;I do not know&mdash;as he does not spell out what these claims, which are not budgeted for, amount to.</P>
    <P>One of the points which has not escaped most people is that, in spite of the Government's removal of health charges and housing subsidies from the rates, the fact is that the rates are still as high as they were before these subsidies were removed. Many people who are not in a position to pay their rates and who fall outside the area of the non-contributory pensioner or that kind of person, cannot get a waiver of rates very easily.  In fact, hardship is one of the most difficult things to prove.  We have stated&mdash;and we shall state it constantly from now on until something is done&mdash;that the rates on private dwellings should be removed altogether. This is the only equitable solution. The Minister argued that it would be very difficult to make an assessment in the case of a person who lived over a shop; he could claim it was his business or something like that.  I see no difficulty in this at all. I am quite certain that, if we could have introduced this scheme, as we would have if we had been returned <Col N="1665" /> to office, this Government could do the same.</P>
    <P>I remember reading somewhere that it is now almost cheaper to go shopping in the morning than in the afternoon because prices increase so rapidly.  Every day of every week people find this, that and the other going up in price.  It amazed me when I read somewhere that somebody in the Prices Commission suggested that price increases should not be published in the press.  I am not saying the Prices Commission as such said that, but a member of it; and it astonished me that there was an attempt in that person's mind to conceal from the people what was happening.</P>
    <P>Many people were concerned by the fact that during the year when the price of beef fell very sharply decreases in beef prices in the shops were not at all in line with market prices.  Many people felt that they were being taken for a ride.  I believe this was so and the Minister left it very late in the day when he decided to inquire into it.  Particularly in a case like that where there is a drop in price the Minister's Department should immediately look into it and see that a proper reduction in price is passed on to the consumers.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to continue to consider very seriously the question of taking malicious damages off rates and making them a charge on the National Exchequer.  I have no doubt that if the Minister were in Opposition today he would be shouting this from the rooftops.  With a claim in the region of £8 million facing the people of Dublin over the next couple of years when these moneys begin to fall due&mdash;including £2 million for one fire alone&mdash;people will be unable to pay.  This is not unreasonable.  Particularly since members of the Minister's own party had a motion down in 1972, I think, calling on the then Minister for Justice to get malicious damages off the rates, they should now be seen to be pursuing the matter when they are in Government.</P>
    <P>One of the disappointing features of the budget concerns travel cards. Not so long ago I asked the Minister if he would consider giving free travel <Col N="1666" /> passes to spouses of veterans of the War of Independence who can travel free with a wife or a husband as the case may be but cannot travel separately. The Minister agreed that this was a very shortsighted decision on the part of the Fianna Fáil Minister who introduced this concession.  I took that as an indication that the present Minister would put this little matter right: it would not cost the Exchequer very much but he has not done it.  It was not unreasonable to ask this as most of these people go out together in any case.  They could be given a permit to travel on their own if they so wished.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I asked the Minister about releasing civil servants engaged in youth work for a week or two each year to go on camp or to take their charges on camp.  He said he could not do this because if you allowed people involved in youth organisations to do this you would have people with various other interests seeking the same privilege.  The Minister does not fully appreciate what many of these people do in their youth work; if he did I think he would adopt a very different attitude Perhaps a certificate could be issued by the National Youth Council who knew the youth worker as a genuine active person in that field and could provide his credentials.  Many of these people give up their own holidays or sacrifice time that could be spent with their families to take less fortunate young people on a trip abroad perhaps to where some foreign youth organisation has invited them, having raised funds locally, or to where they have an annual summer camp.  This would in some way compensate for the paltry sum allocated to youth organisations this year and would be a very real contribution which would be accepted with enthusiasm by youth organisations.  It would enable many young people to get away who cannot at present do so.  I ask the Minister to give the matter further consideration or even to agree to meet members of the National Youth Council if they sought a meeting with him to discuss the matter and see if something like this could be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1667" /> I have covered most of the points I wanted to make.  This is the kind of budget which people themselves will best be able to assess.  They will know whether they are better off in real terms or not and no amount of speech-making by politicians or listening to commentators on radio or television, some saying &ldquo;you are&rdquo; and others saying &ldquo;you are not better off&rdquo; will make much difference. They will judge best for themselves as to whether or not they are better off.</P>
    <P>While I would not say this as a strong prediction, I would not be surprised if we had another budget introduced about October or, perhaps, sooner because of the trend of events abroad.  This budget may be a face-saving attempt by the Government wanting to say: &ldquo;We introduced a budget after being a year in office without having inherited a full Exchequer from Fianna Fáil.  You can see we did not bankrupt the country&rdquo;.  However, they admit that they have gone to £76 million in deficit which we realise will not be £76 million but could be £66 million or £56 million.  Much depends on continuing employment and on the continuing of the confidence this country enjoys abroad.  We do not want to see any companies that come here suddenly deciding to pull out because the philosophies of the Government here are too difficult to understand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will not be very long. This is not a budget which requires a lengthy defence from backbench Government Members.  It can be truly said that this budget deserves the ovation it received from Members on this side of the House yesterday and the reception it received from the Press, political commentators and the public at large.  The burden of the Opposition's case when speaking on this budget was not so much a criticism of the actual budgetary proposals but rather charges of the failure of the Government to inspire confidence.  As far as the poorer sections <Col N="1668" /> of the community are concerned, this Government inspires confidence.  While this might be expected from the Government's achievements, this is not where the Opposition's argument really lies.</P>
      <P>In his speech yesterday the Minister listed for us evidence that the balance of payments deficit rose over the 1973 period from £56 million to £86 million.  In spite of that our external reserves were marginally higher than in 1972.  This was due to the continued inflow of capital projecting international confidence in our economy.  The help for the poorer sections of the community carried most weight with me.  Employment figures rose by more than 6,000 over the past 12 months.  This is evidence of success and inspires me with confidence in the Government, particularly when I compare this figure with a drop of 9,000 in the previous year.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear in the Minister's speech yesterday a reference to rising prices.  Prices are a very important element so far as people in the lower income group are concerned.  Prices rose over the last 12 months by 11.4 per cent.  Food prices accounted for half of this.  There was an improvement in the latter half of this year which can be attributed directly to the Government's removal of VAT from food.  An impression has been created that the removal of VAT from food has been a useless exercise.  In keeping with the election promises the Government removed VAT from food and this was a useful exercise. Since its removal only 12 per cent of the total cost of our price index is attributed to food and before that the figure was 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>External factors have accounted for almost half of last year's food prices. The fuel crisis accounted for something like 30 per cent and has made a very big impact on our prices.  Far from taking sinister pleasure in sanctioning price increases our Minister for Industry and Commerce has made every possible effort to control them.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new measures include the <Col N="1669" /> extension, from one month to two months, of the period of advance notice required before prices of goods and services can be increased, the freezing&mdash;at the level prevailing on 23rd June last&mdash;of the profit margins of importers, wholesalers and retailers on a wide range of commodities, and the fixing of maximum retail prices for various household goods.  These controls can prevent unjustifiable increases in prices.  Where, however, increased costs are unavoidable and cannot be offset by increased productivity they must necessarily be reflected in higher prices.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees that prices need to be kept under constant surveillance. The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government are aware of the need for an extensive inspectorate to control food prices and ensure that any unauthorised increases in prices or overcharging is nipped in the bud.  I have no doubt that there is some overcharging at the moment. There is an area in which an improvement can be made and it is in the area of setting up local machinery for the lodging of complaints.  I have spoken on this subject with housewives, many of them in the lower income group, and others, who have been deprived of ways of making their voices heard.  They would be able to make their charges on overpricing known to the Minister if local bureaux were available in all towns.  This is a very important point to be considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>There was, and still is, an impression abroad that the Minister is totally responsible for the increases in prices. This is not true.  I am confident that he is doing everything in his power to remedy this.  I am confident also that my request for local bureaux to be set up where the victims of overcharging can make their voices heard will be acceded to.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a housewife and a woman Member of this House, I am happy with the improvements in so far as women are concerned which are evidenced in this budget and in the actions of this Government since they took office in March, 1973.  We <Col N="1670" /> have had since then very important improvements so far as discrimination against women is concerned. We have had the removal of the marriage bar in the Public Service, the introduction of an Equal Pay Bill which will be amended and improved further as it goes through the Dáil, and a new, sympathetic and humane attitude towards unmarried mothers.  We have had a new attitude towards handicapped children.  For the first time we have in this budget a recognition of the part played by single women in this society.  We have the commitment to introduce a scheme of allowances to meet their special needs.  At a glance, one might feel that the introduction of a scheme of special allowances for women at 58 might in itself be discriminatory but when one realises the discrimination that has been committed against these people over very many years and the part they have played in caring for parents or relatives with no income at all and at no cost to society it can truthfully be said that they deserve from society some recognition for the part they have played.  This is not a charity.  It is their right.  They should have some allowance of their own at the age of 58.  At 58 it becomes impossible for such people to secure employment. They have been deprived over the years and are very rarely fit for employment of any kind.</P>
    <P>With regard to pensions and social welfare benefits generally, I wish to say that I welcome all the improvements. I want to welcome the recognition for the first time of the need for an adult dependant allowance.  Up to now this State took no account of the fact that a non-contributory pensioner with a wife had any specific need to support that wife.  The non-contributory pensioner with a wife will benefit largely from this budget. His income will rise from £6.15 per week to £10.95 per week.  Such people will welcome the increase.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision made for widows in the early days of widowhood. Their case has been put strongly before the Minister by the widows' associations.  It has been put <Col N="1671" /> to Members of the House that at this time in a widow's life there is often great need.  The shock of widowhood, the cutting-off of the family income and the bereavement of the widow merit special attention by way of financial aid at such time.  The introduction of a scheme which allows social welfare benefit to be extended for a period of six weeks after a husband's death is a good one.  It shows a humane attitude on the part of the Minister for Finance.  It will be warmly welcomed by the associations representing women.</P>
    <P>The Government record with regard to women has gone further.  The need for widows to pay for social insurance stamps has been eliminated.  In this budget there has been an increase for a widow with three children of £2.45 per week.  The Minister will concede that there will not be luxuries in those homes yet but he has made a sizeable contribution to their incomes in so far as he could do so.</P>
    <P>In so far as women generally are concerned there has been acceptance of the concept of giving credit to people who have cared for elderly people.  We can foresee a time when married women generally will be insured persons and will be given credit as social welfare insured persons. They will have social insurance in their own right.  We acknowledge that married women rearing children are doing a very real job for the State and yet we do not compensate them in any way.  Their individual rights have not been recognised.  A useful way to do so would be to allow them credit for social welfare purposes and ensure that they have benefits equal to those in the work force.</P>
    <P>This Government are only 12 months in office.  Their record in the field of advancing the cause of women, easing the discrimination that existed against them and removing the restrictions in various areas has been excellent.  We will constantly be pressing them to improve further the position of women.  At a time like this we must go on record as complimenting the Government on the progress made so far.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> I welcome also the easing of the means test.  The aim should be to abolish means tests finally.  It might be argued that people who do not need pensions would receive them under such circumstances.  That is often said in regard to children's allowances but an equitable tax system would take care of that.  Ultimately, the abolition of the means test will come.</P>
    <P>We are in a situation in which a person of 68 years whose means do not exceed £11.50 per week will qualify for some pension and all the benefits available as well.  A married couple whose income does not exceed £23 will have equal rights in this regard.  This is a major step forward.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £100,000 for research into poverty.  I have no doubt but that poverty exists and has been allowed to exist.  Very little effort has been made up to now to relieve it.  It would be useful to have an idea of the extent of the poverty so that we can tackle it in a realistic way.  I have confidence that in the next few years major steps will be taken towards the alleviation of poverty in this country.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that public service pensioners have been granted parity and the date of payment brought forward from 1st October to 1st July.  I must mention one note of disappointment here.  I am sure the Minister has not overlooked the needs of pre-1968 widows and feel confident that some provision will be made for them in the near future.  The Minister must be aware of the needs of the pre-1968 Civil Service widows.  They were disappointed. They will be disappointed to find in a budget which catered practically for everybody they were in some way overlooked.  I note the good job the Minister has done towards relieving stress and I feel that the waiting period of such widows will not be very long and that he has some scheme in mind for them which will give them parity with the later pensioners.</P>

      <P>This is a budget covering a period of nine months. Those who have not benefited under it should remember that adjustments will be made again in nine months' time. Viewed from that angle, the increases which have been given are even more satisfactory than they would have been.</P>
      <P>In the area of taxation, of course, the reliefs on income tax are very welcome. It is gratifying to note that everyone will benefit to some extent. I have no doubt that there are people who feel that the actual savings under the new income tax provisions should have been much greater.  I am sure the Minister shares that view and if possible he would have allowed for greater increases.  I share that view too but I am well aware of the problems the Minister had and in the circumstances a very real effort was made to meet the need in this area.</P>
      <P>All of us in our saner moments must wonder how anybody of any age can survive, with costs as they are, on less than £20 a week.  The realities are there and the backlog is there.  I am satisfied that, bearing in mind that this need exists, if possible it should be relieved at one fell stroke, but I am satisfied that it does not fall within the competence of any Minister to wipe out years of wrong administration at one fell stroke.  A good start has been made.  The first steps have been taken. The Minister and the Government will work diligently towards greater equity in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very commendable is the fact that the Government have made efforts to end tax avoidance and tax evasion. This will be very welcome to those who have come within the tax net and whose every penny has been public knowledge down through the years.  The Minister said that higher rates of taxation were brought about by the amount of tax evasion there was in the past and that it will be his policy in the future to take firm action against evaders.  He has taken several steps to ensure that this will be done. <Col N="1674" /> He has ensured that interest over £2,000 on borrowings will not qualify for tax relief in future.  He has ensured that income from assets transferred abroad by a person assessable for tax will be reckonable for Irish tax purposes.  Contrary to the Central Bank warning, funds have been diverted to facilitate speculation instead of being used for productive purposes. The Minister has issued a public warning that, unless this practice ceases, more effective steps will have to be taken.  This is all very commendable and will be welcomed by those who have borne more than their share of taxation down through the years.</P>
    <P>The bringing into the net of farmers whose valuations are £100 or more is defensible.  I could not think of any just tax system that would leave such persons outside it, so I welcome the bringing of farmers of that category within the tax net.  Everybody will benefit to some extent from the tax reliefs.  A very good beginning has been made towards providing a just tax system and in the future we will have a much more just and equitable society than we have had since the foundation of the State.</P>

      <P>I am sure that no budget has ever been introduced in any democratic parliament that had not good points and bad points, and there were people who agreed with parts of it and people who disagreed with other parts of it.  That has always been the experience here. Many points were made since the budget was introduced with which everyone in the House agreed, I am sure.  Many points made by the last speaker welcoming reliefs for various obvious classes of people are welcome, I am sure, to all the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is the privilege and duty of the people behind the Minister to remark very favourably on all aspects of the budget which they possibly can, it is also the duty of the Opposition to pick out the weaknesses in it if they can find them, and to offer constructive criticisms.  We heard of the very favourable reception accorded to the Minister's budget this year and <Col N="1675" /> that the only exception to that favourable comment came from the farmers and the Opposition party and that that was anticipated.  I am sure that a lot of the favourable comment was anticipated also.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that what should agitate people when they are trying to read between the lines is that it seems extraordinary that so much is given away and no extra taxation is in evidence.  One wonders what kind of a country this is.  One wonders what kind of a Minister and Government have we got if they are such magicians that they can give and not take.  We always understood that if one section of the community benefited, it had to come out of the pockets of some other sections of the community.  I think that will prove to be the case this year as in the past. That position was easily understood when people had to live within their means.  Nowadays many people are living on the &ldquo;never-never&rdquo; and taking little heed of what the future holds.  Values are changing.  There is a conspicuous absence in the budget of any worthwhile incentive to save for the rainy day.  We were always taught that it was a good precept to think of the rainy day and make provision for it.  This year I do not notice any great emphasis being laid on the necessity for thrift.  It is rather disquieting to think that nowadays it could happen that the thrifty person could be at a distinct disadvantage as against a person who spends whatever he can get his hands on as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Those of us in public life are aware of the elderly person, perhaps the last of a family, who is the owner of a house or two usually acquired as a result of the hard work and thrift of members of her family who have now passed on.  She used to make an adequate living from that property and she now finds she has to pay very high rates and very high prices for repairs to the property which is becoming older and deteriorating every day.  It is now a liability to her and she finds it is no longer possible for her to live on the <Col N="1676" /> rent.  I wonder what has the budget done for such a person.  Somebody from one of the benches said during the afternoon that people in her position, I take it, were too proud to seek home assistance or social welfare. Often it is because they do not know how to go about it despite all the assistance they get from their local TDs, representatives, advice centres and so on.  Some people are reluctant still to seek assistance or let people know they are that badly off that they need assistance from others than their family.  I think we are coming to the stage that these people are the real poor and that something should be done for them.  They are not organised. They are not the best people to speak for themselves.  Therefore, it is up to the State&mdash;either the Government or local government&mdash;to do something to help people like that.  I do agree that in some localities we have been able to ease the burden for them.  Only for that.  I think many of them would have died from malnutrition.</P>
    <P>It may seem strange to people&mdash;it certainly seems strange to me&mdash;that the Minister for Finance should budget for a deficit and hope that that will not be as big as might be anticipated because of inflationary factors and because people will spend the increased money they will receive, whether by way of wages, salaries or other benefits.  Therefore, I would say such a Minister would not feel over-anxious to get people to save money.  It would be to his benefit that they spend the money because he would collect more in VAT, capital gains and so on.  It would all go to the revenue and help to swell the Exchequer.  That is his aim and I cannot say I blame him for that.  Of course, he is a member of a Government which has a Minister whose job it is to control prices and to bemoan publicly every time prices are raised although he has the last word on whether or not they should be raised. On the one hand, you have the Minister for Finance who benefits if people spend the money and, on the other hand, the Minister for Industry and Commerce whose job it is to control prices.  The Irish public&mdash;the man in the street as we call him&mdash;<Col N="1677" /> would view that with a very jaundiced eye and wonder how he is affected by it all.  We are all taxpayers when it comes to indirect taxation.  We can relieve the burden of income tax and we may think we are doing an awful lot of good for people but, when we put it on to indirect taxation, it means that the very poorest person in our community has to pay.</P>
    <P>I would maintain that this budget is an illusory one because the Minister is raising money through indirect taxation whatever it may be taking off direct taxation.  Fianna Fáil have been for many years&mdash;and I agree it was many years&mdash;stating that their policy was to revise the whole system of taxation.  It is no easy job, whatever Government are in power or whatever Minister is concerned, to revise a system of taxation which has existed for more than 100 years and try to mete out justice to all sections of the community.  When I was very young, as an apprentice to my craft, the boss came down one day and said to me that he was working for the income tax people and was bemoaning the fact that his income tax liability was running into three figures. Young as I was, I remember I had the audacity to say to him : &ldquo;I only wish I was paying it.&rdquo; I have never forgotten that lesson.  I felt no greater pleasure later on paying income tax than does any other person.  But I did feel that the persons who did not pay income tax were the persons who should be pitied because they were so badly off they did not have to pay.</P>
    <P>It was said several times in the House today that there were so many more people paying income tax nowadays and liable to it than there were ten or 20 years ago and that this was a reason why Fianna Fáil should be blamed.  Perhaps because I am a member of the Fianna Fáil Party I see it in the very opposite light.  At one time a certain class only paid income tax&mdash;as with rates&mdash;and they were in the minority because the position of the rest of the community was such that they could not pay it.  But the Fianna Fáil policy of industrialisation gave well-paid jobs to thousands of people in this country and brought <Col N="1678" /> them into the income tax bracket.  If income tax is going to be ever a source of revenue to the Exchequer, then my ambition would be that as many people as possible be in the income tax bracket because they would be then contributing to the welfare of the community as a whole.  I cannot see anything for which Fianna Fáil should feel in any way ashamed. On the contrary, they should be very proud that they brought people up to that standard.</P>
    <P>There is mention also&mdash;well meant, I think&mdash;by the Minister of changing the face of the Social Welfare Department and putting a human appearance on it.  I and anybody else in public life would agree with anything he can do about that.  We should all be concerned about those who are less well off than ourselves and those who have to rely on social welfare assistance or something of that kind.  But I think we should start very much nearer home because when one is in need there are things even more important than money and one is the kind word.  As far as I am concerned, the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;by the delays which occur in paying people the benefits to which they are entitled; delay in payment sometimes for five, six or even seven weeks&mdash; causes a great deal of hardship and frustration to those recipients.  That is something which it is within the Government's power to correct.  I do not think it would cost any money but would mean a great deal to those people.  I shall wait until the Estimate for the Department comes up before going into any more detail on the matter.  But I will say in passing that I can never understand&mdash;and I have been speaking about it in this House under both Governments&mdash;why every case has to be processed in Dublin when there is a population of 130,000 people in Cork city and a quarter of a million people in Cork county.  It could be done quite easily there without incurring the delay involved in having it processed in Dublin.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I feel this is an illusory budget.  It purports to give percentage increases but very little in actual increases.  With the inflationary trend now raging there is no doubt <Col N="1679" /> whatever in my mind that by the time the next budget comes along, whether in nine or 12 months, the actual increase will have been eroded completely and will be a memory only.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke today.  He spoke mostly of the difficulties the Government had to face and the difficulties that we were creating for him in Opposition because we did not sympathise more and did not understand better the problems of Government.  Of course, I do not think there is any Government in the world that has not got difficulties.  There is no Government that we know of that has not had bad years and other years not so bad.  I would not say that Governments have good years.  I do not think that possible.  A Government are judged on how they meet those difficulties, overcome those obstacles and you do not come to the Opposition&mdash;as he did this morning&mdash;to complain of the way they are criticising, pleading for more understanding, asking them did they agree with the children's allowances and with this and that increase.  He has his job to do.  He undertook to do it.  He was elected to do it.  He and his Government must do it and be answerable to the people as has been done by any other party or parties in this House.  The Government's job is to be honest with the people, to tell them that the country must pay its way and live within its means even though some hardships may be imposed. This may be distasteful but it is necessary for the good of the country.  I hope this will not be the illusionary budget I anticipate it to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only criticism the Opposition seem able to make about the budget is an economic one.  I do not like to quote the Opposition but they have said it is a fraudulent economic budget.  A suggestion has been made that the budget in some way is irresponsible, that the size of the deficit cannot be justified and that it will create dangers of some kind for the country.  That is a criticism that needs to be dealt with and, as it is the only one made, I shall have to <Col N="1680" /> deal with it at some length.  Of course, I shall say something about the positive merits of the budget but that will take a long time because it is so full of merit.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the economic situation in which the Government found themselves when preparing the budget. There had been a year of very rapid growth.  The figure of growth last year has been given variously by different authorities, but despite the suggestion by Deputy Colley that economic commentators and exports had moved from the figure of 7 per cent and that the figure would be much lower, the actual figure put forward by all the various bodies concerned is 7 per cent or higher.  I could not follow the suggestion that some expert somewhere was giving a lower figure.</P>
      <P>The OECD report assessed last year's growth rate at 7½ per cent; the Economic and Social Research Institute, 7¼ per cent; the National Economic and Social Council, 7 per cent; and, with their customary moderation, the Department of Finance have taken the lowest figure of 7 per cent.  None of these bodies, making independent estimates, has given any lower figure.  The attempt by the Opposition to suggest that something much less was achieved last year, bolstered up by unnamed authorities&mdash;who may perhaps consist of the economic adviser to the Opposition&mdash;is without foundation.  Of course, in the field of macro-economics one is never sure what the statisticians' final figure will be but at this moment there is unanimity on the part of the experts that the figure is 7 per cent or higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also agreement that the growth of the economy last year tapered off as the year went by and as we came into this year that process was aggravated by the oil crisis, to some degree because of shortage of oil.  However, that proved to be temporary and the impact on the level of production was never very serious. There was the effect of the oil crisis on prices, on people's purchasing power and, consequently, on the demand for growth and production. We faced a situation, like that of <Col N="1681" /> many other countries, of impending recession with a real danger of rising unemployment which, of course, had been falling during the 12 months in office of the Government.  In that situation there was a compelling case for a budget that would stimulate economic growth, one that would encourage expansion of the economy.</P>
    <P>The question of the degree of expansion is appropriate and how it should be tackled are matters of opinion.  It will not surprise the country if the Government and the Opposition disagree on those issues but there should be no disagreement between the Government and the Opposition&mdash;there certainly is none between the economic experts&mdash;about the need to stimulate the economy. If no action had been taken, if a neutral budget had been introduced, the growth rates foreseen by the economists ranged from a low figure of 2¾ per cent by the Economic and Social Research Institute to 3½-4 per cent from the Department of Finance and the National Economic and Social Council.</P>
    <P>In putting forward a more optimistic figure as regards what the growth would be if the budget were not re-stimulated, the Department of Finance necessarily were putting forward an optimistic figure for the growth that would occur if nothing were done. They were reducing the margin by which they would justify reflationary measures.  The conclusion they and others came to was that the capacity of the economy to expand was greater than the expansion that would take place if measures were not taken in the budget towards expansion.  Therefore, an expansionary budget was required which would stimulate the growth of the economy by a figure between 1-1½ per cent.</P>
    <P>The OECD suggested expansion of 1 per cent, although it must be said their actual figures for growth without a stimulus and for the target rate of growth suggested a 1-1½ per cent expansion.  They called it a 1 per cent expansion when they wrote about it but, as they said, if the growth was between 3-3½ per cent <Col N="1682" /> without a stimulus, and it should be 4 per cent, the actual expansion they were talking about was in the range of 1-1½ per cent.  The Economic and Social Research Institute in their analysis just published, suggested that without any stimulus the economy would grow by 2¾ per cent, that it could afford to grow by 4 per cent and, therefore, an expansion of 1¼ per cent was needed.  The National Economic and Social Council spoke of expansion of the order of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in the budget put forward is seeking to secure an expansion of about 1 per cent in the economic growth within the present year and perhaps 1½ per cent in the old financial year ending 31st March next.  That plan is completely in line with the advice received from all of the different agencies. There is nothing here of a political attempt to produce a budget more generous than the economy can stand. On the contrary, the expansion proposed is of the order of magnitude proposed by the OECD, the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council. The budget is precisely in line with the advice of these experts&mdash;no more and no less.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the somewhat flatulent oratory on the other side of the House on the subject is without foundation.  Headlines in the papers which referred to Deputy Colley's remark about a &ldquo;fraudulent budget&rdquo; are so much rhetoric, lacking any foundation in economic reality.  The budget is solidly founded on the advice received by the Government. The Government were not tempted to go beyond that, to give away more than could safely be given away to secure the necessary degree of economic growth that will protect employment.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, once growth falls to a level below 4 per cent employment stagnates and declines.  In the ordinary way, the increase in productivity and output per worker which is achieved as a result of the ordinary pattern of investment is in the region of 3½-4 per cent each year. If the total growth of the economy is <Col N="1683" /> no more than that, that increase can be achieved with no more workers.  If it falls below 3½-4 per cent, as some of the experts thought would happen &mdash;for example, the OECD and the Economic and Social Research Institute&mdash;employment would decline and unemployment would rise.  The first duty of the Government is to prevent that happening, to try to secure some increase in employment even in a difficult year and to do so especially if the economic advice given is unanimously in favour of such a policy. Of course, the Government would have been unwise to go beyond that. They could have been tempted to have a more reflationary budget than the experts advised.  They could have been tempted to take a chance on it and hope things would turn out for the best.  They could have gone for a 5½-6 per cent growth rate, a figure near to last year's rate, that would involve a significant increase in employment. However, that would have involved taking a chance and the Government rigidly within the bounds of the advice given to them, produced a budget which is, in these circumstances, if you like, slightly conservative, certainly one that takes no risks or chances, certainly one that we can stand over and be sure it does not put the economy at risk, one that will, in fact, maintain the kind of economic growth rate this country can now achieve of 5 per cent, or a little over, and which will secure some increase in employment.</P>
    <P>We know now from the mouths of the Deputies opposite what would have happened the country had Fianna Fáil been in power at this moment.  They would not have adopted such a policy. They would have budgeted for a deficit of £25 million which would, of course in these circumstances have failed to achieve the economic growth necessary and left the country with declining employment.  Nobody need be surprised that that is the policy of the party opposite because in the years in which they were in Government they regularly on every occasion pursued this particular policy.  They balanced their budgets with as much concern for arithmetic precision as if each of them <Col N="1684" /> was Mr. Gladstone incarnate.  Never did they allow economies to creep into the budget.  Their budgets were bookkeeping exercises, carefully balanced, and whether the right answer for the country in a particular year was a budget surplus, to cut back inflation, to cut back demand, to accept the pressure of demand or whether, in a given year, what was needed, as in this year and, indeed, last year, was an expansionary budget, they ignored these considerations as irrelevant and, going back to their 19th century economics, balanced their budget within £2, £3, £4, £5 or £6 millions.  Only at the very end of their period in office did they move marginally away from this and it was not that the Opposition were not encouraging them.  We, in Opposition, were not taking the penny pinching line the present Opposition are taking a continuation of the line they took when they were in Government.  We encouraged them to be more expansionary when it was necessary.  I can recall advising them along that line myself when we were in Opposition, but they were not prepared to do so and, if they were in Government now, they would no doubt do what they are saying they would do&mdash;I think they are entirely honest in say ing this&mdash;namely, pursue a similar policy.</P>
    <P>If we look now at the actual figures of budget deficits and consider what is involved we can see how appropriate the particular policy has been.  I shall document this by reference to the statements of the agencies I have mentioned.  Last year, the pre-budget position for the financial year 1973-74 was estimated at a £20 million deficit. Because some measure of expansion was needed in the economy last year we raised that deficit to £40 million as the planned deficit.  The Minister, of course, pointed out that in doing that the very action in going for a bigger deficit would itself by expanding the economy enlarge the tax base, bringing in more revenue, and so the actual deficit would be lower than the figure mentioned; instead of £40 million it turned out to be £10 million, which was lower than the Minister himself thought likely, but the nominal deficit on the face of it, before taking account <Col N="1685" /> of this somewhat unquantifiable but very real budget expansionary effect, was the £40 million figure.</P>
    <P>This year, our opening budget deficit was £22 million.  We had to consider what to do.  It seemed to the Government that the right thing to do was to have a budget deficit for the 12 months ahead, because we must calculate initially for a 12-month period; the nine months involves complications to do with a particular flow of expenditure and revenue at particular points in the year&mdash;I shall come back to this later&mdash;and the question was what kind of budget deficit would be appropriate to the needs of a year of threatened unemployment, a year which, if no action were taken, would certainly turn out to be more dangerous from that point of view than last year would have been, a year that needed a bigger measure of expansion in order to preserve employment and utilise to the full the capacity of the economy.</P>
    <P>We got advice on this from various sources.  I shall not quote them all at length.  I shall just take one, the OECD, which is a totally external source, and this is the view of the OECD in their document.  I shall quote from pages 32 and 33.  I shall not read the whole report, the House will be relieved to hear, but just that part of it germane to the present debate: these are some extracts from their &ldquo;Conclusions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The prospects for real output growth in 1974 thus seem to fall short of the 4½ per cent suggested above as a reasonable aim.  The overall shortfall, with a 20 per cent increase in the public capital programme, could be of the order of one percentage point, with a somewhat larger reduction in the possible rate of growth of private consumption.</P>
    <P>The 20 per cent increase referred to was the actual increase that occurred and they were, I think, aware when they wrote this that was the planned increase.  That is what would be required in the increase in expansion in the economy.</P>
    <P>Policy action to stimulate demand <Col N="1686" /> and output would, therefore, seem desirable.</P>
    <P>They go on to consider how this should be done:</P>
    <P>An appropriate form of stimulus would, in the light of the possible development of private consumption, presumably include reductions in personal direct taxation or in indirect taxes.  Indirect tax reductions would have the advantage of easing the prospective rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>They recognise &ldquo;the desirability of a revision of direct personal taxation rates to take account of the rapid growth of money incomes and prices in recent years.&rdquo; They go on to talk about the effect this would have.  It would lead to a larger balance of payments deficit and, of course, to a larger deficit in the budget.  They say:</P>
    <P>If demand management policy were to support growth at capacity rates through 1974 the deficits on current account of both the balance of payments and the public sector would increase sharply.</P>
    <P>This is the policy they recommend: if expansion were adopted there would be larger deficits.</P>
    <P>The signficance of the balance of payments deficit should not be exaggerated: in large measure it would represent oil price increases whose balance of payments effects cannot be offset other than over a period of some years; and it would also contain some cyclical element if Ireland were to be more successful than its trading partners in maintaining output and employment.</P>
    <P>This is the crucial passage:</P>
    <P>Nor should an increased deficit on current government budget deficit be considered undesirable: indeed, if the economy is to continue to operate at full capacity over a period of sharp deterioration in the balance of payments (i.e. there is a reduction in investment abroad), and full employment is associated with roughly stable levels of domestic private investment and private sector saving, then the national accounting identity requires <Col N="1687" /> that the increased external deficit be matched by an increased public sector deficit.</P>
    <P>Note the wording: &ldquo;Nor should an increased deficit on current government budget deficit be considered undesirable&rdquo;.  There was the clearest indication that what we had to do this year was plan for a bigger deficit than we planned for last year.  Last year's planned deficit would be too small in the current year.  It was necessary to go for something larger, and that is what we did.  Instead of raising the pre-budget deficit, £20 million last year and £52 million this year, we took the good advice given by the OECD and raised it to £66 million for the year 1974-75.  That increase is estimated by the Department of Finance&mdash;I sought this information from them this afternoon to ensure I was not chancing my arm in the calculation&mdash;to increase GNP by an extra 1 per cent in the nine months to the end of the year and 1½ per cent to the end of March next. That is exactly the scale of increase the various agencies I have mentioned consider necessary.  The OECD said 1 per cent; they wanted 1 per cent to push up the growth rate from 3 to 4½ per cent and the ESRI wanted 1¼ per cent, so that the planned budget deficit is bigger than last year's.  The OECD advised it should be, and it is designed to achieve, in the view of the experts of the Department of Finance, that expansion of the economy which is thought to be desirable and necessary by all the expert agencies.</P>
    <P>How, in the face of that, Deputies opposite have the nerve to come in here and talk about a dangerous budget, damaging to the economy and risking inflation, I just do not know. However, I suppose they have a problem. There is nothing else on which to criticise the budget and they may think they will get away with this particular criticism.  The Opposition have a difficult task at times.  I found it so myself and, indeed, the task of a Deputy who has to rise to answer a budget speech which he has only had a chance of skimming through <Col N="1688" /> while the Minister is speaking, is always a difficult one.  I know from experience how nerve-racking it is and I should not be too critical, therefore, of the attitude taken up by someone in that position but, equally, what someone in that position says should not be taken too seriously especially when it flies in the face of all the expert advice available to us.</P>
    <P>Just to reinforce what I have said from the OECD report I would like to quote from some other documents.  I should like to quote from the Economic and Social Research Institute's document.  That document states:</P>
    <P>Without a fairly sharp stimulus, either internally or externally generated, the prospects for an above average growth rate in 1974 were slight.</P>
    <P>Given that growth: in 1974 is expected to be below average; employment is not expected to grow with the corollary that either unemployment or emigration will increase; and the reserves will almost certainly fall, there may be a case for expansionary policies pushing the growth rate more towards 4 per cent,</P>
    <P>They have a lower expectation of growth and they believe it should be pushed up by 1¼ per cent.</P>
    <P>The National and Economic Social Council had something similar to say.  In paragraph 20 they said:</P>
    <P>There remains the issue of whether or not expansionary policies should be applied in 1974 over and above those implicit in the budgetary assumptions.  The patterns of the growth in investment and output in recent years do not suggest that productive capacity would not be available to permit a growth rate somewhere higher than 4 per cent,</P>
    <P>I admit that the double negative is almost calculated to confuse but nonetheless reading it carefully one can see what they mean.  The patterns of the growth in investment and output in recent years do not suggest that productive capacity would not be available to permit a growth rate <Col N="1689" /> much higher than 4 per cent.  Translating that into plainer English these considerations do suggest that productive capacity is available to permit a growth rate in excess of 4 per cent. That report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Nor is a higher growth rate likely to be constrained by a general shortage of labour.  Policies that were modestly more expansionary would be unlikely to cause a larger increase in wage&mdash;and salary&mdash;rates. Nor would they be likely to cause a faster growth in prices (than the very high rate already forecast), given the extent to which prices are affected by external influences and the terms of the 1974 National Agreement.</P>
    <P>There is the answer to Deputies on the other side who said that we were budgeting for inflation.  We are told that if we budget, in the case of the National Economic and Social Council, to expand the economy by 1 per cent this year this would not have the effect of increasing prices.  They give the reasons that prices are primarily influenced by external considerations, for example by the price of imports which are not going to be affected by our budget because they are outside our control, and by the terms of the 1974 national agreement which is set and fixed and which will not affect the issue.</P>
    <P>The only way in which prices could be pushed up by the budget in these circumstances would have been if we had sought to cut back the deficit by taxes and expenditure.  This would have pushed up the cost of living and because of the escalator clause in the 1974 national agreement this would have pushed up wages and, therefore, prices still further.  In the circumstances facing us this year it was very important that we should not increase our expenditure and I have not heard any Deputies opposite suggesting that we should increase income tax which is the only alternative available.  In fact, not alone has the budget we have produced not had the effect of pushing up prices but if we had produced the kind of budget the Opposition want, that is reducing the deficit involving, <Col N="1690" /> therefore, heavier taxation and expenditure, that would have had the effect of pushing up wages and prices.</P>
    <P>Finally, the National Economic and Social Council conclude:</P>
    <P>Some expansionary stimulus would help to maintain or even increase the numbers at work.</P>
    <P>The council go on to be more precise in paragraph 22 and state:</P>
    <P>we have concluded that the aim of budgetary and monetary policies in 1974 should be to add about 1 per cent to the growth in output.</P>
    <P>That is precisely the increase in output which this budget, from the expert advice of the Department of Finance, is likely to produce in the calendar year 1974.</P>
    <P>The council add:</P>
    <P>Without the modest expansionary stimulus we envisage, the growth in employment is not likely to reduce under-employment to any significant extent, or to reduce appreciably the numbers on the Live Register.</P>
    <P>There is the warning note.  There is the advice we got and the advice we took and the Opposition are welcome to any pluckings they can get from that particular fowl.</P>
    <P>What then, given that we had to plan for a deficit of about £25 million more than was planned for last year? How should we use the additional money?  Should we spend more on Government services?  Should we cut taxes?  Should we increase social welfare? The Government considered this and decided on a utilisation of this additional resource, on a way of using the money concerned, knowing we had to pump more money into the economy to expand it and we decided on the criteria which would be employed in determining how this money should be used.</P>
    <P>First, and it will always be first with this Government, we felt we should use a large part of the money &mdash;about half&mdash;to cushion the poor against inflation.  That has to be the first priority.  About half of the money involved&mdash;we are talking of the order <Col N="1691" /> of £50 million altogether; there is a technicality about Exchequer balances which brings it up to almost £50 million&mdash;was set aside for improving social welfare benefits in the year to March next.  In fact, of course, we are talking about nine months here in terms of the actual benefits given because there will be a new budget next January to take effect shortly after that.  The first thing was to cushion the poor against inflation.</P>
    <P>The second thing we thought necessary, and on this there was clear unanimity and by the Opposition also becasue I do not think we are in disagreement about this, was the need to give tax relief by increasing lagging personal allowances which had lagged so much, so intolerably over the whole period of Fianna Fáil Government with the exception of one minor adjustment at the end of their period of office.  The bulk of the other half of approximately £45 to £50 million went into this.</P>
    <P>We are concerned not merely to lash out the money but to do it intelligently and to take this opportunity of having a little leeway here to reform the tax system.  This has been on the way throughout the past year.  We have already announced our plans to reform corporate taxation and to reform capital taxation.  These are all now the subject of consultation with the various interests.  We were clear that we needed also to simplify the income tax system which had become intolerably complex so that very few of us really understood it.  I have long gone past the point of understanding the system and when people come to my clinics with income tax problems and produce their figures and data I cannot help them.  It has become much too complicated now and one has to refer to the experts and try to find out from the Revenue Commissioners what exactly the problem is.</P>
    <P>Obviously the system must be simplified and the simplification, therefore, together with increased personal allowances in a single operation was the answer.  Those were the priorities we had and that was the pattern in <Col N="1692" /> this budget.  I think it is a wise pattern and one which I am happy to have had the opportunity of defending in this House.  My only worry was that as I have to leave in a couple of hours time with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste for London I might not get into the debate to say how happy I am to put forward my reasons for being happy with this budget.  I am glad I have had that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the social welfare part of the budget and take what we have done in conjunction with what we did last year because this is a continuing operation.  Last year it was somewhat easier and Deputies opposite were kind enough to point this out in last year's debate and they have, rather foolishly, mentioned it in this debate.  They have mentioned that we had the EEC money estimated at £30 million.  That made it easier but this year we have not got that.  We have not got this sudden once-and-for-all bonanza relief and yet we have been able to do something similar to last year.  In fact, the increases in money terms are generally greater.  They vary and are less in children's allowances but more on the basic allowances.  In a number of areas they are greater than last year and we have been able to do this without any EEC bonanza.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the increases given to particular people, people in particular situations in social welfare categories, and to compare what we have achieved in two years in increases with the cost of living.  Obviously one can talk about increases which sound quite impressive in social benefits but if they are written off by price increases then nobody is any better off.  All it does is to keep people where they were.  I should like to give a few examples of how the standard of living of these people has been immensely improved in the last 15 months.</P>
    <P>When we came into Government 13 months ago a man on disability benefit and who had a wife and four children would have been receiving £15.50 per week.  I am including in that children's allowances, having averaged them on a weekly basis.  We raised that immediately <Col N="1693" /> by almost £5 to £20.38 and this year it is being increased to £23.96. Therefore such a person has £8.46 more now than when we came into office, an increase of 54½ per cent.  Of course the cost of living has increased but let us consider the worst period, not only the past couple of years because this increase will have to last until next year and therefore we should be considering the likely increases in the cost of living in the months ahead and see how he will be cushioned against these increases during 1973-74. The best estimate we can make of the cost of living increase for this year is that it will be 14 or 15 per cent.  This is a very steep figure but one that is imposed on us by external circumstances. On that pessimistic but realistic assumption the cost of living increase between 1972 and 1974 would have been about 27 per cent or 28 per cent.  That means that if social welfare benefits are increased by only 27 per cent or 28 per cent the recipients are no better off in 1974 than they were in 1972.  That is not what we have been doing because in this instance the increase is 54½ per cent and the real purchasing power of that family in that distressed condition has been increased by this Government during their 13-month period of office by 21 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a person on unemployment benefit who has a wife and three children.  When we came to office the figure for him was £13.98 but we increased that straight away to £18.02 and he will now have £21.22. That is an increase of £7.24 or 52 per cent.  His living standard would have risen during the year by 19 per cent. Again, let us take the assistance category.  The man in this category who had a wife and three children would have been receiving £11.78p 13 months ago.  Last year we increased that to £15.82 and he will now receive £18.57, an increase of £6.79 or 57½ per cent and an improvement of 23 per cent in his standard of living in two years.</P>
    <P>A widow with three children and receiving a contributory pension would have been getting £11.08 13 months ago but within two months of our coming to office we increased that <Col N="1694" /> figure to £15.07, a penny short of £4 extra.  She will now receive £17.57, an increase of £6.59 or 59½ per cent and an improvement of 25 per cent in her standard of living between 1972 and 1974.</P>
    <P>A worker with a wife and three children who had been earning £30 per week but who is now on unemployment benefit would, because of the pay-related benefit scheme, receive £30.36.  When we came to office the figure was £15.50 Last year we increased that to £20.38 and the current increase represents an overall increase of almost £15 or 96 per cent in two years.  This means that he is 53 per cent better off than he was 13 months ago.  In the case of a man who had been earning £40 per week&mdash; that is not much more than the average wage today&mdash;and having a wife and three children the unemployment benefit payable will now be £34.36p, an increase of £18.86 or 122 per cent increase in his benefits in two years, leaving him 73 per cent better off in real terms.  Thirteen months ago he would have been receiving £15.50 but we increased that last year to £20.38.</P>
    <P>An old age pensioner whose wife had not reached 68 years of age would have received £5.15 13 months ago. Last year we increased that amount to £6.15 but on examination we realised how desperately unfair had been the Fianna Fáil system whereby when a person switched from unemployment assistance to the old age pension he lost the allowance for his spouse.  We have introduced a special allowance for such cases and the amount payable will now be £10.95, an increase of £5.80 or 113 per cent. That couple would be almost two-thirds better off now than they had been two years ago.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the examples.  I have worked out the percentages and I hope they are right.  In any case, they would not be wrong by more than one percentage point.  The figures are an impressive testimony of what can be done if one is dedicated to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;doing the job. Social benefit tended to rise during the <Col N="1695" /> later years of Fianna Fáil rule somewhat faster than the cost of living but they were never anywhere nearly as dramatic as the increases being granted now.  In no period previously have the living standards of the poor been increased as they have been during our term of office and they have been increased during a period of the most rapid inflation that this country has ever known.  We have been able to protect their living standards so that even in this year, with a rate of inflation of 14 or 15 per cent, they will have an 18 per cent increase in benefits.  This will keep them ahead of inflation.  A point that is important to remember is that we are talking here of a nine-month period.  An increase in social benefits of 18 per cent in nine months represents an increase of 24 per cent per annum because we will have a new budget in January.  This increased level this year without having available to us any EEC bonanza, is a formidable achievement for any Government.  It is one that gives us great satisfaction having had to live through a period when social welfare categories were for long neglected. Even when in later years something was done to help them, their position was not improved radically until now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even now the benefits are inadequate and involve for many people very severe living conditions.  We have a long way to go to make up for the position we found on coming into office.  It will take us years, years during which we shall have to keep alive the social conscience of those who are not poor and during which we shall have to ensure that the 75 per cent who at least have jobs, even if in some cases those jobs are low paid, will be willing continually to transfer some of the increased wealth they have each year to the poor.  We are all prone to selfishness and are concerned with looking after ourselves first.  It is not easy to sustain a live social conscience especially in a very materialistic world.  But that is our job.  If we ever falter or fail in that the people will, I hope, know what to do with us.  However I only hope they <Col N="1696" /> will not do so until such time as they are sure that Fianna Fáil have a better social conscience, but that may take some time to ensure.</P>
    <P>Let us compare what are our rates now with those in the UK in so far as a couple of categories are concerned. If one were to go over the whole field one would find areas where the comparisons are less favourable.  The British social supplementary benefits system is very much superior to our home assistance scheme.  While that is something that a much richer country than ours can afford easily, it would be difficult for us to match it.  However, that is the direction in which we must move.  There are cases here of people being forced to go on home assistance whereas in Britain the system is less humiliating and gives a better standard of living.</P>
    <P>Although we have much to do in this field of social welfare we are making progress and in some instances we are not far behind the standards in Britain.  In fact in some areas we are ahead of them.  We are not as wealthy as Britain.  Our GNP per head&mdash;the best measure we can use to ascertain relative wealth&mdash;is only 65 per cent of that of Britain or, to put it the other way round, Britain is 54 per cent better off than we are. But that is a gap that has narrowed. Ten years ago Britain was 70 per cent better off than we were; four years ago she was 60 per cent better off and now the figure is 54 per cent. We are catching up.  We had been catching up during the period of Fianna Fáil Government but whether that was due to achievements in this country or to a total lack of achievement in Britain is a matter of opinion. However Britain now is 54 per cent better off than we are.  Therefore, all other things being equal and if we were no more or no less concerned than the British people and Government with the state of the poor, one would expect their social benefits to be 54 per cent greater than ours.  To the extent that the difference is less than that, it means we have a greater social conscience and that we really are allocating a greater proportion of our wealth to <Col N="1697" /> this poor&mdash;that we really are giving a higher priority to social welfare and to the poor.</P>
    <P>Let me give some examples.  Disability and unemployment benefits, flat rate, has a base here of £7.75 as against £8.60 in Britain, about 11 per cent more, though Britain is 54 per cent better off.  For a married person, our rate is £12.80 and Britain's rate is £13.90, a difference of about 8½ per cent, though Britain is 54 per cent better off&mdash;and Britain, we are told, is the welfare state.  If they are, we in the last two years have been clearly allocating more of our resources to social welfare and to the poor than Britain has been doing.</P>
    <P>Take the contributory old age pension couple.  There is a Labour Government in Britain and they announced that their major achievement in in the social welfare budget was to push the rate up to £16 per week. That received main headlines on the social welfare side.  What is the figure here?  It is £15 per week because of the exceptional increase we gave in this category.  There is therefore £1 a week between us, 6½ per cent, though Britain is 54 per cent better off.</P>
    <P>What happened to the children's allowances?  Families of eight children &mdash;and that covers most of the families in Ireland&mdash;are better off here.  In Britain there is nothing for the first child.  If you take a family with two children, the family allowance here is £5.60 as against £3.90 in Britain.  With five children, the allowance here is £17.75 as against £16.90 in Britain, although Britain is 54 per cent better off than we are.  What they give in children's allowances is significantly less than what we give.  It again shows our concern for the poor and above all for the children of the poor.  In this area our increases have been greater in the past two years.  It is the children and the families with children who have benefited most from the work of this Government.</P>
    <P>However we have not been content simply to increase the amounts under existing schemes.  That was done much more moderately and much less extensively by Fianna Fáil.  They did it <Col N="1698" /> but they did nothing else.  How many new schemes can you count that came in under Fianna Fáil in 16 years? My memory is shorter than others on this score.  I can recall only two or three and I would be interested to hear any Deputy opposite giving a significantly longer list.  In our first year, as well as doubling children's allowances and reducing the qualification for the old age pension to 69 years&mdash;this year we reduced it to 68, on our way down to 65 years, something which Fianna Fáil said could not be done&mdash;easing the means test so that the first £4 do not count, which Fianna Fáil said could not be done, bringing in the benefits in July instead of August and October as Fianna Fáil did&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowance was paid from 2nd July.  If there was any delay in payment the full amount was effected from 1st July.  It was effected from July, as we had promised.  Fianna Fáil effected it from August or October.  In addition we brought in many other schemes, including the scheme for constant care allowances for handicapped children under 16 years of age, and we made provision for the series of reforms proposed by the CARE organisation, we introduced the unmarried mothers' allowances, improved the position of deserted wives, getting rid of that extraordinary Fianna Fáil provision that the deserted wife who was divorced from her husband in Britain had to give her consent to any attempt to put her case and she was therefore treated as being no longer deserted.  We taxed Fianna Fáil year after year to remove that injustice but they said they could not do it because the Department would not <Col N="1699" /> let them.  Who governed whom in those days?  We dealt with that.  We provided an extra £1 million for home care.  I cannot list all the new schemes but there were about 14 altogether, representing about three or four times what Fianna Fáil did in 16 years.</P>
      <P>This year again, without any EEC bonanza, we proceeded to extend the range of social welfare to fill the gaps, to ensure that people who previously were falling through holes in the scheme would not do so and that the holes would be blocked.  First of all we have the continuation of the process of easing the means test.  Now there is £5 a week free and people with even £11.50 per week will get something in respect of old age pensions. In addition to that and the further reduction in the qualifying age down to 68 years&mdash;fulfilling another of our promises, as every one of our promises is being fulfilled&mdash;we have brought in an adult dependant's allowance.  A pensioner with a wife not of pensionable age now has more than twice as much as he had 13 months ago.  That new scheme is most important and it shows our efforts to fill the gap left in the whole system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the new scheme to fill the problem of single women in the ten years before their retirement.  This is something which is dear to my heart: I have been concerned with this particular group for a long time.  They have been disadvantaged in every way under our system.  I have come across cases in Dublin where the gross inadequacies of housing after 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government left a situation where nobody can be housed who had not a wife and two children or was more than 70 years of age and gets benefit under the housing for old people.  That meant that anybody who is single&mdash;for example a single woman &mdash;had no hope of being housed by Dublin Corporation.  Now with houses being built rapidly&mdash;we had hoped to have 8,000 local authority houses built during our term of office and this should be attained now in our second year&mdash;it will ease the situation in Dublin considerably, though it will take some years before we can catch <Col N="1700" /> up on the enormous backlog left by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances the single woman had no hope of being housed. She has to rent a room and you try to find even a slum room with an outdoor lavatory in the back yard, with a door hanging from it, for less than £4 to £5 per week.  What is she paid? I have not got the up-to-date figures but when I last looked at this a year ago I found that the typical wage of such a woman was £12 a week.  She had £1 a week deducted in tax&mdash;that has now been dealt with&mdash;she was not being housed by the public authorities unless she happened to be the daughter of somebody who had a council house and it was left to her. She had to pay anything up to £6 a week in rent and to live on the miserable remainder.  She was thrown on home assistance.  Now she is in a position to know that at least houses are being built and that the tax position has been dealt with.  Now she knows that when she gets within ten years of retirement age she will as of right be entitled to an allowance which will bridge those years until she will get the old age pension long before the ten years are up&mdash;the pension age will be down to 65 anyway in three years' time.</P>
    <P>This scheme offers great hope for thousands of single women of more than 30 years who having passed that age may not have much prospect of marriage and whose economic prospects in most cases were grim.  Now they know they will have something as of right to help them to survive. That is an expensive new development which will cost a lot of money, but it is very well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Then there is the scheme to help wives of prisoners serving more than six months.  They will no longer be thrown on home assistance.  They have been brought into the social welfare scheme.  This is part of our criminal law reform scheme and everything associated with it.  Then there is the death payment to ensure that the gap in the old system will be bridged which left people without a payment for a long period after <Col N="1701" /> a death.  As I have said, these are some of the numerous schemes brought in this year to extend the range of social welfare.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that this is all that needs to be done.  We have not done everything but we have brought in the best part of 20 new schemes in the first two years to cover a lot of the holes.  We have a lot to do. The home assistance system has to be completely reformed and I would think that is our next major job.  I would hope we will be able before long to announce a scheme that will do that.  There is much more to be done before we have an adequate and comprehensive scheme of social welfare. This year, as last year and, I hope, in future years, we will continue to improve the system, not merely to increase the benefits, to raise sharply the standards of living of the poor but also to extend the range of schemes and to fill the gaps that have been left.</P>
    <P>What is the scale of all this social welfare reform?  I want to give the House some figures to show what has been done.  Exchequer expenditure in two years on social welfare has risen by 70 per cent.  Somebody produced figures showing that we have given twice as much in two years as Fianna Fáil did in the previous eight.  There has been a 70 per cent increase in social welfare spending in a two year period when the consumer price index has risen by 27 or 28 per cent. That means that the purchasing power of social welfare provision from the Exchequer has risen by well over one-third in two short years.</P>
    <P>If we look at the actual figures we see that in 1972-73, the last year in which Fianna Fáil were in office, Exchequer expenditure on social welfare was £93½ million.  In our first year that went up to £132½ million, this year to £157 million.  These are not full year figures.  When the full effects of what we have done are felt that figure of £157 million will be £165 million.  Therefore, in effect, the decisions we have taken will in two and a quarter years approximately have raised the amount of spending on social welfare by over 75 per cent. <Col N="1702" /> That is an aggregate measure of what we have done but these figures really do not get across the full measure of the actual relief to the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is using the economic classification tables in the current budget which are on a different basis and I could not begin to reconcile the two.  Even when in Opposition I have tried to sort that out and had great difficulty in reconciling them because the classification system is different.  The figures I am using are those in the budget speech which relate to Exchequer expenditure on social welfare.  I think they exclude health but I would not swear to that.</P>
      <P>The greatest satisfaction I get from government is the fact that we have been able to do these things and the feeling, which I think is justified, that it would not have happened just this way or just on this scale had the Government not changed.  It certainly makes me feel that it was worthwhile going into politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come now to the question of the tax changes.  I was interested to see two articles in the newspapers this morning making opposite points in this respect, one suggesting that too much of the benefit went to the better-off people and the other <Col N="1703" /> suggesting that the better-off people got virtually nothing.  You can, it is said, prove anything with figures.  In fact the position is, as the Minister's speech made clear, that the percentage reduction in the tax bill for the better off is tiny.  One example he produced was 3 per cent and another 1½ per cent.  Of course on very large incomes even a very small reduction involves more money than a big percentage reduction on a small amount of tax.</P>
    <P>The question is raised in one of those articles, very understandably, as to why the sum of money in absolute terms which the better-off people get in tax relief is bigger than that for less well-off people.  When I saw the original proposal I asked the same question.  The answer lies in the fact that it is not possible to simplify a tax system in a manner which ensures that nobody pays more tax&mdash;we thought that was desirable if we were to get acceptance of the simplification system&mdash;without having, as a consequence, that the amount of tax relief varies somewhat over the scale and is somewhat higher in the higher groups.</P>
    <P>My own reaction was to sit down with paper and pencil and try to see how it could be done better and differently. I though I would have a go at seeing if I could improve the work of the Department of Finance and of the Minister for Finance.  I must say I failed, and I spent several hours trying to do it.  I could not see how you could introduce a simplification system that does not have this effect. We have to accept that if you are going to simplify, if you are going to work on the principle that nobody should pay more, which is a pretty universally accepted principle when you are simplifying a scheme, inevitably as a consequence although the percentage tax saving for the better-off people is very small the amount will be marginally greater in a number of cases.  This cannot be avoided. If anybody on the other side can suggest how it can be avoided I will be glad to hear it because it overtaxed my ingenuity. <Col N="1704" /> Here we face a real difficulty with a tax simplification system.  That is the price we have to pay.  The fact is that the percentage reductions in tax are very large in the lower income groups.  Everybody's tax is reduced. We now have a simple scheme that people can understand and can work, one which does not have to fox people, one that people can actually understand and see how it affects them.  The disincentive effect will be much less, because of the way the scheme has been presented.  As a price for that we have to accept some slight unevenness in distribution of the tax reliefs in absolute amounts. If anybody can think of a better way of doing it that does not have that effect I will be very glad to hear and I am sure the Minister for Finance will be glad to hear it too.</P>
    <P>We have introduced here a scheme of income tax reform which simplifies the system in a manner that makes it comprehensible to people, which gives everybody some relief and gives quite significant relief to people in the lower bracket as well as the higher brackets and which relieves 60,000 people altogether of tax.  Those are the kind of people I mentioned&mdash;the single woman on £12 a week whose rent will take at least half her income.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn to the capital taxation side.  The Government's proposals here have been the subject of quite extraordinary misrepresentation. I say that not in regard to the Opposition particularly but in regard to other commentators and interested parties.  It has been very interesting to see, in relation to an attempt to produce a fairer system of taxation that would relieve the vast bulk of people at present paying capital taxes from taxation but would place a somewhat heavier burden on the very rich, the extraordinary campaign mounted against it by the wealthy and the people who have their interests at heart.  Let us be clear on what is being done here.  What is being done is to get rid of estate duty and to find other and better ways of raising the money. It was interesting to read in one newspaper the day after the scheme was announced two articles which managed <Col N="1705" /> to comment at very great length on the scheme without ever referring to the fact that these new taxes were replacing a tax being abolished and were designed to raise a similar sum of money from those at present declaring themselves for tax and not avoiding it.  This tends to be overlooked. I have had people coming to me with great grievances about the tax they will have to pay who simply ignored the fact that the purpose of this was to relieve them of estate duty.</P>
    <P>In one case brought to my attention yesterday somebody, it was alleged, would have to pay £6,000 a year in wealth tax as an additional burden.  When I pointed out that in fact the figure was £1,750 and that they would save £100,000 in estate duty that was not entirely well received. In fact, they managed to convince themselves that this was not the case.  They managed to ignore completely the relief of the £100,000 estate duty and to exaggerate three and a half times the wealth tax they would pay.  If your mind works like that it is easy to get grievances about tax reform.  There has been a lot of misrepresentation of this kind.</P>
    <P>The first thing we are doing is abolishing estate duty.  We are abolishing it for good reasons.  It is an unjust tax which has to be paid by relatives of people who have not great means or great property in this country at the moment of death.  It has to be paid a number of times in succession if death succeeds death.  There is a mitigation scheme for this but it does not mitigate it completely.  People are at risk as to how many members of a family inheriting wealth die in succession. It has to be paid in such a large lump that the incentive to avoid it is enormous and because it only has to be paid occasionally, on average every 29 or 30 years,&mdash;it can be much shorter or it can be as long as 80 years &mdash;because the interval is so long the opportunities of avoidance are very great.  By simply handling over the money and not dying too soon you avoid paying it altogether.  There are many other more skilful, technical and sophisticated avoidance devices which <Col N="1706" /> derive from the rarity of the occasion on which the tax is paid and where the incentive to avoid it is enormous because of the amount paid.</P>
    <P>On top of all those technical defects which make it an unacceptable tax, which offends against all the canons of good taxation, it was a source of great grievance and resentment to people who did not see why they on their very modest amount of wealth should have to pay a sum to estate duty at the moment of death.  We thought the thing to do was to introduce a scheme which would relieve something like 90 per cent&mdash;my figure was 92 per cent, but I am an amateur on these things and look for a directive from the Department of Finance&mdash;of those paying estate duty, from paying it.  That seemed a good start and something well worth doing.</P>
    <P>That is the object of our exercise but the money had to be found.  How are we to find it?  We could have introduced another form of tax; tried to raise all the money from wealth tax or some other tax.  What we did was to spread it around a bit so that it would be as equitably borne as possible.  To raise all that from wealth tax would have meant a wealth tax at an unacceptably high level.  The whole question of the levels is something people are concerned about and will be looked at in due course when we have all the representations in.  Certainly to get the whole of that money back from wealth tax would involve an unacceptably high level of wealth tax, a level which would be too high by any standard of annual tax.</P>
    <P>We sought other means, other solutions, that would eke out what we could get from a wealth tax at a not too unreasonable level.  First, the gift tax.  In the absence of a gift tax avoidance is much too easy.  The process of handing your money on to your successors and not dying too soon, as I have said, is a very simple method of evasion if a slightly insecure one because one never knows the hour, but in the majority of cases this succeeds. If we are concerned that too much wealth will not accumulate in too few hands in any society we have to have a capital tax.  If we are to prevent all <Col N="1707" /> wealth and, therefore, all power, accumulating in too few hands, if we are to achieve that result, which is certainly a necessary one socially in any society, we have to have an effective tax system and we cannot permit a situation where avoidance of tax is too easy.  Therefore, we have to deal with this question of gifts.</P>
    <P>We must ensure by whatever means that in relation to gifts or inheritance we do not have a situation where vast wealth accrues; that, first of all, it is not accumulated by a person, so that it cannot be handed on to the next generation, further accumulated and in the end the great bulk of the wealth would be owned by a tiny minority of people.  Already, this is too true in this country and we do not want the situation to get worse.  A gift tax is therefore a necessary element to prevent avoidance. How much to bring in is something which is difficult to say because we do not know how people will opt, whether they will opt to make the gift which will carry a lower rate of tax than the tax to be paid on inheritance, or whether they will not make the gift to avoid the gift tax and take their chance on what happens when they die.  It is hard to know what the options will be, and, therefore, hard to assess whether you will get your money under this heading or under another heading.  A gift tax is certainly necessary.  I have seen no criticism of it, and rightly so, because it is clearly desirable and should have been brought in a long time ago.</P>
    <P>Then we have the inheritance tax because we are concerned to relieve the vast bulk of people from paying the tax paid on death.  If you have no tax whatever on inheritance, even of very great wealth, then you would get a situation where eventually you would have the country owned by a small number of people.  We have tried to get away from the estate duty system where on a few thousand pounds people are paying tax.  Under an inheritance taxation the burden is shifted away from the estate of the person dying to the person receiving it. This is an encouragement to people <Col N="1708" /> to split up their estates.  That is a good thing, to spread it around, not to leave it all to one member of the family but to divide it around.  For example, a man with an estate of £600,000 and a wife and three children can now under our scheme avoid paying any tax by spreading it equally between them.  That incentive to divide the estate is a good thing but I do not think anybody really believes if somebody has wealth running beyond that or has £300,000 and a wife and one child, that beyond those kind of levels, people should pay no inheritance tax and be allowed to accumulate wealth indefinitely.  I think by raising the level so high and by putting it on the inheritance rather than the estate of the deceased we encourage the estate to be split up.  We tax very large estates to prevent vast accumulations of wealth.</P>
    <P>At the same time the ordinary person is completely relieved.  The number of people who have estates of over £150,000, and when you allow for farmland production, those with farms of over £250,000, are not many. If they are that well-off they can afford to pay something or their heirs can afford to pay something on receipt of their money.  I think the inheritance tax is fully justified.</P>
    <P>The capital gains tax I believe to be essential.  The sense of social injustice which people have felt in this country through seeing capital gains untaxed when they have to pay tax on every penny of their earned income or even on their divident income is something which has been corrosive in our society.  It has encourage all kinds of avoidance measures.  It has encouraged people in responsible managerial positions to look not for a fair reward for their work in the form of a higher salary but instead to look for stock options and various ways of accumulating capital, diverting their attention away from work towards speculation.</P>
    <P>Of course, the capital gains made on land speculation in the last ten years or so under the previous Government were absolutely fantastic. Those people were totally untaxed while the worker, whether he worked with his brain or his hands, had to <Col N="1709" /> pay tax on everything he earned.  That cannot last.  The capital gains tax is set at a rate of 35 per cent.  That is a matter for argument and is something which can be looked at.  Remember it is not progressive.  The people who make capital gains will almost without exception I think be people who are paying more than the standard rate of tax, that is more than 35 per cent.  The number of people who are making capital gains big enough to pay this tax, who will be paying a rate of tax of 35 per cent or less, is very few.  In fact, under this system for those who make the capital gains which are taxable this 35 per cent rate is lower than what they are paying on their income.  There are social arguments against that and there are economic arguments in favour of it.  One has to maintain a balance between the two.</P>
    <P>In devising this tax system and in listening to the representations which are made to us we will be influenced not by rich people coming along with grievances that they are having to pay taxes at last when they got away with it up to now, but we will be governed and influenced by economic considerations and economic arguments.  If it can be shown that there is anything in our scheme which will have an adverse economic effect and a modification will avoid that we will be open to discussion and argument.  That is why there is a White Paper, that is why it is for discussion and that is why we have given it four months for discussion. The period may be a bit long from some points of view.  It is good to leave the whole matter for political debate for a long time.  Politically, the Government would have done better I suppose to have left it for a shorter period.  I think we were right to leave an adequate period, so that we can get different views and people can make technical submissions to us in regard to where the tax system which we are devising may have any economic defect.</P>
    <P>It is complicated.  All wisdom does not reside on this side of the House or, indeed, with the Department of Finance, or the Revenue Commissioners. We all need to learn from the practical experience of people in the field, from solicitors, accountants and <Col N="1710" /> people with experience in these matters who can tell us what defects there may be in our system.  In any event, the capital gains tax at 35 per cent is at a lower rate than that for those who will be paying the tax on their incomes.  For economic reasons a lower rate of tax may be necessary, even though socially it is undesirable to have that kind of differential.  However we cannot always go for social perfection; on that we will be realistic.</P>
    <P>To come back to the wealth tax itself, let me explain the package of tax and why it is a package, why we have spread the tax around and not concentrated it all at one level.  The wealth tax is something which we set out quite clearly in our election manifesto. We stated we would make this change in the system and, indeed, in the detailed costing of our proposal, we mentioned that the tax threshold would be £40,000.  I checked recently to see if my recollection was correct, because one can sometimes imagine the past.  I got the Press cuttings, and sure enough there are the headlines in the papers in which you will find this £40,000 mentioned.  Nobody need come along a year later with the grievance that we did not tell him.  In fact, what we have done is to raise the threshold to £60,000 for a married couple, which is a lot better than we said we would do.  We said we would introduce a wealth tax with a £40,000 threshold, and anybody who has over £40,000 could draw his own conclusions to that and vote accordingly. We did not pull the wool over anybody's eyes.  Again the threshold can be looked at and if a good case can be made in the matter it can be examined.</P>
    <P>Basically the idea is to get currently each year a sum of money which will be between half and two-thirds, roughly, of what we got in estate duty from this source.  The point has been made that it may bring in more.  I think it may, but that depends on the extent of tax avoidance at present.  If everybody is being honest about the value of the estate he is declaring, this package of tax should bring in the same as at present, and wealth <Col N="1711" /> tax about a half or two-thirds of the present yield of estate duty.  If there is large scale avoidance there will be a bonus, but it will be a bonus coming from the tax avoiders, and I hope there will not be too much sympathy for them on any side of the House.  I saw a statement in one of the papers that it would bring in not £14 million but £100 million and the Government knew it would bring that in.  The Government know nothing of the kind.  The Government know it will bring in about £14 million if there is no tax avoidance.  If there is some tax avoidance it will be a little more; if there is a lot of tax avoidance it will be a fair bit more.  Unless we are to believe that a Fianna Fáil system of estate duty which they kept for 16 years was so incredibly inefficient that only one-eighth of the tax was collected and that seven-eights were avoided, which even I would not allege against the Opposition, the figure could not be £100 million.  I wish it were.  Nothing would give me more pleasure than to collect £100 million, of which £86 million was from tax avoiders.  I am not optimistic enough to think that would happen. Such figures are merely misleading people.</P>
    <P>This tax will be collected from a minority of people who have been paying estate duty.  The vast bulk of them&mdash;I would think over 90 per cent&mdash;will be exempt.  If there is any evidence that the tax has a disincentive or a bad effect on business this will be looked at, but we have not that much sympathy for the individual.  If I am down talking to my constituents in Ringsend about their problems and I put the case to them about how hard it is for a married couple with, say, £7,000, to have to pay a couple of hundred pounds in wealth tax, it will not make much impact on them. We are talking about 9,000 to 15,000 people, depending on the degree of avoidance, who will be caught by this wealth tax.  If half of those who should be paying this tax are avoiding it, it is still only 18,000.  The remaining 750,000 families in the country will never be within sight of a <Col N="1712" /> wealth tax.  They will not have much sympathy with these growls from the well-off.  However, they will be concerned, and we will be concerned about any legitimate greivance that this may have a bad effect on business.</P>
    <P>We have tried to cover the agricultural side by suggesting that for the purpose of these taxes the value of agricultural land up to £200,000 owned by a full-time farmer will be set at half its market value.  If a case can be made that that is not the right figure, we can look at it.  If there are problems to do with small businesses for which the system does not cater, let us look at them, but it does not help when we get examples put to us from sources which should be authoritative showing what the effects on small businesses would be with an error of over 100 per cent in the figure, suggesting that the impact on profits available to be ploughed back will be to reduce them to a figure which is over twice as great as the actual effect.  If we are going to discuss this, let us discuss it seriously with real figures and be careful about calculations.</P>
    <P>If there are problems in industry or agriculture they will be looked at, but we will not be deterred from abolishing estate duty or reforming the capital tax system and bringing in a system that will prevent avoidance, yield adequate revenue and prevent the accumulation of great wealth, by people putting forward personal grievances that because they are so wealthy they will at last have to pay tax.</P>
    <P>Above all, we want to get at the tax avoiders, and if, as well as tax avoiders there are tax evaders who are breaking the law it will be my concern and that of the Government that they should be dealt with properly. The tax avoider will use the law to get around paying his taxes, which I regard as amoral, but it is not illegal, but I regard the tax evader, the man who breaks the law to avoid paying his taxes, as one of the worst kind of criminals.  The ordinary thief does it piecemeal, dealing with one victim at a time, but the man who does not pay the tax he is legally <Col N="1713" /> obliged to pay is stealing from the other million taxpayers, and that, in any civilised community, ought to be one of the worst crimes people can commit, other than crimes of violence. If our tax morality here in Ireland is such that we do not regard it as being a crime, then it is up to this House to give a lead to public opinion and to try to get people to see what crime it is to steal from the people of Ireland, which is what tax evasion is as against tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>Tax avoidance I leave to the consciences of those who do it.  They are within the law.  They are entitled to do it.  If we cannot make the law tight enough to catch them, that is our funeral.  It is they who will have to justify to their consciences eventually having used the law to get around paying their fair share of taxes.  Those who evade taxes are people we cannot leave to their consciences.  They are people in respect of whom society should take action.  I would like to see a society in which a man who was caught out in tax evasion is seen for what he is, a criminal against society, stealing from the rest of the people.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points I wanted to make in regard to the budget.  I am glad I had the opportunity to do so in the short time available to me. Just to recapitulate, the budget is, in my view, totally justified economically.  I have given chapter and verse for that. To do anything less would be to risk jobs, to risk the prosperity and livelihood of people, to let the economy drift, and that we are not entitled to do. I have shown from the various economic sources I have been able to adduce that there is no question of this budget being inflationary.  On the contrary, by achieving expansion in these circumstances and increasing demand and output it will spread overheads and, if anything, will tend to bring prices down&mdash;but not, I fear, very much.  It is very hard to keep prices down even by policies of non-expansion.</P>
    <P>I have shown that our primary concern in this budget was with the poor. I have shown what we have done in this and the previous budget to help <Col N="1714" /> them in a way they have never been helped before.  I have shown our concern for tax reform and for tax simplification. I have shown our concern that where there are injustices in the tax system, particularly in the income tax system through allowances not being increased, that has now been changed and that a policy of increasing these allowances in an equitable way has now been instituted.  These are things a budget should do and this budget does them.  It is a budget of which we, on this side of the House, can be proud and happy to defend at any chapel gate in any part of the country.</P>

      <P>It is a budget which I hope will see us through the rest of this year and which will keep our economy moving ahead and leave us in reasonably good shape next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would not want anyone to think that the conditions which made it possible for us this year, to give substantial&mdash;even massive&mdash;tax reliefs and massive social welfare benefits adding up to almost £50 million will be there every year.  I do not want to suggest that this can be done every year.  The fact that no extra taxes were imposed this year does not mean that in future years extra taxes will not have to be imposed.  People should not be spoiled by this year's budget.  In future years taxes will have to be increased.  That will become necessary and appropriate from time to time.  This year it was not the right course of action economically. We were advised against it by every independent source of advice and were advised to take the action we did take.  Other years will bring their own problems that will have to be resolved.  No doubt there will be times when expansion of demand will be so rapid that it will have to be checked. There may even be times when we shall have to go for a budget surplus for that purpose; and if that is the right thing to do, we will do it in this Government.  This year we have done what we thought was right and were <Col N="1715" /> advised was right and what we believe is right and what I think will put this country on the right course in the months ahead.  We have done it in a way that will secure social justice and equity on a scale which we have not hitherto seen in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to speak on this budget which I consider to be the first National Coalition budget.  I say that because I considered and did mention that last year when the Minister for Finance introduced the 1973 budget he was just sowing on ground we had ploughed and tilled.  The fact that substantial helps and aids were given to social welfare recipients in 1973 we attribute directly to the EEC bonanza which the Minister has mentioned here and that £29 million or £30 million was available to us which normally would not be available because it would be expended on agricultural subsidies to help sell our products abroad.  We feel that we, more than any other party, were responsible for that because we saw to it that our entry to EEC was secured. Those who now coalesce with the Minister were not at all anxious that we should take that step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>On a personal basis, and lip service, I would say, if even that.  I wonder why the Minister mentioned that the EEC bonanza was a once-and-for-all bonanza and that anything he has done this year was done without that aid.  As an ordinary person, not as an expert economist, my view is that this EEC money which we save on agricultural subsidies is now available each year.  Perhaps the Minister means that if they want to do something extra they must find the extra money elsewhere. It would be wrong to try to mislead the people and persuade them that the money gained from the EEC was gained only in 1973 and was not available in 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first Coalition budget and I should like to compliment the members of the Labour Party on being able to assert themselves to <Col N="1716" /> such an extent.  We hear of mongrel foxes being able to sway the pack but I never believed that the little Labour Party would be able to take over the Coalition Government to the extent they have done.  It is no wonder that they were so loud in their acclamation yesterday and gave the Minister a standing ovation.</P>
    <P>In my foolishness at one stage I forecast that the Labour Party would lose their identity when they coalesced in the present Government. Now it looks as if it is the Fine Gael Party that are likely to lose their identity and disappear.  It is well for them that they have seen the light and have decided to run individual candidates under individual flags in the local elections and that they are not fighting on a National Coalition basis. I trust the reference the Minister made to chapel gates was in connection with the local elections.  Or, was it a sign that we might expect a general election? If he is prepared to fight it on any issue and have this budget judged on any criteria, I can assure him my party are prepared to do the same. But the fact that Labour seem to exert an influence out of all proportion to their number in the present Government reminds me of the Cork schoolboy with a rather pronounced accent who was sent to Oxford to get a nice cultured accent.  The upshot was that the professors there were speaking with a Cork accent within six months.  I see a distinct resemblance in what is happening here.</P>
    <P>Going home last night I was thinking what word to use to describe this budget.  I see that people were asked the same question on television.  The word I decided on was &ldquo;chancey&rdquo;, not that I would say that the Minister for Finance is a chancer but it is a budget that I feel is taking a big chance.  The previous speaker said that there were no risks or chances in this budget.  I hope his opinion is borne out.  In today's paper I see that my fellow county man, who is a political correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i> referred to the budget as one of a gambler.  We in Kildare who are fond of a bet realise the dangers of gambling although this might not <Col N="1717" /> deter us from having a flutter.  If possible, we always try to bet with what we can afford to lose.  I wonder is the Minister gambling with what we cannot afford to lose?  Is he taking too great a chance and if his gamble does not come off could it lead to the chaos which happened before?  The appellation I would apply to the Minister would be &ldquo;risky Richie&rdquo;.  He took a chance last year and it came off; perhaps that spurred him on to take a bigger chance this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that Members of the House should be described as Deputies and office holders should be described by the position they hold as Minister or Parliamentary Secretary, Taoiseach or Tánaiste as the case may be.  The Deputy has referred to the Minister for Finance and he should be referred to as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to refrain from such remarks which the Chair finds so objectionable.  I hope that the forecasts so persuasively, so clinically, mathematically correct, given by the previous speaker are borne out in the course of the year.  If percentages such as those he can trot out so readily and so trippingly were always correct, one would always back winners.  This year we have budgeted for a deficit of £80 million approximately and it seems to be the theme of the budget to give the people all we can and not ask them for anything more in return.  When this was mentioned last night&mdash;I was watching television&mdash;my son asked me how this could be done, rather a fundamental and innocent type of question but something that I suppose any normal person would ask.  How is it proposed to give as much as you can and ask for nothing more in return?  The answer is that the Minister hopes that things will work out even better than the experts forecast.  If things go badly and if the local elections were over, or the general election which the Minister hinted about, a supplementary budget could be brought in at that stage to fool the voters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that half the extra money available was being <Col N="1718" /> used to cushion the poor against inflation. He felt that that was a top priority with the present Government. There was no mention of any remedial action to be taken and no effort to stop inflation.  While that may be the priority of this budget, perhaps it gives us an insight into the biggest fault in the budget.  Nothing has been done to stop inflation.  My reading of this is that the National Coalition Government have said that their policy is to let inflation go.  Government spending is rising by 50 per cent. If this continues where will it stop? Are there enough incentives to build up our economy, improve our exports and balance of payments?  Therein lies the real way in which we can improve our country.  To pay our way and try to curb inflation is the proper way to improve our living standards.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a litany of items for which he felt the National Coalition Government could claim credit.  Among them he mentioned social welfare recipients and new schemes which were introduced.  I give him credit for them.  I compliment him on his endeavours to put a face on social welfare.  He mentioned also the domiciliary care allowance of £25 per month for severely mentally handicapped children.  That was a very good scheme to bring in. Dáil questions which I have tabled and endeavoured to pursue have indicated to me that sufficient moneys were not available to implement this scheme in full.  The programme manager in the Eastern Health Board indicated this and reiterated his first statement at the March meeting when he said that he would look for more funds.  There are 60 cases still to be decided in Kildare.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health if he would pay all who qualified or if there would be a further investigation which might determine the degree of severity from the point of view that handicapped children are divided into severely, moderately, mentally or mildly handicapped. At this stage they are being subjected to a stiffer examination in the hope that fewer people might qualify.  The Minister said that this <Col N="1719" /> was done without the EEC bonanza. This is not a once-and-for-all bonanza but an ongoing thing.  We are freed from paying agricultural subsidies each year and therefore this money is available.  Therefore it is wrong for the Minister to say that anything he did this year was done without the benefit of the EEC bonanza.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that the only possible way one could steal from a million people was not to pay one's just taxes.  I have a feeling that the present Minister managed to steal from three million people last year with his famous clawback of children's allowances.  The fact that this clawback has been withdrawn this year proves that it must have been found to be morally wrong and therefore had to be dropped.</P>
    <P>I found the Minister for Foreign Affair's speech very persuasive.  He was an expert in full spate for some time.  He was so definite and so sure that I envied him.  His summing up was that with all this expert advice we could not go wrong.  I felt heartened when I heard that.  There are people in the country who foolishly enough feel that we might be going wrong.  I want to sound a word of warning.  I remember there were experts and financial wizards in previous Coalition Governments too. For some unfortunate reason we did go wrong despite this wealth of expertise. I wonder how they got on in America without the Minister's expertise.  Some might say that it is a waste of talent to have such a man gallivanting around Europe when he might be at home minding the coffers.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the social welfare benefits, that this was a social budget of a Government which cared and which has made great social strides.  I agree with that in part.  Last year £39 million extra was given to social welfare recipients.  This year they got an increase of 18 per cent.  So far as social welfare recipients are concerned that means that they are just 4 per cent ahead of the posse now. By the time the year is out they will <Col N="1720" /> have been caught by inflation, which is being allowed to run riot.  No attempt is being made to curb it.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with some of the items in the budget and some of the social welfare advances which have been made.  I compliment the Minister on the fact that the widows will get their pensions immediately.  This Government say they are concerned to alleviate poverty.  When it is all boiled down this budget will be seen not to help the poor to the extent it is supposed to.  The poor, most of whose meagre means goes on fuel and food, will be hit worst by this budget.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker compared our social welfare programme with his and mentioned the advances made in the social welfare field for the past two years.  The advances made last year were largely attributable to our good work.  It is not our fault if we want to make comparisons with previous Coalition Governments that we have to go back so far.  It was the wisdom of the people which ordained that that is how it should be.  If we went back we would see that in three years social welfare recipients got 2/6d, or 12½p, increase in children's allowances.  Nobody can feel very happy about an increase in children's allowance of 30p.  That amount would not pay the increase in the price of a bottle of milk a day for the child.</P>
    <P>Despite the protestations of the Minister and his anxiety to help people.  I am aware that the ordinary working people found that their tax-free allowances for the year 1972-73, when we were in office, were more than the tax-free allowances they had for 1973-74.  I have seen many examples of that, despite galloping inflation.  The manner in which income tax is being assessed under the new income tax code is more reasonable and more easily understood.  People are not too sure yet where they stand.  Having heard the Minister say last year that people were getting a better deal, and having seen in effect that they got a worse deal.  I will reserve judgment until I see how this works out.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister did not pick out the worst examples but the <Col N="1721" /> ones he did pick out were nothing to write home about.  Possibly they are the best examples.  A single man earning £12 per week will save 50p per week.  A man earning £40 per week will save 65p per week.  I will wait to pass judgment on the income tax reforms until we see the hard facts concerning them during the year.  The people who agreed to participate in the national wage agreement did so hoping they would get something more reasonable than what has been granted.  There has been a breach of confidence.</P>
    <P>I know of a night watchman who got a job in a factory after he retired. At Christmas time he was given £5 in addition to his small wage.  The Minister took more than £1 tax out of that little Christmas box.  The gift tax we are talking about now is really nothing new.</P>
    <P>We have heard much of the Government's commitment to remove VAT from food.  We were told it would help poor people.  It did not make any difference.  Food prices escalated as never before.  When VAT was taken off food it should also have been taken off fuel.  The Taoiseach mentioned on one occasion that he did not think that was a necessity and said that fuel was only a seasonal thing.  Fuel has become a subject that we have reason to talk about.  Some old age pensioners who have no sophisticated means of heating and cooking find that fuel is not seasonal for them.  A poor, deluded woman in my own parish decided before the last election that she would not vote for the party I represent.  She said she would vote for the others because they would give her a bag of coal at 10s.  We have not become completely decimalised in our area yet.  That poor woman now realises that she would want a small bag and a small child to carry home 50p worth of coal.  The people who are paying so dearly for turf, coal or cylinders of gas now realise that fuel is not so seasonal. The removal of VAT from food, and the increases in other items, was a big mistake.  The removal of VAT did not help food prices but drove other prices sky-high.</P>

      <P>This pamphlet was issued by an election agent of Fianna Fáil in Kildare prior to the exit of the last Coalition Government.  It told the women of Kildare that the Coalition then gave them cheaper beer and tobacco but dearer butter, bacon, biscuits, cheese, bread, coal, coffee, chocolate, eggs, flour, footwear, jam, marmalade, milk, oranges, oatmeal, pepper, petrol, margarine, oil, sausages, tinned food, turf, firewood, and so on.  In addition, the national health contributions were higher as well as unemployment insurance and the cost of postal stamps.  The men of Kildare were asked what was the good of a rise in wages when Coalition prices took away the benefit so received and more as well.  The late William Norton was Minister at that time and he blamed the war in Korea.  That was <Col N="1723" /> his excuse.  There was a war in Europe and a world war when Fianna Fáil were in office and yet they kept the cost of living lower than it is now.</P>

      <P>A bad worker is always prone to blame his tools.  I remember the Minister for Industry and Commerce saying that food prices would not increase.  He tried to persuade people on television that food prices would not increase.  Food prices increased by 13 per cent since the last budget and they are forecast to increase by 14 per cent this year. Any housewife can speak about the food prices which increase every month, every week and even every day.  No move is being made by the present Government to keep down food prices despite the declaration in a message from the Tánaiste who, speaking as Leader of the Labour Party in an election handout before the last election, said that there was an alternative to price rises, redundancy and the crippling rates burden. Deputy Corish said that there was an alternative to a tired, incompetent Government.  After 16 years we had a reason for being tired but the present Government are showing every sign <Col N="1724" /> of incompetence after only one year. Their efforts to keep down rising prices are not responsible for making them tired.  If there is an alternative to rising prices&mdash;and the Leader of the party with whom Deputy Kelly coalesced said there was&mdash;now is the time to lead the trump card.</P>
      <P>Oil prices are being blamed for the big troubles at present.  We all agree that huge taxation accrues to the State from taxation on oil.  The fact that we now have dearer oil as a result of the increases in prices abroad has led to dearer transport, dearer materials and dearer goods and has made our goods less competitive abroad.  I would suggest to the Government that if they are so interested in keeping down oil prices they should look for less tax from oil. If they want to know where the tax is to come from I would say that they could make good the loss with tax on cigarettes, beer and spirits.</P>

      <P>I told you about that at one stage before we had a party with a social conscience that would not dream of doing anything to interfere with the course of justice.  I will get around to that before I finish. Every lounge bar I pass at weekends seems to be packed.  One of the greatest ills in our country is excessive drinking.  Those people should pay more or, if they do not prefer to pay more, they should spend the same amount on drink and pay more tax.  If they want to they can smoke less.  If we are to hear the old chestnut about the old age pensioner with his ounce of tobacco and the pint which he likes so much, with the tax we would get from cigarettes, beer and spirits we would be in a position to give him a little more to compensate him.  Not so long ago in my innocence I felt that we had reached the point of diminishing returns with regard to the tax on beer, spirits and cigarettes, but I have now come to the conclusion that there is no end to what people will pay if they want to smoke and drink.  We should face up to our responsibilities and let them <Col N="1725" /> make this sacrifice to secure jobs here at home and to help us to sell our goods abroad and maintain our slender hold on markets abroad.</P>

      <P>I want to say a word about taxation on farmers.  I grant to the previous speaker that this is in lieu of estate duty, and to try to recoup to the Government of the day the amount of money that will be lost if estate duty is done away with.  I am a bit at sea. The fog which was mentioned the other day has not yet been dispersed so far as I am concerned.  I should like to know is there an end to estate duty now.  Are farmers with valuations of under £100 free from tax and free from estate duty?  The new proposals will not come into operation this year.  I believe that if farmers are liable to tax they should pay tax but I do not think a valuation of £100 is the yardstick to use.  How that was arrived at is hardly worth going into.</P>

      <P>If the Minister intends to tax farmers it is up to him to devise a scheme which will enable farmers' incomes to be assessed properly, and to tax all farmers liable without exception the same as everyone else is taxed.  It appears to me that the big farmer has been singled out in this exercise.  We are told 9,000 people are involved.  I look upon this as a socialistic onslaught on very rich people.  Because it is not applicable to all who deserve to be caught in a tax net it is unwarranted and unrealistic and it is most unlikely to succeed.  All through the White Paper the underlying theme is to redistribute the nation's wealth. That is really why the thin end of the wedge is now being inserted.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that farmers should be taxed.  All farmers who are assessed as being liable should pay. When this was mentioned yesterday it caused my colleague in the Labour benches of the National Coalition Parties, Deputy Bermingham, to say &ldquo;Good&rdquo; as reported in the papers today.  This convinces me that we are both of the same mind about this.  I would examine this vague proposal before I would pronounce it as being good, and I think I would come to the decision that, while the idea is good, the <i>modus operandi</i> is very bad. To my mind it is the worse of two evils.  If it is in exchange for estate duty, many of those who contemplate leaving the country would willingly accept estate duty back.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 46 of chapter 4 of the booklet <i>Capital Taxation</i> reads :</P>
      <P>In modern conditions, the system of taxation must be seen to be fair if it is to be acceptable to the community at large.  This fairness implies that not only must the tax system be administered with impartiality but that the tax structure must itself be such that the generality of citizens will readily recognise and appreciate that it is equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1728" /> The generality of farmers will not appreciate or believe that this system is equitable.  It is most unlikely that I will ever be affected by the capital gains tax but I know that it has caused frightful concern in the area I represent. A constituent of mine called last month and he was very upset about the capital gains tax.  I will not quote him literally but his concern was at the time for the rapid removal of these illegitimates, to put it that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital gains tax is wrong from the point of view that it does not take inflation into account. It will be no help to our economy.  If the Minister has not already read it, it might be to his advantage to read an extract from a pamphlet issued by David Sinnott in which he says:</P>
      <P>The way to crush the bourgeoisie, said Lenin, is to grind them between the millstones of taxation and inflation.</P>
      <P>The Minister's Labour colleagues may not have quoted this to him but the millstones were set in motion yesterday by the Minister who officially pressed the button.  I feel he was only a puppet and the strings were being pulled by his colleagues with whom he was forced, rather reluctantly, to coalesce.  I trust that the outcome will justify the grinding of the unfortunates affected by this capital gains tax. I am convinced that it is only the thin end of the wedge and that we will have much more later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a word or two on the wealth tax and its effect on industry. We are possibly the least advanced industrially of the EEC countries.  The greatest deterrent to the expansion of our industrial economy would be lack of money.  Money can be got only if we retain profits or we borrow or get capital from abroad.  I am convinced that the climate at the moment in this country has not been improved by the issue of the White Paper.  I am convinced also that small family industries such as those I know well in <Col N="1729" /> Monasterevan and other places, which I presume would not have been allowed to grow at all had Fine Gael been in power, have now reached a stage where they are competitive.  This could be very detrimental to their chances.  I fear, too, that a wealth tax will be charged to a company even if its trading has been conducted at a loss over the year.</P>
    <P>I notice that to justify many of these taxes the Minister continuously reverts to examples in the USA and the United Kingdom.  Why should we always look for examples there when we are a small island of three million people only?  Could we not look after our own affairs and entice people to come here rather than repel them because that appears to have been the effect of the recent announcements and encourage investment in this country by people from abroad? I feel that if we gave everybody a good living in this country and allowed those people who work hard and long hours reap the benefit of their endeavours it might be better for the country as a whole.  Russia is possibly the ultimate in socialism but it would be well to investigate if it is a success there.  If we remove an incentive, could we not get just a mediocrity?  It might be no harm to refer the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleague to a biblical parable where Our Lord gave three different people some talents.  He did not give them all the same amount.  He gave a different amount to each one.  Afterwards He asked them to account for the talents they had been given.  One worked with them and made more; one buried his in the ground and when the day of reckoning came returned with what he had got.  The Lord's attitude was that those who had been faithful over little things were placed over many.  Of course, that was years ago.  If the fellow were alive today and buried his talent he could be sure that when he would come back he would get an equal share with all the others.  There would be no need for him to work very hard at all.</P>
    <P>I do know that when these announcements were made in the White Paper they did cause a rush of <Col N="1730" /> money out of this country.  I am not saying this lightly.  By the Thursday from one bank alone I think £10 million had been removed from this country.  I have information from a fairly reliable source that £40 million was removed from another bank. Perhaps the Minister would make inquiries and tell us how much money did leave the country as a result of the announcements in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned about the bloodstock industry and I am glad to see that my concern is reciprocated on the other side of the House.  This is, indeed, a very sensitive area and very important to the constituency I represent.  I welcome the special treatment that has been promised.  I, like the Minister, recognise the high risk, the big investment in this industry and the years of waiting which sometimes occur before the investment pays off.  I do know that the bloodstock and racing industry, as a whole, is now experiencing a very serious and trying time.  Although most people might not believe it, if the owners of racehorses and possibly bloodstock too&mdash; even the most successful&mdash;were to be averaged out, it would be found that they race for pleasure and not for any benefit they might get from it.  The big money prizes that were available to us in France and elsewhere have been denied now to our owners.  It is important that we endeavour to keep race horses and racing interests here. I am well aware of the difference that an investment in bloodstock can make in an area, the amount of local <Col N="1731" /> employment and the market for our farm produce it can create.  I am sure that our balance of payments has helped the sale of our horses abroad. These people have done a lot in keeping our name to the forefront.  I think we should do everything we can to attract investors and buyers to this country.  If any derogatory step were taken now, years of work and an uphill grind could be lost.  It would be catastrophic if anything happened to harm this industry now.  I do know it would take very little to cause many owners and trainers, too, to leave this country.  A wrong word from the Minister could bring this about and we might be a long time asking: Will he no come back again?  If that happened.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether or not he did experience any financial trouble during the year.  It is our opinion and that of Deputy Colley who spoke yesterday that he did.  One of the things that should cause anyone concern should be the failure of the national loan.  That must have been because people had no confidence.  Perhaps they had no spare money.  Perhaps no incentive is given to them to save but the fact that the loan was very poorly subscribed to should be a cause of concern to us all.  The fact, too, that the Minister had to scrape the barrel for £20 million borrowed from the Central Bank&mdash;which was stacked away to prevent inflation; I suppose he would have willingly robbed the child's piggy bank at that stage if his troubles were of such a nature&mdash; indicates to me that it could well be that this country could be heading for disaster or ruin.  Perhaps I could be regarded as a prophet of doom but history does repeat itself.  And remember that under two previous Coalition Governments this did happen. It might be well were the Minister to ask himself: is our policy correct?  And if he is in any doubt about it would that not afford him an opportunity to pull up his socks, dampen down inflation?  He might well ask himself: is this policy of taking as much as one can from the rich to help the poor a good one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> Somewhere in the White Paper&mdash;I regret I am unable to find it now&mdash; there was a term used in relation to the removal of wealth from the rich. It was called a levelling down process. That expression is not a very fortunate one.  It would have been much better had they decided to level up rather than down.  Why drag one section of the community down to the level of another rather than elevate the poorer section?  Is our economy ready for the chances now being taken?  Should we continue to live on borrowed money or should we try to pay our way?</P>
    <P>I should mention that reference has been made to the promise of social justice and the protection of the individual. That was believed by the gullible and some time ago I promised the Parliamentary Secretary I would refer to it.  Some people believed we were in for an era of pure politics; this was added to by the media until they became sickened recently.  The rash of political appointments, of peace commissioners and judges, the more brazen family appointments by some Ministers, and the fact that the taxation regarding mines has not been faced up to squarely, have tarnished our reputation abroad.  The decision regarding the mines was detrimental to us in the eyes of some people.  They think we are not to be trusted and this was something that never happened before. We have lost some of our good name and we will have a job to restore it.</P>

      <P>A person of a different political persuasion was appointed by Fianna Fáil.  This will give an indication of the patronage that was not exerted in all cases.  There is a recession in the building industry and there can be no doubt about that.  The housing situation last year was good and we should compliment the Minister. In our small way we helped to bring that about because the provision of sites, of water and sewerage services for the houses about which the Minister now boasts, was our good work.  However, huge injections of money are needed for this.  Have we got the amount of capital expenditure needed for water and sewerage services?  Today the Minister said that £2 million was not available to him to keep down building society interest rates.  If we could have a subvention from some quarter to help the unfortunates who must pay hundreds of pounds to have an electricity supply, we would be doing good work.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was persuasive in his arguments to the Government that he needed £40 million for the next five years for his Department.  I realise that telephones are necessary and that money should be found for them but there are other matters that also need help.  The greatest difference between Fianna Fáil and the present administration is that we represent a broad cross-section of the country.  We tried to help all sections, not to single out one more than another.  We may have done a little for all and not enough for everyone but we made the effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Minister has been genuine in his intentions.  I can appreciate that all the policies may not be those of his party, that he has to contend with elements in the Labour Party who are diametrically opposed to rational Fine Gael thinking.  For instance, I do not believe anyone really wanted the health services to be free for everyone.  Probably this was regarded as a socialist concept that had to be accepted.  We should <Col N="1734" /> have improved the lot of the poorer people holding medical cards, or those barely above that level, and we should have raised the income ceiling.  We should not blame the doctors or consultants for our failure.  We all know who to blame for the failure with regard to the health services.  To borrow a phrase, possibly more appropriate now than before, do not blame the Government, change it.</P>
    <P>The Minister decided to take a chance in this budget.  He is borrowing a lot and he hopes to repay it later.  For all our sakes I hope his gamble comes off.  Certain Government decisions taken during the year have not proved very attractive to investors.  They have not encouraged people to save.  We need money to cure many of our ills and we should not drive our investors away.  There is no incentive to save now.  There is a thought abroad that it is foolish for anyone to provide for the future. I would ask the Minister not to gamble with the future of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the budget, to which I give full and absolute support.  As a young man coming into public life some 12 or 13 years ago, I believed there were many ills in society and I wondered why people did not deal with them in order to eradicate many of the objectionable things in our society.</P>
      <P>At that time Fine Gael were going through an evolutionary process and we introduced what is commonly known as the just society policy document. As one of the Deputies who gave complete support to that thinking, I welcome the budget because it is in the direction of a just society. There is not much point in talking about a just society from the Opposition benches if the members are not prepared to give weight to their thinking when they are in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time, to the best of my knowledge, an Opposition party have not tabled amendments to the proposals incorporated in the budget. Yesterday they merely gave token opposition to the budget generally and this is rather unusual.  It seems <Col N="1735" /> to suggest that even Fianna Fáil subscribe to the just society, that they are conscious of the need for a better society south of the Border, and this was demonstrated by their reluctance to oppose any aspect of the budget by walking through the lobbies.  If that is so I welcome it because we are becoming politically mature.</P>
    <P>A Deputy from a Border county cannot help but compare, often with little pride, the conditions on the northern side and the southern side of the Border.  I would not exchange many of the things we have in the south but being a British subject in this small island has economic advantages. Frequently in the course of debate with people who do not subscribe to my political thinking, they rightly point out the disadvantages of unemployed people South of the Border, the disadvantages in not providing proper housing for people in the South, the disadvantage people in the middle income group have if they are not holders of medical cards when a member of the family falls sick, to say nothing of the entire under-privileged section of our society. I, as one who believes in the concept of a united Ireland, would find it very difficult to argue against this particular aspect if one were to take on in debate the question of the advantage of the benefits to which I have just referred.  I wish to put on record now my complete, absolute and total support for the kind of political thinking the Minister has put into this budget.</P>
    <P>In this particular year, housing will be increased.  I am giving the figures for the 12-month period realising this is a nine-month budget.  In the year 1972-73, the year in which we had the last Fianna Fáil budget, the figure for housing was £45.4 million.  In this budget it is £77.23 million.  Like many other Members, even in the Fianna Fáil Party, I am deeply conscious of the need for more and better houses for our people.  I cannot close my eyes to the fact that there are too many in my constituency who need housing.  I cannot close my eyes to the fact that in a <Col N="1736" /> small village where you build 20 houses the net result very often is a quarrel between neighbours as to who should or who should not get houses. Ill-feeling is generated between neighbours because not enough houses are built.</P>
    <P>As most Deputies will appreciate, in a small rural town where 20 houses are built one can have a situation in which ten applicants will decide themselves and the local knowledge county councillors and Deputies obtain indicates to them at a glance that these ten will occupy the first ten of the 20 houses built.  Out of the next 20 applicants ten other people have got to be picked and, no matter what permutation you use, you will end up with ten dissatisfied people.  My experience is that those ten people fall out with everyone.  They blame public representatives for ratting on them and they blame the Government for not building enough houses.  They claim the people who have been successful have used ignoble tactics because they have taken an unfair advantage and they themselves have been cheated.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of society to which I totally and absolutely object, a society that sees only the minimum need, a society which creates friction in a locality which will last until the unsuccessful applicants find alternative housing accommodation and I fully endorse what the Minister has done in providing extra money to build houses. I hope that in future the policy we have been advocating in Donegal&mdash;it has received a certain amount of support from the Fianna Fáil members of the council&mdash;of ending this stop-go policy with regard to housing has been finished and done with.  I would recommend the Government to give instructions to housing authorities to the effect that when an organisation is set up by a contractor to build a scheme of houses, that contractor should continue building houses in different stages until all housing needs have been satisfied instead of the present policy of building 20 houses and building no more for the next ten years.  That lends itself to abuse.  It does not serve any purpose and it is, in my opinion, bad management.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> The Minister has increased the sum for sanitary and environmental services from £9.93 million to £18.41 million. That is an increase of almost 100 per cent.  Today, everything we buy is bought either in a container or a wrapper of some kind.  Even in public-houses your half dozen of beer comes in disposable bottles.  Sooner or later we will have to say to those responsible that we will not allow them to sell their goods in disposable wrappers or bottles.  Bottles should be returned. I have always questioned the economics of the present system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Where sanitary services are concerned, we in Donegal have been getting a round figure of £300,000 per year from the Government.  The lowest figure we have is, to the best of my recollection, in the region of £3 million.  That figure was prepared by the engineers.  Everything is ready to go to contract but, at a figure of £300,000 per year from the Government, it will take us ten years to get through the programme.  We have not provided for sewerage or water schemes and one cannot build houses without these services.  The Minister has increased the sums by almost 100 per cent this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In education there is an increase from £15.94 million to £22.20 million That is as near a 50 per cent increase as makes no difference.  It is not possible to guage immediately the result of education.  For far too long we have been spending far too little on education.  Some three or four years ago I asked a question about what <Col N="1738" /> amount of the national cake was spent on education in 1931 and in 1968. In 1931, as far as I remember, we were spending about 15 per cent.  In 1968 we were spending something like 4 per cent.  I have not had time to work out what the percentage is this year but it is certainly higher than it ever was when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    <P>This Government came into power at one of the most difficult periods in Irish history.  It is just over 12 months since the last general election and the enthusiasm with which the Government was received.  But the manner in which the people who did not support them in the election received and welcomed the political breath of air that was flowing through the countryside was noticed by the public Press, North of the Border and certainly was not hidden from people like myself.  I am confident that but for the international inflation which has taken place over the last 12 months this Government would have increased their effort, good as they may have been in this budget.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any fair-minded person, be he a member of the Fianna Fáil Party or any group who oppose the National Coalition, can dispute the fact that this has been a very difficult 12 months, but in spite of all that the only taxation which has been imposed is on agriculture.  I come from an agricultural community and I believe that the agricultural industry will not object to the type of taxation which has been imposed.  The type of people who are earning their living from agriculture in County Donegal are fair-minded people; they are people with an over-abundance of commonsense and they realise that it was unhealthy, unjust and totally wrong for them to be collecting income tax from farm labourers and not to be paying tax themselves.</P>
    <P>For those who might find it necessary, for reasons which are not understood by me, to criticise this added taxation it is well to mention that £15 million extra is being provided for agriculture in the budget over and above that which was provided last year.  It is also well to remember that <Col N="1739" /> the farmer with a poor law valuation of £100, if he employs two workmen and if he claims his normal depreciation on machinery and normal claims for personal and family allowances, will not be paying any tax or if he is it will be a very small amount.  I agree that there are large farmers who will be paying income tax; but if we believe in social justice, and as Christians we have got to believe in that, people must help the lame dog over the stile.</P>
    <P>I make no apologies for increasing taxation and I will pay my own share of it if this is to provide a society where parents of mentally handicapped children will have security in the knowledge that if anything happens to the husband the widow will not be saddled with the responsibility of looking after that mentally handicapped child for the rest of her life and then wonder what will happen to the child if she dies.  Sufficient funds are being made available for any child who is mentally handicapped to have free institutional care for the remainder of that child's life.</P>
    <P>This has been achieved by efforts of the Fianna Fáil Party, and for this I acknowledge their interest, but it has not been achieved without taxation.  I I do not believe that there is any Deputy in this House, or any person in the country, who would dispute paying income tax or taxation to provide a society that will do these things because the handicap of being mentally handicapped does not confine itself to political parties.  It does not confine itself to any particular family nor to any particular income bracket. In some of the most remarkable families in the world&mdash;the royal family in Britain has had its sad cases and a sister of the late President Kennedy is also evidence of it&mdash;have had their share of such tragedy. Therefore, none of us can rule out the fact that it could be our next child who could be mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>The same argument can be put forward in support of taxation for physically handicapped people.  I offer no apology to anyone and anyone who takes exception to what I say is no <Col N="1740" /> great friend of mine.  I do not profess to be a socialist; I do not profess to be a capitalist; but I am a rare type of individual who just likes to see people getting a fair deal, particularly people who have handicaps over which they have no control.  This brings me to the case of the unmarried mother.  More money is made available in this budget so that the child of an unmarried mother can be kept at home and so that the mother will be able to support that child without feeling any obligation to claim from the St. Vincent de Paul Society or going to the local home assistance officer.  It will be done now with a certain amount of dignity and this is something that the people of the South of Ireland&mdash;I say purposely the South of Ireland&mdash;have given their consent to, despite the holier individuals in the inner society who would make us believe that they are holier than the Pope and who feel that it is morally wrong to support an illegitimate child.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to these people that if they do not get sufficient funds for the support of the child the alternative is that the child will starve to death.  My experience has been that in the past this was a sin against the family, an embarrassment in the family circle and, therefore, the quicker the baby was got away to an orphanage the better.  I should like to ask Deputies to recognise the care, attention and the services which religious orders and lay people have provided in these orphanages.  Nevertheless can one imagine more unnatural circumstances for a child than to be locked away in an institution with, in the case of a boy, all boys and in the case of a girl, all girls? According to my social concept any child who is born with a handicap is the responsibility of society and a child who is born out of wedlock has a handicap over which he has no control.  The thinking behind the idea originally of putting these children in orphanages may have been acceptable in its time but in retrospect it can only be described as having been penal to do this and to expect any such child to behave later in the same <Col N="1741" /> manner as one would expect a child to behave who had been brought up within a family unit.  Therefore I pay tribute to Fianna Fáil for having initiated the type of policy we are pursuing and I compliment the present Government for providing benefit so as to enable a mother to keep her child in the family circle.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said that because of the wealth tax there has been a constant flow of money from the country.  The facts do not bear that out because in January and February of this year the capital inflow was £10 million and since the publication of the White Paper the inflow in March alone was £34 million.  Therefore the type of remark that Deputy Power made is highly dangerous and I hope that the Deputy will consult with perhaps a better authority and will correct that statement.</P>
    <P>This year the Government will be providing £315,000 towards youth and sports organisations.  The figure for 1972-73 was £170,000 so that the increase this year is of the extent of almost 100 per cent.  A sum of £315,000 seems generous; while I welcome it, it is not adequate.  During my many visits to Belfast in my efforts to try to understand the human conflict there, I have been told that the recent troubles have spotlighted the need for better community facilities for the people generally and for the youth in particular.  I am not an authority on this subject for the rest of the country but my experience in Donegal has been that we are sadly lacking in this respect.  I do not know of one housing estate in Donegal that was provided by the housing authority in which there was provided as much as a football pitch.  Recently we had a discussion on whether we should spend £180 in supplementing the efforts of a community in Milford. In the council chamber there was a political wrangle as to who should get the credit for the effort.  In my opinion responsibility lies with the Government and with local government. To say the least, it is bad planning not to provide these facilities. It represents a dangerous and a shortsighted policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely making the point that while the sum of £315,000 may be generous it may not be sufficient to implement the type of policy that I, for example, would subscribe to.  I beg the Chair's indulgence but if I am allowed a few moments I shall make the point I was developing, that is, that the Government and local government, acting in close liaison with each other, must provide facilities for youth when houses are being built.  Perhaps the Minister would give his attention to this matter in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>As a nation, if we are serious in our desire for the building of a society south of the Border with which our Northern brothers would even consider identification, there is an urgent obligation on us to ensure that the Government will be successful in what they are trying to do.  Perhaps in the national interest Fianna Fáil proved to us that they were politically mature and that we have all become politically mature in not opposing the type of social thinking that the Minister has put before us on the occasion of this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any Government have been presented with an issue more severe or more dangerous than that which has prevailed in the North of Ireland during the past four years with its resultant loss of lives and of millions if not billions of pounds in the course of claims by one side or the other to be put right.  Any Southern Government, party or society which does not recognise the duty we have in endeavouring to help people in the North out of their entrenched positions do not hear the cry of the Northern people.  There is nothing attractive in our society at present that will win over the support, the confidence or the interest of the Northern Unionist, not to mention the Northern Loyalists.  Therefore there is a duty on the Government. There is an equally heavy responsibility on the people to support the Government, and there must be a <Col N="1743" /> wilingness on the part of our society to change.  If we are to be thought of as a constructive society in the Republic we must be prepared to change willingly and to recognise the rights of minorities.  The majority must agree to give minorities their rights, be the people demanding certain rights the under-privileged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Unless our politicans give a lead to society in general, unless they are prepared to try to bridge the divisions that exist at the moment, they will not be playing their required part in helping to solve the national question of reunification.  We must provide better social welfare services, better health services, better housing, more money for the underprivileged.  Otherwise we will not be doing our duty.  It is necessary that a completely new society emerges here.  Otherwise we would not attract people in Northern Ireland to join us.</P>

In my contribution on this motion I shall give credit where it is due and I hope the few remarks I have to make will be accepted as being fair.</P>
      <P>I accept that a budget along the general lines of this one was needed to cure the harm done by the massive inflation of the past 12 months. If it were not for the little extra given to the social welfare classes I do not know what would happen to them.  The oil crisis has been blamed a lot for the raging inflation we are experiencing but we must on both sides admit that no attempt was made to control controllable prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> The Minister for Finance spoke about the £30 million odd of EEC agricultural money which helped last year's budget and he said this money helped to ease the results of the inflation caused by Fianna Fáil.  He said that type of money is not there this year.  If there was £35 million or thereabouts of EEC money saved on agricultural subsidies last year, it is there again this year.  We are still members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>In the last general election campaign we expressed the fear that EEC membership would mean we would be faced with rising prices and it was proposed that extra money would have to be spent in helping social welfare classes to meet these price rises.  It was also admitted that there would have to be wage increases.  At that time the Coalition candidates said there was no occasion for prices to rise.  They did not believe that of course in the context of our EEC membership.  They could not have done so.</P>
    <P>I fought the election campaign in a town where there are many underprivileged people.  Therefore when I see any benefits coming to such people I welcome them.  Last year's budget was a £40 million gamble. This year's is a still bigger gamble and let us hope for the sake of the country that it will come off.  What worries me when I see deficit budgets year after year is whether a <i>cul de sac</i> will be reached.  I wonder if the imminence of the local elections this year is the reason for this budget.</P>
    <P>Now I come to what is to me my most important comment on the budget. All my life I have been associated with farming organisations. What are my views?  My first is that anybody who is liable to pay taxation should pay it, but I wish to make a reservation in regard to farming.  If there are large farms earning large incomes the owners should pay income tax.  We all know that where industry is concerned there are numerous incentives to exporters.  The agricultural industry is the largest exporter and from that point of view alone is entitled to all the incentives <Col N="1745" /> we can give it.  It is the greatest asset the country has.</P>
    <P>The Minister is starting to tax farms with a £100 valuation and leaves it optional as to whether owners go for a valuation basis or for accounts. In my view a valuation basis, pure and simple, is grossly unfair because valuations differ so much from parish to parish and from estate to estate. Anybody who knows the history of land in this country will be aware that in the days of the grand juries landowners applied to have their valuations increased so as to qualify for those juries.  Rates in those days were only a penny or twopence in the £. That type of valuation was passed on to the tenants later.  Consequently, inferior land in one parish could be valued higher than good land one parish away.  For that and other reasons the valuation basis is unfair.</P>
    <P>Under EEC Regulation 259 there are three types of farmers, traditional, developing and commercial.  The traditional and developing farmers should not be asked to keep accounts but the commercial farmers could be asked for taxation purposes.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the accounts system of taxation, I should like to tell people who know nothing about farming what the work is like.  A farmer is a 12 hours a day, seven days a week, four hours on a Sunday man. He has to milk cows in the morning and evening and if he goes to a football match on a Sunday he has to be home to milk his cows.  He has no hours.  In the summer he must work late in the evening and he must watch the weather.  Almighty God plays a big part in a farmer's year.  When the Minister is assessing his income he will find that he works about 76 hours a week.  We will have to allow him a certain salary.  He is entitled to be paid for the hours he works.  The farmer's wife also works on the farm. The Minister will have a difficult job in assessing a fair tax.  I am not saying a farmer should not be taxed but his life is different from that of any other worker or professional person. Admittedly in wintertime he does not have to work such long hours <Col N="1746" /> because he must have his milking done earlier.  Some people here do not understand farming life and its ups and downs.  The farmer depends on Almighty God in every way.  He may have a lucky year with his sheep and cattle or an unlucky one.  I notice that he may opt for either the past year or the present year.  That is good because there can be a very big difference between years.  I have heard people, with no practical experience, telling me: &ldquo;Have all your cows calving at the one time&rdquo;.  They forget that nature plays a big part in that.  You can arrange nothing in farming.  You can try to do it but 20 things can go wrong.  I have no objection whatever, and I do not think any reasonable person has, to people who should pay taxes paying them but the way of life of the farmer is very different from other members of the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be careful not to do anything that would hinder increased production.  For instance, a development farmer is to develop to X amount of money.  We are trying to bring them up to that standard in the EEC.  I can assure the Minister that if there are people in my area who will be taxed their votes are not going my way and never did.  There are very few anyway.  It does not affect my area at all.  However, I must be fair because I have been in farming organisations with men who will be taxed.  I suppose I am not a politician but I try to be fair in all cases and I am putting up a case for people who would hardly ever give me a vote.  That is beside the point.  I want to show how different is the life of a farmer and how different his income and how it goes up and down.  The Minister will have a tough job in assessing a farmer's income.  He works a 12-hour day and he is assisted by his wife and his sons.  Everybody on a farm works.  They have to.</P>
    <P>I welcome everything that has been given in the social welfare sphere.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs quoted figures.  When people quote figures in relation to the cost of living I would like to know what they include in the cost of living.  Is it just food?  There are many essentials other than food <Col N="1747" /> I could not agree with the Minister's figures.  I never use figures because one can do what one likes with figures if one is an expert with them.  I never tried them.  I talk to the people who buy the normal things they always bought in the week.  I talk to them on Saturday night and I am told whether they have much money left or whether they have enough.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister could not do any better in the circumstances but if inflation continues at its present rate I do not see how it can balance out. This is what worries me and also the gambling element in the Budget. Everything is OK if things go right.  I learned when I was young that I had to earn first and spend afterwards. Here we are spending first and depending on Almighty God to earn for us. I am afraid of this.  I hope we will earn it in the interests of country.  I do not give a jot what Government are in power.  I am one of the older generation and, for the length I will be here, whether they are put out or not does not make any difference.  There is a terrible element of gambling in this budget.  I know the Minister had to gamble to a certain extent because he could not afford not to increase the social welfare benefits.  Having been interested all my life in those people, I have to welcome the increases sincerely.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to anyone who should be paying taxes paying them but I had to put forward the farmers' point of view.  I do not think it is understood by many people on the Government benches.  There are many people who are associated with farming but who are not practical farmers. I worked hard all my life on a 50-acre farm.  I know the ups and downs of farming.  I have been associated with small farmers.  Whenever I met a fellow full of theory talking about agriculture I was always able to put him sitting down because I had the practical knowledge.  No matter what job you are at if you have the practical experience you will always cod the fellow with the theory.  If you let him go far enough he will make a fool of himself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> I welcome what is good in the budget: I am worried about the gambling element and I would ask the Minister to be careful on the farming end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday we had a budget introduced in this House by the Minister for Finance and last night the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare on a television interview was asked what were the main features of this budget.  The Tánaiste's answer summed up the main feature of the budget when he replied: &ldquo;Concern.&rdquo; Concern for people is the message of this budget as far as I can see. Despite all the theorising, words, speeches, scripts and calculations, that is what government is about.  It is about people and it is to ensure in a democratic society that our financial affairs, in particular, are organised in such a way that the maximum number are carrying the load and looking after the less fortunate members of our society.  That was very clearly demonstrated by the Minister for Finance on behalf of this Government in yesterterday's budget.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat amused to read some of the political comments this morning and to hear in the contributions by some of the speakers opposite during today's debate the very feeble attempts to grasp on to any straw whatsoever.  God knows, there were few enough of them around in this year's budget for Opposition speakers. They attempted this from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;, from the moment Deputy George Colley stood up and, in what only could be described as delayed shock after the Minister for Finance sat down, tried to make a contribution on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The best that the Fianna Fáil Party spokesman on Finance could do was to try to suggest that this budget was prepared and presented to the nation because there was a danger of a split in the Coalition.  How desperate for an argument can an Opposition speaker be when that was the best he could produce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told in this morning's papers by some political commentators <Col N="1749" /> that the Labour Party were dominating in the Coalition Government, that Fine Gael had to be dragged reluctantly, apparently, to introduce this type of budget.  I would like to refer these commentators and the people on the opposite benches to a document issued by the Fine Gael Party long before there was any Coalition talk.  That was a document called &ldquo;The Just Society&rdquo;, which showed concern for people.  The concern expressed in that document, combined with the concern my party have shown for people, was very clearly expressed in the budget the Minister for Finance introduced yesterday.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that members of the Fianna Fáil Party might have forgotten there was such a document produced.  It set out the policy, aims and objectives of a political party.  It is understandable that Fianna Fáil Deputies would forget this thing because it would be a new thought to any member of the Fianna Fáil Party that policy or objectives should be set down on paper and given to people to read and to use as a reference.  No such documentation exists and, to my knowledge, never has existed as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only policy, so far as I can gather, that has been pursued by Fianna Fáil over the last 20 years has been one of political expediency.  Every decision and every pronouncement has been guided by that one thought, that one objective.  I do not think it has ever been more clear to the people than it has been over the last 13 months that that is the approach of Fianna Fáil to the ills that beset the country, that so far as every issue that has come up, that was not too dangerous to touch, it has been hammered, and blindly hammered on occasions.  They seem to think that the role of an Opposition is to be 100 per cent, 24 hours a day, destructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know something about being in opposition.  I spent eight years in opposition on those benches.  When I came into public life I came in in the belief that I would spend all my public <Col N="1750" /> life in opposition so I had to make a close study of what the role of an Opposition should be.  I can assure the House that it is not solely to be destructive and to offer destructive comment and criticism.  Occasionally, in the national interest, it is necessary to forego your own particular party advantage and offer constructive criticism and, even on occasions, support. I mean this sincerely.  The sooner the Fianna Fáil Party realise that, the better Opposition they will become and the healthier it will be for this Dáil and for this country.</P>
    <P>Naturally, when talking on a budget debate, I would concentrate on social welfare.  I must say, at the outset, that there is quite a lot in the budget in the social welfare area for me to concentrate on but I think we should look at the record not only over the last 13 months, the two budgets that this Coalition Government have introduced and their effect on the people in receipt of social welfare, but in the light of some of the comments I heard from the Opposition benches during the day, it would be instructive and enlightening to look at expenditure in the field of social welfare in some of the budgets over the last ten years.  Eight of those budgets and their commitment to social welfare were introduced by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance.  In the eight years in which Fianna Fáil introduced budgets their total commitment to social welfare was £54 million.  The last speaker said you can do anything with figures, and in most cases I would be inclined to agree with him.  However the figures I am quoting now are very simple, and they are not my figures.  They are on the public record for any Deputy to see.  They are available in the Dáil Library.  In those eight years Fianna Fáil spent £54 million on social welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can make all those allowances when I give him the next piece of information. <Col N="1751" /> In the two budgets, last March and yesterday, the Minister for Finance of this Government, Deputy Richie Ryan, allocated £88 million for social welfare.  There is plenty of room in those two figures to allow for inflation.  The average commitment of Fianna Fáil to social welfare was £7 million per year; the average of this Government in the two budgets it has presented is £44 million per year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that even covers inflation.  However not only has a great deal of money been distributed in this budget and in the previous budget, but something else has been displayed, and I go back to the words of the Tánaiste on Telefís Éireann: that something is concern for people.  If you look at these two budgets you will see the commitment of the Government to the deserted wife, the unmarried mother, unmarried women of 58 years in poor circumstances, prisoners' dependants, six weeks' continuation of social welfare benefit, and something that has been a glaring injustice for a long number of years, the dependant's allowance for a non-contributory old age pensioner.</P>
      <P>These social injustices did not just appear on the scene in March, 1973. They have been there right through the previous 16 years of unbroken Fianna Fáil rule and for a long number of years before that when Fianna Fáil were in Government.  We did not go out and manufacture these ills. They were there, but what was not there was concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most if not all of the Members of this House are fairly seasoned politicians, and representatives on both sides of the House, myself included, were able to judge reasonably accurately how much voting mileage there is in doing or saying a particular thing.  I think it is widely acknowledged&mdash;and I do not think it was widely practised by Fianna Fáil in government&mdash;that there is not really much voting mileage in social <Col N="1752" /> welfare.  We know that, too.  We are also fairly seasoned politicians.  Some of us have been in public life at local and national level for quite a long time.  However, there are certain areas where voting mileage is not a criterion.  That is really what distinguishes the last Administration from the present one.  Realising that, this very heavy financial commitment in the field of social welfare was made by this Government.  In framing a budget the whole approach of the Fianna Fáil Government to social welfare&mdash;and I am not speculating now, because I am in a position to know; I had to speculate for eight long years across in those benches&mdash;was: &ldquo;Let us do everything we think is popular</P>
    <P>In the budget yesterday one other allocation was made, £100,000 for pilot projects on poverty.  The only statistics available to us at the moment&mdash;and we are not even sure of their accuracy because no one showed a particular interest in this area at Government level&mdash;indicate that within our society in 1974 there are 20 per cent of our people living in poverty, not relative poverty, basic poverty, not having enough to eat, not having adequate shelter or clothing.  I mean this seriously.  I should not like to have been a member of a party which would have that record after their long years of rule.</P>
    <P>When one talks in statistics one tends to lose sight of the realities but in <i>The Irish Independent</i> this morning&mdash;and there was much in this and whatever is left let us give it to social welfare.&rdquo; That was the thinking and the attitude of Fianna Fáil. particular publication that I did not agree with&mdash;there was a picture of an old lady of 82 from Seán MacDermott Street.  There was a comment from her on the budget proposals and the increase in her pension.  I have not that paper with me but I think I can quote almost verbatim what she said, this lady living in the heart of our capital city.  She said: &ldquo;I badly need new underwear and new shoes and this will allow me to get them&rdquo;.  She spoke of the price of eggs and said, I think, that they were one shilling each and <Col N="1753" /> that she may now occasionally be able to buy an egg.  That is the scene behind the statistic of 20 per cent living in basic poverty in our society in 1974.  That alone is a terrible indictment of all of us but particularly of the party that ruled so long in this country.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a notion abroad that all you have to do to cure this situation is tax hell out of the rich. That is a very wrong notion to me, not because I am averse to taxing the rich but because it will not solve the problem facing us in regard to poverty.  Statistics say that 5 per cent of the people in this country own a very substantial amount of its wealth. We have 5 per cent at the top, 20 per cent at the bottom and 75 per cent in between and if we are to solve the problem it must be by a combined effort.  I do not regard myself as a wealthy man; in fact I think I could safely say that my total assets are short of my total liabilities.  But I live well; I eat well; I have a good home; I can provide for my wife and children.  I have never seen them hungry, thank God.  I have never seen them cold because of insufficient clothing.  I have been able to take them on short holidays and most of those in the 75 per cent category are in roughly the same position as I am.  We must be prepared to make our contribution towards solving the poverty problem.</P>
    <P>Poverty, I am convinced, cannot be cured by just handing out money weekly.  Poverty, over a long period, can cause tremendous difficulties and ills which are directly related to it and to living in that state.  These are not catered for and if we continue to approach the problem by merely handing out sums of money we are not solving or eliminating the problem; in fact we are perpetuating it. We hope that by these pilot schemes we shall be able to discover the most effective way to deal with poverty.</P>
    <P>I think I should say that the attitude of the previous Administration towards social welfare, as such, and the figures I have quoted, which are the actual figures on record, and the pursuance of that policy was a recruiting sergeant <Col N="1754" /> for the army of poverty existing in our society today and has left us a little frightened at the sheer magnitude of the problem and the commitment all of us must make in order to eliminate it.</P>
    <P>I listened to some Fianna Fáil speakers today.  I think it was Deputy Briscoe who went into great detail on children's allowances, breaking down the allowance into fractions and calculating what the increase meant per day.  It struck me as rather odd that we should be listening to a Fianna Fáil spokesman crying out about the low level of children's allowances in the budget while his own Government, when they were in power, had given only four increases in children's allowances over ten years.  This Government in last year's budget made a very notable advance in that field by giving a very substantial increase and continued to show concern.</P>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy for Fianna Fáil speakers who are grasping at straws to muster up a logical reason why they should oppose this budget.  It is legitimate for an Opposition speaker when approaching budget time to make speeches calling on the Minister in power to concede things in the forthcoming budget which the Opposition speaker believes in his heart it is not possible to concede.  Last week in a speech outside the House, Deputy Lynch, Leader of the Opposition, demanded and called on the Government in the forthcoming budget to give an increase of 25 per cent in social welfare benefits and assistance.  The plight of the poor, unfortunate Fianna Fáil speakers in this debate after that demand by their leader is pitiful. Practically all the hopes and aspirations, but not the responsibility, of the Opposition party were realised in this budget.  In a nine-month period there is an 18 per cent increase across the board; over a 12-month period this works out at slightly over 24 per cent. My heart bleeds for an Opposition speaker having to follow that.  That would be some trick, even for Fianna Fáil who are extremely skilled in this area.</P>
    <P>When looking at this situation we might get the impression that we can sit back because we have solved in this <Col N="1755" /> budget all the ills and problems in the social welfare field and in other fields. I can assure the House that this Government are by no means satisfied with the rates of social welfare and home assistance, or any form of assistance, that we at this time are in a position to pay.  How can any feeling, reasonable man be satisfied if he relates all these figures and calculations to that lady of 82 in Seán MacDermott Street whose ambition was to buy herself new underwear, a pair of shoes and possibly an occasional egg?  We still have a long way to go but we are moving in the right direction, and we know where we are going.</P>
    <P>If you look at the last two budgets you will see that it is not just a question of dishing out a few shillings here and a few shillings there to keep the punters happy as would appear to have been the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  There was a pattern behind them as far as social welfare is concerned.  Our goals will not be achieved overnight but I am confident that they will be achieved.  I am also confident that none of this would have been even started, or even have been thought about, had Fianna Fáil continued in Government.  They had a different sense of priorities.  They looked for their support in a different area.  They had a Taca mentality&mdash; I am not using the word lightly or politically, I am using it to describe what happened to the Fianna Fáil Party over a period of 20 years.  I am concerned about what happens to people who are dependent on the Government's social welfare payments of one kind or another.  We are now faced&mdash;I do not say &ldquo;we&rdquo; as a Government but &ldquo;we&rdquo; as a society&mdash; with 20 per cent of our people existing in a poverty area.</P>
    <P>We have been told that we have broken this promise or that promise or that we have not done this or that. We saw this morning that some people were amazed because the Coalition Government, consisting of Fine Gael and Labour, could produce such a budget.  I am not amazed and I do not see why anybody else should be. This Government went before the <Col N="1756" /> people on a 14-point programme.  The mandate given to them was for a five-year period.  There have been no broken promises.  We have gone a very substantial way towards achieving that 14-point programme in the last 13 months.  We have still approximately four-fifths of our time left to fulfil our commitments.  One of the top priorities of that programme was social justice.  Even the most biased critic could not but acknowledge that all the visible signs are there to prove that there is an earnestness by this Government to live up to that commitment of social justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity of raising the subject matter of Question No. 10 on today's Order Paper.  It concerns the future of Creevagh National School.  I do this for a number of reasons and with your permission, I will elaborate on them.  On my own behalf and on that of the parents in the area I should like to protest most vehemently at the manner in which the decision to close this school was arrived at.</P>
      <P>It would appear that this was done against all the trends.  If I give a little of the background it might help the House to understand why the people of this area regard the closure as one which came not from the Department of Education but because of external influences.  Some years ago a meeting was held to decide the future of this school.  At that time it was a one-teacher school.  Certain decisions were arrived at.  The people were satisfied and I think the Department's officials were satisfied. Since then it has become a two-teacher school.  This happened some months ago.  I question therefore the answer which the Minister gave today when he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reviewed the position as regards Creevagh National School and I am satisfied that the best interests of the children concerned would be served by its amalgamation <Col N="1757" /> with Carrowmore National School in the Carrowmore school to form a three-teacher school unit.</P>
    <P>There are a steady number of pupils on the roll.  It is around 36 or 37. Industrial expansion has already started in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the almost complete opposition by the parents and householders in the area to the closure of the school.  I understand that a letter was sent by the parents' association two years ago.  I gave the Minister a copy of this letter, from which I will now quote:</P>
    <P>We, the people of Creevagh School area expect that the money you made available for the abovementioned school will be spent on same.  We understand that you have withdrawn the money at the request of the Manager.  This request is the manager's own and not the wishes of the parents as there was no consultation whatsoever with the parents.  As regards amalgamation the parents will not allow their children to be taken to Carrowmore National School or any other school.  Please find attached the signatures of the parents and householders of the area attached the signatures of the area who are opposed to amalgamation.</P>
    <P>The parents complain about the complete lack of consultation with them in this matter, despite the guarantee given by the Minister in this House during his speech when he introduced the Estimate for his Department for the financial year 1973-74. I will quote an extract from that speech where the Minister said:</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be consultation and the views and opinions of those who may be opposed to the proposed closing of a small school will receive the fullest consideration.</P>
    <P>The parents of pupils attending Creevagh school were not consulted.  I would question the reason for that.  It is all the more strange that on the 7th November, 1973, in reply to a question of mine on this particular school the Minister said:</P>
    <P>My Department are sanctioning a grant for the provision of water-flushed sanitation, thermal storage <Col N="1758" /> heating and fluorescent lighting at Creevagh National School.  The Office of Public Works are being asked to ensure that the works are carried out as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I know that plans were prepared for this school.  I also know that a well-boring contractor actually came to the site but was not allowed to proceed with the work.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the House whether the view of one particular individual or the views of the parents of the area should be the prime consideration in this matter The parents of the area and myself are entitled to an explanation why the decision was changed.  I would ask the Minister about this.  He said in the House today that no pressures were used.  I am certain that if the Minister knew the background of this dispute as I do he would be satisfied that there was pressure. Which is paramount&mdash;the wishes of the parents or the wishes of an individual?</P>
    <P>Even if a transfer to Carrowmore school takes place I regret to tell the Minister that it will be bitterly opposed by the parents.  There would be considerable expense in providing extra accommodation at Carrowmore school. In reply to a supplementary question today the Minister said that he felt that in the long term a central school which would take in the pupils of Creevagh, Carrowmore and Banagher would be the ideal solution.  I question this and so will the parents in the Banagher area, especially as the school in Banagher is a new school.  It is approximately eight years old.  I question it on the grounds that there is no demand from the parents for it, and also on the grounds that, if these amalgamations were to occur, they would be occuring in the wrong places and that it is now too late to amalgamate.</P>
    <P>Pupils are now coming to Creevagh from Killian which is some miles north of Creevagh.  It would appear that they will now have to go some extra miles to Carrowmore.  The Minister will have to provide transport.  At Carrowmore he will have to provide not only the additional classrooms which will be necessary but also an assembly hall which could be used by the pupils to <Col N="1759" /> have meals.  Above all the Minister and I are faced in this situation with having to decide&mdash;and I have repeating this&mdash;whether the parents wishes as expressed in the letter to the Minister and by the fact that they have signed their names to a document or the wishes of one man are to prevail in this case.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why the decision arrived at when Creevagh was a single-teacher school should be changed now that it is a two-teacher school, one appointed some months ago only.  I am convinced, and I will always remain convinced no matter what the Minister's decision is, that at the end of January the Department was visited by the person who evidently succeeded in putting his views across and having them accepted by the Department over the views of the parents.  I cannot accept this.  On that basis, and the basis of the points I have outlined, I would ask the Minister and the Department to seriously reconsider the decision which has been taken and to give the children in this area the same chance as the children in a number of small schools got since the Minister came into office.  The parents feel they are entitled to the same consideration as has been shown to a number of schools in Kerry and Galway.  They feel they know what is best for their children and that they know where their children will get the best education.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider one other point.  Even though they are in the same parish, the Minister is amalgamating two different types of people.  The people from the Creevagh area are fishermen, always have been, and always will be. Their children are now to be sent to a school in an area where the predominant occupation of the parents is farming.  A meeting was held which was attended by Deputy Gallagher, Senator O'Toole and myself a few weeks ago, and that meeting was unanimous that Creevagh should remain open.  All I can do is to add my voice to the voices of those who wrote to the Minister <Col N="1760" /> and who signed the letter he received. I would ask the Minister to give these people the same rights as have been extended to others.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Deputy Calleary for the reasonableness of the case he has just made and for the tone of his contribution which was for me a very refreshing change from other Adjournment Debates which I attended here, particularly in the middle of last year.  He quoted from a speech I made on the Estimate for the Department of Education in the latter part of 1973.  He did not refer to some of the reasons which I gave in the educational area about the general desirability, if it can be brought about, of having larger central units where possible because of the educational advantages for the pupils in having three or four teachers to teach the children in these schools.  In introducing my Estimate I explained my policy on small schools and I can do no better than to repeat what I said. I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...in ordinary circumstances no further one-teacher or two-teacher schools will be built, either in replacement of existing schools or as new schools.  Neither will grants be made for extensive reconstruction or improvement of such small schools.  In using the funds which the Dáil will make available for school buildings and equipment from year to year we must aim at securing the best educational advantages for the individual community concerned in each school building project and for the country as a whole.  We must avoid, to the greatest extent possible, deliberate expenditure on projects which would only preserve existing disadvantages or even create further disadvantages from the educational point of view.  There will, of course, be consultation, and the views and opinions of those who may be opposed to the proposed closing of a small school will recieve the fullest consideration.  There may be occasions when I shall be forced to <Col N="1761" /> take a decision which will not be generally popular, but no decision will be taken arbitrarily, without the fullest weighing of all the factors involved.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was present in the Dáil this afternoon when I replied to his question.  The key word in the reply was &ldquo;reviewed&rdquo;.  I said then and I repeat now that the question has been reviewed.  I want to explain to the Deputy in some detail what is involved here.</P>
    <P>The position is that the Creevagh school is an old building.  It was recommended for replacement by the Office of Public Works in 1958.  The school was built, I think, in 1895.  A proposal for the amalgamation of Creevagh with Carrowmore National School was put to the school manager in 1966.  This was in line with the policy of centralisation of small schools to form larger and more effective teaching units.  Various factors delayed the provision of the extra accommodation needed at Carrowmore school to cater for the Creevagh pupils.  A minor scheme of essential repairs was carried out to the Creevagh school in 1971 to render it habitable for a further limited period.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can rest assured that I have reviewed the situation.  He spoke earlier today about pressures and I resisted the imputation of pressure to the extent that there was any suggestion that the pressures were improper.  The Deputy will accept&mdash; and I am not expressing any criticism of him&mdash;that he himself and other public representatives exerted pressure on the Department of Education. This is only right and proper; this is what Deputies are there for.  I think it would be improper to suggest that that kind of pressure is of a more benign or meritorious kind than representations received from other individuals or groups of individuals. I do not deny for a moment that I have received representations and on foot of those representations, I have made a review of the case.  Having reviewed the case, I am fully satisfied that the amalgamation of these schools, to form a three-teacher school, would be in the best interests <Col N="1762" /> of the children concerned.  Lest there should be any misunderstanding, there is no suggestion that the amalgamation into a three-teacher school is anything other than an interim solution. The Deputy and other public representatives may not be aware&mdash; indeed, the public may not be aware&mdash;that in Creevagh and Carrowmore schools the school population&mdash;and, to my knowledge, these facts are accurate; the projections are accurate&mdash;will, in a few years, drop to the point where only one teacher will be warranted in either Creevagh or Carrowmore.  So, even if they were amalgamated now, as a permanent solution, the population would not warrant three teachers in a few years time.  That is why the long term policy of the Department is to have a central school, the population of which would warrant a greater number of teachers than would be warranted even in this interim solution.</P>
    <P>I know that the Deputy and other representatives have pointed out&mdash;indeed, I read it in the papers&mdash;references to industrial developments in Killala and places adjacent.  To my present knowledge there is no indication, from the figures available to me, that this is going to increase substantially the population of the area. And, if it is going to increase the population, it is not necessarily in these particular areas.  I would, therefore, put it to the Deputy that, having reviewed the situation, taking into account the views of all the persons concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy was very restrained in putting his case.  I well acknowledge that.  I want to say to him that the figures and advice available to me are that, on present trends, we would not be justified in expending the substantial amount of money he thinks should be expended in relation to the small school at Creevagh which, in the fairly near future&mdash;in a matter of a couple of years&mdash;will not warrant even two teachers.  These are the facts as available to me.  On these facts, I have reviewed the situation and come to this decision.  I cannot explain it any further than that.  I have said that the decision of the Department, in the long term, is that the best interests of the area would be served by setting up a central school; that the three-teacher arrangement for Carrowmore is an interim one only.</P>
      <P>We cannot predict the future.  I think the best solution at this point in time is to be set up a three-teacher school at Carrowmore.  We will then await future development to see what further steps, if any, are needed.  That is the reason why the matter was reviewed. That is the reason why I gave the Deputy the answer I did today.  I think the case is reasonable. I acknowledge that he has made representations; so have other public representations; so have the parents, the manager and the interests concerned. I stand over my decision.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that the figures projected for Creevagh have been proved wrong already in that the Department of Education estimated that there would be only 22 pupils attending Creevagh and there are now actually 37?  On that basis would be accept that the information he has been given for the next couple of years would be wrong also?  The parents in Creevagh are quite satisfied&mdash;and they know because they have actually counted the children there coming up to school-going age&mdash;they will have sufficient there for at least five&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy's latest question I would say to him, even in a three-teacher school, the number of pupils attending school will just about warrant three teachers and not for a very long period; that there is a declining population in this area and that we would not be justified in keeping two separate schools going in the area.  If the population were suddenly to explode and this information were to be made available to me then a new situation would arise.  But my present information is that the school-going population in Creevagh would justify three teachers in the immediate future; that the population is dropping and would not justify the keeping open of two schools, as the Deputy suggests.  I would repeat that I think it is a good decision.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. Friday, 5th April, 1974.</P>
