      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that minutes of executive and conciliation council meetings are not made available to the executive members of the Sub-Post Office Union; and if he will take steps to ensure that a copy of these minutes is supplied to the executive members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no function in regard to minutes of meetings of the Executive Council of the Sub-Postmasters' Union.  As regards meetings of the Sub-Postmasters' Conciliation Council, the constitution of the council provides that agreed joint reports of its proceedings are made. The circulation given to these agreed reports within the union is a matter for the union itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not make representations and use his good offices to ensure that both sides at conciliation have a record of what is happening?  Would the Minister not agree it is too much to expect one side to commit to memory what happened, while the other side have a written record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The conciliation council have chosen not to keep minutes as such but to issue from time to time agreed joint reports, <Col N="1918" /> which reports are submitted to me. The proceedings of the council are confidential and no statements concerning them are issued except with the authority of the council.  The council do not authorise publication of reports until the Minister's decision has been conveyed.  I have no authority in relation to the circulation of these reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and I do not expect the Minister to interfere unnecessarily at conciliation.  However, would he not regard himself as having some function to ensure that records are kept of the conciliation meetings so that continuity of purpose may be maintained by both sides?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to interfere in this matter with the executive council of the union.  It would be most improper for me to interfere in the internal affairs of the union.  As regards the conciliation council, they are the masters of their own procedure and I do not propose to interfere with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The application, which was received in November last, should have been accorded priority treatment.  That has now been <Col N="1919" /> arranged and the telephone will be installed as soon as public wayleave consent for a section of pole route, applied for a month ago, has been cleared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not entirely within my powers to say, as the Deputy will understand.  Wayleave permission is needed from the local authority concerned, the Waterford County Council, for a section of pole route which has to be erected to provide the service.  The application for wayleave was made on 22nd April. The wayleave consent should have been applied for earlier in the year. An error of judgment was made in this case, for which I should like to express regret to the Deputy and to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to say the Deputy has been misinformed. I should like to explain that the part of the city involved was one of many areas in the city for which more than one cable company had applied for a licence under the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974.  At the request of some of the cable companies, my Department convened a number of meetings with the companies involved with a view to securing agreement on orderly and efficient development of cable television in Dublin by extension of the existing systems to uncabled areas.  Following protracted discussions, the companies agreed among themselves on the areas which they considered should be serviced by each company, bearing in mind cabling already done in the area, provision of an efficient service to customers generally throughout the city, the expressed views of residents' associations and so on.  The cable companies amended their applications for licences to take <Col N="1921" /> account of the agreement reached.  I am satisfied that these agreements are likely to be in the best interests of the public generally and I have decided to issue licences for the provision of cable systems accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The licence was issued as a result of agreement between the companies concerned.  I do not think it is in order here for me to discuss which company in any particular case.  No preference has been accorded as between RTE and other companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAhern" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the position of the ESB regarding the supply of power to bulk tank farmers in County Cork in view of the fact that bulk tanks purchased by farmers in County Cork over a year ago have not yet been connected; and if he will make a statement on the lack of co-operation between the IAOS and the ESB in the rationalisation of the dairy industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) (for the Minister for Transport and Power) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) (for the Minister for Transport and Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the board are not aware of cases where bulk milk tanks which were installed on farms in County Cork over a year ago have not had supply connected. If the Deputy will provide the names and addresses of those farmers whom he has in mind the matter will be investigated by the ESB.  In general there is usually some unavoidable delay between the time at which application for increased supply is made and the time when it is possible to carry out the work involved.  This is due to the necessity for programming of work by the board and to take into account the best utilisation of the available skilled manpower resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inconvenience which might otherwise arise due to the time lag necessarily brought about by work programming can be reduced to a minimum <Col N="1922" /> by adequate advance notice to the board of those locations where it is intended to install bulk milk tanks. This aspect of the matter is at present being studied jointly by the board, An Foras Talúntais, ICMSA, IFA and a dairy industry working party.</P>
    <P>For many years the extensive network erected during the first stages of rural electrification was underutilised. The bulk tank installation programme has now coincided with the final stage of the present rural electrification programme and both of these activities make heavy short term demands on ESB skilled manpower resources.</P>
    <P>While the board have no primary responsibility in the rationalisation of the dairy industry the board are very willing to co-operate with any organisation, including the IAOS, with which they can identify common objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAhern" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear what the Minister said.  What did they do to help the small farmers in Cork?  They did nothing.  There must definitely be something wrong between the IAOS and the ESB.  There was no need for a long rigmarole which has nothing to do with this problem.  There is a bit of bluffing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister convey to the appropriate Minister that, if he is not already aware of the situation in Cork, all he has to do is to check with the ESB and with any of the farming organisations? Will the Minister tell the appropriate Minister that there is a widespread and serious problem in the Cork area where farmers have capital tied up in bulk milk tanks and so on and cannot get ESB connections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if his attention has been drawn to recent <Col N="1923" /> Press reports to the effect that one of the multi-national oil companies reported a record income of £309 million for the first quarter of 1974 of which £125 million arose from abnormal stock profits; and if he considers this an indication that all such oil companies made abnormal stock profits by sale of products in this country during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no responsibility for the profits of multinational oil companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister responsibility for the stocks of the national oil companies and has he authority over the price charged during a specific period in 1974 by the multi-national oil companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The ownership of the stocks is obviously in the hands of the company.  The Department of Transport and Power have a supervisory role.  The question of regulation of prices does not arise in the context of the responsibility of the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Minister for Transport and Power has a responsibility to ensure that there is a certain minimum period of supply in terms of days left?  Is it not also true that these multi-national oil companies deliberately withheld oil supplies in this country until the price had risen and then made a vast amount of profit?  Has the Minister got responsibility in that sense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast amount of profit to which the Deputy may be referring relates to the published accounts of the companies at international level.  The figures which were in the papers recently do not relate to the Irish end of their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While this entire figure does not apply to us as a nation, we are satisfied that £5 million or £6 million was made by the oil companies in this country during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be so satisfied but I am not because, if one considers the profits of international <Col N="1924" /> oil companies, they have the power to regulate where they take their profit anywhere between the oil-well and the petrol pump.  They are integrated all the way from one to the other.  They can take their profit where they like and in the place most advantageous to them.  Some of the most recent figures I have seen for one of the larger suppliers in Ireland showed a loss in Ireland during the most recent period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer which I gave originally indicated that the Minister had no responsibility for the profits of multi-nationals.  The point I am making is that indeed we have no control whatsoever over the profits of multi-nationals accruing outside this country.  That is a feature of the role of multi-national companies.  It is an undesirable feature, but it is a fact of life.  Of course we have regulations in that we are locked into the same terms as the peripheral zone of the United Kingdom.

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that any site for a tidal power scheme which is to have any prospect of commercial success must among other things provide a large tidal range and such sites are comparatively rare in the world.  The only large tidal power scheme ever constructed, at La Rance, Brittany, has a tidal range of 39 feet.  The maximum tidal range around the coast of Ireland is only 12 to 15 feet.  Previous examination by the board revealed no possible site in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Board are continually reviewing all potential sources of electric power and the possible development of tidal power will be reassessed regularly in the light of technological progress and changing economic conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of countries with which Ireland has an adverse trade balance the general aim is to seek to improve the position by encouraging the expansion of exports. The Government, through Córas Tráchtála, have made a wide range of grants, incentives and services available to exporters and these, of course, apply to exports to Poland and Czechoslovakia.</P>
      <P>Special measures have been taken in recent years to encourage exports to Poland and Czechoslovakia.  In November, 1972, a trade mission on which 24 leading firms in the engineering, consumer goods and other fields were represented, visited Poland and Czechoslovakia.  The mission met executives of State buying organisations, chambers of commerce and end-user industrial firms in both countries.</P>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála are organising participation by Irish exporting interests in the Poznan International Industrial Products Fair in June and in the Poznan Consumer Goods Fair in the autumn.  Irish firms participated in the Brno International Consumer Goods Fair in April this year and there will also be participation by Irish exporters in the Brno Engineering Products Fair in the autumn.</P>

      <P>The measures taken by Italy, which have been authorised by the Commission of the EEC, are aimed at redressing a serious adverse balance of payments.  In these circumstances and having regard to the nature and volume of our exports to Italy I do not consider that action of the kind suggested would be warranted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a similar situation existed in relation to our exports to Britain some time ago&mdash;granted a much wider volume&mdash;but in the interests of maintaining our exports which are growing, I understand, to Italy would he not consider breaching the EEC regulations, as they did in imposing the levy, by subsidising our exports to enable those who have a foothold in the market to continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter arose we certainly considered it but when we weighed the drawbacks against the potential advantages we decided that it was correct that no action should be taken by the Government. I might point out that at the time of the British action under the AIFTA Agreement 60 odd per cent or possibly a little more of our exports then went to the UK market while 2 per cent of our exports go to Italy. The action taken by the Italians has the agreement, if not the approval, of the Commission.  The great danger and the overwhelming reason why it is right for us not to act at Government level, though of course the way is open for action by other agencies, is that were we to do so we could provide a pretext for actions by other members of the Community.  There are seven others exporting into Italy who are much richer than we are, whose exports to Italy are much more important and who would be able to outbid us in this action, which would disrupt the whole free movement of goods inside the Community which is <Col N="1929" /> already disrupted enough, indeed, in regard to agricultural produce.  That would redound to the disadvantage of all of the members.  It is a difficult situation for our exporters and we will give them every possible help but we cannot, at Government level, contemplate creating a precedent that would eagerly be followed by others, richer and stronger than we are.</P>

This economy, as it has been for a very long time, and as I understand was central to the policy on which Fianna Fáil originally came to power, is a mixed economy&mdash;that is understood&mdash;with a balance of private interest and public interest.  Irish industry understands that very well and the response of indigenous Irish industry and of overseas investors in the last 14 months, while I have been in this Department, indicates they understand it perfectly well.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prices (Stabilisation of Profit Margins of Importers and Wholesalers) Order, 1973, and the Prices (Stabilisation of Profit Margins of Retailers) Order, 1973, which were introduced by me in June, 1973, operated to freeze at the levels which obtained on 23rd June last the cash margins which may be taken by importers, wholesalers and retailers on a number of commodities.  These two orders were necessary because a feature of trading at the import, wholesale and retail level had been the adding on of a customary percentage mark-up on cost prices.  This practice, taken in conjunction with inflationary trends over a number of years, resulted generally in an increase in absolute cash margins to traders out of proportion to increases in their labour and <Col N="1934" /> overhead costs.  The orders mentioned were intended as a corrective to that situation.  The percentage margins of retailers and wholesalers will of course vary with the changes in cost prices, and in the absence of a detailed investigation, I cannot say how the percentage margins of these traders have been affected by the orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the percentage margins allowed to rise with the increase in costs.  It is not fixed at a particular sum?  Is the percentage the same irrespective of the increase in price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The percentage margin is the actual profit.  The actual margin on the 23rd of June is fixed. But in the case of an imported article, for example, as the phased price of the imported article rises the percentage margin diminishes.  Since the actual real margin in pounds and pennies is frozen, the percentage margin diminishes.  Indeed, from the protests I have been having from a large number of bodies it is indicated that this is happening and that we are squeezing margins, although I cannot give the Deputy an accurate answer as to how much.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA decision to grant-aid the provision of up to 1 million cubic feet of storage for intervention beef was taken in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Apart from the fact that the right to sell to intervention is an element of the Common Agricultural Policy of the EEC it is essential for the continued viability of the Irish meat processing industry that the companies in the industry should have this right when market prices are unfavourable.  Because of the present market situation more beef is now being sold to &lsquo;intervention&rsquo; than had originally been anticipated and this has resulted in considerable pressure on existing storage facilities. I am not therefore prepared to ask the <Col N="1936" /> Industrial Development Authority to alter their decision.  The Government's policy of restraining price increases must be operated in such a way that it will not cause a decline in economic activity by preventing producers from being compensated for increased costs.</P>

      <P>The question I have been asked relates to a decision by the IDA to grant-aid storage space.  I have indicated that I think this is a correct decision and a helpful one in very difficult circumstances.  It is helpful precisely in relation to the problems Deputy Gibbons has raised in his supplementary question.  The question he seeks to have answered does not arise on the original questions, Nos. 21 and 22, and is not the responsibility of my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, Ltd., that during the year ended 31st December, 1973, they received 360 inquiries from industrialists interested in establishing new industries in the mid-west region and that 114 of these industrialists visited County Clare during the 12 months in question.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of the 360 inquiries and the 114 visits seven new projects were subsequently approved. Some of these are matters of public knowledge already, including the largest of them which is Syntex.  As regards the others, the Deputy will be aware that it can cause embarrassment if an announcement is made prior to the participating firm wishing it.  I do not want to say more than has already been revealed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain why such a small percentage of those who had shown interest, seven out of 114, materialised and why so many were lost along the line?  Is there any indication that some of the 114 may show further interest in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly a possibility that some of the 114 will come back but I think a yield of seven new projects with job creation of over 800 in that area in that period is a good record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but would the Minister not agree that out of 360 inquiries and 114 approaches seven would be regarded as a bit low?  I am certainly glad that seven are coming but seven out of an original inquiry list of 360 seems a very small number.  Is there any particular reason why these people may not have shown interest in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a small number.  There are many parts of the world engaged in as vigorous <Col N="1939" /> industrial promotion as we are through the IDA and when firms are contemplating a move to a new area they can shop around over practically the whole world.  They do so very widely and the original number would in fact relate to what was very much a preliminary inquiry.  That wastage is not, I think, at all unusual in this business.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 30:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;the&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Conditions of Employment (Equal Pay) Act, 1974.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Dowling.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night I was asking the Minister to accept this amendment. Having examined the long title of the first Bill, and also that of the Bill introduced by the Minister in relation to equal pay we find little difference in the long titles.  The Minister says there is an emphasis of change indicated by the second title but, as we see it, it is a contradiction in terms.  We have already pointed out that section 9 is a section which permits discrimination against female workers.  If the Minister wishes this to be an anti-discrimination <Col N="1949" /> Bill he must surely eliminate the discrimination in section 9 in its present form.  Surely we must not legislate to discriminate against people.  That is what this Bill is doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The title, as I explained last night, takes its significance from the subsequent pieces of legislation which will follow on dismissal and unfair discrimination in general in employment. As I indicated, this Bill simply concentrates on one aspect, namely, the pay of women.  The Bill sets out the definitions and procedures whereby a woman will be able to get her equal deserts in the matter of pay before the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is bad parliamentary practice to have a Bill called &ldquo;anti&rdquo; something; it should be &ldquo;pro&rdquo; something.  The Minister might call this the &ldquo;Pro-Equal Pay Bill&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill&rdquo;.  That would be more decisive. We all admit now that there is discrimination.  Even at this late hour could the Minister put in a clause to the effect that this Bill is purely a temporary measure and that he intends to remove this anomalous section as soon as he has more comprehensive legislation ready to ensure equality of all people employed?  If he does not do that I shall certainly vote against the Bill, even though there are one or two things in it which are quite good. Would the Minister meet us by changing the title?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of virtue in what the Deputy said. This is just one part of three separate pieces of legislation which will, I hope, change the whole contract of employment in industry.  This Bill deals with just one important aspect, equal pay for work of equal value.  We have set down the procedures and the penalties for employers who break the provisions of the Bill.  I think Deputy Moore's point is a good one and when the entire legislative package is passed we can consider the whole matter as being, perhaps, more accurately described as &ldquo;Fair Employment&rdquo; legislation.</P>

There is a clause in this Bill under which discrimination can occur.  &ldquo;Anti-Discrimination (Equal-Pay) Bill&rdquo; would be a better title for this.  Until further legislation is brought in this is wide open to discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not concerned apparently about continuity of employment which would be of vital importance to a person seeking equal pay.  We have discussed this aspect over and over again.  If the Minister does not write in some safeguard there is bound to be discrimination. The emphasis here is on pay, but pay is only one factor.  We are concerned about continuity of employment. Consider the position of a person who gives good service for 20 or 30 years and the employer throws her on the scrapheap; all the employer will suffer is a small penalty or perhaps no penalty at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>A Bill which permits discrimination against workers cannot surely be called an anti-discrimination Bill.  This Bill positively carries discrimination against female workers who seek equal pay, win their cases, and are dismissed as a result of successfully seeking equal pay.  The Minister says he cannot write a safeguard into the Bill.  But discrimination is written into the Bill and the Minister says nothing can be done about it except through the medium of other legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>One could not regard a penalty of up to £1,000 as a small penalty.  No employer would lightly disobey the provisions of this Bill.  I also think the majority of employers are broadly in agreement with <Col N="1951" /> the terms of this legislation because of its fairness and its justice.</P>
      <P>There has been some disagreement about the time of implementation of this legislation in that it comes some two years in advance of the latest date recommended by the Council for the Status of Women, but, apart from these reservations, on the general broad principles of the legislation no reputable employer has voiced any disquiet or reservations, or disagreement in any case.  Therefore I think that in regard to the few cases Deputy Dowling spoke about, where there may be a danger that somebody would be dismissed from employment because of looking for her rights under this legislation, as has been made quite clear earlier in the debate the idea of the Bill is to act as a deterrent to employers who would act in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been made clear also to the Deputy that in comparable British legislation there is no section dealing with it.  What we do here in the deterrent features of this Bill is more or less in line with what other countries have done in similar legislation. Finally in the unfair dismissals legislation, which I hope to bring before the House shortly, we will go into all of this area in regard to the retention in employment of people who look for their rights.  We will go into this in depth and ensure that the contract of employment will be protected for <Col N="1952" /> the employee.  That will be an appropriate time to deal with the points the Deputy raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned about the penalties laid down for employers. I am concerned about continuity in employment for people who look for their rights, people who seek the aids guaranteed in this Bill.  As a result of seeking these aids they will find themselves out of employment. That is discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being naive when he mentions fines and penalties for employers.  Section 8 states that where a court of competent jurisdiction is satisfied that the sole reason for dismissal was the making of the claim,</P>
      <P>the employer shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £1,000.</P>
      <P>That may go against the worker who seeks her rights.  We would be perfectly satisfied if the Minister reviewed section 8 and inserted one line providing that a person's conditions of employment shall not be worsened by making a claim for equal pay.  That is all the Minister has to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word on the Title.  This is: &ldquo;An Act to ensure equal treatment, in relation to certain terms and conditions of employment, between men and women employed on like work.&rdquo; There is no comparison whatsoever between the Short and Long Titles.  In the amendment, just defeated, there was certainly an emphasis laid on the conditions of employment in the Long Title.  The Bill, as going through now, is one of discrimination which the Minister has not taken the necessary steps to eliminate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have given the Minister every opportunity of undertaking to write into the Bill the necessary protection for the people who would be making claims.  We find that a person making a claim, which he is duly entitled to under this Bill, can find himself out of employment as a result of that claim.  This is discrimination against Irish workers and it is appalling.  On Report Stage we will put down amendments to overcome this situation. We are sorry that the Minister has not given an undertaking to write complete anti-discrimination into this Bill.  Workers are the losers in this case.  It is unfortunate that Irish workers should be treated in this shabby manner.  We will put down amendments to ensure that workers <Col N="1955" /> get adequate protection.  The Minister and the Government have not seen fit to write such protection into this present Bill.  It is a Bill which legislates for the sacking of workers and the loss of their employment.</P>

      <P>There is adequate compensation built into the Bill for anybody who suffers any loss of employment.  There are very heavy deterrents in the Bill.  There is a clause in the Bill which permits an employee to obtain two years' salary retrospectively with fines on employers. This is amply covered.  This Bill must be seen against the background of two other pieces of legislation dealing with the bringing into being of a firm contract of employment throughout Irish industry.</P>

It covers what was in the Committee Stage amendment but it goes a good deal further than that.  I hoped by putting down that amendment to give the Minister an opportunity of putting down a similar one.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries expressed himself in agreement with the amendment I had down on Committee Stage in relation to this matter.  He asked me not to press it because of the fact that it would be covered in a Bill to be brought in by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at some future date.  We have no idea yet when that time will come. We have the experience of waiting a long time for Bills.  Would the Minister&mdash;I am glad to see him here today&mdash;consider an amendment if not precisely in these terms at least on these lines to cover the question of the advertising of food?</P>
      <P>We had examples the last day which I myself gave, and on a previous occasion the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke on the Bill and gave examples.  Perhaps the greatest of abuse in relation to advertising is in the food sector and the quasi-medical food sector.  We are all in agreement that this is undesirable and dangerous as well as misleading. I suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary that an amendment on these lines should be inserted in this Bill.  If necessary it could be repealed if and when the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes in with a general Bill covering advertising claims. The Parliamentary Secretary did not accept this suggestion.  Perhaps the Minister would do so today.</P>

      <P>Before moving that amendment I should like to refer to Volume 272, column 1501 of the Official Report, which is the beginning of the Committee Stage debate on this Bill on Wednesday, 15th May, 1974.  Before the Committee Stage it appears in the Official Report that the House went into Committee on Finance to consider a Money Resolution and that the Minister for Health moved a Money Resolution.  The question was put and agreed to and the Money Resolution was reported and agreed to by the House.  I was present on the last occasion from before the beginning of Committee Stage until after the end of it.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Corish, was not present in the House.  Neither he nor anyone else moved this Money Resolution at the beginning of Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that I should draw this to your attention since Standing Orders lay down that you are responsible for the proper and accurate preparation of the Official Report and that what appears at column 1501 is quite incorrect and could not be correct because the Minister for Health was not present, nor was any Minister present.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was the only representative of the Government present.  There was no Minister present who could have moved a Money Resolution.  I understand that under Standing Orders a Money Resolution must be moved by a member of the Government. I would submit that in the interests of accuracy that entry in the Official Report should be deleted.  In order to keep the matter right the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who is now present, might now move a Money Resolution.  Otherwise difficulties could be encountered afterwards.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7 to delete lines 1 to 7.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 in my name proposes to delete lines 1 to 7 on page 7, that is, subsection (3) of section 6. Section 6 has given rise to a great deal of difficulty and there was a lot of discussion on it the last day.  I referred to it at some length when I spoke on the Second Stage.  As a result the Minister brought in certain amendments which were designed to do good but, as I pointed out the last day, did not achieve what they set out to achieve and in certain respects made matters worse so far as subsection (4) is concerned.  I am glad to see that the Minister has put down today a further amendment to that subsection.  This further amendment, if it does not bring the position to what it should be, at least is an improvement on the rather intolerable position which was arrived at as a result of the Committee Stage amendment and which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries sought at great length to defend vehemently last week.  Unfortunately while the Minister, happily, has seen fit to accept much of what I and others said in relation to subsection (4), no change is proposed in relation to subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave examples on the Second and Committee Stages of the Bill of the <Col N="1959" /> undesirability of the kind of concept contained in subsection (3).  This must be looked at in the context of the subsections which precede and succeed it. Subsections (1) and (2) fairly and squarely place the onus of proof on the defendant in different but important matters.  Subsection (3) goes even further.  Not alone does it put the onus of proof so far as the prosecution is concerned on the defendant, but it puts the onus of proof on him in relation to a matter which nobody would be entitled to assume against him.  If it is alleged by the prosecution that this is such a serious matter it should most certainly be proved by the prosecution.</P>
    <P>The example I gave on the last two occasions was perfectly valid.  I was told by the Minister on the Second Stage that it was a bit far fetched. But, I am afraid, it is not.  I was not told that on Committee Stage.  I have looked at the situation again and I am afraid that it is very much a possibility. If on any premises on which human food is manufactured, prepared or offered for sale, non-human food is found by an inspector there will be a presumption that that non-human food was used in the manufacture or preparation of the human food unless the defendant can prove to the contrary.  To allege that, on the part of the prosecution in the first instance, would be a serious matter. One would imagine that a responsible prosecution would not allege that unless they had grounds to substantiate it beyond reasonable doubt.</P>
    <P>The situation which we find as a result of subsection (3) is that all they have to do is to allege it; all they have to do is to show that there was non-human food on one of these premises. The example I have given of non-human food clearly relates to animal feedingstuffs of one kind or another.  All they have to do is to show that there was some kind of animal food, whether for dogs, cats or any other animal, on the premises and that the premises were used for the manufacture or preparation of food intended for human consumption. Having shown that, there is an immediate presumption that the <Col N="1960" /> occupier of the premises did in fact use the animal food in the preparation or manufacture of food for human consumption.  The onus is on him to prove he did not do it.</P>
    <P>That is a serious allegation to make on the part of the prosecution.  A provision such as this, which enables them simply to allege it and to have it presumed to be true until the defendant proves otherwise is, in my view, untenable.  This is not the sort of legislation which should go through this House.  This is one of the Bills which, because it has no great public interest, the newspapers do not bother reporting.  The public do not read these Bills.  Nobody worries too much about what is in them.</P>
    <P>If this section is passed in its present form and in six or 12 months' time somebody finds himself in court with this allegation made against him, which he knows to be untrue, and then finds that the prosecution do not have to prove it but that he has to prove his innocence, there will be an outcry.  Part of that outcry will be directed against this House for not pointing out the consequences of this Bill and for not stopping it passing through the House.  On the last day and again today I pointed out the consequences but I cannot unfortunately stop it going through.  I cannot command enough Deputies on this side of the House to do it.  I can only do my duty in this respect and point out to the Minister, as I did to the Parliamentary Secretary the last day, that this is wrong.</P>
    <P>This is not just a question of the ordinary transfer of onus of proof, which to some extent we tend to come to expect and accept in food and drugs legislation.  That is the type of transfer of onus which is in subsections (1) and (2).  This goes much further.  It is a different matter and much more serious.  It relates to a more serious matter and is patently more unfair to a defendant than the ordinary transfer of onus.  It is open to serious abuse, if people were so disposed to abuse it.  It is not enough for me to get an assurance that the vast majority of people who would <Col N="1961" /> enforce this would not seek to abuse it.  One should not have in legislation powers which would allow one in a hundred, or one in a thousand, who might seek to abuse it the opportunity to abuse it.  They should not be given that opportunity.  Indeed the temptation should not be put in their way.  That is why I ask the Minister, in the interest of all fairness and particularly in view of the other transfers of onus in subsections (1) (2) and (4), to agree to the deletion of subsection (3).  This is not a matter which could arise very often.  If it were not there it would not cause any serious additional difficulties for the prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy is genuinely concerned about this subsection since he opposed it so vigorously at every Stage.  At the same time, I would not feel justified in dropping it because it is similar to section 64 (2) (c) of the Health Act, 1947.  If Deputy O'Malley is not familiar with that section I will recite it for him:</P>
      <P>(c) any material or article which is found in any such establishment used for or in the preparation or manufacture of food for human consumption and which is capable of being intended for use in such preparation or manufacture shall be deemed, unless the contrary is proved, to be so intended,</P>
      <P>(d) In any prosecution of an offence under this Part of this Act in relation to any such food, the food shall be deemed, unless the contrary is proved, to have been kept for human consumption in such establishment.</P>
      <P>That is an exactly similar subsection in the 1947 Health Act, if we were looking for a precedent.  The Deputy has given the example that a food manufacturer that kept dog or cat food in his premises for his own pets could be presumed to have it there for use in human food.  It is not unknown for such a thing to happen, and there is at least one such case on the records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1962" /> I cannot but remark in passing that it would not be very sensible to keep such products in premises where human food is manufactured or prepared for sale, and anyone who did so would obviously be asking for trouble. I think the Deputy would agree that such a person would be looking for trouble if he were to keep on the premises where he is manufacturing food for human consumption what the Deputy has described as cat or dog food.</P>
    <P>On a more practical level, the Deputy should realise that this is not a conclusive presumption.  It can be rebutted and, to my mind, would be very easily rebutted.  It is true that the defendant is required to prove the contrary, but I have been advised that under the law of evidence in criminal matters it would be sufficient for the defendant to raise any reasonable doubt.  The Deputy knows more about how such cases go than I do, but that is my advice.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, if I were to drop this subsection, there would be very little chance of securing a conviction, even in the most suspicious circumstances.  How can you prove the state of a man's mind?  How can you prove his future behaviour? If it were not for this presumption you could never get a conviction, unless you actually saw the defendant use the offending substance in manufacturing food and then could prove he disposed of it for human consumption.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.  It certainly does not seem to be a serious matter and does not seem to stand up to examination, and we have the precedent which I have quoted on exactly the same lines in previous legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept it is not a serious matter, but I accept that there is apparently a precedent for it in the Health Act of 1947.  When I was speaking earlier I referred to the fact that there are many of these presumptions in food and drugs legislation, but I cannot agree that something must be accepted simply because there is a precedent for it.  The fact that something similar is in the Health <Col N="1963" /> Act of 1947 does not mean, if it is unsatisfactory, that that type of legislation should be continued indefinitely. It may be that the Dáil in 1947 was not as vigilant as perhaps it should have been, and if one calls in aid any single precedent for future legislative or other activities of that kind one is getting into a very dangerous logical situation.</P>
      <P>A lot of things have happened and have been done in this country in recent years which are scarcely good precedents.  I venture to think we saw a very good example of it last night; unless there was a considerable change of heart&mdash;and conscience, I am reminded by Deputy Collins&mdash;on the part of the present Government in relation to prisons, a lot of dangerous people would have be released from custody at the end of this month.  The precedent was set, if you like, by 20 or more Deputies now on the Government side of the House who thought that the legislation which was passed in 1972 and which is due to expire at the end of this month should be allowed to expire; instead we find it prolonged for longer than its own original period.</P>
      <P>The Minister's argument about precedent is a dangerous one because there are many bits of legislation which have gone through this House in the last 20 years often without examination of any kind by Government side or Opposition side and which have been found subsequently in the Supreme Court to contravene the Constitution.  It might well be that some of the pieces of legislation which the Minister might call in aid as precedents would be found to be similarly defective.  In regard to provisions such as food and drugs legislation and the relevant part of the Health Act, 1947, there is a danger&mdash;I do not push it any further than that&mdash;that with the mood of the Supreme Court in recent years, it might well take a very different view of these provisions from what a court 20 or 30 years ago might have felt about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in the last eight or ten years that legislation in this House other than that of great political content began to get any sort of careful <Col N="1964" /> scrutiny.  Twenty or 30 years ago if a Bill introduced was of a technical nature it was let go through, and that was that.  The country paid for that former tradition of this House in that section after section of Bill after Bill has been knocked down in the High and Supreme Courts in recent years. I feel it is the duty of a modern Opposition in a modern Parliament, conscious of the liberal action taken in recent years by the Supreme Court, to examine this sort of thing carefully. The fact that there is, as the Minister says&mdash;and I grant him that&mdash;a close precedent for this subsection does not make the subsection good.  I hope, for example, nobody would ever want to claim that what happened in this city last Friday would be a precedent for something like it to happen again.  It is a very dangerous thing to depend on the concept of precedent, to say that because a thing happened before it can and should happen again.</P>
    <P>I do want to say this much, however, in relation to what the Minister has just said now.  What he said was short, concise, and was to the point, accurate and straightforward.  There was no messing or bluffing about it. This is in stark contrast to the manner in which this Bill and the amendments down to it were met on the Committee Stage, when we had a long, waffling five hours on it, when, unfortunately, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister did not really deal at all with the points that were put and the Committee Stage debate was prolonged beyond all necessity.  What the Minister has said today, even though I do not agree with all of it, at least is to the point and has relevance and some compellability about it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister again, if he cannot rely on anything more than precedent, to consider this amendment again.  I do not think it is a situation that would be likely to cause difficulty from a health point of view if this subsection were not there.  I do not know whether any great use ever had to be made of the roughly corresponding subsection in the Health Act of 1947.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 12 to 14, to delete &ldquo;and that he notified&rdquo; down to &ldquo;hearing of the prosecution,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am happy the Minister has put down amendment No. 4 because we were told at considerable length on the previous occasion when this Bill was discussed that there was no need for it and that it would be wrong and foolish to make any change in subsection (4) (a) as it stood after the amendments that were made the last time.  One of the things we were told by the Parliamentary Secretary was that if someone was going to be convicted because of the terms of (4) (a) as it stood after it was amended, he should apply for an adjournment and that if he did he would probably get off.  I found it quite unacceptable that legislation which contained provisions that necessitated that kind of thing being done should go through this House.  I am glad that wiser counsel than that of the Parliamentary Secretary prevailed and that at least some gesture is made in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>Without question, the Minister's amendment improves the situation from the blatant injustice which would result if the amendment were not put down, but it is not altogether satisfactory. It would be much more satisfactory to remove all the words from &ldquo;... and that he notified the prosecutor...&rdquo; to the words &ldquo;before the hearing of the prosecution&rdquo; at the end of paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>Under the Minister's amendment there is still an obligation on a prosecuted person, even though he is innocent, to convey to the prosecutor the fact that he has this warranty.  This obligation to convey that information only arises under the section after he has been prosecuted.  Subsection (4) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1966" /> If the defendant in any prosecution for an offence under section 2 of this Act in relation to food proves&mdash;</P>
    <P>and then there is set out (a), (b) and (c).  In other words, the question of showing the warranty and bringing it to the attention of the health inspector or the relevant prosecutor, under this section even as amended by the Minister, will only arise after a prosecution had been initiated and a summons served.  The Parliamentary Secretary said at considerable length on the previous occasion that all the person had to do was to show the warranty and there would be no summons.  I tried to point out, without success, to the Parliamentary Secretary who did not seem able to grasp it that the subsection did not relate to that situation, that it only relates to a situation post-prosecution.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this subsection for a pre-prosecution showing to the prosecutor of whatever warranty the person relied on.  It would be much fairer if that were provided for, rather than the situation that the person has to notify the prosecutor of the fact of the warranty and the contents without unreasonable delay, as is proposed by the Minister, before the hearing of the prosecution.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of having to notify the prosecutor at this stage is wrong.  A much cleaner way of dealing with the matter would be to cut out that part of the sentence and to remove that obligation of having to notify the prosecutor in advance.  I am on the point of saying there must be very few precedents for that kind of obligation to notify a prosecutor but I stop short of saying that because I have no doubt the Minister's advisers will be able to hawk up some precedent to tell me it happened before.  However, I can safely say, without fear of contradiction, that it is not a common or usual provision and it is not one that should be introduced lightly into our law.  It is not desirable in principle.</P>
    <P>Our system of criminal trial is an accusatorial one, in which one side accuses the other, while the continental systems are inquisitorial and <Col N="1967" /> are quite different from ours.  The concept there of having to show the prosecutor something in advance of the actual trial is not foreign to them because they have examining magistrates who look into matters and who question the defendant before he is prosecuted.  It is quite different here and in England and the question of showing the prosecutor one's defence in advance before the case is heard is alien to us.  While there may be some precedent somewhere, it is certainly not common in our law and it is not desirable that it should be introduced.</P>
    <P>To some extent my amendment and the Minister's tried to achieve the same objective within reason, but it would be achieved much more cleanly and in a more clear-cut fashion if the Minister would delete the words I have mentioned and let paragraph (a) end with the words &ldquo;with a written warranty to that effect&rdquo;.  I can see considerable difficulty in a court trying to decide what is &ldquo;unreasonable delay&rdquo; in getting in touch with the prosecutor to inform him that a person has the warranty. Most people in that situation would probably produce it on the morning of the court and they might be told that was too late.  The trouble is that if they are told it is too late, if they fail to prove (a), (b) and (c) in this subsection, they must be convicted because the end of the subsection states that if the defendant proves (a), (b) and (c) he shall be discharged from the prosecution.  Assuming amendment No. 4 goes through, he must prove that he notified the prosecutor without unreasonable delay.  It might be taken that the morning on which the case was heard was unreasonable and there might then be the situation that even though he can prove his innocence, and the warranty he produces makes this clear, nevertheless because he did not produce it quickly enough he will be convicted.  The court will have no option but to convict him.</P>
    <P>The obvious corollary from that is that if the defendant does not prove (a), (b) and (c) he cannot be discharged <Col N="1968" /> from the prosecution.  Therefore the court could be faced with a situation that a warranty is produced in court which clearly exonerates the defendant, he proves (b) and (c) but, because the warranty was not produced in time, the court has to convict him even though all know he is not guilty.  While the Minister's amendment goes a fair share of the road to meet the point I made on the previous day, it does not go the whole way.  It still can allow a ridiculously anomalous situation to arise.  The man has the warranty which proves he is not guilty but still, because he cannot prove that he produced it without unreasonable delay, the court has no option but to convict him.</P>
    <P>Frequently we are accused in legislation of making a rubber stamp of a court, of laying out things in such a way that the court has very little discretion. This is going beyond rubber stamping.  It is bringing it to an extreme degree, because it is forcing the court to convict somebody it knows is not guilty.  It is a form of legislative coercion of the judiciary. That is wrong.  I do not think the Minister would wish to have that sort of situation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied it can be avoided if he accepts my amendment rather than his own which, while a great improvement on the situation which existed after Committee Stage, still allows injustice to be perpetrated and, more than that, forces the court to do something it knows is wrong.  I do not think we should reduce our courts to the level of a rubber stamp in the first instance.  Worse than that, we should not reduce them to the level of having to convict somebody they know perfectly well is innocent other than by the terms of paragraph (a) of this subsection.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  They are so related that it would be difficult to discuss them in isolation.  I know the Deputy is concerned about this and that he made quite an argument about it on earlier Stages.  He has done the same again today.  I have drawn his attention to the fact&mdash;I know he does not like precedents&mdash; that we have a precedent in the 1947 Act.  It is identical with this.  As well as that, it should be borne in mind that the subsection provides a complete defence for a person who, through no fault of his own, handles substandard food, provided he can produce a warranty.  I doubt that it is asking too much to ask him to produce this warranty in time to save the time of the court.</P>
      <P>The Deputy holds that it is a post-prosecution provision.  In strict theory he is right, but it is most unlikely that there will be a prosecution if, at the time of the inspection, it is made known that a warranty is available.  It is not unreasonable to require anyone who has a warranty to produce it within reasonable time. Surely the court will be reasonable in its estimation of what is, in fact, reasonable time in which to expect a warranty to be produced.  I put it to Deputy O'Malley that my amendment covers fairly adequately what he is looking for in his amendment.  I would ask him to accept my amendment in substitution for his own.</P>

We all know there are several people involved who are not efficient and that others have not got the time to keep their files properly.  As a result of that type of inefficiency they could find themselves being prosecuted for something of which they were innocent.  Deputy O'Malley is trying to protect against that.</P>
      <P>I can see the Minister's point of view.  He assumes that everybody will be efficient.  I am afraid that does not happen.  As legislators we must be very careful to ensure that only the guilty are found guilty.  Deputy O'Malley's amendment would obviate the necessity to convict somebody who was innocent.</P>

      <P>I do not know who is right about it, quite frankly.  I think either amendment covers reasonably anybody who is involved in such a case.  There is no serious difference between my amendment and Deputy O'Malley's, but I think mine meets the situation reasonably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>There is this difference that with my amendment nobody will be convicted who should not be convicted and with the Minister's amendment it is possible that some people will have to be convicted by the court, even though the court does not want to convict them.  I grant that the position is much better under the Minister's amendment than it was under the amendment which <Col N="1971" /> the Parliamentary Secretary moved on his behalf on Committee Stage. Hundreds of people would be potentially caught there, and here the number of those who will potentially be convicted of something of which they are innocent will be much fewer. At least we have achieved that much as of today in getting this amendment from the Minister.  We were told by the Parliamentary Secretary last week that there was no need for anything at all.  While the position is now much better that should not stop us from seeking to achieve perfection.</P>
      <P>As the Minister says, there is not much difference between the two.  The only difference is that some people will be convicted under his amendment who should not be convicted, and nobody who should not be convicted will be convicted under mine. The Minister mentioned that there is a precedent in the Health Act, 1947, for this type of provision.  I should like to know whether the precedent refers to &ldquo;one week&rdquo; or to &ldquo;without unreasonable delay&rdquo;?  Unfortunately I do not know which section it is of the Health Act, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It reads:</P>
      <P>such defendant shall be discharged from the prosecution, but shall be liable to pay the costs incurred by the prosecutor unless he gave due notice to the prosecutor that he proposed to rely on the said defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much obliged to the Minister for quoting the relevant section of the 1947 Health Act but it is significant that the phrase used there is different either from the phrase in this Bill, as amended in Committee, which is &ldquo;not less than one week&rdquo; or the phrase used in the Minister's amendment No. 4 which is that the notice would be given &ldquo;without unreasonable delay&rdquo;.  Frankly, I would be happier, if I had to choose between the three, with the phrase that is used in the 1947 Act because it would give rise to fewer problems but while it would give rise to fewer problems than what is in the Bill as it stands, or in the Minister's amendment, <Col N="1972" /> there would still be some problem.  We can overcome that now if the Minister would accept amendment No. 3 which is very similar to his own.  I want to reiterate, just before I sit down, that the only difference is that under his amendment some people who should not be convicted will be convicted while under mine nobody who should not be convicted will be convicted.  It is not unreasonable, because of the small difference anyway, to ask the Minister to accept that.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage Deputy O'Malley pointed out that a licensed haulier might be prosecuted even if he knew nothing about the food he was carrying. I accepted this as a valid point and I put down an amendment to subsection (6) to ensure that this would not happen.  Unfortunately, it appears that Deputies have some difficulty in understanding that amendment.  I hope the form of words I am now proposing to substitute is clearer although it is still rather complicated.  Its purpose is to provide a defence for any person transporting or storing food for hire unless the standards enforced for the food concerned laid down the conditions under which that food must be transported or stored.  To take an example, a haulier would have a defence if a load of tinned vegetables he was carrying turned out to be substandard since this is obviously none of his business.  However, he would commit an offence if some food, ice cream for example, was supposed to be transported under certain conditions of hygiene and refrigeration and he did not comply with those conditions.</P>

That is the greatest compliment that can be paid to him.  On Committee Stage I referred on a number of occasions to the sale of alcohol.  I believe the Minister did not make any statement on it.</P>

    <P>When he goes to the Seanad with the Bill I should like him to introduce some amendment to prohibit supermarkets from selling alcoholic beverages. I pointed out the dangers of young people going into supermarkets <Col N="1975" /> and buying bottles of alcohol.  We should not condone this.  I am not sure if the Minister has power under this Bill to do something in relation to my proposal but the situation is very serious in the country at the moment.  Young people have easy access to alcohol.  As I said before, 15 per cent of the people who go into mental institutions do so because of alcoholism.  We should use every effort in this House to highlight this matter and indeed to try to combat it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>  In page 4, after line 25, to add the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) No allowance shall be made under subsection (1) in respect of expenditure incurred before the 6th day of April, 1974, whether or not such expenditure is, by virtue of any provision of this Act, the Finance Act, 1946, or the Act of 1967, deemed to have been incurred on or after the said date.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (1) provides for the immediate write-off against mining profits of exploration or development expenditure incurred on or after 6th April, 1974.  The purpose of the amendment, <Col N="1978" /> which corresponds with a similar provision in section 6 (2), is to ensure that no allowance shall be granted in respect of exploration or development expenditure which was incurred before 6th April, 1974, notwithstanding that under certain specified enactments such expenditure may be deemed to have been incurred on 6th April, 1974 or some later date.  For example, a person who commences to work a qualifying mine on or after 6th April, 1974, and who has incurred exploration expenditure in connection with that mine, will, in accordance with section 245 (9) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, be deemed to have incurred that expenditure on the date on which he commences to work the mine.  The new subsection ensures that the deeming of this expenditure to have been incurred on or after 6th April, 1974, will not bring it within the scope of subsection (1).</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, I have certain amendments down which will be dealt with later.  I did not propose an amendment to this section because I did not attempt to cover all the areas in the Bill in which this problem arises.  Perhaps I shall deal with the problem in more detail at a later stage.  It seems to me that the effect of the Minister's proposed amendment is to make it quite clear that there is no intention of treating existing mines in the same way as new mines.  I tried to make it clear on the Second Stage of the Bill that it seemed to me one should make a very clear distinction between existing mines and new mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as new mines are concerned, whatever arrangements seem to be appropriate, whatever arrangements will produce the maximum return for the community, consonant with retaining sufficient incentive to mine owners to carry on is absolutely justified; but in regard to existing mines the position is different not only because of the viability, or lack of it in the case of some of them, but particularly because of the fact that such mines have been operating on the basis of the statutory exemption.  The effect of this proposed amendment is to make it absolutely clear that the Minister does not propose <Col N="1979" /> to allow to existing mines a number of the allowances which he proposes to make available to new mines. When I say that I mean that he proposes not to make them available to existing mines in respect of the period prior to 6th April, 1974.</P>
    <P>This matter arises on other sections and other amendments and at this stage I do not propose to pursue it in full detail but I did refer to this point regarding section 2 on the Second Stage and I asked the Minister if he would explain the thinking behind this provision which is reinforced by this proposed amendment.  In particular, I point out to him that it is proposed under section 3 to allow previous expenditure in the case of existing mines.  Would he explain why it is not proposed to grant the allowance provided for in section 2 to existing mines in the same way as it is proposed in the case of abortive expenditure under section 3?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is misreading the situation.  We are not proposing any disadvantage to existing mines.  Essentially, there will be no difference in treatment between existing companies and any new companies. The new scheme of allowances, so far as it applies to expenditure incurred on or after 6th April, 1974, applies equally to new companies and existing companies. The Deputy may have in mind that the new scheme of allowances does not in general apply to expenditure before 6th April, 1974, and therefore existing mining companies will not get the benefit of the special relief in respect of past expenditure. I think he would, on reflection, agree that it would be unreasonable to expect that they should now get relief for past expenditure which at the time it was incurred did not qualify for tax relief.  We must recognise that existing mining companies have enjoyed full exemption from tax, some of them for periods up to eight years, and that this exemption more than compensates them for any expenditure incurred before 6th April, 1974, expenditure which would not qualify for tax relief at the time it was incurred under the general tax law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> I recall that during the budget debate Deputy Haughey said that he had introduced the 20-year tax exemption period because he was confronted, he said, with the complicated apparatus of income tax allowances to deal with the problem of the mining industry. As I said in replying to the budget debate, there was no need to avoid the simple exercise of devising a comparatively simple code to deal with the special problems of the mining industry.  This Bill has a mere 17 sections, two of which are routine sections relating to definition and repeal, so that we have clearly demonstrated that it is possible to devise in a comparatively simple measure the kind of relief to which the mining industry can reasonably make claim on the basis of world experience.  That is what we are doing but we are not putting any existing mines in a disadvantageous position compared to new ones.  It would be wrong to believe that we are so treating them.  In fact, existing mines will be able to carry forward the balance of the expenditure which they have had in the past against liabilities which will now arise.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy Colley proposes to argue this at greater length on some further sections and on his own amendments and I shall be only too glad to take up the argument with him then.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 4, lines 37 to 39, to delete &ldquo;but was incurred within a period of seven years prior to the date on which he commences to carry on the said trade,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall that in speaking on the Second Stage I referred to this question of limiting the period in respect of which the allowance could be claimed to seven years. I said then that my understanding was that normal exploration may take five to seven years and the appraisal of that may take another two years and development after that may be five or more years.  If this information is correct it would appear that the seven-year limitation imposed in subsection (2)&mdash;I think it is also referred to in subsection (1)&mdash;is unreasonable. It may be that the information given to me is not correct.  I do not profess to be an expert on the technicalities of the mining industry but I do not think the Minister, when replying to the Second Stage debate adverted to this point.  I would be glad to know whether the advice available to the Minister is to the effect that my understanding of this position is correct or not.  If the advice available to him is that it is substantially correct would <Col N="1982" /> the Minister explain why he would still propose the seven-year limitation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the period for exploration and development will vary from mine to mine.  Two or three years might be a suitable period for one mine but it might take ten years or more for another.  What we have to do is to try to strike a compromise. It so happens that if one takes a compromise between a short period of two or three years and a period of as much as ten one comes in with a figure of about seven.  That is one reason for going for a compromise figure but it also happens to coincide with the period of tax exemption which was given under the 1967 legislation. Bearing these two factors in mind we considered that the commencing date should be 6th April, 1967.</P>
      <P>We consider it was quite generous to allow people to accumulate exploration expenses over a period of seven years and to use those accumulated expenses as a set off in respect of future tax liability.  The advice which I have does not seriously conflict with what Deputy Colley offered.  I believe the Deputy went to 12 years in his suggestion so that we have not gone very far away.  I believe we have struck what any person would accept as a reasonable compromise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that in the case of one mine it may be three years while in the case of another mine it could be ten years.  I wonder if that is correct?  Is it true that in the case of some mines the process of exploration, appraisal and development could be completed in a three-year period, because if it could not then taking seven years as a compromise does not have much reality.  On the other hand, the second point the Minister made may be of more importance.  He said that the seven years coincides with the exemption period back to 1967.  Could the Minister throw some light on this?  Prior to 1967 if such expenditure had been incurred would the mine concerned already have got an allowance corresponding to this?  If it had then it seems to me that the Minister has a stronger case.</P>

      <P>The House should bear in mind that what we are dealing with here is abortive exploration. There was no allowance for abortive exploration prior to 1967.  Clearly there must be a limit on what we can allow people to set off in respect of abortive exploration otherwise it would be open to somebody to go around buying up the rights to abortive exploration and setting those off against future tax liability. That would defeat the whole object of this legislation which is to ensure that the mining industry pays a fair share of taxation in the future.  The figure we have chosen, having regard to the average experience, is a very reasonable one.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me whether it would be usual for exploration, appraisal and development to be completed within three years.  Probably not, but what we are dealing with here is abortive explorations which might be followed by appraisal but if exploration is abortive it does not take long to appraise that the wise thing to do is not to proceed.  Obviously one could easily have exploration expense within one year, and completed within a year, which would turn out to be negative and would be abortive and which would be available for set off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it would be totally undesirable that a firm could go around buying up the rights to claim abortive expenditure but I thought there was a provision in this section, and if there is not there is provision in another section, in relation to another kind of allowance confining the allowance to the person or company who actually incurred it, thereby precluding its being bought up.  Is that solution not open to the Minister so that the genuine case where abortive expenditure has been incurred can be allowed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are providing against people buying up holes in the ground all over the place in order to set off but we are going to enable people to set off what they have incurred in the course of exploration because we want to encourage people <Col N="1984" /> to explore.  This is one of the greatest incentives to the future development of the mining industry.  Where there has been <i>bona fide</i> exploration in the past we also want to permit that to be set off but we must ensure that there is no avoidance here.  The period we have chosen, seven years, is a reasonable compromise.  It provides for reasonable exploration in the past and it does not lend itself to abuse.  If we go beyond the seven-year period I think we do open the door to abuses.</P>

      <P>If that is so then surely it will not be possible for people to go around buying up these rights and to get the benefit of them.  If the allowance is confined to the person or company who actually incurred it is there not a strong case for having no limitation because it means they genuinely incurred the expenditure? As the Minister has clarified, prior to 1967 they got no such allowance and what my amendment is seeking in practice is to give the allowance to the person or company who actually incurred the expenditure.  Therefore, we can assume it must be genuine expenditure incurred by them and they have to prove this to the Revenue Commissioners before they can get the allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically my position is unchanged.  We are dealing with a situation where we are primarily concerned with the future and not the past.  The concession we are providing is to ensure that people who engage in legitimate exploration, which proves abortive, will be encouraged to proceed with their exploration and development because they will have this set off available to them.  We should not go back too far, over a period when there was no right to avail of abortive exploration for any tax relief &mdash;going back now to pre-1967. <Col N="1985" /> I think the proper thing to do is to relate it or tailor it to the date of commencement of the tax holiday, which was 1967.  I am prepared to have a look at this but nothing Deputy Colley has said leads me to any view other than that the date should be 1967.</P>

      <P>We have made a little progress.  Could I ask the Minister to examine it a little further still? If he takes the position that he is prepared to allow this expenditure where genuinely incurred for a period of seven years back&mdash;that is, during the period when the companies concerned had complete tax exemption&mdash;what justification is there for not allowing it earlier than that when they did not have the complete tax exemption for 20 years and when there was no such allowance?  In other words, would the effect of the section, as the Minister has drafted it, not be unfavourable to companies who have genuinely incurred such abortive expenditure prior to seven years ago as against those who incurred it, say, six years ago?  Is there any real danger of abuse if the Minister puts no limitation on it having regard to the fact that these cannot be bought up by people taking over the grant.  They can only grant it to those who genuinely incurred this expenditure.  Is there any real danger of abuse?</P>

Why, in other words, does he propose to allow the abortive expenditure to existing mining companies but not allow the other kinds of allowances provided in the Bill except to new mining companies or, at any rate, to operations after 6th April of this year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must bear in mind that we are dealing with a totally new situation.  The existing mines had the concession of a tax relief for the last seven years and they have therefore enjoyed in the past a treatment which will not be available to any new company in the future.  It is quite wrong to believe that they are now being put at any serious disadvantage. The truer approach to adopt is that they enjoyed concessions in the past which they and others will not enjoy in the future.  That is the correct way of looking at it and not the way Deputy Colley is looking at it, as if existing companies are being punished in some way while new companies will get advantages not available to the old ones.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister's argument though I do not necessarily agree with it.  I may have missed something he said.  The question I asked the Minister was on what basis does he distinguish, granted the terms of the argument he has put forward, between abortive expenditure on the one hand and development expenditure on the other.  He is allowing the abortive expenditure back for seven years but he is not allowing development expenditure.  In what way does he distinguish?</P>

You never until now could set off abortive exploration expenditure and that is the reason why these two have now to be treated differently as it were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to raise on this section is in regard to the provisions for group relief.  I understand that in Britain group relief is available generally where the shareholding relationship is 75 per cent as against the proposed 100 per cent in this section.  It has been suggested to me that the requirement of the 100 per cent relationship can cause difficulties for some mining companies in dealing with very small minority interests. Has the Minister any information on this?  Could he indicate whether a reduction on the 100 per cent requirement would present problems from the point of view of the administration or control of the relief being granted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the difficulty, as I am sure Deputy Colley will recognise, that if we go down to fractions we leave the machinery open to a certain amount of abuse.  We are anxious to facilitate people engaged in legitimate contractual arrangements and very sensible management and proprietary arrangements.  But again we must ensure that, as we are bringing in this liability to tax, that liability cannot be avoided by arrangements which in essence are for the purpose of purchasing exemptions which could be set off against the tax liability of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section is designed to cover a case where exploration expenditure has been incurred by one company in a group of wholly-owned subsidiaries and mining profits are earned by the parent company or by another subsidiary <Col N="1988" /> group.  In such cases the exploration company may elect to have this exploration expenditure, whether abortive or successful, attributed to any other subsidiary in the group or to the parent company, so that the exploration expenditure may be set off against mining profits wherever they arise within the group.</P>
    <P>Representations were made to have this facility made available and it was urged on me that where one company in the group carry out the exploration programme and another develop a successful mine, that the entity operating the successful mine should be able to claim in regard to the total exploration costs for the purpose of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the dangers of abuse if the requirement of shareholding relationships is set too low.  On the other hand I would hope the Minister would appreciate that there could be problems where there were small minority holdings in some companies.  As I have mentioned, I understand the relationship accepted in Britain is 75 per cent. I would think that even a considerably higher figure might not be unreasonable but that some reduction from 100 per cent would at least allow for small minority interests. Such a situation, I understand, arises in some Irish mining companies.  I wonder if the Minister would have another look at this, perhaps even in terms of 85 per cent or 90 per cent. This might meet the difficulty and prevent the possibility of abuse.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 6, line 32, to delete &ldquo;on or after the 6th day of April, 1974&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the object of these amendments is to try to ensure that the investment allowance in respect of exploration expenditure would be available to a company that had incurred that expenditure before 6th April, 1974, as well as thereafter as provided in the section.  I adverted earlier to some of the matters involved here.</P>
      <P>As I understand it the case the Minister is making&mdash;this is a general proposition in regard to a number of sections&mdash;is that because the existing mining companies had tax exemption up to now, then it is not reasonable to suggest, now that it is being taken away, they should be given the allowances during the period when they had tax exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all I would point out that during the debate on section 3 the Minister made the argument that he was providing there for a new allowance and he distinguished that from the development allowance which was already in existence, though he admitted it was a purely notional allowance because of the tax exemption. He used the notional allowance <Col N="1990" /> that he was talking about as an argument. It suited him at that time.  I think that if it were true in that case, the same argument should be applied here and the Minister should have regard to the fact that if these companies had tax exemption they had it on foot of a statutory provision.  The companies concerned and their shareholders formulated company policy and implemented it on the basis that they had this exemption provided for in legalisation and that they had raised the necessary finance for their operations on the basis of the exemption.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable, having regard to the fact that it was provided for in legislation and that there were assurances given from time to time in regard to that exemption, for them to assume that this was in effect a contractual relationship and it was reasonable for them to operate their business and to raise finance on the assumption that they would be allowed and would continue to be allowed the exemption as provided for in legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to take away that exemption.  Not alone does he propose to do that but he also proposes, except in the case of abortive exploration, not to allow the additional allowance in this case&mdash;the investment allowance in respect of exploration expenditure&mdash;except in regard to expenditure incurred prior to 6th April, 1974.  I would suggest that at the very least the Minister is going to take away the statutory exemption on which these mines were operated and in which they believed, because the statute would operate for a 20-year period provided that the completion of it was before 6th April, 1986.  When they were operating on that basis, and the Minister now proposes to take that away, the very least he should do is to grant to such companies, who had geared their financial operations and raised equity and loan capital on that basis, the allowance in respect of exploration expenditure which he is proposing to allow in respect of expenditure incurred after 6th April, 1974.</P>
    <P>The object of these amendments is <Col N="1991" /> to create a situation in which this allowance will be granted whether the expenditure was incurred before or after 6th April, 1974.  I would urge the Minister to consider very carefully the implications of these amendments. If he is not prepared to accept the later amendments which would allow existing mines&mdash;again, I would distinguish very sharply between existing mines and new mines&mdash;to carry on, as they believed they would under the existing laws, then I would press him very strongly not only from the point of view of doing justice to companies which raised money on the basis of existing statutory provisions but also in order to try to ensure that the reputation of this country is not adversely affected.  If he would concern himself with that aspect of the matter and, if he is not prepared to allow the existing exemption to continue&mdash;for existing mines only; not for new mines&mdash;then I would urge him very strongly to consider applying the allowances which he proposes to give for operations after the 6th April, 1974 to those prior to that date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I think Deputy Colley is overlooking the immense benefit which was available to people who engaged in exploration prior to the 6th April, 1974.  They enjoyed a tax-free holiday; they had total exemption from tax liability.  In addition to that, Deputy Colley is suggesting that, on an historical basis, we should build back, as it were, this extra 20 per cent investment allowance.  I have made some inquiries and I have not come across any case in which the investment allowance was ever paid by the State, here or elsewhere, in respect of past work.  The whole point behind giving an investment allowance is to provide an incentive for future work.  This is precisely what we are doing here.  We are giving an incentive to people interested in mining to engage in further exploration.  This incentive will apply equally to old and new companies to engage in exploration in the future.  It could fairly be argued that this incentive is not as big an incentive as a total tax exemption.  If that argument be a valid one&mdash;and I do not <Col N="1992" /> think Deputy Colley can seriously disagree with it&mdash;then one can turn the argument the other way and say: &ldquo;That being so, you have no right to say that, in addition to total exemption in the past, there should also be an investment allowance of 20 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he appreciates that existing mining companies&mdash;operating on the basis of the exemption provided in the law in force&mdash;raise money by way of equity and, in some cases, in addition by way of loan and if he changes that situation, if he takes away that exemption, he is altering the basis on which they raised this finance and is, therefore, adversely affecting their financing arrangements?  It is not merely a question of taking away an exemption which they had but of affecting, in some cases, fairly fundamental financial arrangements which mining companies made, and made in good faith.  If he cannot see his way to continuing that arrangement there is an obligation on him at least to show that he is conscious of the fact that the abolition of this exemption is adversely affecting not merely the question of additional profits or otherwise but the gearing basis of financing arrangements made by mining companies. As an acknowledgement of that and as a gesture towards remedying the position where, in the view of some mining companies and, indeed, of a number of other people with no connection with mining, a quasi-contractual arrangement is being broken unilaterally, he should go some of the way.  If he is not prepared to continue the existing exemption, the easiest way for him to go about it is to grant those allowances to these companies in respect of the expenditure they incurred prior to April, 1974, and thereby go some of the way towards enabling them re-adjust their financial programmes entered into in good faith on the basis of a statutory provision enacted by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can reply very bluntly to Deputy Colley's question as to whether I accept that people entered into investment arrangements in the mining industry on the basis of <Col N="1993" /> a tax provision by saying I do not accept that that was the only reason people invested in mining.  What Deputy Colley is arguing here is that a Government have no right to vary tax liability subsequent to the date on which any person, or persons, invested in a company and certainly have no right to vary tax liability to the disadvantage of investors in or owners of a company.  I cannot accept that.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that in 1967 the mining industry expressed the view, through its own trade journals, that the 20-year tax exemption provided for in Irish legislation was too good to last and accepted that, within the life span of the 20 years provided for in the legislation, the democratic Government of Ireland would be obliged to mend its hand. I am quite certain that any person seriously considering investment in mining would have been aware of that view which was very strongly held and was expressed in the trade journals.  Of course, people who invest in mines look at all the possibilities of making profit but they include not merely the question of the tax arrangement but also the minerals in the ground, the cost of extracting them, the market for them, the likely movements in markets, the prices to be obtained for the product and so on.  Bearing all these factors in mind I cannot see that the argument Deputy Colley is advancing is a justification for giving preferential treatment to the people who have already enjoyed what they themselves regarded as exceptional and so exceptional that it was unlikely to last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if Deputy Colley's argument bears further examination, even if some consideration were to be given to what he urges upon us, with respect, I do not think it is relevant to this section which is related very specifically and correctly to future mining.  It is an incentive to exploration expenditure in the future and not in the past.  It would be quite wrong, I think, to use an incentive which is supposed to encourage people to continue exploration in the future in order to compensate them <Col N="1994" /> for any real or illusory loss which they may have incurred by reason of a belief that the tax laws would never be changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were talking here about ordinary tax provisions which are a normal hazard subject to change from year to year, or even at shorter intervals in the annual budget, or in a supplementary budget, that would be one matter.  In fact, we are not; we are talking about a statutory provision that there would be tax exemption for up to 20 years. That is a different thing from the ordinary income tax and other provisions that we deal with from time to time.  Any company must, of course, calculate or allow for the possibility that these rates and conditions will be changed from time to time.  But we are talking about something different, something that was inscribed in legislation providing for a 20-year exemption.  I submit it is not reasonable to say that companies operating under that legislation should expect that it would be changed at any time.  I doubt very much if the Minister can produce any-evidence, in any mining journal or anywhere else, to show that the trade expected this to be changed in relation to existing mines.</P>
      <P>To expect it to be changed in relation to new mines is another matter.  It was quite clear from the actions of the previous Government that in relation to new mines there would be a different approach but to expect that this would be changed in respect of existing mines operating under the existing law is quite another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has grasped the major distinction there is between these two things.  I wonder if the Minister has grasped the serious implications of changing the rules under which a company operated and raised money as distinct from the ordinary taxation provisions.  Has the Minister grasped the serious implications of that not alone for the Governments concerned but also for the good name of this country and the consequences for us?  We should be able to say that if this House, rightly or <Col N="1995" /> wrongly, in this case or in any other case provides a particular incentive those who commenced to operate under it would be allowed to carry on in the same manner.  One can change the rules for a newcomer but not for those already operating.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot see his way to do that, I would hope he would see that there is a strong case for amending this Bill in such a way as at least to show he is aware of the implications involved, is prepared to make a gesture to show he is aware of them, and that he is trying to do something to remedy the position which has arisen for companies who raised money on the basis of existing provisions and who now find that the basis on which they raised that money has been changed.</P>
    <P>I accept the point the Minister made in relation to the particular allowance provided for in this section that perhaps in this case it would be appropriate that it should be confined to new expenditure.  It is designed as an incentive for the future.  However I should like to know whether what the Minister has said indicated that he would be prepared to think, in relation to the other allowances, of doing something on the lines I am urging.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley has asked me to furnish evidence of what I had alleged in relation to the expectations of the mining industry&mdash;that the 20-year exemption would not last that long, I would refer the Deputy to the issue of the <i>Mining Journal</i>, published in Canada, for 14th April, 1967, which stated:</P>
      <P>In effect Mr. Haughey's budget proposals suggest that the Irish Government is prepared to forego profits tax revenue from its domestic mining industries for ever in order to encourage maximum foreign exchange revenue and employment opportunities&mdash;indeed, a remarkable situation.</P>
      <P>It continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be recognised that after about ten years of vigorous government of capital development the <Col N="1996" /> Government of the day will probably find itself under considerable pressure to tax the profits of successful operations in order to satisfy the demands of the electorate.</P>
    <P>They were only short by about three years.  It only took seven years instead of ten to reach that situation.</P>
    <P>I come to another Canadian journal, the <i>Northern Miner</i> which is quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16th October, 1973. It states:</P>
    <P>...it was generally acknowledged that some adjustment in the Irish Government's tax policy was to be expected.  After all, nowhere else in the world could one expect a 20-year exemption from income tax and in Canada, after whose mining laws Irish ones were largely patterned, the exemption for new mines was a mere three years.</P>
    <P>Now even that has been abolished despite strong objections from the mining industry.</P>
    <P>It is pertinent that as far back as 1971 the Deputy's colleague, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lalor, indicated that he was anxious to have this whole matter reviewed.  He set up a committee to consider in what way to end the 20-year tax exemption.  The fact that Deputy Lalor established that committee was made known.  It was public knowledge.  That was confirmed at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis in February, 1972.  <i>The Irish Press</i> of 21st February, 1972, stated:</P>
    <P>Mr. Lalor suggested that the 20-year tax free holiday for foreign mining companies may be coming to an end.</P>
    <P>Then a gentleman of great wisdom and analytical capacity said&mdash;I quote Mr. James Healy of the Donogh O'Malley Cumann in University College, Cork&mdash;&ldquo;The Government&mdash; and that is the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;made their great mistake in extending the tax free holiday for mining to 20 years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This clearly indicates that the posture now being adopted by Fianna Fáil is not one which is in keeping <Col N="1997" /> with their own analysis of their 1967 mistake.  Within four years of giving the exemption they realised that there was a serious need to correct it and that it was a prodigal incentive. In that situation the exhortations to me now to provide in addition to the seven years' total exemption further exemptions is not one which carries a great deal of weight.  The people who have enjoyed the seven years did so without giving anything very specific in return for that enjoyment. None of them entered into any new arrangement as a consequence of that 1967 legislation.  They were all in the mining business before the 1967 legislation.  That is very pertinent, particularly when one comes to deal with the point which Deputy Colley made about quasi-contractual rights which people might have had.  Deputy Colley says they had been led into a situation of belief that the exemption would remain for 20 years.  They did not act as a consequence of that, even if they had believed it.</P>
    <P>From the quotations I have given it is quite clear that anybody who knew anything about mining was of the opinion that the bonanza was too good to be true and certainly too good to last.  All that is happening now is that their reasonable anticipations have been fulfilled.  I would not even call them gloomy forecasts because from what I have quoted there is no indication that it would be a dreadful or a damaging thing that the 20-year tax exemption would be qualified.  It has been enjoyed for over one-third of the period.  Those who enjoyed it have little reason now to grouse.  Even as it is being terminated they will be able to enjoy concessions in the future in respect of their continuing interest in mining. That is what we are primarily interested in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why it should be so difficult to bring the Minister to the real point.  None of the quotations he has given bear out what he has said or contradict what I said.  Furthermore, he referred to the announcement by the previous Government about setting up an interdepartmental committee to examine <Col N="1998" /> the incentives for mining.  I had adverted to them before the Minister rose to speak.  The whole point I am making is that it was clear from the announcements of the previous Government and, as the Minister said, to those engaged in mining, that as mines developed the incentives granted in 1967 would not be necessary to induce further development of mining and, therefore, the 20-year exemption given in 1967 was almost certain to be taken away, in some form or other, from new mines.  That is the point I am making to the Minister&mdash;from new mines.  There was never any suggestion from the previous Government in any of their announcements and, I submit, never any suggestion in the quotations the Minister gave us, that the exemptions would be taken away from existing mines.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a legitimate point that existing mines started before the exemption was brought in.  I do not know what went before that, whether there was any discussion between the then Minister for Finance and the mining companies.  Whether there was-or not, the fact is that while a mine might be started there are developments which take place and financial arrangements have to be made.  I have hard evidence in relation to one mining company, and I am informed that it applies to other mining companies, that financial arrangements were made based on the 1967 exemptions. Money was raised by way of equity or loan on the basis of that exemption.  If that is so, I am sure the Minister can see that the taking away of that exemption in relation to those mines and companies is something which, at the very least, will create problems for them and may well damage our reputation which is vitally important to our future economic development.  Therefore, I am urging the Minister, if he cannot see his way to maintaining the exemption for existing mines, at least to show that he is aware of this problem by giving the allowances to the existing mines in respect of previous development which he proposes to give new mines in respect of future development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> I should like to ask the Minister what is involved in this for the Exchequer? On Second Stage he gave an estimate of revenue to the Exchequer which made it clear that over a 20-year period the average revenue to be expected as a result of applying this Bill, as then drafted, to all mines present and future would be in the region of a little over £6 million per annum. He also made it clear that for the next few years there would be very little income.  I wonder how much revenue is actually involved in this matter as far as existing mines are concerned.  I want to make it clear to the Minister because I do not think he has grasped this point yet that I am talking about existing mines and not new mines, or the allowances to be granted to them. How much revenue would be involved if, for instance, the allowance provided for under section 6 were to be given to existing mines?  I suggest that the amount of revenue we are talking about in this section and indeed, overall, in relation to existing mines is extremely small, particularly in relation to the damage done and the potential damage which can be done to our economy. He ought to reconsider his approach in regard to existing mines.  I repeat, I am not talking about new mines.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that the terms for new mines could be much more stringent than those which existed for existing mines.  No new mining lease has been granted for about eight years. When we are talking about new mines, we are talking about a completely new situation.  In regard to existing mines I suggest that the consequences of what the Minister is doing will be serious and that the return to the Exchequer will be relatively very small.  Even at this late stage the Minister ought to mend his hand.  There will be very little involved for the Exchequer but there could be a very great amount involved for the whole of the economy if he does not mend his hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little more I can say which I have not already said.  There is no ground whatsoever for this repeated irresponsible Fianna Fáil allegation that any damage has been done to our economy <Col N="2000" /> or to investment in this country.  Deputy Colley has been waxing indignant about the high bids people are making for interests in Irish mining. The simple answer is that this shows the confidence the people have in Irish mining and in the very fair package which we have produced here which is on a par with what other comparable countries are offering in any part of the world.</P>
      <P>If there is any criticism of the Government's proposals it is that we are being too generous towards the mining industry and that the £125 million, which I said would be gathered over the next 20 years, is too little and we should be taking more.  That is on the basis of existing figures and existing prices.  We could anticipate that over the same period there will be variations in price which could double that figure or bring it to something even higher.  I would not feel justified in granting this particular request which Deputy Colley is making, which covers as much as £9 or £10 million. That would be taken off the £125 million which a large body of responsible opinion feel is an inadequate recovery for the economy for the immense wealth which is being taken out of Ireland by the mining industry.</P>
      <P>Having listened with some understanding to the arguments advanced and having listened very sympathetically over several months to representations from the mining industry.  I believe we are correct in confining an incentive which is intended for future exploration to future exploration, and not using that particular incentive as a device to give compensation in respect of what I respectfully express as &ldquo;illusory&rdquo; losses by people who invested in an industry primarily because it had inherent in it a capacity to make a profit.  They invested in it irrespective of the fiscal arrangements applicable to the industry.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The basic question here, as Deputy Colley put it, is that of undermining confidence.  Can a Government, even the Government now in power, give an undertaking to industrialists coming into this country that any concessions given will not be withdrawn? It is quite obvious now that any Government can break contracts.  I agree with Deputy Colley that any undertaking given from now on as regards new mines could contain far more stringent conditions.  However, if a businessman enters into a contract with a bank or any other financial institution it is important that he be assured that such a commitment will be honoured.  The Government may have undermined confidence abroad, especially, because the finger can very easily be pointed at this country that with a change of Government here undertakings, especially financial undertakings such as this, can be broken very easily.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am dealing with the basic principle involved in this section.  It will be seen from Deputy Colley's amendment that he is seeking exemption prior to a certain date.  Therefore the principle I am invoking has a bearing on the amendment.  What Deputy Colley has in mind, if I follow his argument properly, is that commitments prior to a certain date should be honoured.  This is important from a business point of view.  Businessmen always like to be assured that even with a change of Government the contracts they enter into will be kept. As regards future arrangements in regard to new mines I should think the Minister would be entitled to lay down any regulations he thought fit, but I would be concerned that confidence would not be undermined in this field.</P>

If I might briefly repeat it.  I got the impression from something the Minister said earlier he felt in relation to this amendment that it was inappropriate because this investment allowance was designed to encourage future development. I conceded to him that I thought there was a certain logic in what he was saying.  I asked whether, from what he had said earlier, I could take it that he would consider applying in some way the other allowances proposed in this Bill to pre-1974 expenditure.  If he gave an indication of that kind, our attitude in regard to this and other amendments might perhaps be different. I may have misunderstood something he said earlier.</P>

    <P>If I can avoid it I do not wish to go back over the ground we have been covering on previous amendments, although the principle involved here is the same.  I might perhaps be able to short-circuit the matter somewhat if I were now to put to the Minister the question I put to him on a previous amendment.  Was what he said earlier intended to indicate that he would be prepared in some way to grant to <Col N="2006" /> existing mines in respect of expenditure before 31st March, 1974, the annual allowance for mineral depletion provided specifically in this section, and indeed in other sections, and to allow it to operate in regard to pre-1974 activities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said already, I regard the exemption which has previously existed as providing relief for previous expenditure.  It would be indefensible to add to that magnificent exemption already enjoyed, incentives and further concessions which are really being provided in order to ensure encouragement for the mining industry in the future.  If I understand Deputy Colley's amendment correctly, he is seeking to ensure the depletion allowance in respect of scheduled mineral assets acquired before 31st March, 1974, that is, assets acquired by any existing company.</P>
      <P>On Second Reading Deputy Colley suggested that if a mining company now sells a scheduled mineral asset it would be subject to a tax charge on the receipts from the sale, notwithstanding the fact that it receives no relief under section 8 for the cost of acquiring it.  It is to be noted that, in the first place, it is provided in section 11 (3) that where a scheduled mineral asset which is sold by a person was bought by him the receipt on which he is to be charged tax is to be reduced by the amount paid by him for the scheduled mineral asset.  This is an important matter which we have to bear in mind.</P>

      <P>Where a person sells under section 11 he will be subject to tax on his receipt but that receipt would be reduced, as it were, by the amount which he paid for the asset which he sells.  First of all he purchases the asset, and sells it later.  The liability would relate only to the difference between the two figures.</P>

      <P>Am I not right in saying that in the case of a person commencing to work a qualifying mine after 31st March, 1974, such a person operating under section 11 will also be entitled to deduct the mineral depletion allowance, whereas those commencing before that date will not?

      <P>Does the Minister accept that existing mining companies may have raised money on the basis of the existing law and that the taking away of that exemption can certainly cause difficulties in regard to the financing of such companies?  If he accepts that, does he also accept <Col N="2008" /> that the position is not simply: &ldquo;You had the tax free allowance. Now you have not.  Because you had the tax free allowance you are not entitled to any other allowance in relation to the pre-1974 period.&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>All the existing companies have had their cake.  Do they want to have it forever?  They have enjoyed a bonanza which others have not enjoyed and there is no reason why, having enjoyed it, they should get in addition the fringe benefits which will be available to the mining industry in the future and which have not been offered to other industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have with me a letter from one of the mining companies in which they state quite specifically:</P>
      <P>... the policies of my Company and their shareholders have been formulated and implemented on the basis, not merely of that legislation, but on the explicit understanding with the then Minister for Finance, and subsequently emphasised by several Ministers to the effect that the mining companies would enjoy an exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax for a period of twenty years from the date on which a mine is brought into commercial production, provided that date is prior to April 6, 1986.</P>
      <P>Substantial financial commitments have been undertaken including the issue of equity shares, based on the belief that a contractual relationship existed between the Government and the companies in relation to this exemption.</P>
      <P>If the legislative provisions were not tantamount to a contractual relationship, then the availability of a tax exemption expiring on the specified date should not have been held out as a long term incentive to mining companies.  It would seem vital that the country's credibility in relation to the many people and financial institutions who have invested in existing operations, should be preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the Minister at least accepts that there is one company, <Col N="2009" /> and probably more, which did raise money on the basis of the existing exemption and that if one changes or takes away the existing exemption problems can arise for such a company. Does the Minister accept that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  If problems arise for a company the company will be entitled to marginal relief.  We have very specifically provided for that.  There may be a reduction in profit but that is what taxation is all about&mdash;to relate the obligation to contribute to the revenue according to capacity to pay.  We are providing that no company should be in difficulty on account of the tax liability because it will be given relief which will be available for any mines which would be in jeopardy because of the tax liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But does the Minister appreciate that these financial arrangements were entered into and that they were entered into with foreign financial institutions on the basis of the existing law and that, as I pointed out earlier, this is not analogous to the ordinary income tax provisions.  This was a specific statutory provision giving a 20-year exemption not analogous to the ordinary income tax provisions, which are of course subject to change at any time. Does the Minister appreciate the distinction between these two things? Does he appreciate that the consequence of what he is doing is not only to create problems for the mining company or companies concerned but also to damage this country's credibility?  Surely this factor cannot escape the Minister's attention?</P>

      <P>It is not escaping the Minister's attention.  The Minister would point out that the special plea in a letter that Deputy Colley referred to&mdash;although I noticed that he did not tell us what company it was that wrote it and that might be a matter of some interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Deputy will also understand that the authority of the letter remains questionable as long as it is not disclosed.  It does contain a number of inaccuracies. Perhaps the remainder of the letter can be tested by the fact that it refers to the undertaking of the Minister in 1967 to give tax exemption for 20 years, an undertaking which it is said was confirmed by a number of his successors.  If &ldquo;a number&rdquo; is one that might be correct, but I think the phrase used led one to believe that there had been more than one successor giving that confirmation, which Deputy Colley knows would be incorrect because he was the only successor to the Minister who gave the exemption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>I see.  The ground is changing somewhat all the time. Deputy Colley has canvassed this idea. I cannot say any more by way of reply to it other than to point out that he is asking us to give a further benefit to people who have enjoyed seven years total exemption.  I cannot accept that that principle is applicable to this or any other particular concession or exemption which is being given in order to promote future development of Irish mines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister unless he changes his tune radically when we come to the last two amendments, which I do not anticipate, is not alone welching on a statutory undertaking given by this House and by the other House and supported by both sides, but that he <Col N="2011" /> is not prepared having done that even to apply, by way of some compensation for welching on such an arrangement, the allowances he proposes to give for future mining operations.  I think it is very unfortunate.  It already has had adverse consequences, and the persistence in this attitude can only have adverse consequences for the future with no even reasonably commensurate benefit for the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I would guess that if the Minister were starting all over again he would not adopt this approach, that he realises it was a mistake and that he is now stuck with it.  If I am right in that, it is unfortunate that he should persist in his error, because it seems clear to me that it has always been the approach on both sides of this House that in cases like this where you are changing the rules of the game you change them for future entrants, not for those who are already in there and operating on the basis of the provisions already agreed to I do not want to labour this point, but it is very unfortunate that the Minister cannot see his way even to make some compensating gesture for the very misguided action which he and his colleagues have taken in this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 8, lines 6 and 7, to delete &ldquo;The Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The Revenue Commissioners, on production to them of a certificate from the Minister for Industry and Commerce under subsection (1)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that on the Second Stage I referred to this section and expressed some misgivings about it as drafted.  Perhaps I would be permitted to quote briefly what I said on that occasion, which is reported at column 538 of the Official Report for Wednesday, 1st May, 1974.</P>
      <P>I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to section 10, which deals with marginal mines, I am somewhat unhappy at the vesting of the power provided in that section in the Minister for Finance as such. On the face of it this would seem to be quite inappropriate.  I note also that there is no provision for an appeal against whatever decision the Minister would make.  Indeed it is difficult to see how you could provide an appeal if one adheres to the Minister's proposals to vest this power in the Minister for Finance. It would seem to me that a better arrangement would be to give the power to the Revenue Commissioners with the right of appeal to the Appeal Commissioners.  It may be that the Minister will be able to show us that there is something wrong with this approach and that it is necessary to have the power vested in the Minister himself, but the reasons would want to be very <Col N="2013" /> compelling to justify a provision of this nature.</P>
    <P>I do not think it could fairly be said that in replying to the Second Stage debate the Minister gave any very compelling reasons to justify this.  It is undesirable, if it can be avoided at all, to have a situation in which the Minister for Finance, as distinct from the Revenue Commissioners, in effect decides on the amount of a taxpayer's liabilities.  That of itself is objectionable, not alone from the point of view of the general public, but from the point of view of the Minister.  It is not the kind of duty, obligation or power any reasonable Minister for Finance would want to have.  It has the consequential effect I have adverted to, that by doing it in this way it seems to preclude the possibility of any appeal against the decision.</P>
    <P>I tried, as Minister for Finance, to introduce the right of appeal in any case of any decision on tax matters by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is a good principle and I do not think we should depart from that if we can avoid it.  As I indicated on Second Stage it may be that there is some tremendous difficulty involved here which prevents the Minister from accepting the kind of suggestion I have made which is that the Revenue Commissioners would make the decision on the basis of the certificates given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce provided for in subsection (1).  You could then provide for an appeal to the appeals commissioners. It may be there is some very substantial reason why this cannot be done but if there is I do not think the Minister has told us yet. Perhaps he will do so now if he does not accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley is criticising the section as drafted because he says it would empower the Minister for Finance to decide what a person's tax liability would be and that this is not a function of a Minister for Finance or one that any reasonable Minister for Finance would want to have for himself but that it is a function of the Revenue Commissioners. A good debating point and I acknowledge it as one but I will give <Col N="2014" /> him a good debating point, which is this.  The Revenue Commissioners are not policy makers.  It is not right that they should be.  They should not seek to adjudicate on the management of a business.  Their statutory function is a neutral function, which is to assess a person's tax liability on the basis of profits made, not whether a business would close down if tax is gathered.</P>
      <P>The decision which has to be taken in this case is whether or not a mine would be unworked if tax had to be paid.  That is a commercial decision which has to be made in the light of many considerations other than pure tax considerations.  That is why we are very much in the field of policy, commercial and industrial decisions.  It is not the Minister for Finance who will make the major decision in this case.  The research would have to be conducted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce because it is he who will have to certify that the mine is unlikely to be worked or will continue to be worked.  It is only after those consultations have been held with the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Minister for Finance may direct in respect of such a mine that the tax might be remitted.</P>
      <P>One point is as good as the other but the weight of the argument falls very much, it seems to me, on the side of the section as drafted because it is primarily a policy decision which is beyond the ken of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the Minister is right in saying that this would be a policy decision.  I think he is right in saying that the fundamental decision in a matter such as this would be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I assume the practical effect of a certificate from the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be that in relation to a particular mine the prospects were that its profits would amount to so much, over a certain period of years perhaps, and, therefore, the decision to be made by the Minister for Finance, as envisaged under the section, would be whether no tax should be payable or whether a reduced <Col N="2015" /> rate of tax should be payable, the object being to produce a situation in which there would remain sufficient profit to induce the mine-owner to continue the operation and not to close down because the operation was non-viable.</P>
      <P>It seems to be stretching the situation somewhat to say that that is a policy decision and one appropriate to the Minister for Finance.  It is true that certain commercial expertise is required to make the correct decision but I do not think one can assume commercial expertise as such in a Minister for Finance.  There is not much doubt, I suppose, that some holders of the office have had considerable expertise but it is not a necessary ingredient in the holder of the office of Minister for Finance.  It seems that to a great extent the decision that has to be made would be made by reference to what was happening in other mines, what kind of returns were being obtained in other mines, particularly those that were getting close to the marginal situation and ultimately perhaps by some form of negotiation with the owners but backed up with these kinds of figures.</P>
      <P>The people who would have this information in regard to other mines would be the Revenue Commissioners, not the Minister for Finance.  He should not have the information in relation to other mines and again would not want to have it.  There is quite a strong case for the amendment I am proposing.  There is also a point I raised earlier, and to which the Minister did not advert when replying, that is by giving the decision to the Minister for Finance one seems to be effectively precluding the possibility of an appeal.  I would accept there should not be an appeal from a decision of the Minister but I hope he will accept that as far as it is possible we should provide for an appeal on all decisions as to the amount of tax which a taxpayer has to pay.  Here we are excluding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel the Minister is exaggerating the degree of policy in the ordinarily understood sense of that word that is involved in this decision.  I feel to <Col N="2016" /> make the decision it is necessary to have other information which would and should be available only to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is inappropriate that such power should be vested in the Minister for Finance, inappropriate and unacceptable unless the Minister can give very compelling reasons for it and on his own statement I think he would only put his counter-argument at about the same level as my argument.  Certainly, even on his own say-so it would not be regarded as a compelling reason.  I urge him very strongly to consider the implications, not just in this particular case but possibly for different situations which would arise apart from mining and to adhere to what I might call the normal practice, I think, that decisions of this kind would not be made by the Minister personally but by the Revenue Commissioners and with a consequent right of appeal.</P>
    <P>I do not think the matter is of vital importance from the point of view of the argument put forward by the Minister but it could conceivably be of vital importance looked at from the point of view of the argument I am putting forward.  If there is not all that much in it the Minister should come down on the side of the Revenue Commissioners with right of appeal rather than that of the Minister alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Chair would need to have a balance in order to adjudicate on which side the greater weight of argument really lies.  It is no discredit to the Revenue Commissioners to say that if they have a discretion they usually use it in favour of the Exchequer rather than the taxpayer so that if this discretion were to be conferred on them I doubt very much if the principal beneficiary would be the person or persons Deputy Colley seeks to benefit.  I expect Deputy Colley considered that his amendment would have conferred upon a taxpayer a right of appeal but, in fact, it does not provide for any such right, nor could there be a right of appeal in the circumstances of this case because that right only arises where there is a statutory title to a particular tax remission.  No statutory title, no absolute right exists <Col N="2017" /> in relation to this provision which is a concession.  It is a concession similar to that contained in the Petroleum and Other Minerals (Development) Act, 1960, in which power was conferred on the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Section 55 of that Act provides that if the total amount paid by the holder of a petroleum lease in respect of rent, royalties, taxes and rates exceeds such amount as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may determine, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may make a payment to the lessee of the excess.</P>
      <P>There is a difference between that situation and the one which arises under this Bill in that in this Bill the only issue which arises is the question of relating a tax liability.  There is no element of rent, royalties or rates; it is simply concerned with tax which, I suppose, is affected to the extent that the profits of a company will be measured only after other liabilities have been taken into account.  But it is clearly a case where it is primarily a question of a tax concession and as such the Minister for Finance is obviously appropriate to make the final decision as to whether the concession should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might help if we look at the way the scheme will actually work.  First, a person who is operating a mine which he considers to be marginal will ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to adjudicate the mine as marginal and to issue a certificate to the Minister for Finance.  In such a case the Minister for Industry and Commerce would examine the circumstances relating to the mine, cost of operation, likely output, price of metal, capital investment and level of profits likely to be derived from the mine and if satisfied that the level of profit is such that it is unlikely that the mine will be worked or continue to be worked, the Minister would then give a certificate that it is a marginal mine.  The question will arise each year as to what extent, if any, there is to be a remission of tax on profit.  This position could change from year to year depending <Col N="2018" /> on the price obtained for ore sold and the level of profits.</P>
    <P>When the company makes up its accounts for a particular year it will then, if it considers it appropriate, apply for relief under this section. At that stage the inspector will examine the accounts and prepare a draft assessment of tax for the particular year of assessment to income tax and accounting period for corporation tax.  At that stage consultation will take place between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the extent to which tax for the year of assessment and the accounting year ought to be abated.  Quite clearly a policy decision will then have to be made which only Ministers are competent to make.  It would not be a decision which would fall within the competence of the Revenue Commissioners. Therefore, I suggest to Deputy Colley that on reflection he might see that the Bill as drafted confers this power to grant the exemption in the right quarter, the policy-making quarter.  As I said earlier, I think it would be a disservice to the industry to suggest that this policy-making decision should lie in an area which has not until now a right to make policy and is ill equipped to test various factors which would have to be borne in mind in the issuing of a certificate as to whether a mine would be likely to be worked in future.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any point in pursuing this.  I do not agree with the Minister's argument but it is not at the moment a vital matter and I trust it will never become one because if it does I think the wrong decision is being made by the Minister.  I shall not push the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I adverted to this section on Second Stage, taken in particular in conjunction with section 8, <Col N="2019" /> and we have dealt with some of the consequences of taking it in conjunction with section 8.  But there is another matter to which I adverted and it arises in connection with the consequences of the Minister's proposals, adjusted though they have been, in relation to capital gains tax.  It is appropriate that we should consider this in relation to this section because under the Minister's original announcement, although we have not passed the legislation, capital gains tax is now in operation.</P>
      <P>It seems that under this section if land is sold to a mining company the proceeds of the sale will become liable to income tax at the normal rates. However, if the same land was sold for any other purpose, for instance to a builder, the result would be, under the capital gains tax provisions, that the amount by which the sale price exceeded the value of land as at 5th April this year would be subjected, under the recent changes announced by the Minister, to capital gains tax at 26 per cent.  On the face of it this would appear to be an anomalous consequence and I wonder why there ought to be a difference in the approach to the taxing of the proceeds of the sale of land on which there are minerals from the sale of other land to be used for any other purpose.</P>
      <P>I have demonstrated under this section that the consequences would be quite different and the effect could well be, if there was a mineral deposit which was not excessively valuable and might be marginally worth developing, to induce the owner not to part with the land because the amount of tax he would suffer would be so much greater than if he disposed of the land for any other purpose.  I accept that that is a fairly remote possibility but it is one that could occur.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the apparent anomaly of imposing what would almost certainly be a much higher rate of tax on land sold for mineral development purposes as against land or any other property sold for any other purpose.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate why there ought to be this difference in approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2020" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer to section I which defines a &ldquo;schedule mineral asset&rdquo; as &ldquo;a deposit of scheduled minerals or land comprising such a deposit or an interest in or right over such deposit or land.&rdquo; If a person having such asset was to decide to make a profit by taking royalties from a mining company then such royalties would be liable to income tax.  If the owner of the mineral assets was to choose to work the mine himself he would become subject to income tax on the profits.  The connection between section 8 and section 11, to which we referred earlier, lies in the fact that under section 8 the purchaser of a scheduled mineral asset would be able to claim a depletion allowance in respect of the expenditure involved in the acquisition of that asset against his mining profits over the life of the mine, or 20 years if shorter.</P>
      <P>It is only logical that if the person who acquires the scheduled mineral asset is to get the benefit of a depletion allowance a corresponding charge should be made against the vendor.  If we did not do this then the person who sold mineral rights as distinct from the person who worked them or took royalties from them would be in an extremely favourable position.  The State, having regard to the depletion allowance provision of section 8, would be the loser. I should like to illustrate it with a hypothetical example.  Somebody could own a mineral asset worth £15 million and sell it for £50 million.  As a consequence of the depletion allowance the State would end up in such a case £25 million the loser unless the vendor were to be subject to income tax on the sale.  If the vendor is to be subject to income tax on the sale, as we propose, then the State would have a set off against what would otherwise have to be allowed in respect of the depletion allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a precedent for this and I think it is a good one.  The Finance Act of 1959 provided the making of a charge in the case of the sales of patent rights and this charge is confirmed in sections 284 to 293 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Here we are providing that the profit made on the <Col N="2021" /> sale of a scheduled mineral asset can be spread over a number of years to avoid hardship.  It can be spread over six years and this is quite a generous provision.  The sale of patent rights which are subject to a tax liability could also be spread over a number of years.  Deputy Colley will see that if we did not make this provision here a greater anomaly and injustice could arise.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that Deputy Colley had a good debating point when he asked what the difference was between the sale of land which contains a mineral asset and the sale of land which does not.  There is a difference between land which contains mineral and land which does not.  The land which contains the mineral asset was bought primarily not for the land as land but for the wealth which is underneath it and that is what is being taxed here; it is not the land as such. The depletion allowance is being given because it is assumed that in the course of the working of a mine the land above it will become depleted in value.  Essentially it is the mineral wealth which is being taxed and not the land itself.  Perhaps &ldquo;the area&rdquo; is what we should be describing this as.  It is the wealth that is being taxed and not the area above it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take this £50 million sale and if that sale took place after April, 1974, in such a case there would be no capital gain or there would be no calculable capital gain between now and the commencement of the capital gain liability period. Nothing would arise now.  In future, if it is a cardinal principle of the capital gains law that one would not subject <Col N="2022" /> a profit to a capital gain and to income tax at the same time it would not arise.  The Deputy will appreciate that in relation to capital gains it is only the gain that is subject to the tax and not the value below the gain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was making.  The consequence would seem to be that the tax payable by, for instance, a farmer, on the sale of land containing mineral assets would be very much greater than that on the sale of land for any other purpose.  He might be selling land in certain circumstances, say for building, and making a very handsome profit on the deal but, nevertheless, it would appear that under this provision the amount of tax he would pay and the rate of tax he would pay would be very considerably higher if it was the sale of a mineral asset as distinct from land sold for building purposes.  Would the Minister agree that that would appear to be the consequence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  But, of course, no depletion allowance would arise in the case of the sale of land without a mineral asset but a depletion allowance arises here and the Revenue would be at a considerable loss by reason of the depletion allowance being given to the purchaser.  It is only equitable in such a case that the vendor would be brought within the liability for tax.  It would appear from what the Minister is saying that the vendor, the farmer, is going to have to pay because the mining company is getting a depletion allowance which the farmer is not getting.  The farmer does not have to sell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an anomaly here.  In effect, the Minister is applying <Col N="2023" /> to the farmer concerned a rate of tax which is, as I said, vastly higher than would be applied for any other purpose and the main justification he is giving for it is that he proposes to give a depletion allowance, not to the farmer but to the mining company.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Minister has inside information and is shortly expecting some very valuable strikes, but there is the interesting point that if minerals were discovered on someone's land today whether its value on 5th April, 1974, would be deemed to be the value when one did not know about the minerals or, using hindsight, whether you valued it as having the minerals in it.  I can see I am making no impression on the Minister.  I do not suppose many citizens will be affected by this.  It may be, speaking from past experience, that if there are citizens affected by this they will be in the Acting Chairman's constituency in Galway; and I hope, if what I am arguing happens, the Acting Chairman will be in a position to tell the taxpayer concerned that I did my best with the Minister but he would not agree.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 30, to delete &ldquo;whether&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;where&rdquo;; and in line 31 to delete &ldquo;before&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Acting Chairman has pointed out, these amendments are cognate though they relate to two different sections.  They have precisely the same purpose, namely, to undo the Minister's proposal to take away the tax exemption from existing mines.  From the point of view of orderly debate we should, perhaps, have discussed these first, in which case most of the <Col N="2025" /> other amendments I tabled would not have arisen had these been accepted.</P>
    <P>Once again, as far as we are concerned, I want to make it quite clear that the treatment of new mines is quite separate and should be quite separate from the treatment of existing mines.  When we were in Government we made it quite plain that the development of mining here had reached a sufficient level to ensure that we did not need to continue the exemption given in the 1967 Act for new mines; in other words, with smaller inducements, we could get mineral development continued at a satisfactory rate.  As was said earlier, we set up an inter-departmental committee to examine closely the kind of return the community could hope to get from future mineral development and still leave such development sufficiently profitable to induce mining companies to embark on mineral development. A considerable amount of work had gone into that when we left office and more work went into it after the present Government took over.  That committee duly reported to the Government and I understand decisions were then made.  It is our contention that the decisions made were, to say the least of it, mistaken. There may well be a case for applying more stringent taxation proposals now to new mines than are provided in this Bill.  I would have been making this case much more strongly if I did not believe that the Government may well have it in mind to supplement the taxation proposals by the level of royalties levied on new mines.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that, again as far as we are concerned, we believe the level of mineral development is such that our approach now can afford to be much more stringent than it was.  We are in a much stronger bargaining position than we were when the last lease was granted eight or nine years ago.  Whatever we do about new mines, and whether we want to argue that these provisions are too stringent or not stringent enough, whatever view we may take on that, the question of the treatment of existing mines is a quite separate and distinct question.  Some people <Col N="2026" /> have endeavoured to misrepresent our position in this matter as though we thought that the existing exemptions should continue to apply to all new mines.  The fact that we set up the inter-departmental committee and made announcements about this shows that that is totally untrue and that our approach was to try to get as much as possible for the community from new mines.</P>
    <P>However, when one comes to the question of existing mines one is faced with the position that an exemption for a 20-year period was agreed to by this and the other House.  In this House, and I think in the other House, it was agreed to on both sides and was built into our legislation and operated by existing mining companies who geared their financial arrangements to that provision, written so solemnly into our legislation.  I think it is an extremely serious matter that this Government would consider welching on that arrangement not just in relation to the mining companies concerned, though I believe we have an obligation to any individual or company operating under laws enacted by the Oireachtas, whether Irish citizens or not: we should not decide to deal with them inequitably or unjustly&mdash;not to do so knowingly, anyway.</P>
    <P>Apart from that aspect the consequence of the Government's decision as embodied in these two sections, and which the amendments I am moving are designed to cure, is that an existing statutory exemption for a 20-year period, held out as an inducement to mining companies, is to be withdrawn not just from new companies but from existing companies who were operating under it.  I think this was a mistaken decision by the Government.  Even if the amount of revenue involved were enormous, taking a long term view of our economy and of our dependence on attracting foreign investment if we are to solve our unemployment problem, it would be wiser and more profitable in the long run to stick to a deal made and written into legislation for existing companies.  The fact is that the amount of revenue involved is relatively <Col N="2027" /> quite small, and for that relatively small amount of revenue, I believe we have done ourselves considerable damage and are leaving ourselves in a position where further damage can ensue for us.</P>
    <P>It is a well known fact, adverted to once more today at Question Time by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that we are in a very competitive business in trying to attract investment from abroad.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, people considering investing here can look almost all round the world and find inducements offered to them in various places.  That being so, we should not be putting at risk the good name of this country in attracting investment.  We should not be destroying the reputation, hard earned over long slogging years, that this country, unlike a number of other countries, had abroad that if a deal were made with an Irish Government it was kept.  It is vitally important that that reputation should be maintained and this far transcends the mining industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say it is wrong, and possibly that it is mischievous, to say that damage has been caused to us in this way.  But the fact is that after this announcement of the Government's and the Minister's intention to withdraw the statutory exemption from existing mining companies, almost immediately one member of the Government, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, spoke about the decision and went out of his way to assure potential foreign investors that the existing tax exemptions for profits on industrial exports would not be withdrawn. Subsequently the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I think the Minister for Finance, and certainly the Taoiseach, made similar speeches, going so far as to say they would personally undertake in writing that the exemption from tax on profits of industrial exports would not be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>There is only one other possible explanation for this, which I referred to on another occasion and rejected. The explanation which I reject is <Col N="2028" /> that the Government were so inept and incompetent that they did not realise that by offering these written undertakings they were drawing attention to the danger people thought might exist.  I have a pretty low opinion of the Government in many fields but I do not believe they would be so inept or incompetent as to make that mistake.  Consequently I am left with the only possible conclusion that those speeches by Ministers and the Taoiseach offering written undertakings that the statutory exemption in regard to profits on industrial exports would not be withdrawn were offered because the Government had discovered, having made the announcement of the provisions contained in this section, that numerous potential foreign investors in industry in this country took fright, that they needed reassurance, and great efforts were made by the Government to give that reassurance, the latest being by the Minister for Finance on the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I submit that kind of reassurance would not have been necessary if potential foreign investors had not been frightened by the Government's announcement, and that potential foreign investors should not have been freightened&mdash;that the Government should have looked ahead to the consequences of what they were doing.</P>
    <P>If the Government had announced that this taxation provision would apply to new mining in Ireland there would have been no problem&mdash;no basic problem would have arisen.  The real problem arose because the Government made it clear they were going to apply the new mining regime to existing companies and take away the statutory exemption.  A little thought on the part of the Government would have shown precisely what would happen if they made that announcement, and clearly no thought was given to the consequences.  But when it happened then we had this&mdash; I think it would be reasonably fair to describe it as a frantic effort&mdash;frantic effort by members of the Government, including the Taoiseach, to provide reassurance, to offer written undertakings in regard to something that <Col N="2029" /> was inscribed in the legislation of this State.  To say the least it was an anomalous situation.  It was a situation which should never have been allowed arise.  It was a situation which, potentially, would be far more damaging to the economy of this country than any revenue that would be brought in by applying this Bill and its provisions to existing mines. It was a mistake.  I think the evidence is there that it was a mistake.  The Government have tried, rightly in my opinion, to reassure people so that they would not be frightened off because the consequences of that could be extremely serious for employment in this country.  But the most effective reassurance that the Government could give, by far the most effective reassurance, would be to accept these amendments with the consequence of continuing the existing exemption for existing mining companies only.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of years experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I know just how delicate can be the situation in regard to the attraction of industries from abroad to the kind of image that potential investors have of the economic climate in a country, and the image that was created prior to this announcement in this country was an extremely good one.  One of the greatest assets&mdash;and this was repeated to me by numerous foreign industrialists&mdash;we had was the understanding that if one made a deal with the Irish Government that deal stood.  I hope that, by now, the Minister has recognised the mistake of that announcement.  I hope he will not attempt to argue, in face of all the evidence to which I have referred, that no damage has been done. The real question is: what is the best way, in so far as one can, to undo that damage?  I would suggest there is no better or more effective way than that suggested in these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1967 20-year tax holiday was an inducement.  I think Deputy Colley agrees that it was an inducement to people to explore and develop mines in this country. Nobody acted on foot of that inducement.  Therefore there can be no question of anybody having been <Col N="2030" /> done a disservice by reason of the 1967 inducement or the withdrawal of it.  The position is absolutely static as far as the development of mines is concerned on foot of the 1967 inducement. I consider it particularly fortunate for Ireland that we should have in power a Government that have the will to bring that improvident inducement to an end before somebody acted on foot of it.  I would accept that there might have been some difficulties had somebody acted on foot of that inducement but the fact is that nobody has so acted.  They are particularly lucky that the Government changed last year and came to this decision before we ended up in a situation where irreparable damage had been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley is suggesting that all would be well if we merely applied the removal of the tax exemptions in respect of future companies.  I think it important that the people should see what Deputy Colley is at.  The effect of doing that would be that what we have, very modestly, estimated as a revenue of £125 million over the next 20 years would be totally lost.  Deputy Colley is saying that we should not collect £125 million, minimum, from mining companies over the next 20 years.  One hundred and twenty-five million pounds is probably a very conservative estimate.  On the basis of the very substantial increases in prices for ores over the last few months and what we can anticipate will be the likely rise in prices over the next 20 years, the not improbable figure runs into a few hundred millions, maybe several hundred millions.  That is on the basis of all existing mines.  Deputy Colley is saying here, and the Fianna Fáil Party are saying: Forget it all. Do not provide that relief for the Irish taxpayer because that is in fact what the collection of this tax from the mining interests means for all other taxpayers in this country&mdash;some element of relief, because if the mining industry did not pay its share of taxation, taxation would have to be got from some other source.  God knows our people are taxed heavily enough already without exempting a particular industry in a better position <Col N="2031" /> to pay tax than many of the unfortunate people still in the taxation net.</P>
    <P>I would recall, from February to November, 1973, there was not a spark of life to be found in the Fianna Fáil Party; they could not find any issue upon which they had any heart to attack the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Once we announced our intention to remove the tax exemption from the mining industry they got fire in their bellies and came out loud in continuous condemnation of our measures.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have tried to keep a balance between what they know the public wants, on the one hand, and pleasing some of their contacts in the mining industry, on the other.  But the reality of the matter for the vast majority of our people, who considered it a scandal that the mining industry should be exempt for 20 years from mining taxation, is that the Fianna Fáil stance tonight on the last sections of the Committee Stage of this Bill is that everything that we have done so far is wrong, that we were wrong to bring within the net all the existing mines.  The only calculations we have made so far are on the basis of the mines that exist, the mines about which we know something. Those are the only ones upon which we can now make an assessment of what the ending of the tax holiday really means for the future of all other Irish taxpayers.  I have given that figure on a very conservative basis.  But if, as it is reasonable to anticipate, other mineral deposits become available in this country for exploration and development over the next few years, the profit will be even greater.  What that profit may be we do not know, but certainly it was justifiable that we should ensure that, whatever that profit might be, it would <Col N="2032" /> be caught for the benefit of the Exchequer here, because operating for the benefit of the Exchequer it operates to the benefit of all other Irish taxpayers.  Fianna Fáil are now with us in that; they are prepared to go that far along the road.  But I would point out to Deputy Colley that even that &mdash;to use his own words&mdash;is a breach of the provisions of the 1967 Act which was going to operate for 20 years.</P>

That is why we are completely justified in the stand we are taking and why the Fianna Fáil argument has no foundation whatsoever. Let nobody be under any illusions, Fianna Fáil believe that the tax we propose to collect from existing mines should not be collected.  That means that we should let what, on a conservative estimate, is £125 million go out of the country altogether and the figure is more than likely to be £400 million or £500 million before the 20-year period is up.</P>

      <P>It would be appreciated if the Minister could do so.  If those figures were made available it would help a great many people.  I want to point out that the Minister claims that nobody acted on the inducement of the 1967 Act.  Is the Minister saying that from 1967 to now no exploration took place or no further development of existing mines was carried out? The Minister cannot be saying that, but why does he say nobody acted on the inducement?  Is the Minister not aware that millions of pounds were expended on exploration in that period?  Is he not aware that further development of existing mines resulted from this inducement and, as I pointed out earlier, that money was raised <Col N="2034" /> both by way of equity and loan capital based on this provision on which he is now welching?</P>
      <P>Within the mining sector alone, apart from the wider consequences of what he is doing here, I personally know of one case in which a company was about to expand more than £1 million on exploration over quite a short period and this was cancelled on hearing the Minister's announcement. The company may go ahead when this legislation has been passed or it may not do so.  I do not know. In that case the new work was cancelled immediately.  No confidence was inspired in that company when they saw the cancellation of a statutory exemption in relation to existing mines.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the attitude taken by this party when the Government made their announcement. He said that we had changed our tune and that we had originally opposed the Government's proposals entirely.  I defy him on that and I challenge the Minister to produce one iota of evidence for that statement.  I suggest that the Minister will find, if he bothers to look, that the statements made by us following the Government's announcement and ever since then have been absolutely consistent and that he and some of his colleagues have deliberately tried to misrepresent our position by suggesting precisely what he suggested tonight, but the fact is that we opposed taking away the exemption from existing mining companies.  We did not oppose the imposition of a new regime on new mines.  We made it clear that we ourselves had been engaged in this process when in Government and that this Government completed the process when they got the report of the inter-departmental committee on mining.  We did not set up that committee for fun.  We set it up because we wanted to change the position in regard to new mines.  I hope that this gross misstatement of our position will not be continued further, at least by the Minister for Finance, who should now know better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to this party's contacts in the mining industry.  I am <Col N="2035" /> not aware of any such contacts.  Any information that I have on this Bill or that has come from mining industries to me has come from people with whom I am not acquainted but because I am the spokesman for Finance in this party.  I personally have no contacts of the kind the Minister is talking about.  Since the Minister raised this matter I presume that he is aware that his own Government are not without close contacts with the mining industry.  I am not accusing them of anything in that regard; but, since the Minister seemed to be accusing us, let us get the facts right. The Minister knows very well that one of his colleagues at least has a very close family connection with one large mining company.  There is nothing wrong with that, but if the Minister wants to make innuendoes about this party let us get the facts right.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the cost of accepting the Fianna Fáil proposals and of continuing the exemption for the existing companies.  Did the Minister make any assessment of the cost to the economy of what he has done and what he is proposing to do?  Did he make any assessment of the cost to the economy of the industries, apart from mining, which we lost?  The Minister cannot make that assessment because he cannot assess, except in a very limited way, what he does not have.  I would venture to suggest that if one could estimate it the cost would be vastly greater than the figure the Minister is talking about.  I hope it will be noted that the Minister made no reference whatever to the point that I spelled out about the assurances given by various Ministers and by the Taoiseach and the offers of undertakings in writing not to cancel the existing exemption of tax on profits from industrial exports.  That happened only because of the serious reaction which was created by the Government's announcement in relation to mining.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not comment on that.  I do not blame him because the facts are incontrovertible.  The Minister comes in here and tosses estimates <Col N="2036" /> around in relation to the cost of this but he makes no reference at all to the possible cost of what the Government did, or to what they have been scrambling around trying to remedy ever since, or to the fact that the Taoiseach and Ministers have been trying to remedy the situation with their offers of written undertakings. The Minister himself tried to speak on this again in the Second Stage debate on this Bill.  What is the cost of that?  Is it not at least possible that many jobs which would have been created in this country will at the very least have been postponed as a direct consequence of what is being done in this Bill and of its announcement?</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to toss figures around about costs, he might at least advert to the possible cost involved in this gross mistake which was made by the Government in regard to this announcement.  I repeat, our attitude has been from the beginning, and continues to be, that we have no criticism of changing the tax regime for new mining companies. We were in the process of doing this ourselves.  What we object to is the welshing on the existing arrangements under which various companies engaged in exploration and raised money on the strength of that undertaking written into the legislation and supported on both sides of the House. We object to that on the basis of what this is doing to the companies concerned and of the inequity involved. But most of all we object because of the very serious potential consequences for our whole economy, for those who are unemployed and for whom it is our duty to provide employment as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Government approach in this matter has been totally misguided and that damage has been created which cannot be undone. In so far as one can undo the damage, the way to do it is by these amendments.  The Minister has made it clear that he does not propose to accept these amendments.  That being so, the consequences are his and his colleagues.  I trust that those consequences will not be such&mdash;we will all <Col N="2037" /> regret them&mdash;that members of the Government will have to go round again offering written undertakings in lieu of undertakings written into our legislation.  As I said, this was a misguided decision and is potentially very damaging.  We have done our best to highlight this and to get the Government to change their attitude, even at this late stage.  If the Government fail to do so the consequences lies on them and those who support them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to write this information into the record.  The Industrial Development Authority having seen the allegations of Deputy Colley and others relating to the effect of the Government's announcement on taxation of minerals, have certified to me on 13th May, 1974, that no company in discussion with the IDA either deferred or withdrew its proposals because of the mining proposals.  That information came from the IDA who would know and it effectively repudiates all the Fianna Fáil mischiefmaking in this and other areas.</P>
      <P>Again, for the information of the House, I want to put this on record. I would remind the House that by way of a news release on 11th April the IDA certified that for the year ended March, 1974, the total number of new jobs approved was 22,000 which was significantly higher than the estimated figure of 16,000 for the same period.  Their expectations for the coming year are even greater.  All of this shows that fact is a lot more comforting and reassuring than Fianna Fáil mischiefmaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all industries, the mining industry is the most worldwide.  It is the one about which the people involved know precisely what incentives and opportunities are available in any country on the globe.  The mining industry has little roots or attachments to particular areas.  It operates wherever it can make the best profit. The mining industry is, I suppose, at least free from the mischiefmaking of Fianna Fáil because it knows that the new tax situation, the new opportunities for making profits in Ireland out of the mining industry which will apply after this Bill is enacted, are <Col N="2038" /> exceedingly favourable and that, as a consequence, there are very great opportunities for people in mining here.  Therefore, Fianna Fáil are endeavouring to get the best of both worlds by suggesting to the people that they are not against the taxation of mines for the future, but they are against the taxation of existing mines. What they are saying is that it is wrong to do what we are doing when we know that by this measure we will collect anything up to £200, £300 or £400 million from existing mines. Fianna Fáil say we are wrong to do that.  I am sure the people will not approve of their stand in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have been informed of the agreement reached today among the parties in the Northern Ireland Executive on how the Sunningdale Agreement should be implemented.  They note that the Executive stands unitedly by the principles embodied in the Sunningdale Communiqué and that the agreement reached by it today involves the immediate establishment of the Council of Ministers of the Council of Ireland.  Today's agreement also assures the maintenance of the power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland which came into existence as a result of the settlement reached at Sunningdale.</P>
      <P>This power-sharing Executive is an indispensable element in progress towards peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and, indeed, in Ireland as a whole.  The maintenance and development of the Executive are especially vital to the interests of the minority in Northern Ireland, who through it have for the first time in the history of Northern Ireland secured full and fair representation in government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government would, of course, <Col N="2039" /> have preferred if it had been possible to reach agreement within the Executive to join in implementing all aspects of the Council of Ireland immediately. They understand, however, the reasons which make this impossible.  They believe that it is necessary to face the reality of the present extremely serious situation and accept the great need for a firm basis for peaceful progress.  Accordingly, the Government welcome the opportunity to cooperate in the Council of Ministers of the Council of Ireland on the basis proposed by the Executive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that I and members of my party are at a disadvantage in that today's developments as they were disclosed to us were very sketchy.  We did not have an opportunity to study the Taoiseach's statement and only had time to refer to a rather incomplete copy of the Northern Ireland Executive's statement.</P>
      <P>I cannot but express my party's keen disappointment at today's developments and, in particular, at what appears to be a watering down or at least a phasing of the implementation of the Sunningdale Agreement.  When the Sunningdale Agreement was presented to us in this House we were told it was presented as a complete package and was not open to negotiation. We expressed at that time, and, indeed, before the debate in the House, our reservations in relation to certain parts of the Sunningdale Communiqué.  One of these was in reference to our constitutional position, and that reservation was effectively removed by the statement of the Taoiseach in the House in the early part of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason otherwise for our acceptance of the Sunningdale Communiqué was the declared intention to implement that part of it which dealt with the setting up of a Council of Ireland.  It now appears that the Council of Ireland will not be set up fully in accordance with that communiqué, that now it is proposed to set it up by phases, and even then the implementation of the second <Col N="2040" /> phase is not certain.  In the meantime, the postponement of the implementation of the second phase will continue to exclude from any active participation in the political development of the Northern Ireland situation and the North of Ireland situation as it relates to the South, the biggest political party in the whole country, in that this statement which was agreed apparently by the Northern Ireland Executive proposes to postpone the setting up of the Assembly of the Council of Ireland.  In the meantime, it is proposed only to set up the Council of Ministers to undertake certain functions, most of which are already being effectively carried out in cooperation between the former Stormont Government, now the Northern Ireland Executive, and our Government. It would seem that the continuance of this process would not require all the paraphernalia of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I refer again to what we are told about the acceptance of the Council of the Sunningdale Communiqué as a package.  Now that seems to have been diluted and, in effect, the implementation of the Sunningdale Communiqué will depend on the electoral will of the smallest of the jurisdictions who are parties to the Sunningdale Agreement.  This seems to be a departure, as far as I can see it on a rather hasty study of the document, from the Sunningdale Communiqué as it was presented to us.  It is a departure, too, from what has constantly been the assertion and the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party that the Irish people as a whole have an inalienable right to decide their own political destiny.</P>
    <P>We recognise the need for the maintenance of the power-sharing Executive in the North of Ireland, and we are anxious to see it proceed.  We are told that the consent to the implementation of the second phase of Sunningdale will now depend on the result of an election in Northern Ireland which is due to take place in 1977-78. This would appear, at first sight, to imply at least that the British Government are not maintaining their powers under the Sunningdale Communiqué <Col N="2041" /> and giving them instead, as I said, to the electoral will of the people of a small part of our country. It certainly does not conform with our principles and our policy. We still, however, hope to see the Northern Ireland power-sharing Executive continue in being as the best immediate hope of maintaining peace and promoting the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This document which has been presented to us only a short time ago and which the Taoiseach has accepted on behalf of his Government, is by no means a statutory instrument.  I believe that the efforts towards peace and reconciliation, towards co-operation between both parts of our country, towards bringing all the people of Ireland together, should proceed in any event, and that it is our hope that the date set here, 1977-78, is not the only date which will operate in respect of the full implementation of Sunningdale, especially in relation to the setting up of the Council of Ireland. I would hope that it would be possible for the parties to Sunningdale to proceed even before 1977-78 to the full establishment of the Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have stated my reservations.  I have not had the opportunity of consulting my party, but in the interests of maintaining peace in the North of Ireland, in the interests of maintaining progress towards our ultimate aims and ideas in relation to the whole of Ireland, we should not comment further on this document, this suggested agreement of the Executive of the Council of Ireland.  We shall not oppose any steps that will be taken towards maintaining in existence the Executive itself and maintaining its powers as they now exist pending further developments.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Fianna Fáil Party, with reservations, subject to the fundamental principle I have already stated of the inalienable right of the Irish people to decide their own destiny, will not do anything that will in any way stay progress towards peace.</P>

      <P>I have investigated the allegation made earlier today by Deputy Desmond O'Malley in relation to the Money Resolution for the Food Standards Bill, 1974.  I find that the allegation is entirely without foundation. The Tánaiste was in the House and duly moved the motion, which was agreed to without debate in Committee on Finance, and then duly reported to the House and agreed by the House.</P>
      <P>The shorthand note of the reporter who was in the House at the time recorded the Minister for Health as moving the motion.  The typescript which the reporter made from her notes and gave to the Editor shortly afterwards again shows the Minister for Health as moving the Resolution. Again, the note of the proceedings which the Clerk of the Dáil is obliged to make under Standing Order 77 shows the Tánaiste as moving the Resolution.</P>
      <P>Finally, the reporter referred to, the Clerk Assistant of the Dáil, and myself, who were all present at the time, clearly recollect the Tánaiste being present and moving this Resolution.</P>

I am sure he is aware that the unemployment figures are considerably higher than they were in the corresponding period last year. That is the red herring the Minister is introducing.  The real point is that the Taoiseach and other Ministers got up, made speeches and undertook personally to give in writing guarantees that the exemption from income tax applying to industrial exports would not be withdrawn.  It is a simple question: why did they have to do that?  The Minister has refused to answer the question.  He can juggle around with figures or anything else but those facts speak for themselves. I submit they establish that the view this party took immediately the Government made their announcement, which they have consistently expressed since then and which we are expressing in the amendments, was the correct <Col N="2046" /> view, that the best interests of our economy, apart from any other questions, would have been served by not removing this exemption from existing mines.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 16, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>16.&mdash;(1)  Where a person who is carrying on the trade of working a qualifying mine is chargeable to income tax for the year 1974-75 and would, in accordance with the provisions of section 58 (1) of the Act of 1967, be charged to income tax under Case I of Schedule D on the full amount of the profits or gains of the year preceding that year, he may, by notice in writing given to the Inspector before the 1st day of August, 1974, elect to be charged to income tax for the year 1974-75 by reference to the amount of the profits or gains of that year.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a person elects, as provided for in subsection (1), he shall be charged to income tax for the year 1974-75 as if the full amount of the profits or gains of the year preceding the said year 1974-75 were an amount equivalent to the full amount of the profits or gains of the year 1974-75.</P>
      <P>As the House knows, the exemption in favour of companies mining scheduled minerals is being terminated as from 6th April, 1974, and those companies will, therefore, be subject to income tax for the year of assessment 1974-75.  The normal basis of assessment is the profits of the preceding year but mining companies have claimed that the use of the preceding year basis means that their 1973 profits will be subject to tax, that this is a retrospective taxation, that they will have to reopen 1973 accounts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I am finding it a little difficult to hear the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has been made that because the 1973-74 year is used as the basis of assessment for tax liability for 1974-75 there is some element of retrospection.  Of course there is no retrospection simply because the basis of the previous year is used.  The charge will be for 1974-75 and the preceding year's profits are merely used as a measure for the purpose of the 1974-75 charge.  The mining interests have, however, continued to press this point and Deputy Colley also raised this matter on Second Reading.  The amendment proposes to meet the point by giving the mining companies the option to be charged for 1974-75 by reference to the actual profits of that year instead of by reference to the profits of the preceding year.  Whichever option they exercise there is no question of retrospection.  We have given them, as we have done in the case of farmers, an option to choose actual profits or the preceding year's profits as the basis for 1974-75.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has accepted the point I <Col N="2049" /> made on Second Stage that the Bill as it stood required amendment something on the lines of this amendment because as far as I am concerned the Bill as it stands does involve an element of retrospection.  I would simply say at this stage that there is more to it than the income tax liability.  The question of corporation profits tax arises in this matter but before I pursue that I took it on Second Stage, and said so, that the Minister did not wish to introduce retrospective legislation, that is retrospective before the 5th April, 1974, and the moving of this amendment by him is a clear indication that he does not want to do so.  I am not entirely convinced that if that is his objective he has succeeded in achieving it with this amendment but it might help in pursuing this matter if the Minister could explain what is intended to be achieved by subsection (2) of the amendment.  Subsection (1) is reasonably clear but subsection (2) somewhat mystifies me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are doing here is simply emphasising that we are taking that year as the basis of the liability and that it will not be assumed that that was the actual profit position in the year in question. We are using an artificial basis.  There is no reason for giving the person the double benefit that could arise unless that particular subsection was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could get the matter a little clearer if I put to the Minister a possible way in which this would work out and he could tell me whether it is correct or not.  Under the amendment as drafted, in subsection (1) the person has to make his election before the 1st August next.  Let us assume the taxpayer elects under subsection (1).  Then under subsection (2), as I understand it, the basis on which he would be taxed would be the actual income for 1974-75 but presumably that cannot be ascertained until after April, 1975, and, indeed, in some cases depending on the date of the company's accounts it might go into 1976.  Is it the intention to operate on the basis of 1973-74 figures and then make an adjustment and if it is not <Col N="2050" /> intended to do that how is it intended to operate when the actual amount of profits or gains for 1974-75 may not be ascertainable until 1976?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we had better explain the whole background to this subsection because it is only by an understanding of the particular difficulty which is created by the new corporation tax that the need to have this particular structure set out in this way arises.  Subsection (2) provides that where an election is made the charge for 1974-75 is to be made as if the preceding year's profits were equal to those for 1974-75.  The reason for this approach is to ensure that while substituting the 1974-75 profits as the measure of the charge the preceding year's basis of assessment was being preserved.  This arises as a consequence of the move towards corporation tax. If we did not do this there would be quite an amount of tax lost as a consequence. There will be no additional revenue earned by the State by this but it ensures that there will be none lost either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather gathered subsection (2) meant something like what the Minister has said but I was not quite sure.  I do not think he will blame me when I say when one reads it it is not clear what it is saying.  There are a few points I want to raise on this.  When the Minister says that one is preserving the previous year's basis, I appreciate that but is the consequence of that that a liability for corporation profits tax will arise in relation to profits earned during 1973-74?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Deputy will appreciate that corporation profits arise after the income tax year but if we did not identify the appropriate starting point for the corporation tax then there would be tax lost.  We are providing that if a person goes to the 1974-75 period, the actual profits will not as a result of that be deemed to escape corporation tax for one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not pursue that point at the moment but it has been <Col N="2051" /> suggested to me, and perhaps to the Minister, that the objective which I believe the Minister has in mind could be achieved simply by providing that these companies will be liable to corporation tax, under the new arrangement, from the 6th April, 1974. Leaving aside the technical difficulties that that tax does not exist at the moment, if that is the Minister's only difficulty would it in fact achieve what he is trying to do if one could do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There would still be a year's tax loss.  In any event, it seems to me that the problem here is one which could best be dealt with when we are dealing with the corporation profits tax legislation.  We are dealing here with the liability of mining profits to income tax.  We are dealing with an income tax situation and the corporation tax situation will be dealt with separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but it is important to know, leaving aside the technical difficulties, whether, if one could do it, that a provision that these companies would be liable to corporation tax as defined in the White Paper, from the 6th April, 1974, would achieve what the Minister wants or whether that would, in the Minister's view, mean a loss of revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would.  We are concerned here with income tax.  This is an Income Tax Bill in relation to mining profits.  Therefore, if we were to give the concession which has been sought by the mining industry we would be losing income tax, as the law now stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If we ignore for the moment the question of whether it is income tax or corporation tax and think only in terms of revenue, if there were to be an enforcible provision in substitution for this amendment to the effect that these companies would be liable to corporation tax from the 6th April, 1974, would the revenue received be the same as what the Minister is trying to achieve under this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I suspect the Minister is really engaged in retrospective taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely no retrospection. As there is no retrospection neither will there be postponement. The Bill proposes to impose the tax liability as from April, 1974.  That is what we are very neatly doing, no more, no less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that this amendment came rather late and I have not had a chance to look into the very technical aspect involved.  I would like to do so because I suspect we are not <i>ad idem.</i> The date of election is to be not later than the 1st August next.  I assume the reason for giving the right of election to the taxpayer is that he can assess for himself, which is the most advantageous method.  Of course, he cannot assess this before the 1st August next because he could not possibly know what the returns will be for 1974-75.  Therefore, it would seem that the date of election provided in the amendment is much too early.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with whether or not the taxpayer should have the right to avoid his profits of last year being looked at for the purpose of deciding this year's liability.  He will know last year's profits before the 1st August.  That is the matter on which he must make his election.  If he decides to eliminate that and go on this year's, well and good.  He has the knowledge in relation to last year's profits to make that choice.  It is not proposed, nor would it be reasonable, to propose that he should wait until the end of the year 1974-75 before he makes the choice. He wants to eliminate and he looks back to the past.  He can do that before August this year.  He will have <Col N="2053" /> all the information ready for that at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not much of a right of election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  After all, this is a concession which he is being given which is not being given to other people who will pay on the basis of their previous year's profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I understand that the Minister undertook, and intends, not to charge tax on profits earned prior to the current financial year.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The liability will only arise from the comencement of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister is purporting to give a right of election to people where their choice is between a blind shot, not knowing what the figures are for 1974-75, or alternatively, last year's figures, which effectively is charging tax on last year's profits.  My understanding was that the Minister's intention was not to charge tax on profits prior to this financial year.  I think the area of misunderstanding boils down to whether he did not intend to charge tax on profits earned prior to 5th April of this year or whether he did not intend a tax liability to arise prior to 5th April of this year.  There would seem to be a year's difference involved in this.  My understanding is that the mining companies who met the Minister were under the impression that he did not intend the tax to be charged on any profits arising prior to the 5th of April of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Colley will concede that we are meeting the point which has been made. These people sought to have the right to be adjudicated on the profits for the year 1974-75.  They asked us not to assess them on the basis of 1973-74. We said: &ldquo;OK, we will give you a choice.  You make up your mind and you can choose what way you want to do it.&rdquo; I do not think that is unreasonable. It is a concession that is not given to the general body of taxpayers. <Col N="2054" /> We are giving it also to farmers who are becoming subject to income tax liability this year.  It can be argued fairly for both that they are coming within a tax liability which previously did not exist and, therefore, it is reasonable that they should be given some transitional arrangement which they can operate to their own advantage.  If a person wants to get this benefit it is not unreasonable that he should exercise his option before next August because once the option is exercised the inspector of taxes has to get around to assessing what the liability may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that he conveyed to the mining interests that no tax would arise or be payable prior to this financial year or, alternatively, does he think he conveyed to them that no tax will be payable on profits earned prior to this financial year?  I understand the latter is what they think he conveyed to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain I made it clear that we would make mining profits subject to tax as from April, 1974.  What arrangements or understandings may have been understood at that conference by the financial advisers to the mining industry I do not know.  In any case, a choice has been given and they can exercise it if they wish to do so.  I do not think that is in any way unreasonable. They asked for it and we are giving it to them.</P>
