    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £157,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the period beginning the 1st April, 1974 and ending the 31st day of December, 1974, for <Col N="2236" /> the Salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal briefly with the Estimate for my Department and, in accordance with the normal practice, to review national progress and the Government's policies and actions, particularly in so far as the greatest single domestic problem now facing us is concerned.  I refer, of course, to the problem of inflation.  I also intend to say something about our policies and attitudes in relation to certain aspects of international affairs.  Other Ministers will speak in the debate and deal in greater detail with the matters which come within the ambit of their own Departments.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go in any detail into the Northern Ireland situation. We had a debate on developments affecting the North less than one month ago and, as I indicated in reply to a recent Parliamentary Question, the lines of policy enunciated by myself and other Government speakers in that debate remain valid.  It is clear that a peaceful settlement based on justice can only be reached with the agreement of all sections of the Northern community. It is clear to all that the Irish dimension exists, as a fact.  So far as we are concerned, the lines of policy are clear.  We will seek by all means in our power to achieve peace and reconciliation between the communities in the North.  We will help so far as we can in the achievement of power sharing there.  And with the evidence so clearly before us of the pain and destruction caused by violence in the North, we will adhere to the policy of helping to contain it, so far as we in this part of the country can, and of seeking progress by discussion and consent.</P>
    <P>In common with Estimates generally, the Estimate for my Department is based on the nine-month period 1st April, 1974 to 31st December, 1974. On a 12-month basis, there would be an increase of approximately £10,000. This is accounted for by increased expenditure on salaries, wages and allowances, attributable to increases in staff numbers, which more than offset a decrease under the subhead for information and public relations services, <Col N="2237" /> due to the termination of the Markpress account.</P>
    <P>The OECD Economic Survey of Ireland, published in March this year, stated that &ldquo;1973 was, in most respects, a particularly successful year for Irish economic management&rdquo;. This success showed itself in many ways&mdash;in the growth rate of the economy generally which at 7 per cent was a near record; in the significant increase in living standards brought about by this expansion; in the quickening of interest in our country as a site for new industrial development; in the increase of over 6,000 in industrial employment; in the evidence of net immigration; in the prosperity of our agriculture; in the greatest distribution of all time to social welfare beneficiaries; in the achievement of the highest level of house-building ever recorded; in substantially increased public spending on education, health and other services; and in the completion, not only without serious mishap, but, I would venture to say, with a fair measure of success, of our first full year of membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in this House last December on a supplementary vote for my Department, I mentioned the hope that the situation caused by the oil crisis would not become so serious that jobs would be threatened, the expansion of the economy halted and, indeed, our standard of living reduced. I expressed this hope as signs of these developments were emerging in many western countries in the wake of an unprecedented boom.  The onset of the energy crisis turned the prospect of an economic slowdown into grim reality.  Even though the initial impact of the crisis, in terms of actual and threatened shortages of oil has now been spent, the increases in oil prices are still working their way through international and domestic economies.</P>
    <P>The increases have accentuated the pressures on prices being exerted by domestic inflationary influences in many countries and by the abnormal rises in other raw material prices.  The latest OECD figures show that, in the most recent 12 month period for which they have information, the percentage <Col N="2238" /> rise in prices was in double figures in 17 out of the 24 member countries of the organisation.  This experience is expected to be repeated again this year in all member-countries of the EEC, except Germany.</P>
    <P>The impact of the increased cost of oil imports on countries' balance of payments has been dramatic.  The OECD estimates that the aggregate deterioration in the current payments of oil-importing countries in 1974 will be of the order of $50,000 million&mdash; equivalent to between seven and eight times the total Gross National Product of this country.  Most of the increased receipts will accrue to Arab countries. A number of the major beneficiaries have small populations and the economies of all of them have a limited capacity in the short term to absorb imports or indeed economic development. For some time to come, at least, the increase in their purchases will go nowhere near matching the transfer of purchasing power from other countries. Unless, therefore, their increased receipts can be recycled, back to the oil-importing countries, on terms which these countries can bear, the shadow of deflation hangs over the world economy for the present and the near future, at least.</P>
    <P>The efforts so far made to arrange such recycling through international organisations have been attended with only moderate success.  Recycling through international capital markets has been fairly successful to date. However, some doubts have been expressed about the ability of the Euromarkets to bear the burden on them involved in such a massive recycling operation and indeed there have been some signs of strain in these markets in recent months.</P>
    <P>The appropriate response to oil-related increases in external deficits has been the subject of considerable debate in all the countries affected and in the international organisations concerned.  It seemed to be generally agreed that there was nothing to be gained and much to be lost by efforts on the part of the industrialised countries to offset consequential increases in their deficit by short-term deflationary action or other traditional <Col N="2239" /> adjustment measures.  The main result would simply be to redistribute the total deficit among them with the likelihood of a rash of competitive and mutually impoverishing actions.  It was argued that there was little need for action to squeeze home economies so as to make room for increased exports to the oil exporters as it would only be gradually and over a period of years and decades that they would demand increased exports from the industrialised countries in payment for their oil.</P>
    <P>However, some countries have introduced measures designed to curb demand and to improve their balance of payments.  In doing so, they were doubtless influenced by the threat posed by double-figure inflation.  In some cases, there was also a need to reverse a widening of what I might term the &ldquo;non-oil deficit&rdquo;.  A further factor may have been recognition of the undeniable fact that over the longer-term, fundamental adjustments are needed in oil-importing economies in response to the increase in the price of this vital fuel and a feeling that the present was a good time to initiate these changes.  No substantial consumer of oil can go on blithely as before, ignoring the effect on his domestic prices and balance of payments position of perhaps a threefold increase in price.</P>
    <P>Whatever the varying reasons for the restrictions, they have led to some concern that an international downturn could be precipitated by a general extension of such measures.</P>
    <P>An opposing view is that the greater danger is that of accentuating inflation running in most western countries at a rate, which if continued, will destroy belief in money as a medium of exchange, as we know it.  In this view, any resort to widespread reflation could only increase the danger of runaway inflation.  Faced with these starkly contrasting options most industrialised countries have accepted that growth expectations for this year are necessarily much lower than would have been possible before the increase in oil prices.  Indeed, it is forecast that in Britain the growth <Col N="2240" /> rate will be negative, that there will be little, if any, growth in Italy and that German growth will be only 2½ per cent.  Simultaneously, the growth of international trade, affected by curbs on demand and monetary uncertainties, is not expected to exceed 4½ per cent, compared with an estimated growth of 13 per cent last year.</P>
    <P>For 1975, most official comment in forums such as the EEC and OECD suggests that economic growth in the main member countries will be somewhat better than in 1974.  This view is dependent to a large extent on an upturn in the US and German economies as the authorities there pursue more expansionary policies. While this may not happen, the probability is that most industrialised countries will recognise the interdependency of their economies and accept the need to pursue policies that will ensure a continuation of growth.</P>
    <P>I have gone in some detail into this rather sombre international background because as every Deputy knows, our economy, perhaps more than most in Western Europe, is influenced by what happens outside it. Exports and imports together form an unusually high proportion of our total Gross National Product.  We cannot, even if we wished to do so, ignore what is happening elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In common with most oil-importing countries, we have experienced a sharp deterioration in our balance of trade in the first six months of this year.  Total imports have risen by £263 million or 48 per cent compared with the same period last year.  The increase in exports was £125 million or 32 per cent.  The trade gap, therefore, widened by £138 million.</P>
    <P>The most important single factor responsible for this has been the increased cost of our oil imports, the value of which rose by £55 million in the first half of the year, despite the fact that there is likely to have been some decline in volume.  There were also indirect effects on the prices of other imports arising from the oil price increase.</P>
    <P>The figures also reflect the increases <Col N="2241" /> in the prices of a wide range of other basic commodities which reached a new peak in the first quarter of the year.  These latter two factors are reflected in the increase of £147 million in the value of imports for further production. Overall, a rapid acceleration in the rate of increase in import prices has undoubtedly been a major influence in the huge rise in the value of imports. However, it is not possible to quantify the degree of this influence as import price indices are only available up to September, 1973, due to unavoidable delays involved in the changeover from the former official import and export lists to a new, integrated tariff/statistical list as the basis for compilation of all external trade statistics.  The new list contains over 11,000 headings compared with about 1,200 import and 700 export headings in the former lists. Difficulties in the changeover to metrication have also caused delay.</P>
    <P>Our exporters have faced considerable difficulties in the past nine months. First, there were demand restrictions in many countries.  Depressed cattle prices have led to relatively slow growth in the value of agricultural exports.  Exporters of industrial goods had to contend with the disruption of oil supplies, massive increases in price when supplies again began to flow and the scarcity of many raw materials exacerbated by the three-day working week in Britain.  Despite these unfavourable conditions, industrial exports in the first half of the year are estimated to have increased by 42 per cent in value.  Even when allowance is made for substantial increases in prices this represents an appreciable growth in the volume of these exports and great credit is due to exporters for this remarkable performance in most difficult conditions.  Part of the credit is also due to the decision of the Government to set up a raw materials supply information service.  Operated jointly by Córas Tráchtála and the Industrial Development Authority, the service has assisted firms seeking alternative sources of supply for a wide variety of materials.</P>
    <P>Despite difficulties, may of them due to the situation in Northern Ireland&mdash;without which it has been <Col N="2242" /> estimated our earnings from tourism would be approximately twice what they are now&mdash;tourism earnings this year are also likely to show an increase. According to Bord Fáilte, tourist numbers so far this year were more than 5 per cent higher than last year.</P>
    <P>Despite the increase in the trade deficit, the external reserves have remained at a high level.  At the end of June they stood at £398 million, marginally lower than a year earlier. This indicates a sizeable capital inflow in recent months.  It is worth nothing, however, that much of this inflow is now due to borrowing abroad by the Government and semi-State bodies to sustain their investment programmes. Overall, within the economy the level of investment in fixed assets is estimated to have risen last year by 13 per cent, and its ratio to GNP, at 23¾ per cent, reached its highest level ever.  I need hardly stress the importance of these figures.  Without investment in new buildings, plant and methods the country cannot prosper&mdash;nor indeed maintain even its present standards in the highly competitive world in which we live.</P>
    <P>Consumer demand was exceptionally buoyant last year.  The volume of expenditure went up by more than 6 per cent and the number of new cars registered was more than 18 per cent higher than in 1972.  The energy crisis, however, dashed any hope of a continuation of this momentum, certainly so far as the early months of this year were concerned.  The volume of retail sales in the first four months of the year, the latest available figures, was less than 1 per cent greater than in the corresponding period last year. The principal factor tending to depress sales was the poor demand for cars.</P>
    <P>Some indication that the outlook for consumer demand is brightening is given by the 2 per cent rise in the volume of total retail sales in April. Current indicators of investment are few.  I would draw attention, however, to the encouraging 35 per cent increase in imports of capital goods in the first quarter of the year and to the fact that the majority of respondents <Col N="2243" /> to the most recent quarterly survey of business intentions expected their investment to be higher in the coming year than in the previous year. The results indicated some decline in the buoyancy of intentions as compared with previous surveys.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking so far about trends in investment and consumption as categories of demand on the resources of the economy.  Hard statistics in output and employment trends are not quite so up-to-date.  The preliminary figures for the first quarter of the year suggest that the output of manufacturing industry was over 8 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1973.  This is a most praiseworthy achievement in the unfavourable circumstances of the early part of the year.</P>
    <P>The provisional results also indicate that the acceleration in the growth of industrial employment which continued throughout 1973 may have been halted in the first quarter of the present year.  Employment in manufacturing and mining was over 7,000 or about 3½ per cent higher in March this year than in March 1973.  These figures may reflect a time-lag before trends in production are manifested in changes in employment.  Indeed, the most recent statistics of unemployment show an increase of almost 3,000 between the first weeks of July, 1973 and July, 1974.  This was probably a reflection of the decelerating trend in the rate of growth in industrial employment.  It is possible that continuing net immigration may also have been a contributory factor.</P>
    <P>I will have more to say on industry and on agriculture later, but first I want to refer to the prospects for the economy as a whole this year and to the fiscal and monetary policies being applied in its management.  When the Budget was being framed in the early part of the year, we were faced with a marked slowdown in growth.  The best assessment that could be made was that without greater stimulus on current account than was given by the financial outcome for 1973-74, growth would be of the order of 3¾ per cent. As this rate seemed unlikely to sustain <Col N="2244" /> any increase in employment, the Government decided to give the economy a further shot in the arm by introducing a deficit budget.  We had been exhorted to adopt an expansionary policy by various national and international organisations.  Apart from this general theme, we were also advised against taxing commodities like beer, spirits and tobacco on the grounds that they would drive up the cost of living and in this way further increase the pressure for inflationary wage and salary claims.  The budgetary measures were expected to add 1 per cent to the pre-budget forecast, thus raising the growth rate close to the average potential growth rate over the medium-term and maintaining the momentum towards increased employment.</P>
    <P>However, as a result of a number of adverse factors whose effects can now be gauged more clearly, including the disimprovement in the external environment and the effects of industrial disputes, it now looks as if the growth rate aimed at will not be achieved.  While the pace of economic activity is expected to continue fairly strongly throughout the remainder of the year, as domestic consumption and investment benefit from the stimuins given in the Budget, it is now estimated that the growth rate for the year will be of the order of 4 per cent.  A comparison with the forecasts for other countries to which I referred earlier will show that the revised growth expectation for the Irish economy gives grounds for satisfaction.</P>
    <P>Monetary policy for the remainder of this year, as set out in a statement issued by the Central Bank on the 21st of June, has been framed to support the Government's desire for growth, while helping to contain inflation and the balance of payments deficit. Towards the end of the first quarter bank lending resumed the rapid growth which occurred in the second half of 1973.  The rise in non-Government lending was at an annual rate of 40 per cent and was clearly excessive.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank have now directed that all additions to credit should be reserved for the purposes most productive in terms of increasing output <Col N="2245" /> and employment and have requested banks to permit no net increase in lending in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The results attained by the Industrial Development Authority recently in the field of job creation indicate the benefits to be reaped if only we can maintain our attractiveness to promoters of new industrial projects.  The last year was the most successful to date.  Actual job creation in grant-aided projects in 1973 was 10,700.  Even more significant was the fact that projects approved for grant by the authority during the year ended March, 1974, have a total employment potential of 22,000 which is over 50 per cent higher than the level in the previous year and also significantly higher than the target of 16,000 which the authority had set for the year.  The planned investment in the projects approved reached £280 million compared with £135 million in 1972-73. This deflects the high capital-intensity of a number of projects.  The promoters include companies of wide international repute such as Gillette, Syntex, Wellworthy, Black and Decker, Alcan, Courtaulds, Berck, Hollister Asahi.</P>
    <P>The capital investment planned by Irish industries also increased substantially, especially in the food processing sector where the IDA approved grants of £9 million towards fixed investment of some £30 million.  IDA capital expenditure in the year to March, 1974, was almost £25 million. Among the principle factors contributing to this encouraging performance were the resurgance of interest in Ireland by British firms, the greater number of proposals resulting from the increased tempo of the IDA's marketing programme in previous years.  Ireland's accession to the European Economic Community, as well as, of course, the general boom conditions which prevailed last year.</P>
    <P>The IDA will be endeavouring to maintain last year's level of job creation throughout the remainder of 1974 and the authority have set a target of 16,500 potential jobs from approved projects for the nine months April to December, 1974.  Present indications are that the high level of <Col N="2246" /> job creation is being maintained and that there are good prospects of achieving the target.  I recognise fully the contribution to this record of success made by the staff of the IDA and all others involved in industrial promotion whose efforts, indeed, I warmly commend.  I think it is fair to say that the increased interest shown by investors and entrepreneurs is a clear demonstration of international confidence in the soundness and potential of our economy and in its handling by the Government.</P>
    <P>Indeed the pace of industrial development is creating other problems. The number, size and type of project require that careful assessments and judgments be made of the likely impact on the environment. Control powers are being strengthened by the amendment of the 1963 Planning Act and new legislation is in preparation to deal with water pollution.  The tempo of industrial development must also be co-ordinated with the provision of the necessary infrastructure, particularly water and sewerage, for which a substantially expanded programme is now operating. Schemes to a total value of £31.7 million were approved up to the 1st April last and a further £6.4 million has since been approved.</P>
    <P>A noteworthy feature of industry and services in this country is the multiplicity of trade unions.  This has created problems in many ways.  Where there are too many unions in a firm this complicates negotiations.  There is also the likelihood that where so many individual unions cater for workers the service available to the ordinary member will not be up to the standard which he requires in today's conditions.  We have in Ireland up to a half-a-million workers organised in 100 trade unions whereas in, for example, West Germany 6½ million workers are organised in 16 industrial unions.  We have, therefore, introduced the Trade Union (Amalgamations) Bill, 1974, to facilitate rationalisation. I should make it clear there is no compulsion involved in the Bill, but it is our hope that it will facilitate further cohesion of the trade union movement, and its <Col N="2247" /> development in the way best suited to Irish conditions and the prosperity of the Irish people, as a whole.</P>
    <P>In a situation where the incentives offered by many countries to attract foreign capital are extremely competitive, one of our greatest advantages is our labour force.  Training in itself is important in that it enables individuals to realise their full potential, something which has been denied many Irish people because of lack of opportunity in the past.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of industrial training, the Government intend expanding our training capacity in our direct training centres fourfold by 1978.  Centres are already in operation all over the country and it is intended to increase their number still further.</P>
    <P>As a contributor to the national income, employment and the balance of payments the agricultural industry remains of vital importance in the economic life of the nation.  In the past two years there have been remarkable increases in both agricultural output and income.  Last year the value of output rose by over £140 million or 30 per cent on top of a rise of 24 per cent in 1972.  Farm income rose by 32 per cent to £364 million on top of a rise of 38 per cent in 1972. While these income increases were much greater than those secured by other sections of the community, it must not be forgotten that in the past farm income lagged behind and farmers had considerable leeway to make up.  One very welcome feature of the improvement in farmers' income is the fact that farmers are now able to secure the bulk of their income directly from the market so that the burden on the Exchequer is greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>One of the most important tasks of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has been the negotiation in the EEC Council of agricultural prices which are fixed in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy. For 1974-75 the Commission's original price proposals provided for an overall increase in farm prices of just over 7 per cent but after hard bargaining <Col N="2248" /> an improved price agreement was negotiated which represented an overall price increase of around 9 per cent.  Due to a variety of reasons&mdash;not least, consumer resistance to higher retail prices&mdash;market returns for cattle have been far from satisfactory. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has been working to improve this situation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that important remedial decisions were taken at the meeting of the Council of Agricultural Ministers on 15th-16th July.  I would refer, in particular, to the ban until 1st November on imports from all sources of all cattle, beef and veal, with the exception of certain quotas to which the Community is committed under GATT.  Another important measure designed to promote more orderly marketing and consequently improved returns to farmers was the authorisation to member States to grant premiums to farmers who hold on to adult cattle, excluding cows, for varying periods: the details of this scheme will be worked out in the coming weeks.  Measures like these should renew the confidence of farmers in the common agricultural policy which the Government are determined, will be maintained and developed in order to ensure increased incomes for our farmers with all the resulting benefits to the economy.</P>
    <P>The EEC measures mentioned will be supplemented by the new loan scheme announced by the Agricultural Credit Corporation on 12th of this month which is designed to aid farmers who want to hold on to their store and young cattle during the present period of poor prices for these categories of cattle.  Loans are expected to be for up to £2,000 and no security is required.</P>
    <P>Conditions in the dairying industry are satisfactory.  Although weather conditions so far this year have been somewhat unfavourable for milk production it is expected that total deliveries to creameries will approximate to last year's level which was 35 million gallons up on the previous year.  Average milk prices for the year should be about 12½ per cent above the 1973 level.  The effects of the prices <Col N="2249" /> for store and fat cattle have, however, had their effect on calf prices.  Cattle numbers, particularly the breeding herds, are continuing to rise.  The December, 1973, returns showed total cattle numbers up by 548,000 head and breeding stocks up by 172,000 head.</P>
    <P>Farmers, of course, in common with others, have had to meet increases in their costs of production.  This has been particularly the case with feed, fertilisers and fuel.  Efficiency in the use of inputs is now more important than ever.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress is being made in the implementation of measures for the structural reform of agriculture. The farm modernisation scheme introduced earlier this year provides realistic levels of assistance towards investment on Irish farms.  The scheme introduced earlier this year provides realistic levels of assistance towards investment on Irish farms. The scheme is a comprehensive one and involves all our farmers, large and small.  The aids are provided so that our farmers have every incentive to undertake the degree of investment needed to expand our agricultural industry for only in this way can we exploit the opportunities and meet the competition facing the industry in EEC conditions.</P>
    <P>In addition, of course, to the new scheme to which I referred a few moments ago, the Agricultural Credit Corporation make loans for a wide range of agricultural investments.  The high level of resources available to the corporation&mdash;some £34 million for the nine-months' financial year, an increase of 17 per cent on the amount disbursed in the same period last year&mdash;should ensure that farmers should be able to fill their present requirements.</P>
    <P>A major social measure introduced this year by the Minister for Lands is the new voluntary retirement scheme for farmers.  The object of this scheme is to enable the smaller farmer, who so wishes, to retire with dignity and reasonable financial security while he can still pursue an active life.</P>
    <P>Progress is also being made in the <Col N="2250" /> formulation of two other structural reform measures.  The first is the scheme of assistance for the hill and disadvantaged areas.  This will supplement the income of farmers in the poorer areas and encourage them to remain in farming thus helping to maintain population numbers and to protect the environment.  The second measures will apply the socio-economic directive of the EEC in order to provide the farming population with information and guidance as to the choices and opportunities open to them for the purpose of extending the facilities available for training in the skills required for modern farming.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of agriculture I should like to say a few more words in connection with certain aspects of the common agricultural policy.  First of all, may I say that some of the criticisms made in this country about the Community's agricultural system relate to matters that were settled even before Ireland joined.  We had to accept the position as it was, and seek modifications as part of the on-going work of the Community.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to think that we can pick and choose in regard to the Community's agricultural arrangements. They seem to be under the impression that we can accept or adopt only those parts of the Community system which benefit us and those parts which involve some disadvantage or inconvenience for us, or impose some burden on us, can be ignored or readily altered.  Some of the other member states do not like certain parts of the Community agricultural system which we regard as most attractive, and indeed of vital importance.  But no member state can have the agricultural system precisely as it would wish.  Of course, there is a tendency for member states to try to bend Community rules in one way or another.  However, in view of our particular dependence on agriculture and our position as one of the smaller member states, it is in our overall long-term interests that the Community system should operate as uniformly as possible over the entire Community.  All member states have <Col N="2251" /> to take the rough with the smooth, and it is quite definite that so far the advantages and benefits for Irish agriculture have greatly outweighed the very limited disadvantages.</P>
    <P>What I have said about the application and operation of the Community agricultural system does not, of course, mean that we should not seek adjustments or modifications to meet our circumstances.  Indeed, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has been most active in seeking, and securing, special arrangements to solve particular problems which we have had or to meet difficulties which arose.  Thus, in order to offset a temporary subsidy on pigs slaughtered in the UK, Ireland is currently receiving a special FEOGA subsidy on pigs slaughtered here.  Similarly, during the three months, August to October, Ireland alone will be receiving FEOGA funds to meet the cost of a cattle slaughter premium.  This again will not apply in any other member state.  The Minister has also secured a special arrangement whereby Irish cattle slaughtered in the UK will qualify for the same slaughter premiums as will be paid on similar UK home-bred cattle.</P>
    <P>These examples of special arrangements secured by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries are of major importance to the livestock sector. The pig subsidy has been of the greatest assistance to our pig producers during the current market difficulties, and the FEOGA aid for cattle slaughtered here and the application of the UK premium to Irish cattle slaughtered in the UK will contribute significantly towards strengthening cattle prices and helping our producers to overcome the critical beef market situation that exists at present not merely throughout the Community but in world markets generally.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to some of the effects of the increase in oil prices in the past year.  The crisis of last winter underlined how dependent on imported oil our own and other European economies were.  The Government have given a lot of attention <Col N="2252" /> to energy policy in recent months and, although it is difficult to determine the final shape of policy until the position in relation to possible oil and gas reserves in our continental shelf becomes clearer, a considerable amount of progress has been made.</P>
    <P>I should like to advert for a moment to the common agricultural policy to say that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has been pursuing the question of a formal proposal relating to the &ldquo;Green £&rdquo; made to the Commission, to the Council of Ministers, and urging the Council to approve it.  He is pursuing this matter actively both in the Council of Ministers and outside it.  It was specially discussed at the Council meeting last week.  It is now being considered by the Commission and will come before the Council of Ministers again in September.</P>
    <P>In connection with the oil supply situation, both the supplies of crude oil and petroleum products are at present satisfactory and all restrictions on the distribution of oil have been removed. The supply situation is kept, however, under close surveillance, by the Department of Transport and Power and, as a safeguard against further shortages, fully up-to-date plans have been drawn up for oil allocation and petrol rationing based on the experience of the last period of restricted supplies.</P>
    <P>Steps are also being taken to increase this country's strategic oil reserves.  Discussions have been going on with representatives of the oil companies over recent months to ensure compliance with the 65 days reserve requirement of the EEC.  This requirement as Deputies are aware will be raised to 90 days as from 1st January, 1975.  The provision of the necessary storage facilities will involve substantial capital expenditure by the industry.  We are also playing our full part in the discussions which are taking place on energy matters in various international organisations including the EEC, OECD and the Energy Co-ordinating Group set up following the Washington Energy Conference last February.  The co-ordinating Group has made good progress in formulating a programme for allocating oil among participating <Col N="2253" /> countries in the event of an emergency. We are naturally interested in this matter as any disruption in oil supplies would have very serious implications for the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The most obvious response to the difficulties recently experienced in both the supply and cost of energy is to economise in its use.  There are a number of schemes under which grants are given towards expenditure to increase fuel efficiency.  These are operated by the Departments of Transport and Power and Local Government and by the Industrial Development Authority. The question of establishing some central unit to co-ordinate and develop conservation schemes and practices in all sectors of the economy is under examination.</P>
    <P>The recent substantial increases in the price of oil have made turf more competitive as an energy source and have made it feasible to develop bog areas which had earlier been regarded as uneconomic in face of low cost imported fuels.  Bord na Móna are preparing a third turf development programme with the aim of bringing these bogs into production.  Details of the programme have not yet been completed but it is hoped to increase substantially the production of milled peat for the generation of electricity.  It must be emphasised that the financing of this scheme will cost a lot and will, of course, require detailed examination at Government level.  In addition to increasing the level of assured supplies of energy sources and reducing our balance of payments problems, the scheme should provide a substantial increase in employment.  While any further development of traditional power sources is to be welcomed, we will have to look largely to new sources for future growth.  Significant discoveries of hydrocarbons in our off-shore seas could transform our situation. So far, only a relatively small find of natural gas about 29 miles south-east of Kinsale has been confirmed.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the gas will be piped ashore adjacent to Cork city and this will in itself attract a certain amount of industrial and constructional activity in the area.  The deposit <Col N="2254" /> should, when fully developed, be capable of giving a daily flow rate of 125 million cubic feet of natural gas for a period of about 20 years.  Of this Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta are being allocated 52 million cubic feet a day and the Electricity Supply Board will initially be using 13 million cubic feet a day at a 75 megawatt gas fired plant at Marina.  In subsequent years up to 1982 ESB usage will rise to about 89 million cubic feet a day; a number of gas-fired plants will be provided at Whitegate which with the addition of steam turbines using the waste heat will generate approximately 500 megawatts.</P>
    <P>Some people may object that the use of the natural gas for the generation of electricity is not the most efficient use of high grade fuel.  However, we must base our power generation on domestic fuel sources as far as we can.  Moreover, the combination of gas-fired gas turbines with the subsequent addition of steam turbines using the waste heat will ensure that the gas is used with the greatest possible efficiency.  The gas is suitable for the manufacture of ammonia.  Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta are setting up an ammonia plant at Cork which will meet the potential demand for ammonia of the nitrogenous fertiliser industry in the next decade.</P>
    <P>The recent news of an oil &ldquo;show&rdquo; increases our hopes that substantial deposits may be found on our Continental Shelf.  However, we all know the danger of counting chickens before they are hatched.  The Government are anxious that drilling in the areas of our Shelf not covered by the exclusive exploration licence held by Marathon Petroleum should be started soon.  Consideration of the financial and other terms for the issue of further exclusive licences is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>In November last, the Government approved, in principle, an ESB proposal to construct a nuclear power station for the generation of electricity. Preparations are being made by the Board to give effect to the Government decision.  It is anticipated that planning of the project will be sufficiently advanced by the end of 1975 <Col N="2255" /> to enable a final decision to be taken at that stage.  Selection of the site is primarily a matter for the Electricity Supply Board.  The Nuclear Energy Board which was recently established has the responsibility of advising the Minister for Transport and Power and the Government on all aspects of proposals for the construction of nuclear power stations.  The Electricity Supply Board have expressed their preference for a site at Carnsore, Co. Wexford but a final decision as to the choice of site must await further investigation and the advice of the Nuclear Energy Board.  Through our membership of the specialised committee of Euratom and the International Atomic Energy Agency we are keeping in close touch with all developments in the nuclear field.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the Government's commitment to social reform which is being implemented by direct improvements in social security and health schemes, by reforms in the taxation system and by changes in the law governing working conditions and the rights of the disadvantaged in our society.  Full implementation of this programme will transform the quality of life in Ireland and ensure social justice for all our people.</P>
    <P>Everyone who cares to examine the record of social legislation enacted and introduced and the many non-legislative steps taken by the Government will see that we have already made major advances on the road to those objectives and redeemed most of the specific pledges we gave.</P>
    <P>In money terms the yearly rate of spending on social welfare has increased from £167 million, based on the 1972 budget provisions to £295 million, based on the Budget this year&mdash;an increase of 77 per cent.  These figures do not include the cost of the changes in the taxation system which have also, in themselves, contributed notably to the benefit of the recipients of social welfare.  They cover only social welfare payments proper and, large as they are, they do not take into account the increases which have taken place in other cognate areas such as health and housing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2256" /> Translated into benefits for the individual, the changes made in the 1973 budget provided for what were then the highest ever increases in social security payments.  Weekly benefits, pensions allowances were raised by £1.00 in the personal rates and by at least 50p in respect of every qualified dependant. The monthly allowances under the children's allowances scheme were increased by £1.50 for each child.  This year's budget maintained the pattern established in 1973.  The improvements provided for in these two budgets resulted, for example, in a married man with three children receiving an increase from £13.00 to £19 a week in unemployment or disability benefit&mdash; that is an extra £6.00 a week or an increase of 46 per cent.  In the case of an elderly married couple receiving contributory old age pension the increase meant an extra £4.65, or 45 per cent, a week.  The percentage rise in the monthly children's allowances was greater still.  For example, one-child families received an increase of 360 per cent, two-child families received an increase of 180 per cent and three-child families received an increase of 127 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition to increase in benefit rates, many more people have been made eligible for social insurance and assistance payments by other improvements and extensions in existing schemes and by the introduction of new schemes.  The qualifying age for old age pension and for free travel, free electricity and free television licences has been reduced from 70 to 68 years&mdash;the first reduction since old age pensions were introduced&mdash;increasing the number of old age pensioners by about 25,000.  A further 12,000 persons have become eligible for pensions as a result of the substantial relaxation of the means test. Provision has also been made for the payment of an extra £3.65 a week to a non-contributory old age pensioner whose wife, or invalid husband, was not receiving any personal payment. The age limit for receipt of children's allowances has been increased from 16 years to 18 years in the case of children who are continuing in full-time education, are apprenticed or are <Col N="2257" /> incapacitated and likely to remain so for a prolonged period.  This improvement has brought an additional 70,000 young persons within the scope of the children's allowances scheme.  In the case of deserted wives, the period for which they have to be deserted to qualify for payment was reduced from six to three months.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of allowances for unmarried mothers who keep their children has been introduced.  The Commission on the Status of Women recommended the introduction of such an allowance for a period of not less than one year after the birth of the child but the new allowance continues in payment until the child ceases to be a dependant of the unmarried mother&mdash; age 18 years or, if the child remains at school, 21 years.  Some 1,800 unmarried mothers are already benefiting under the scheme.  A new benefit, based on insurance, has been introduced for deserted wives as an alternative to the means-test allowance already in existence.  We have also provided for two new social assistance schemes applying to single women aged 58 and over who were unable to benefit under the existing schemes and to the wives of prisoners serving sentences of six months or more.</P>
    <P>Social insurance was extended to all employees on the 1st April of this year, with the abolition, from that date, of the £1,600 remuneration limit which applied to non-manual workers.  In the same month a system of pay-related benefits was introduced for insured workers who became sick or unemployed and for women entitled to maternity allowance.  Title to children's allowances has been vested in mothers instead of fathers as the Commission on the Status of Women recommended.</P>
    <P>Further improvements and extensions are being considered.  The home assistance scheme has been reviewed in detail and it is hoped that changes will be possible in the near future on the basis of recommendations drawn up by the Department of Social Welfare. An examination of the implications of extending social insurance to <Col N="2258" /> the self-employed&mdash;a development which is seen as a priority&mdash;is in progress in that Department.  The establishment of an Advisory Committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty in May last will, I hope, help in dealing with the problems of poverty and their solution&mdash;which depend more often than we may realise, not so much on money as on sympathy and understanding.</P>
    <P>Another very important step has been the Government's decision in principle to support the establishment and operation of community information centres in a number of areas to advise and help people concerning all aspects of the social security services administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  This network of information centres will be established as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>The changes introduced by the Minister for Finance in his recent budgets have also contributed in their way to the social programme of the Government. In the aftermath of the lengthy debate in some detail in this House on the Finance Bill to implement provisions of the last budget it is not necessary for me to go in detail here into these changes.</P>
    <P>In so far as the law governing working conditions and the rights of the disadvantaged are concerned, the Government have given workers the right to three weeks' holiday and have added an extra public holiday this year.  We have given workers the right to a minimum period of notice of up to eight weeks in the case of dismissal and we have improved considerably the position of workers who become redundant.</P>
    <P>A Bill was introduced last week by Long and Short Titles to tackle the problem of child labour and to protect young people who are at present open to exploitation.  Following the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women, we have enacted legislation to eliminate discrimination and improve the position of women in our society.  Women are now guaranteed in law equal pay by 1975 with the enactment recently of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974. The marriage bar in the public service <Col N="2259" /> has been removed; allowances have been given to unmarried mothers keeping their children; wives can now be paid children's allowances; improvements are being made in regard to desertion, maintenance and so on. Later in the year it is intended to enact further legislation to improve the position of women in employment. It is our objective as an administration to enable women&mdash;who account for 52 per cent of our population&mdash;to play a full part in the life of the State and to eliminate those barriers which prevent them from doing so.</P>
    <P>The recent adoption legislation will, among other desirable changes, make it possible for couples in a mixed marriage to adopt, while the Maintenance Orders Act, 1974, enables effect to be given in this country to a proposed agreement with Britain and Northern Ireland for the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance and affiliation orders, which should relieve the position of deserted wives.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government decided, as part of their general programme of social reform that every member of the community, irrespective of income and type of employment, should be entitled to free hospital in-patient and out-patient service, free maternity services, free infant care services and assistance towards the cost of drugs, so that no family would have to pay more than £4 a month for drugs.  Difficulties with the medical organisations have delayed full implementation of the scheme.  However, since 1st April last, there has been a partial easing of the restrictions on entitlement, including the rasing from £1,600 to £2,250 of the annual income limit for the eligibility of insured, non-manual workers for certain services.  I would hope that it will soon be possible to resolve the difficulties which have been experienced so that free hospital services can be made available to all.</P>
    <P>The Government's achievements and policies in the field of housing were set out by the Minister for Local Government in his Estimate speech last week.  I would simply refer to the announcement last Friday that we are <Col N="2260" /> making available an extra £9 million to local authorities for home loans in the current nine-month period.  The total provision is now equivalent to more than £35 million in a full year, compared with expenditure of £11 million in the year before the Government took office.  This is clear evidence of our commitment to providing decent housing for all our people.  We are keeping the whole situation in relation to house building and housing finance under close and continuous review so that changes and developments which may occur will be watched in order to ensure that adequate facilities are available for the industry.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom anois roinnt a rá faoi pholasaí an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  In oráidí a thug mé le bliain anuas, ag labhairt dom faoi Thuaisceart na hÉireann agus faoi phobal na hÉireann uile, thagair mé do na snáthanna eágsúla sinsireachta agus dúchais as ar fáisceadh muintir na hÉireann sa lá atá inniu ann.  Ní hé a bhí i gceist agam ins na tagairtí sin céimsíos a thabhairt don Ghaeilge ná don chultúr Gaelach.  Is amhlaidh a theastaigh uaim an fhírinne a léiriú mar atá sé.</P>
    <P>Aithníonn an Rialtas gurb í an Ghaeltacht foinse agus tobar an snáth Gaelach inár bhéin úiacht, agus is é an beartas atá ná lánfhostaíocht agus caighdeán maith maireachtála a chur ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta sna seachtóidí.  Chun forbairt eacnamaíoch, shóisialach, theangaíoch, agus chultúrtha na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn ar na bealaí is éifeachtaí bunófar Údarás na Gaeltachta ina mbeidh guth láidir ag pobal na Gaeltachta féin.  Is faoi scáth Roinn na Gaeltachta a bheidh an tÚdarás agus beidh cumhachtaí leathana feidhmiúcháin aige chun clár uileghabhálach a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Beidh Acht le rith chun na socruithe nua a dhéanamh, agus, idir an dá linn, tá Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Gaeltarra Éireann ag brú ar aghaidh go tréan le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus tá méadú mór déanta ag an Rialtais ar an airgead a bhíonn ar fáil dóibh.  Ní beag an dul chun cinn atá déanta cheana féin.</P>
    <P>Mar shampla, na tionscail nua ar fud na Gaeltachta a bhfuil cúnamh <Col N="2261" /> ceadaithe ag Gaeltarra Éireann dóibh, meastar go gcuirfidh siad fostaíoch ar fáil do suas le 4,000 cainteoir Gaeilge ina gceantair dhúchais.</P>
    <P>Is mian leis an Rialtas freisin an pobal a spreagadh ar thaobh úsáid na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre agus, don chéad uair, beidh an phríomhfhreagacht i bhfeidhmiú an bheartais ghinearálta sin ar Roinn ar leith&mdash;Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Faoi scáth na Roinne bunófar Bord na Gaeilge agus cumhachtaí feidhmiúcháin aige chun leas na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Bord reachtúil a bheidh ann tar eís Act cuí a rith ach bunófar go luath é ar bhonn <i>ad hoc</i>.  Chun freastal ar na socruithe nua don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge déanfar atheagrú cuí ar structúr Roinn na Gaeltachta agus aistreofar oiread agus is féidir d'obair na Roinne go dtí na Forbacha i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the European Economic Community has extended now for a period of more than one year.  While there are features of our membership which may have been the cause of disappointment, we have, on the whole, gained substantial benefits both material and otherwise, from membership.  The net flow of funds from the Community towards our country was of the order of £33 million in 1973 and further substantial sums have been approved but have yet to be paid.  We have benefited from Community arrangements in agriculture, and as members of one of the largest and most dynamic industrial markets in the world, we have become an even more desirable location for new industry&mdash;as the figures I have quoted earlier for the value of new industrial projects approved by the Industrial Development Authority imply.  Further, there is for us the intangible, though nonetheless real, benefit arising from the development of our sense of identity with our European heritage.  The Third Report on Developments in the European Communities, laid recently before both Houses of the Oireachtas, ranged in more detail over developments in the various areas of Community activity.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the <Col N="2262" /> British Government have tabled in the Council of the Community a number of requests for amendment of the existing arrangements of the Communities. The most important of these requests related to British contributions to the Community budget.  The British have here made the case that the present provisions are &ldquo;inequitable&rdquo;.  In response to the British case, the Commission is examining the economic and financial situation of the Community as a whole since enlargement and its likely future development.  Other British requests relate to Community agricultural arrangements, trade policy, development aid and national industrial, regional and fiscal policies.  These matters are all being considered as part of the on-going work of the Community and within the existing framework.</P>
    <P>In general, we take the view that Community solidarity requires serious examination of problems raised by any member state.  We also wish to see the Community maintained with its present membership.  In the light of these considerations we have been happy to note the British intention to negotiate within the terms of the Community treaties.  Our reactions to any proposals designed to meet the British case will, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has pointed out, be largely conditioned by the degree to which these would promote the prospect of achieving real progress towards a democratically-controlled European union.</P>
    <P>During the first six months of 1975 Ireland will hold the presidency of the Council of the European Communities. It will be Ireland's opportunity to provide chairmen for all committees and working groups of the Council as well as meetings of the Council itself during this period.  Preparations are currently being made in Government Departments to enable this country to discharge fully its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Our presidency next year also covers the inter-governmental political co-operation activity of the member states which is quite separate from the Community framework.  We will have the responsibility in 1975 of chairing all meetings of the Nine in this political framework.  The major difference of <Col N="2263" /> organisation between these two sets of activity is that European political co-operation meetings are held in the capital of the presidency, which means that we will be called upon to provide in Dublin all the necessary secretarial and infrastructural services in addition to performing the function of chairman. As well as a number of meetings of Foreign Ministers and conceivably a meeting at higher level, there will be a large number of meetings, at official level, possibly 30 or more, over the six-month period.  Apart from preparing those meetings and presiding over them, Ireland will have the important and demanding task of acting as spokesman for the Nine in their collective dealings with other countries.</P>
    <P>The objective of this political co-operation procedure is to ensure close co-operation in foreign policy matters between the Governments of the Nine with a view to achieving better mutual understanding on major international problems and to strengthen their solidarity by harmonisation of views, co-ordination of positions and, where possible and desirable, common action.  Ireland has participated actively in the framework since our accession to the Communities in January, 1973.  At present consultations are held among the Nine on a wide range of foreign policy subjects. This framework has provided a valuable opportunity for the elaboration of common positions and attitudes on subjects such as the conference on security and co-operation in Europe, the situation in the Middle East, the proposed Euro-Arab dialogue, relations with the United States, and the situation in countries such as Chile, Portugal and Cyprus.</P>
    <P>One of the topics which has been of particular interest in the past year has been that of arrangements for consultations between the Nine and other countries, and in particular the United States.  It has now been agreed that consultations on issues of interest to the Nine and to the US should be carried out through the presidency in each case where the issue is raised by one of the Nine and where there is consensus in favour of such consultations. <Col N="2264" /> This appears to be a very satisfactory foundation on which to develop future relations and Ireland, as a member state of the Nine with many strong links of friendship with the United States, welcomes this agreement which ensures that the interests of both the Nine and the United States receive due consideration at all times.</P>
    <P>An important initiative taken this year by the Community, acting together in the framework of political co-operation, was the decision to open a long-term dialogue with the states of the Arab world.  Agreement in principle has been reached by both sides on this dialogue, the detailed content of which remains to be elaborated.</P>
    <P>The broad aim of this dialogue is the long-term development of relations between Europe and the Arab world and co-operation over a wide variety of fields.  We have participated fully in this initiative and we have indicated our willingness to contribute as far as possible to the successful achievement of its objectives.  Discussions are also in hand among the Nine on the coordination of European proposals for inclusion in the dialogue; this is a matter of particular significance to us in the context of Ireland's tenure of the presidency in 1975.</P>
    <P>We have been co-operating closely with our partners in the Nine in the conference on security and co-operation in Europe, the second phase of which is currently in session in Geneva.  We share the concern of our partners that the results of this conference, the first major East-West dialogue in post-war years, should be sufficiently positive in all fields&mdash;that of increased freedom of human contacts and the diffusion of information, no less than those of trade and security&mdash;to enable it to succeed in its basic objectives of the furtherance of <i>detenté</i> and ensuring the future stability of the continent.  I believe that we have been able to make a useful contribution both towards the development of a common position of the Nine, and in the conference itself, where we have, of course, benefited from the support of our partners in <Col N="2265" /> putting forward the Irish position where questions of particular interest to us arose.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to a matter in the area of international affairs, not directly related to the EEC, but which is of tremendous potential importance for this country.  The Law of the Sea conference which is being held at present in Caracas ranges over a very wide area, including such matters as territorial seas, contiguous zones, international navigation, exclusive economic zones, marine environment, marine research and an international regime for the sea bed.</P>
    <P>One of the main purposes of the conference is to seek a new regime for the ocean bed outside national jurisdiction, with the probable creating of an international authority to control this area and its exploitation with particular concern for the needs of poorer countries. While international conventions do already exist, they do not in the light of present technological advances and the growth of the economic needs, deal with large areas of the law of the sea.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging that the seas and their fruits are the common heritage of mankind and supporting the establishment of an international authority with an effective constitution, we will also be looking for the recognition of the preferential rights of coastal states.  We will be seeking for this country the largest profitable area of national maritime jurisdiction in the form of an extension of the territorial seas and contiguous zones, and a wide economic zone.  We see this as the most beneficial way of exploiting the seas both for the coastal state and, internationally, by ensuring the control of pollution, the conservation of living and non-living resources and the promotion of marine technology in these areas.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that inflation was probably the greatest single problem facing us.  I want to preface what I have to say by some remarks on the growth of public expenditure.  In the 12 months to March next, the Government have budgeted to spend £180 million more on the current side and <Col N="2266" /> £65 million more on capital development than in the previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>Public service pay increases, that is the pay of civil servants, teachers, Army, Garda and health board staffs, account for a very significant part of the overall increase in current Government expenditure.  The cost in 1974-75 of meeting standard increases under the national pay agreement 1974 for the public service is about £40 million and increases in staff numbers account for a further £14 million. These increased numbers are required for expansion in the fields of social welfare, education, health, telephone development, in EEC work and in the security forces.</P>
    <P>These pay increases, together with the annual rise in the cost of servicing the national debt&mdash;now estimated to cost almost £190 million annually &mdash;absorb a very high proportion of tax buoyancy and limit the Government's room for manoeuvre in regard to desirable expansion in other areas. Nevertheless, in 1974-75 the Government are spending an extra £34 million on social welfare mainly on improvements in benefits, including children's allowances, and the lowering of the old age pension age to 68.  An extra £17 million&mdash;not including pay&mdash;is being spent on various expansions and improvements in the health services including the cost of transferring a further instalment of health charges from the rates to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In 1974-75 the Exchequer will provide £126 million towards current health costs and the rates will provide £19 million.  In education apart from the increased costs of teachers' pay and the cost of increases in teacher numbers, about £6 million is being provided for various improvements, including increased expenditure on teacher training, school transport, higher education grants and free education grants.  In local government an extra £5 million is being provided for housing subsidy, the Road Fund grant is being increased by £3.1 million and provision is made for continuing the interest subsidy to building societies which the Government introduced in May of last year. There are also substantial increases <Col N="2267" /> in the amounts provided for expenditure under the Public Capital Programme on services like housing, industrial development, agriculture and so on.</P>
    <P>The rapid increase, in recent years, in both current and capital expenditure has resulted in a sharp rise in the amount of total expenditure not covered by tax or other receipts.  This increase in the net borrowing requirement has been all the greater because of the limited room for manoeuvre on the tax front combined with the necessity to revise the personal tax allowances. Not only do we get a higher proportion of our revenue from indirect taxes than any of the other EEC member states but the burden of taxation in Ireland in recent years, has been growing faster than in most other member states.</P>
    <P>The net borrowing requirement is financed from two major sources viz:- (a) normal Exchequer resources, and (b) residual Exchequer borrowing. While there is a reasonable assurance of realising most of the amounts under the &lsquo;normal resources&rsquo; heading, sales of securities to the public are exceptionally volatile and react sharply to events outside the Government's control, in particular to trends in international interest rates, and cannot, therefore, be predicted with any degree of accuracy.</P>
    <P>Because the domestic resources available to the Exchequer have failed to keep pace with the growth in expenditure, there has been a rapid increase in the amount of money raised abroad in recent years.  Apart from the element of uncertainty if not hazard which this gives rise to, there is also the consideration that foreign borrowing is becoming increasingly costly and the repayment period increasingly shorter.</P>
    <P>All of these factors point to the need for a most careful and critical appraisal of State expenditure both in the current and in future years. This leads me to deal with a subject closely related to the high rate of increase in public expenditure in recent years.  I mean the phenomenon of inflation. <Col N="2268" /> Inflation has been described as the enemy of economic progress, of social justice, of the young seeking jobs in Ireland, of the saver and, indeed, of democracy itself.  With these sentiments I fully concur.</P>
    <P>The extent of inflation in our economy is indicated by the rise in the 12 months ended mid-May last, of over 16 per cent in the consumer price index.  This compares with a rise in the year to December last of approximately 19 per cent in average industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>Much of the rise in prices is due to external influences.  In fact, nearly 50 per cent of the increase in 1973 is accounted for by the rise in the price of imports, as compared with only 10 per cent of the increase in 1972 and less than 20 per cent in 1971.  The effects of the oil price increases are reflected in the dramatic increase in the contributions of fuel, light and transport to the total increase in consumer prices.  This was 31 per cent in the second quarter of 1974 as compared with about 10 per cent in the final three quarters of 1973.</P>
    <P>Over the last 12 months, increases in material costs generally have become important as causes of price increases.  In December last, they accounted for nearly 90 per cent of total cost increases.  In the first four months of this year the corresponding figure was about 80 per cent. This fell in May and June but the explanation for this decline lies not in any reduction in the absolute size of the rise in material costs but rather in the increase in the percentage accounted for by wage costs claimed in price applications as a result of the 1974 national pay agreement.</P>
    <P>In the drive against inflation it is obviously necessary to ensure that only price rises justified by increases in costs which cannot be avoided or offset are permitted.  The main agency for this is the National Prices Commission whose work has ensured substantial savings to consumers.  Increased annual costs of £119 million were claimed in nearly 1,200 applications for price increases considered <Col N="2269" /> by the Commission in the 11 months up to 21st May, 1974.  Only £100 million were actually allowed.  It is, of course, impossible to say the purposes on which the money saved to consumers would have been spent if it had remained with the firms the subject of the controls.  Part of it may well have been invested, directly or indirectly, in increasing or improving methods of production.  This is one of the costs of price control, which though not quantified, we should not forget.  It is one of the inefficiencies which inflation compels us to build into our economic structure.</P>
    <P>In dealing with prices we are dealing with the symptoms, not the causes, of inflation.  I have not referred to the external pressures forcing prices up to distract attention from the domestic causes of inflation. Even in a period when import prices soared, domestic causes accounted for more than half the rise in consumer prices.</P>
    <P>The dominant influence here is the increase in incomes of all kinds, far in excess of the rise in the volume of national output.  For example, the rise of 19 per cent in employee incomes in the industrial sector in 1973 compares with a productivity increase of only 7 per cent.  This resulted in an increase of 11 per cent in unit wage costs.  In itself, this might not be too dangerous if trends in other countries were similar.  But the rise in unit costs here has been well above the increase in most industrialised countries.</P>
    <P>I need hardly spell out the consequences of a continuation of this trend.  If our prices are not competitive we will be unable to sell the goods and services we produce.  Persons will lose their present employment and the attractions of the country as a location for new industry &mdash;on which our future prosperity depends&mdash;will be diminished or dissipated.</P>
    <P>The 1974 national agreement which was ratified only after months of hard negotiation will be one of the key factors here.  Not only did it sort out and provide a solution for various problems arising from widely differing terminal dates of industry <Col N="2270" /> agreements, but it is producing and will produce very substantial pay increases for workers generally.  In addition, it has guaranteed that increases in the cost of living index in excess of 10 per cent in the 12 months to November, 1974, will be fully compensated for.</P>
    <P>In strictly economic terms, however, the agreement, will add to, rather than alleviate, the pressure on costs and prices.  It is essential, theremore, that its terms should be observed and supported by all.  The basic pay increases provided for are substantial, by any reckoning; indeed the economy will have great difficulty in trying to absorb the increased labour costs involved.  Even before the agreement expires, moderation in pressing anomaly items over and above the standard increases could be of significant help.  Indeed, the extent to which claims have been pressed for increases over and above the standard provisions has been a source of disappointment to the Government.</P>
    <P>Also discouraging has been an increasing readiness to ignore the peace clauses of the agreement.  Over the past few years our economy has been transformed from one characterised by a high strike record to one in which our industrial relations performance has been amongst the best in Europe. Unfortunately the trends which have developed in the first half of this year are in the opposite direction.  In that period we have lost about twice as many man-days through strikes as we lost in each of the three preceding years.  A few disputes accounted for the vast majority of the man-days lost.  If this trend were to continue we would as a community lose one of the prime advantages of national agreements.</P>
    <P>The over-riding priority on the economic front now is for Government and other various interests concerned to work out ways and means of winding down the present rate of inflation. Luckily, the external pressures seem to be easing.  The rise in food prices is slackening, commodity prices have declined in recent weeks and may well declined further.  The future course of oil prices is more difficult to predict. <Col N="2271" /> The moves towards fuller State participation by the Governments of the producing countries may tend to raise prices somewhat.  On the other hand, the supply demand situation points to the likelihood of some fall in prices. We may hope, at least, that any increase will be moderate.  In these circumstances, we must ensure that this opportunity of turning back inflation is not thrown away by actions in areas within our own control.  The Government are fully conscious of the influence of expenditure within their own programmes on the pressures of demand within the economy generally.</P>
    <P>Basically, as I have indicated, we must concentrate on the domestic causes of inflation.  This is not to deny or minimise the extent of imported inflation.  It is simply to recognise that externally generated inflation is largely beyond our control.  We will, of course, support any well conceived international initiatives to moderate it and it will be the Government's concern to cushion the poorer sections of the community against its worst effects.  But the hard fact remains that it is only on the domestic elements of our inflation that we can exercise any really significant influence.</P>
    <P>To exert such influence demands a certain minimum of agreement between the main parties concerned on what needs to be done and, most important it demands the will to do it, despite the sectional pressures that are bound to arise.  As I have said, the most powerful of the domestic causes of the present inflation has been the extent to which the rate of increase in money incomes has out-paced the growth in national productivity. The national agreements made so far have, despite the other advantages which encouraged the Government to support them whole-heartedly, added to inflationary pressures. What may have been good enough when the rate of price increase was lower, however, cannot be risked when the rate is running, as it is at present, at over 16 per cent.  It is not too early, therefore, for urgent examination of the ways in which whatever new arrangements replace the <Col N="2272" /> current agreement can help to slow down inflation drastically.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise, of course, that in such arrangements, since price increases cannot be stopped overnight, real moderation by workers in their wage demand may need to be matched by provisions which, as far as possible, protect their existing wages against the ravages of price increases.</P>
    <P>I have spent some time on wages because of their importance but all other forms of incomes and prices need equally critical scrutiny, the criterion in all cases being, whether developments in these areas can be harnessed in the fight against inflation.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which will engage the Government's attention is whether, and if so what, improvements are needed in the relationship between the way we determine income increases and the way we take decisions at national level on major economic, fiscal and social policies.  It is important that decisions on income increases should harmonise with the community's decisions on those wider issues.  On the institutional side this means looking at how such bodies as, for example, the Employer-Labour Conference, the National Prices Commission and the National Economic and Social Council relate to one another in their work and aims and how they, in turn, relate to Government Departments and the legislature. Mere tinkering with institutional machinery can do more harm than good and that is not what I have in mind.  It is, however, obviously desirable that income increases be determined with full awareness of how they fit into the wider context of the country's economic and social policies. The institutional framework can help or hinder this.</P>
    <P>To sustain employment for a labour force which is expected to increase in the years ahead, while maintaining a rising standard of living and an equitable distribution of income, requires, in turn, an increasing level of public expenditure which is incompatible with the existing high rate of inflation and with the likely lower growth rate <Col N="2273" /> which this inflation will ultimately engender.  There is now before us as a community an unavoidable choice between a stabilisation policy aimed at safeguarding employment and social equity or the persistence of the existing rate of inflation with its dire consequences for employment and living standards.  The Government will ensure that the course in the best interests of the entire community is followed and the only course in the national interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's review of the economy has been, at least, a comprehensive one but when all the figures are scrutinised and the verbiage of the Taoiseach's script has been digested I think it will be clear that there is no indication that the Government have any specific plan or programme, or even the will to implement it, to deal with the current serious and deteriorating economic situation.  There is nothing in the tone or content of the Taoiseach's statement that would in any way stimulate the flagging spirits of many Deputies who listened to it and who have had a sleepless or almost sleepless night.</P>
      <P>It is not surprising that the Government were reluctant to permit this Adjournment Debate and have done so now, which is not unusual, by introducing the Taoiseach's Estimate in which the Taoiseach is usually expected to review not only the economy but the overall performance of his Government.  This performance during the past year has been characterised by one continuing and dominating feature, the total lack of will to face up to difficult or unpopular decisions. This cowardice or desire to buy public popularity at all times is the one common trend that has run through all aspects of Government administration and behaviour in all fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had, for example, the head-in-the-sand approach to the oil shortage last winter when, for a long time, there was an attempt to pretend that no problems existed.  We had the paralysis of the Government in the face of industrial disputes such as the ESB dispute last winter and, more recently, the Dublin bus strike.  We <Col N="2274" /> had the spectacle of the Government first announcing, and then running away from its capital taxation proposals. We had the pathetic attempt at pretending that inflation was all the fault of world events over which the Government had no control as an excuse for failing to honour the Coalition election promises about stabilising prices.  It is at least somewhat reassuring to hear the Taoiseach in his statement today say that there is at least 50 per cent of this inflation over which we can exercise some control&mdash;yes, certainly if the Government had the will and ability to do so.  For the crowning touch we had the spectacle last week of the Taoiseach disclaiming a Bill brought in in the name of his Government.  The list could be extended but the examples I have given are sufficient to make the point.</P>
    <P>Allied to this lack of courage to which I referred there has been a second feature of the Government's performance which should be highlighted, and that is their continuous attempt to have things both ways by a barrage of propaganda and public relations exercises designed to conceal the unpleasant facts from the public or, in some way, to misrepresent them.  Also, there was, and is the extraordinary lethargy on the part of the Government to introduce and implement important legislation. There are so many examples that one hardly knows where to begin.  The most recent one was the unfortunate situation which developed here yesterday and throughout the night. The Government introduced the budget on 3rd April this year and it took three months, coming up to the last days of the Dáil, before we at last saw the Finance Bill.  Because of the necessity to have that Bill enacted before the end of this month the usual time was not available to the Opposition.  Sufficient time was not available to discuss the implications of that Bill fully.  That is entirely due to the Government's lethargy, to which I referred, in bringing forward legislation.</P>
    <P>We have now been told that the long-awaited mining taxation Bill <Col N="2275" /> will be introduced during the current summer.  This was promised during last summer also.  We hope that at last it will ultimately appear.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with three main issues which I think will show up these features and the ineptitude of the Government to handle the current serious situation.  Since it is still fresh in people's minds I shall begin with the Contraceptives Bill.  Again, we have an example here of Government lethargy.  The need for the Bill was apparent after the Supreme Court decision last December: the Bill was introduced six months later.</P>
    <P>Since it is still fresh in people's minds I shall deal with it in some detail.  Here, the line was being put abroad up to last Tuesday that the Government was being civilised, reasonable and enlightened in allowing, not only an open debate, but also a free vote on this issue, and that Fianna Fáil were the villains of the piece by trying to make party political issues out of something which was to be treated as a matter of conscience and outside the normal party arena.  We were told that this Bill was being discussed in a free vote situation.</P>
    <P>That is what Government Deputies were told but, unfortunately, they seemed to discover in the process of the Bill going through the House that the contrary was the case.  I am sure that is why so many Members on Government benches, especially those of Fine Gael, felt deceived and betrayed last week.  There was no free vote for them; they had been whipped into voting for a measure, despite the reservations which many of them felt, because they were led to believe that their party, their Leader and their Government Ministers supported it.</P>
    <P>The Government Whip, Deputy Kelly, tried to cover up the confusion and dismay by what might appear to him to be a brave speech last weekend in which he&mdash;not surprisingly&mdash; attacked Fianna Fáil and tried to suggest the debacle was in some way our responsibility.  However, the shock of last Tuesday's events must have still affected him when he made that speech on Thursday because he also made <Col N="2276" /> some remarks which I certainly interpret as criticism by him of the Taoiseach. He spoke of the 61 Deputies&mdash;&ldquo;five-sixths of the total Government strength voted freely to change the law in a manner which respected the minority's rights and conscience&rdquo;.  The clear interpretation of that assertion must be that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education, who voted against the Bill, are not persons who would respect the minority's rights.</P>
    <P>He went on also to say&mdash;I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of July 19th&mdash; that 61 Deputies freely supported the Bill in the interests of reason, order in law, and national reconciliation. Again the implication is very clear. The Government Deputies, the Taoiseach and the Minister who voted against the Bill did not have these interests at heart.  He continued with the extraordinary statement, which in the usual way of <i>The Irish Times</i> report on these things says &ldquo;according to the supplied script&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>This is the proud and historic side of Tuesday, the 16th day of July, and if we are ever to have an all-Ireland day of national brotherhood this would be no bad date to choose.</P>
    <P>If this ever happens the Taoiseach will take no comfort in taking part in this day of national brotherhood&mdash;16th July which may be chosen from now on as that date.</P>
    <P>I want to make the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party towards the Bill perfectly clear.  It was perfectly clearcut. We did not support the Bill because we regarded it as a bad piece of legislation and impracticable in its application.  We recognise that the existing situation following the Supreme Court decision in the McGee case is one which needs to be redressed and which calls for legislation.  Were we in Government we would bring in such legislation and stand over it, but it is not our function to do the work of the Government for them.  If the Government sought to redress the situation following the Supreme Court decision it was their duty to bring forward a practicable Bill for this purpose. Since it was asserted by the <Col N="2277" /> Minister that it was essential legislation, it was also their duty that they should use their parliamentary majority to ensure that the Bill would be passed and enacted, but this was not done.</P>
    <P>Many people who oppose contraception applauded the defeat of the Bill.  They felt it meant that contraceptives would not now be legally available. Many people still think this following the defeat of the Bill in the House last week.  It is necessary to state again what the actual position is.  The Minister has done so himself on at least two occasions during the course of the passage of the Bill.  Prior to the Supreme Court decision in the McGee case it was not lawful to import, sell or expose for sale contraceptives. That was in accordance with the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935. The Supreme Court decided that that part of the 1935 Act which prohibited the importation of contraceptives for personal use was against the Constitution. Therefore, from the date of the Supreme Court decision in December, 1973, it was and is legally permissible to import contraceptives for personal use but not to sell or expose them for sale.  That is a fair statement of the position which now obtains.</P>
    <P>In effect, since the Supreme Court decision contraceptives have been and are now freely available.  The purpose of the Government Bill is to continue to make them legally available but under certain restrictive conditions.  These were conditions with which our party did not agree on the grounds of practical enforcement and public morality. In effect, the Government Bill would have made contraceptives available through chemists' shops or other retail outlets amounting in all to some thousands throughout the country without any obligation on the shopkeepers requiring them to sell them only to married people.</P>
    <P>I believe that this widespread and almost indiscriminate availability of contraceptives would be against public morality.  I also believe and want to make known my personal position that there are personal circumstances, for example, for valid health and social reasons, and where religious <Col N="2278" /> beliefs or conscientious convictions allow, in which people ought to have reasonable access to the use of contraceptives. The health considerations involved were clearly illustrated by the evidence in the McGee case. Apart from the force of that evidence it is clear that the State ought not to legislate in such a way as to endanger a citizen's life or health.</P>
    <P>As for religious beliefs or conscientious convictions, I accept that in no matter what capacity I do not have the right to dictate to married persons on their use of contraceptives in lawful wedlock.  Apart from the other considerations I have mentioned this is a matter of private morality. I do not condone any legislation which would make contraceptives available to single people.  The possible alternative suggested by Deputy O'Malley, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on this issue, of making available contraceptives to married people through the agency of the health authorities on a non-commercial basis was an alternative which the Minister should have considered and accepted.  However, he chose not to do so.</P>
    <P>The position now is worse that that which would have obtained if the Government Bill with all its faults had been passed.  This is something which must be remembered in the present situation.  There is now the danger of uncontrolled or uncontrollable illicit sales of these devices, especially among young people.  It is the duty of all responsible persons and groups, churches or otherwise, to indicate to people who think otherwise what the position now is.  There is no use pretending that because the Bill was defeated contraceptives are no longer available.  Those who opposed the Bill, as I did, knew that without alternative practicable legislation contraceptives would be and are now freely available.  The Minister for Justice stated that he is satisfied to leave the situation as it now obtains, that is, complete freedom to import contraceptives for personal use.</P>
    <P>Apart from the extraordinary and unprecedented action of the Head of the Government and the Minister for <Col N="2279" /> Education in voting against the Government measure this action strikes at the very credibility of this administration. It is another blatant example of their lack of coherent policy.  The Bill was not a vote for or against contraception.  Therefore, it is nonsense for any Member of the Government or any Deputy supporting the Government to say, or to have it said on his behalf, that he voted against the Bill because his conscience dictated that he should oppose the availability of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>That was not the issue.  The issue was whether the Bill adequately controlled the availability of contraceptives. We read in the newspapers that hundreds of letters complimenting the Taoiseach on his act of conscience have poured into his Department and this now gave thought to the other members of the Government that perhaps the Taoiseach was right after all.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not vote against contraception, because by his vote he made contraceptives more freely available than under the Bill.  It was a Government Bill.  If the Taoiseach felt that it did not adequately fulfil its purpose, it was his duty to have acted within the Cabinet and not to come into the House and by his action in voting against this Bill be misinterpreted by the public at large.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Education by voting against this Bill are striking an irreparable blow to the credibility of this Government and to the confidence which the public can have in it and in any future difficult decisions with which it might be faced&mdash;and there will be many.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the second area in which the Government have failed to offer any coherent policy and in which they have continually run away from difficulties and unpopular decisions, and that is in the management of the economy.  The Coalition Government took office at a time when the economy was expanding at a record rate and was set fair for further steady progress.  Successful growth, even at the rate of 5 or 6 <Col N="2280" /> per cent per annum, cannot guarantee instant prosperity for everybody nor can it enable all problems to be immediately resolved.  The Coalition Government, unfortunately for them, had made many extravagant and expensive election promises which they then could not admit were beyond the limits the country could afford. So they embarked on a programme of excessive spending.  The figures the Taoiseach gave in his speech are a clear indication of that, and I will refer later to more objective authorities to illustrate my point.  One consequence of this was to add to the already high rate of inflation.  Far from stabilising prices, as had been promised, they were worsening the position.  We have now reached the stage of almost complete frustration on the part of the public as to whether this Government can in any way help them in their dire economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that to a Government which was alleged to have so much talent learning would be quicker and easier for them than for others.  Instead, the Government have continued their policy of excessive spending this year also.  At budget time we pointed this out in detail and showed what was necessary to deal with the prevailing economic difficulties.  Deputy Colley, in his first statement after the budget speech, said at column 1478 of the Official Report of 3rd April, 1974:</P>
    <P>In our economic circumstances, some of which are outlined by the Minister in his speech, and having regard to the international climate particularly in relation to oil prices and the shortage of various raw materials, it is gross irresponsibility on the part of the Government to bring in a budget providing for a deficit of more than £66 million.</P>
    <P>That was the biggest single simulation of the inflationary trend for which this Government was responsible.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance literally strutted into this House on the 3rd April, 1974, with his budget statement under his arm and then read it. The very first line read:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2281" /> The success of last year's budget policy is illustrated by the near record rate of 7 per cent growth achieved in 1973.</P>
    <P>We claim that this expansion had taken place during 1972 and up to the first half of 1973 and thereafter it declined.  The Taoiseach repeated the unsupportable claim of the Minister for Finance in his statement here today.</P>
    <P>A few days ago the Economic and Social Research Institute issued a report, a Quarterly Economic Commentary, dated June, 1974.  On page 9 they provided a table entitled &ldquo;Volume of Production in Manufacturing&rdquo;. In the column immediately under that table it says:</P>
    <P>It is clear from the table that the upsurge in activity occurred in the second half of 1972 and continued into the first half of 1973.  For the remainder of the year the level of production actually declined.</P>
    <P>That is possibly the most objective comment which could be made on the performance of the economy in 1973&mdash;an improved performance that ended long before the first budget of the Coalition Government could have had any economic effect whatever.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the stimulus given to inflation by an unnecessary and dangerous budget stimulus.  Again we have comments from a source which nobody could suggest was anything but objective and, as is its purpose, critical.  I refer of course to the Central Bank Report and, in particular, to the report recently published for 1973-74.  On the first page of the General Review, on page 7 of the report, it says:</P>
    <P>Again Ireland was one of the most inflationary areas in the world.  To review such a year of monetary depreciation would, from the Central Bank's viewpoint be bleakly depressing if no remedial action were possible or no hope of relief, however adventitious, could be foreseen.</P>
    <P>Again this is a clear denunciation of the Government's failure to tackle this inflationary problem.  In the next paragraph it says:</P>
    <P>It is a fallacy, even for the open <Col N="2282" /> Irish economy, that inflation is due more to external than internal causes and that it is beyond our power to curb or control it.  If this were true, and the only armoury a country had against a mainly imported inflation was price control, the situation would be a sorry one.  Price control, as is obvious, can prevent only &ldquo;unjustifiable&rdquo; price increases; those justified by increased costs of imports or of home products and services it can do nothing about.</P>
    <P>That is quite true.  We know that inflation is now divided into three categories &mdash;home generated inflation, export inflation and imported inflation.  There is little, if anything, any Government can do about imported inflation.  Export inflation refers in the main to the kind of prices we get for our commodity exports and, if these prices are high, naturally the price on the home market will be almost correspondingly high. But there is an area in the third category of home generated inflation which the Government not only can but have a duty to control and this Government have made no effort whatever to do so.</P>
    <P>If I might refer again to the Central Bank's Report 1973-74.  The Minister for Finance, in his budget of 1973 and again in 1974, seemed to have become politically intoxicated with the flowery phrase &ldquo;expansionary policy&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach repeated it today as being the greatest virtue that the Government have had in this field.  Expansionary policy is good as long as due regard is had for the necessary means of obtaining it.  The Central Bank, on page 10 of its report, speaks about this expansionary policy in the following terms:</P>
    <P>The 1974 budget was merely another, though major, advance along an expansionary road which has carried the annual rate of increase in public current and capital expenditure from just over 13 per cent in 1969 to 23 per cent last year.</P>
    <P>Further on, at page 11, it says:</P>
    <P>The growing extent to which this rising volume of public expenditure has to be financed by external borrowing <Col N="2283" /> is a special cause for concern. At end-March, 1974 about £165 million of external government debt was outstanding, as against only £55 million five years before,</P>
    <P>That is a three-fold increase in that five-year period.  The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>and the indications are that this figure will be of the order of £300 million at least by end-March, 1975.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the need for external borrowing and I should say, in fairness, referred also to the dangers of deflation or reflation by countries from which we have borrowed. There is also the fact that we are denied the tax that would be payable if money was borrowed from within the country, payable on the interest earned on those borrowings. Suffice it to say, Sir, that indiscriminate borrowing abroad is not only highly dangerous but adds considerably to the public debt.  This, of course, has to be financed.  A simple illustration of how this affects the ordinary person, an illustration of what I consider to be the irregular progress of the Government in this sphere is the increase in servicing the national debt which rose from £80 million just two years ago to £130 million this year.  A simple division exercise will show that, firstly, this is an increase of over 60 per cent in two years and, secondly, in more simple terms, reflects an increase of about £1.25 in each and every household on average in this country. Therefore, this external borrowing about which the average person may not think too much, deliberately undertaken by the Government, deprives every household, on average, of an income of £1.25 per annum.</P>
    <P>That is not the only reference I could quote which, again, I would regard as in no way&mdash;I will not say as objective as the other two but certainly in no way would tend to be unfavourable towards the Government. It is worth noting that the Irish Transport and General Workers Union publication <i>Liberty</i> is also <Col N="2284" /> critical of the budget and supports the Fianna Fáil view that the emphasis should have been on policies to boost investment, exports and growth. In its current month's issue on page 11, it says:</P>
    <P>...it is necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I have omitted a preamble to this but I think what I am about to quote gives a proper indication of what it is intended to convey:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is necessary that further investment in capital equipment should also occur.  It is for this reason that it can be argued that it might have been preferable for Government economic strategy to have concentrated on improving the environment for increased investment rather than hoping that increased investment production would result from the boost to consumer demand arising from such a large budget deficit.</P>
    <P>It continues to say:</P>
    <P>Indeed such a strategy could just as easily backfire in terms of an accentuation of inflationary and balance of payments problems of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Those are comments from three separate sources&mdash;the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Central Bank and the official journal of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  This budget&mdash;which, as we have been told always, is the cornerstone of Government economic policy &mdash;not only failed to help investment and exports but the other economic policies of the Government seem to be designed to destroy the economy rather than build it up.</P>
    <P>The best example of this appalling bungling was the capital taxation proposals. These were introduced in the name of improving the equity of the tax system and reducing the inequality in the distribution of wealth.  The Government had taken a whole year in which to study this problem before announcing its proposals.  These were announced at the end of February. Therefore, it would have been reasonable to expect that any scheme would be well thought out and supported by <Col N="2285" /> adequate information but, as the events of the past five months have clearly shown, that was certainly not the case.  It was not surprising that an ill-conceived mixture of tax proposals of this sort would be amended, as they have been, but the extraordinary manner of their change is incredible.  When modifying the wealth tax the Minister for Finance dropped the pretence at distributing wealth which apparently is supposed to be its <i>raison d'être.</i></P>
    <P>There is no longer any talk about equity; instead, he was saying two weeks ago that the only test was whether or not the new taxes could bring in the same amount of money as the old death duties and that if the other new taxes&mdash;capital gains and capital acquisitions&mdash;could do this, then the wealth tax could be dropped. We still do not know what will be the ultimate decision of the Government in this respect.  But certainly it has caused widespread uncertainly amongst many people, many people of moderate means; many people who have capital to invest in this country; many people who have capital already invested in this country and who have been letting it go out of the country.  Certainly, it has given these people no cause to have confidence in the future, the kind of people on whom we depend to generate productivity and employment.</P>
    <P>This is one of the results of inadequate Government preparation; the result of lack of coherent policy; lack of firmness of purpose by the Government in pursuing any policy.</P>
    <P>I think the situation in the house building industry is something that ought to be highlighted.  For weeks past we have been treated to a barrage of words and statistics by the Minister for Local Government denying what has been asserted by those who are in a position to know best&mdash;the building contractors and the Construction Industries Federation who have been warning of the grave crisis not only developing but having developed within the industry.  There are many reasons for this situation, but the main reason for it lies at the door of the Government and, in particular, at the door of the Minister for Local Government. <Col N="2286" /> The failure of building societies to attract adequate investment is having serious repercussions in the industry and especially among those involved in the construction of private dwellings.</P>
    <P>As we know now, many builders are left with completed houses on their hands because intending purchasers have failed to obtain the necessary loans.  Naturally in such a climate builders are reluctant to proceed with any expansion in their output and inevitably most builders are now cutting back on housing starts.  Builders who accepted the Government's commitment to achieving an output this year of 25,000 houses expected, as they were entitled to expect, that the necessary finance would be forthcoming to achieve the target set.  A couple of days ago the Minister for Local Government announced that £9 million more would be made available for local authority housing.  There is no mention of anything in respect of housing provided by the building societies.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the £9 million would be available from savings in other Government Departments.  He did not specify where these savings would be made.  But even if this money is to be made available to local authorities it will not be usable by them because the maximum local authority loan is £4,500 while the average price of a new house, in the Dublin area and in other areas also, is £8,500.  Therefore, these loans will not solve the problem because they leave too large an amount to be made up by the applicant&mdash;as much as £4,000&mdash;and we know that those who build houses in this category are not people who would have that kind of money available to them.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that steps taken so far will not ease the situation and that unless positive steps are taken to ensure an adequate amount for home loans the industry can be thrown into the blackest depression experienced by it since 1957.  That can happen within months.  It is happening already to a small extent in many areas.  Hundreds of building workers have been laid off. A serious problem faces builders' providers who, in the light of the Government commitment to a target of 25,000 new houses, stocked up with supplies <Col N="2287" /> which they cannot now distribute.  Unless some definite action is taken by the Government within the next week or so&mdash;I am not referring to the type of action announced by the Minister for Local Government&mdash;many more workers in the industry will be laid off before the holiday season commences.</P>
    <P>Approximately 80,000 are employed in the construction industry and about 25,000 of these are engaged in house building, and it is this latter group who will be the first to feel the pinch. If the rot sets in there, all other workers in the industry will be affected.</P>
    <P>Within the past couple of days in this House, the Labour Party Whip, Deputy Desmond, has said that it is Fianna Fáil who are endeavouring to create a housing scare.  Fianna Fáil have their own means of ascertaining facts, but it is not necessary for us to do a great deal of research into the industry when we hear from those involved directly that there is a grave housing crisis, a crisis which apparently, the Minister for Local Government has not heard of or, which, if he has heard of is something with which he has not come to grips.</P>
    <P>The report of the Economic and Social Research Institute says that, while 1973 appears to have been a specially favourable year for the building and construction industry, the difficulties faced by home buyers in obtaining finance in 1973 which led to a sharp divergence between houses completed and houses purchased in that year, have now worked through to new housing starts in 1974 and that it seems likely that this will be reflected in a reduction in houses completed during the year.  Here again is an example of the grandiose and flamboyant promises of the Government.  It looks now as if their target of 25,000 new houses is incapable of being reached.  The same can be said of most of the other Government promises.</P>
    <P>It is idle for the Government to try to assert, as the Taoiseach has done again today in his speech, that a record number of houses were completed this year.  It is idle for the Taoiseach to imply, as he has done on <Col N="2288" /> many other fortuitous occasions for his Government, that they can claim credit for this achievement.  We all known that there is at least a three to four year cycle between the start and the completion of a new house because of the time involved in such matters as the examination of title, negotiation of loan and the physical start in the building process.  Therefore, if a record number of houses are built this year, the Coalition Government cannot claim the credit, but if the indications that have been given by those involved in the industry and by the Economic and Social Research Institute are correct, and I have no doubt that they are, the Government will have to take the blame for the downturn in house building that seems to have set in now.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred briefly to the Northern Ireland situation and I intend to refer to this question only briefly, also.  We need a clear re-definition of our relationship with the North.  In his speech the Taoiseach said that so far as the Government were concerned, the lines of policy are clear.  I wish to tell the Taoiseach that, so far as we in Fianna Fáil are concerned, the Government's lines of policy are not clear, and it is for that reason that we need a clear re-definition of our relation with the North and of what is policy in connection with that problem.  We are suffering from a surfeit of Government spokesmen speaking with varying nuances on the need to keep our mouths shut on the subject of reunification.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in particular, has said that unity is simply not obtainable in present circumstances or in the foreseeable future and that, therefore, it is not a practicable goal.  Lest any Minister should like to suggest that this statement has been taken out of context&mdash;and such a suggestion was made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;I have here a script of the recording of the Minister's interview on Radio Éireann from which that statement was taken.  There is no question of this statement being taken out of context or of its being capable of being taken out of context although, <Col N="2289" /> a week after that interview had taken place, the Minister for Foreign Affairs went on the air to make such assertion. Far from being taken out of context the fact that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs even held the aspiration of unity was only drawn from him reluctantly and in a qualified sense and he repeated that he did not regard unity as a practicable goal.  We know that it is Government policy, as it has always been Fianna Fáil policy, to bring about peace and reconciliation. It is very important that this should be highlighted.  Indeed, the Taoiseach highlighted it today.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to make the aspiration towards the reunification of the country a party issue and I hope that never again will it become a party issue.  However the responsibility of ensuring this rests mainly on the Taoiseach and the Government generally. It is not sufficient for the Taoiseach to point out that the general tenor of Government statements on the Northern situation is towards the national aspiration we all cherish, when a member of the Government makes specific statements that are deliberately divisive of the unified approach towards the Northern problem which has been established in recent years.  The statements should be specifically repudiated as not representing Government policy if that is the case.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Taoiseach will reply to this debate but I hope whoever is replying, or the Ministers who may speak in this debate, will deal with the specific issues some of which I have raised and others that will be mentioned by my colleagues in the course of the debate.  The Government should tell the people what they are doing with regard to hardship and economic depression to ensure that there is some hope that the country will emerge in the not too distant future from the kind of depression now being created.</P>
    <P>All of us have experience of situations like this being allowed to drift, when decisions, however unpalatable, are not taken in time and ultimately the crunch coming at a time when perhaps the country can least afford having <Col N="2290" /> to face up to these decisions and their consequences.  The Government are not doing this.  I would ask them to face up to the realities of the situation and to stop substituting solid performance by a well-orchestrated public relations exercise.  Indeed, the discords of that orchestration have begun to jar on the ears of the public.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, the only remedy is to take courageous decisions. If the only courageous decision the Government can take is to go to the country and have a general election, contrary to what some commentators seem to suggest, Fianna Fáil are ready, willing and able to take on that situation. We are ready, willing and able to take on any issue or a combination of issues that must inevitably predominate in the next election.  Above all, as we have done before, we are ready, willing and able on behalf of the people to tackle in a serious and realistic way the economic and other problems from which this Government appear to be continually running away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention in this debate is not for the purpose of making the kind of speech one makes in introducing a departmental Estimate and, in common with the other Deputies, I speak after an all-night session of Dáil Éireann.  It is difficult to avoid some elements of a departmental speech on this occasion but I am conscious of the fact that the presentation of the Estimates for my Department will provide later this year an opportunity for a fuller debate.  Therefore, I do not propose now to enter into too much detail on matters that will be taken up shortly.  However, there are some points on which I wish to make my position clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to the House last October, the broad lines of my educational policy are firmly based on the main objectives set out in my statement of intent published by the National Coalition before the general election.  These are first, to introduce genuine consultations with parents, school authorities, teachers and students; secondly, to transfer to an independent educational body authority <Col N="2291" /> for examinations and courses; thirdly, to see to it that the policy of selective compulsion which has proved so disastrous for the Irish language in the last 50 years be replaced by a genuine policy based on respect for and promotion of the Irish language and culture.</P>
    <P>I should like to dwell a little on the first of these objectives&mdash;the introduction of genuine consultation&mdash;because the implications of the change of policy in this area do not seem to be sufficiently appreciated.  It was generally understood there was goodwill in principle for many of the changes proposed. However what troubled us was the attitude of confrontation adopted in implementing those policies and the lack of sensitivity to genuine local community hesitations which characterised that approach.  I have been endeavouring since taking office not just to improve the position in that respect but, in fact, to restore morale which was badly shaken on many sides.</P>
    <P>In the last year I have had ample confirmation of my original expectation that this would be no easy task.  It is essentially a slow process and a less showy one than trying to over-ride local wishes and aspirations.  Although it is more rewarding in the long run, the shifts of emphasis necessary during the slower pace can give rise to misunderstandings. I should like to cite one example in particular.</P>
    <P>In the matter of community schools, the impression was given&mdash;whether consciously intended or not it had been very deeply ingrained in many quarters&mdash;that there was to be only one pattern for the future, namely, the community school, irrespective of any other wishes.  When I faced the task of correcting this impression I found myself the target of the unworthy suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition. I quote from the debate on Northern Ireland, from column 1590 of the Official Report dated 26th June, 1974, when he said:</P>
    <P>... The present Minister for Education seems to have pulled back from the purpose and concept of community schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2292" /> He also added the interesting invitation:</P>
    <P>I think it would be interesting to hear some of his Government colleagues, who I am sure would support me in what I suggest, comment on the action now being taken, or rather the lack of action, by the Minister for Education in this sphere.</P>
    <P>I leave that invitation without comment. There is no foundation whatever for this charge.  I told the House in October last year that there were then 12 community schools in operation and that negotiations were in progress for the establishment of others in a number of centres.  I had also expressed my appreciation of the value of the contribution such schools can make, particularly in the area of adult education, where there is general agreement to their establishment.  I told the House in February of this year that three further community schools are under construction and that 12 more had been agreed upon but were not yet under construction.  Notwithstanding all this I find Deputy Wilson in his contribution to the Supplementary Estimate debate on the University of Florence and on the National Museum and Library last evening echoing his leader's baseless suggestion and asking me to unfreeze the financing of community schools.  I find it difficult to understand this perversity.</P>
    <P>One of my reasons for mentioning this matter today is that it involves a piece of reality which tends to be overlooked.  The degree of State financing in community schools is very great and the cost of building and equipment have risen enormously. The running of community schools is also an expensive matter, far more expensive in fact than was made clear by their more committed protagonists, or perhaps being charitable, than was anticipated by them. Traditional sources of secondary school provision were in any case becoming inadequate for the burdens they were bearing but it should be recognised that over-emphasis on the State commitment does tend to make the operation of community schools more expensive by discouraging very <Col N="2293" /> valuable voluntary local assistance.  It has become traditional to pay tribute to the extent of the voluntary aid to education in Ireland, particularly at second level, but it is now being borne in upon us as never before how much of a hard fact of economic life we would have to face without that aid.  I, for one, will do my utmost to retain that aid and to preserve as far as possible the morale of those who mainly provide it.  This is one of the reasons why I am not prepared to be doctrinaire in my approach to school organisation and re-organisation.  I feel that in difficult times we have need of all the resources we can possibly call upon and that we neglect at our peril sources which have been incredibly generous in the past.</P>
    <P>I am speaking for the moment almost purely in economic terms.  This is because I find myself as a Minister for Education seemingly headed for more difficult times.  In common with other countries, we in Ireland have undertaken enormous educational commitments&mdash;and rightly so.  There is, of course, much more to be done. But some of the glamour has worn off investment in education.  We, in educational ministries still recognise its importance.  But other very pressing priorities are developing an urgency that cannot be denied.  The problem in the immediate future for me, as for my colleagues in other countries, is to try to retain the impetus we have gained rather than make any spectacular advance in our share of the public purse.  We must, therefore, see to it that we get the very best value out of the resources we can command and endeavour also, where possible, to improve productivity.</P>
    <P>There are, however, terms other than the purely economic which are no less practical and, perhaps, in many ways more important.  There are values enshrined in our traditional approaches to the educational process which should not be sacrificed for the sake of rationalisation or other equally desirable objectives.  Our aim should rather be to refine these values and enable them to permeate our newer structures.  Let us innovate <Col N="2294" /> certainly but let us not rush off after concepts such as &ldquo;integration&rdquo; as ends in themselves, particularly when they have no meaning whatever over the great bulk of our particular field of operations.</P>
    <P>My desire as Minister for Education has been, and will continue to be, to develop harmony, co-operation and mutual understanding amongst all those connected with our schools and colleges at all levels&mdash;parents, teachers, managers, officials and the community in general&mdash;and to ensure that all will recognise that the educational interests of the children and young persons will be by far the most important, if not, indeed, the sole consideration by which they will measure the worth and merits of any proposals with regard to the educational system in general or to a particular problem in an individual school.  I hope to realise this desire through constant consultation and exchange of views.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that one must avoid the danger of allowing discussion to become a substitute for action rather than a preparation for it.  Lest, however, there might be any misunderstanding on this score I feel it is useful to refer at this point&mdash;without going into detail&mdash;to some of the positive things which have been accomplished in the relatively brief period since I took up office.</P>
    <P>In the area of education our aim is to encourage the fullest participation of all interested in the formulation and promotion of educational policy.  It is in this context that I initiated discussions with various educational interests in relation to proposals for regionalisation which envisage greater local involvement in educational matters and that I recommended appropriate arrangements for wider participation in the management of schools.  I will refer to that a little more fully later.</P>
    <P>Furthermore in the course of my address to the annual congress of the Irish vocational teachers at Westport on 28th May I proposed that vocational education committees should consider exercising the powers vested in them under the Vocational Education Act, 1930 to establish sub-commitees to act as boards of management <Col N="2295" /> of vocational schools.  Within the last few weeks I have sent a circular to the chief executive officers of the committees inviting the committees to set up such sub-committees and I have suggested the composition procedure and functions which might be considered appropriate to the sub-committees as boards of management.</P>
    <P>It might also be helpful to remember in this context that in the period of my tenure of office as Minister for Education we have had in County Wexford a dispute which has lasted over a number of years but which was settled earlier this year after a public inquiry by a solution based largely on the boards of management suggestion to which I am now referring.</P>
    <P>The teachers in that area withdrew their services from all of the vocational schools in the county imposing severe hardship on the pupils.  A public inquiry was held in February and the teachers continued to withhold their services until the end of March.  I am glad that an initiative on the part of the Department of Education brought about an amicable settlement which has seen to it that the schools were re-opened and that the pupils received tuition until the end of the school year.</P>
    <P>An expansion of educational facilities at second level is being developed on the basis of full educational opportunity for all through co-operation between schools and the maximum use of resources.  Schools of different traditions and specialities are being urged to develop their complementary roles and functions in harmonious and mutually advantageous relationships. In this connection, I refer later to my suggestion, which is commonly known as the Thurles experiment or more correctly, combined secondary schools proposal.  It was this concern for balanced development in the educational system at third level that has led to our support for the regional technical colleges, which were brought in under previous administration, and our support for the higher institute the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick and the technological colleges in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The courses in these colleges, as we <Col N="2296" /> know, should complement those course in the universities and to an increasing extent meet the need of students seeking qualifications for employment in a wide variety of occupations.  I am at present actively engaged in deciding the whole future of third level education and until I am in a position to put the final proposals to the country I think I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fundamental role which the primary school plays in our educational system and, in particular, its significance for the children of less well off families.  I am aiming, as indeed I know were my predecessors, at a pupil teacher ratio of one to 30 in national schools.  I am glad to be able to record a significant advance in this regard in 1973-74 with the injection of 380 new teachers into our larger schools.  These measures have brought about a very desirable reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio and I think this is to be welcomed by all Deputies. The reduction which I made in July, 1973 resulted in the appointment of additional teachers in schools having teaching staff of nine teachers or more.  From the 1st of July, 1974 I have given the benefits of these proposals to schools in the four to eight teacher range.</P>
    <P>The educational merits of these decisions are so obvious as not to require any elaboration.  The augmentation and improvement in the numbers of the teaching force were 150 in 1973-74 and 200 in 1974-75.  It should be remembered that this is in addition to the normal increase in the number of teachers consequent on the growth of the primary school population.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I am very conscious of is the need for remedial teachers.  The sanction for remedial teachers additional to the number of teachers warranted in the normal staff is steadily increasing.  In the year commencing 1st July 1974 there will be 150 teachers sanctioned for remedial work in schools in which the need for such teachers is greatest.  Another matter which has engaged our attention, and which is very important, is the area of in-service training.  In-service training for national teachers has been almost entirely on summer <Col N="2297" /> educational courses organised by my Department, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and by other institutions approved by my Department. The extent to which teachers availed themselves of these courses is impressive and I think due recognition must be given to this profession which avails itself to the extent in the current year of 50 per cent to 60 per cent of national teachers having enrolled for the vocational courses.</P>
    <P>An obstacle to the development of in-service training has been the absence of any provision for the appointment, recognition and payment of part-time teachers who would serve in place of teachers who might be released from school duties for portion of the school day in order to attend courses.  I shall be announcing shortly the details of a scheme under which suitably qualified persons may be appointed and paid on a part-time basis in place of teachers who are attending in-service training courses.</P>
    <P>One of the earlier decisions which I made as Minister for Education was the undertaking which I gave on taking up office that it was my intention to extend as from this year, 1974, the teacher training course from two to three years and to provide for the taking of a university degree at the end of the course.  The three-year course comes into operation as from October next and the different training colleges are well on the way to completing arrangements with the several university institutions for the award of a degree.</P>
    <P>Another matter in this area which has had my attention in the area of teacher education is the proposal which was put up by the Higher Education Authority in their report on teacher education.  In October, 1973, having regard to those proposals, I set up an <i>ad hoc</i> planning committee to advise me and to make recommendations in regard to the setting up of a body which would have functions in the area of first and second level teacher education and teacher registration. This committee carried out a most thorough and expeditious examination of the whole question.  The results of <Col N="2298" /> its deliberations were presented to me early last May in a very comprehensive report which proposed the setting up of a statutory body to be known as An Chomhairle Mhúinteoireachta. I arranged for copies of this report to be circulated on a confidential basis to major teacher organisations, teacher educational institutions and other appropriate educational associations in order to obtain their views as a matter of urgency.  I have already received the observations of a number of these bodies in the matter and I am looking forward to hearing from the remainder in the very near future, as I believe these observations will be both valuable and helpful to me.  As soon as I have received these and have had an opportunity of considering them I hope to arrange for an early meeting of the interested parties in order to discuss the implementation of the committee's recommendations.</P>
    <P>As is widely known, three months after taking up office as Minister for Education I had proposals put before the managers of the primary system in regard to a revision and an extension of the school management system to include parent representation on management committees. These discussions are well advanced and there is every reason to hope that a revised management system, which will be acceptable to all the interests involved, will provide improved educational advantages for the children and these proposals will evolve in the coming months.</P>
    <P>It is the custom of the Department of Education to review regulations governing the appointment of vocational teachers from time to time but this year I have had undertaken a far more comprehensive review under which every paragraph of the rules came under the spotlight.  This was a very detailed undertaking, involving consultation by the Department with the main bodies concerned with vocational education, namely the Irish Vocational Education Association, the Chief Executive Officers' Association and the Teachers' Union of Ireland.  The revised regulations are now in the final drafting stages and the result will be published before the <Col N="2299" /> commencement of the next school session.  Our desire here is to co-ordinate regulations for vocational schools and those for secondary schools particularly in the context of our proposals on regionalisation.  While this is important it cannot be rushed because there are legal, contractual and psychological difficulties to be overcome as Deputies will appreciate.</P>
    <P>I have also extended the teacher quota in secondary schools to provide for remedial education where circumstances warrant an extension.  I have given increased representation to the Association of Secondary Teachers (Ireland) on the Registration Council and I have also given, for the first time, representation to the Teachers' Union of Ireland.  While my predecessor had signed pension schemes I actually introduced them in the Dáil and Seanad to provide pensions for comprehensive school teachers, mobility between national, secondary and comprehensive schoolteaching and to remove certain long standing associations.  We have initiated an amended pension scheme which is now at the draft stage to provide general mobility between the teaching and the public services and to provide pensions for community school teachers.</P>
    <P>One of the first actions I took was to remove the necessity to pass in Irish as a condition for the award of the intermediate, group and leaving certificates.  When I announced that it had been decided to do this I felt I had the approval of the House and the country and the decision, I believe, has contributed to the creation of more positive and favourable attitudes to the Irish language among parents and children who were previously somewhat inhibited by the sword of Damocles of examination failure. This is shown by the increase in the number of pupils attending the Gaeltacht this summer where there is an increase of about 30 per cent.  I pay tribute to those who run summer colleges for their efforts but if the Irish language had suffered a downturn in popularity, even their worthy and increased efforts would not have met <Col N="2300" /> with success.  I am very glad to see this success and will do all I can to augment it, if possible.</P>
    <P>As an incentive to pupils to study Irish in an intensive manner and to a high standard I amended the relevant examination regulations so that the leaving certificate would be awarded to candidates who obtained grade D or a higher grade in at least five subjects or in four subjects including Irish from the approved list of subjects.  This was greeted with dismay by some pessimistic people. Some Deputies thought that the study of Irish to a high level would have been interfered with by my decision. The House should know that the total number taking higher level papers in Irish in 1974 at 8,781 showed an increase of over 10 per cent on 1973, when the number was 7,954.  Facts and figures speak and the number of pupils taking higher level papers shows that the subject is being studied at a high level.</P>
    <P>At this stage I also announced that I proposed to introduce a new subject, Irish Studies, into the secondary schools' curriculum.  A departmental working party is engaged at present in drawing up a draft course on which the syllabus will be based.  The proposals are at an advanced stage and will be introduced first at junior secondary level and later at higher level.</P>
    <P>On 14th May, 1973 vocational education committees were informed that additional money would be provided in the school year 1973-74 for the allocation of an increased number of new scholarships to the regional technical colleges.  The extra money provided for that school year was £180,000.</P>
    <P>In addition committees were advised that the value of the regional college scholarships could be increased to bring them into line with the value of the higher education grants.  I have affected some changes in regard to these grants as follows: Students who are awarded grants may defer taking up these grants for a period not exceeding two years. Prior to 1973-74 candidates were required to pass the leaving certificate in any one year.  Now, candidates may pass the leaving certificate and obtain <Col N="2301" /> the four honours in separate years. Prior to 1973-74 honours in mathematics counted as two honours for the purposes of higher education grants. Now honours in either mathematics or Irish counts as two honours: the concession or incentive now applies to Irish also.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most fundamental administrative change that I have suggested while I have been Minister for Education has been the regionalisation of the educational system.  Again, I was acting in conformity with our undertaking to consult when I put proposals before a number of teaching managerial organisations, 17 in all.  I want to put on record the names of these organisations to show that when we say consultation we mean consultation; the Irish National Teachers Organisation, Teachers Union of Ireland, the Association of Post Primary Teachers in Ireland, the Irish Vocational Education Association, the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, the Chief Executive Officers' Association, Catholic Headmasters' Association, Teaching Brothers' Association, Conference of Convent Secondary Schools, Church of Ireland Lay Secondary Schools Joint Managerial Body, Catholic Clerical Managers' Association, Conference of Convent Primary Schools, Irish Headmasters' Association, the then Irish Headmistresses' Association, Protestant Headmasters' Association, Federation of Catholic Lay Secondary Schools.</P>
    <P>In putting these proposals, I, as Minister for Education felt I was reflecting the policy of both parties in the National Coalition Government. The Fine Gael Party in its document <i>Planning a Just Society</i> in 1965 and <i>Towards a Just Society</i> in 1969 made the following statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We accept the principle of subsidiary function and believe that it is wrong for a larger and higher organisation to arrogate to itself functions which can be performed efficiently by lower societies and in our plans for reform we will be guided at all times by this principle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Labour Party document on education produced in 1969 in Section 36 <Col N="2302" /> states: that the general level will be guided by regional educational authorities.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore in the main stream of thinking of these two parties in putting forward these proposals.  We all know why such proposals are desirable. For historical reasons the administration of the educational system in Ireland has developed on a highly centralised basis.  Primary, secondary and vocational systems have come into being at different points in time, established on a pragmatic basis by the society of that time.  The Department of Education on behalf of the Minister exercises detailed day-to-day control over a considerable area of the educational system.  It is in direct contact with thousands of schools and their managers.  It undertakes considerable executive functions in relation to the personnel work of teachers, payment of salaries, conduct of examinations and the day-to-day administration of schools, by tradition and practice going back to the establishment in the last century of primary and secondary education and in the case of vocational education, to 1930 and the passing of the Vocational Education Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister through his Department has to give a considerable number of individual sanctions for specific actions by managers, teachers and committees.  The growth in the past decade of the complexity and diversity of educational institutions and services has put an intolerable strain on the capacity of the Department.  I mention in this context community schools which are increasing in number and in detail of administration and also the regional technical colleges and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to a proposal which I made at the end of last year about the Thurles combined schools. I want to correct a false impression which seems to be abroad that there was proposed for this area a community school.  There was not.  Therefore, those who alleged that in some way or other the Minister for Education is watering down the concept&mdash; I think that is the phrase used by one individual&mdash;have got it completely wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2303" /> The Minister has taken two separate schools which had indicated earlier their ideas in this matter.  The suggestion is to place them on a single site where they could co-operate for the better education of the children of the area.  The proposals were basically that the school run by the Christian Brothers and the school run by the vocational education committee should have separate schools for an agreed range of subjects on a single location, each one to own the site and premises of its school.  The schools would be physically linked to a shared block of specialist facilities.  This shared block was to be the property of the Minister for Education.  The Christian Brothers would receive a more favourable grant towards the erection of this school than would normally be given to secondary schools&mdash;80 per cent instead of 70 per cent, and a loan of 20 per cent instead of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>There would be separate boards of management in each of these schools and four nominees of the conductors of the school and two nominees of the Minister, who would be parents.  The board of management of the vocational school would be a sub-committee under article 21 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  The State aid towards the running of the Brothers' school would be in accordance with the recognised aid to secondary schools.  The financing of the vocational school would be in accordance with the provisions of the Vocational Act, 1930. There would be the closest possible co-operation between the two schools so that there would be available to all the pupils a broadly-based, balanced and varied curriculum.  I consider that the educational advantage of such an association of schools on the basis of shared facilities of staff and other resources, as against the provision of schools operating entirely independent of one another, are impressive. Killarney has now agreed in recent times to this proposal.</P>
    <P>Such an arrangement would, while achieving the desirable objective of ensuring the optimum use of expensive facilities&mdash;the duplication of which in separate schools would be avoided&mdash; enable the shared area to serve as a <Col N="2304" /> unifying element which would generate a sense of unity of purpose between schools which have traditionally seen themselves and have been looked upon by pupils and parents as distinctly separate institutions with different emphases and objectives.  Time does not permit me to go into further detail on that matter.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to another proposal which I made to the Teachers' Union of Ireland, which was a proposal that between the intermediate certificate course and the leaving certificate course there would be what has properly become to be known as a free year in which the children could be taken off the academic treadmill and given some time to look at themselves as persons and to develop their total personalities.</P>
    <P>I suggested that subjects like logic, philosophy, psychology, media criticism, appreciation of music and art, religion and other suitable subjects could usefully be put on this course for these children.  I am glad to tell the House that a number of schools have taken up this suggestion.  From the beginning of next year they will be undertaking experiments and trying out the idea.  I would like to quote from the <i>Education Times</i> of 18th July, 1974 where a headmaster in Northern Ireland said in regard to this plan that it would seem to be &ldquo;a teacher's dream&rdquo;.  It reads:</P>
    <P>It asks the young person to lay aside, for a year at least, the hitherto inexorable commitment to the race for marketable qualifications.  During this year he will develop himself emotionally and aesthetically, while discovering for himself the stark realities of the world he is preparing to enter.</P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals, nevertheless, deserve to be treated with respect, if only for their conception of a community where every child will have access to the best influences of a liberal education.</P>
    <P>In the final paragraph he says:</P>
    <P>Against him (the Minister) will be the hitherto unquenchable demand <Col N="2305" /> for marketable qualifications and the scepticism of a profession which has always been geared to meeting this demand.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the subject of media criticism which I mentioned in April to the Teachers' Union of Ireland meeting.  This is a very important subject.  I have included it on the suggested curriculum for a number of reasons.  We all know that those who work in the media are in a most important position in society.  Depending on the medium they are working in, they are trying to satisfy and at times create a demand for their product.  I am thinking particularly of television. It is time our pupils were given some tuition to enable them to achieve discriminiating taste and to demand quality from the various media which are pouring out the news and comment day by day.</P>
    <P>If the schools are responsible for inculcating a sense of the importance of the truth they should realise that education in the use of media is vital to the complete fulfilment of this task. I would assert that education in the use of media would fit into those other elements of the curriculum I have just outlined which are designed to make our pupils constructively critical. Media education should include a study of how news is collected and transmitted.  I saw recently an excellent one-day course at the Communications Centre.  A whole class spent the day compiling a news programme. Pupils were separated into different roles such as interviewer, interviewee, editor, newscaster and so on.  The day's news was examined.  Pupils were brought through a progress of choice, selection, omission and interpretation. This experience led them to an appreciation of the pressures of bias, and prejudice and they are only two of the forces at work which have to be counteracted by those working in this area.</P>
    <P>I can see pupils benefiting from a similar exercise in other media forms. A skilful teacher reading leading articles, feature articles and others, could scrutinise them and his pupils would emerge with a heightened critical sense and perhaps also with an <Col N="2306" /> understanding of the pressures which every good communicator must withstand if he is to continue to earn the high regard of the public.  As was pointed out at the annual meeting of the Irish Vocational Education Association, at Westport, as Socrates has put it, the communicator and the media are the gadfly of democracy. A critical and sound relationship between the public and the media is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that the two things which I did at the beginning of my term as Minister, the opening of Dún Chaoin school and the abolition of compulsory Irish, were symbolic.  The former act revitalised the spirit of a small community, the latter had a beneficial psychological impact on the general attitude towards the Irish language. Both acts were in recognition of a deeply felt spiritual and practical need and they were widely acclaimed as such.  It is my desire and intention to endeavour to continue to approach educational problems under that kind of inspiration.  I would hope to have the general support of the House to that end.</P>
    <P>However we may differ as to means, there should be no doubt as to our common interest in preserving those fundamental beliefs and aspirations which the Irish people have for long centuries striven to uphold and which they will not lightly throw to the winds of change.  It is our joint responsibility in this House to strengthen and foster the reality of this heritage.  It is our responsibility as representatives of the people.  It is we who are answerable to the people for this responsibility and we cannot allow ourselves to be deflected from courses which we think are clearly correct by commentators, who one day think they have the answers but may not have the cure for all our ills.  There is no universal cure-all.  I, as Minister for Education, will continue to pursue with your co-operation, as diligently and as conscientiously as I can the task entrusted to me of ensuring that our educational system at every level is adequate to the present and future needs of our country.</P>

      <P>Having heard the Minister for Education for the last 45 minutes, it is easier for me now to understand the present chaos which exists in the Government.  He spoke of his achievements for the last 12 months.  If he was a greyhound and that was his track record I have no doubt that he would be put down immediately.  He said that his first job was to restore confidence in his Department.  I respectfully suggest that before he restores confidence anywhere he should start with his own Coalition group.  Recently we heard what members of his political alliance had to say about the Minister for Education, and they were very blunt.  If the Minister is interested in restoring confidence let him take down the telephonic wall which he has put around the Department of Education.  He has turned the Department into a criminal-like institution where nobody can talk to any civil servant.  By doing this the Minister has shown that he has no confidence in any civil servant in his Department.  It is time to expose the humbug which the Minister has been preaching for the past 12 months. Before this debate is finished I hope the Fianna Fáil speakers on education will avail of this opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great pleasure for me to have an opportunity to participate in this Adjournment Debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate.  I strongly condemn the Government and the Taoiseach for their reluctance to facilitate the Opposition with this debate.  It is standard practice that an Adjournment Debate be provided at the end of a session so that those who are not happy with the Government progress or record will be given the opportunity to voice their constructive criticisms in this democratically-elected Parliament.  This is their right.  It is obvious that the Government, and the Taoiseach in particular, will be only too anxious for many reasons, to brush everything into their political carpetbags or hold-alls and disappear for the next two or three months.  These carpetbags and hold-alls are safely locked <Col N="2308" /> away and the keys are out of reach.</P>
    <P>Prior to the last General Election of February, 1973, and in the days immediately following, we were told many times by the Coalition Members that they believed in government through consultation, that they believed in open government.  This is a phrase which was used very often in the media. When in Opposition, Members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties made many promises of what they would do when they were in Government.  We all know that the pseudo-liberalism which we saw from the leading lights of the then Opposition, who are now in Government, has been put aside over night.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to speak for 45 minutes if he is allowed to do so by his own party.  Now that they are in Government we hear the same type of talk and the promise of Government by consultation being propounded by members of this Government.  We should ask the Taoiseach or any of the members of his Government who might be close to him&mdash;if any are&mdash;if we are to have government by consultation. If we are why did he try to have this session finished without an Adjournment Debate?  If consultation is to take place the Taoiseach and his supporters should realise that the Fianna Fáil Party have the support of practically half this country.</P>
      <P>If we are to have consultations the Taoiseach should respect the democratic institutions of this State.  He would like us to believe that he has great respect for this Parliament. Therefore, let him try to show his contempt for this institution by refusing, or hoping to refuse, a debate on the close of the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Taoiseach thinks that he will be forgiven for any contempt he might <Col N="2309" /> show this Parliament, I would like to assure him that he has another guess coming.  Everybody knows that the Coalition Government is on the verge of breaking up and on the road to economic disaster.  If the Taoiseach knows anything about keeping his Coalition Government together and hopes to avoid criticism of his failures by refusing us an Adjourment Debate, he is not the man I thought he was. He is not the manly type of person whom many thought him to be.  He is not the person who is as responsible as we would like our Taoiseach to be. I believe he has lost out in his role as Taoiseach.  He is not giving the leadership one expects or demands from a Taoiseach.  This has been seen very clearly in many ways in recent months, and more particularly in recent days.</P>
    <P>If he is to be captain of his ship, then let him be the captain.  If he is to be the leader of his team let him play the role of leader of this particular team, irrespective of how second-rate or third-rate it may be, because of all the odd-balls in it.  If he is to lead us on our way, let him do so immediately.  Up to this he has failed miserably in this regard and in every other way.  I will not go into any detail about the functions of this institution because I have not the time to do so.  Parliament can only be what we want it to be.  Parliament is not a magic word or a magic place.  It is only as good as we allow it to be.  Parliament can only be what we help it to be or what we want it to be.  If we contribute well in Parliament, Parliament will be respected for what it is meant to be by the people who elect and support it in every way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the latter part of the question first, a recent actuarial survey estimates that the capital cost, as at 31st December, 1972, of doubling civil service <i>ex gratia</i> pensions is £6,072,000.  A further £1,281,000 would be required to meet the contingent liability in respect of the future widows of pensioners who retired before 23rd July, 1968 and who are still alive.  This makes a total of £7,353,000. These figures refer only to the Civil Service, as no actuarial survey has been carried out in respect of the rest of the public service.  Extending a similar benefit to other branches of the public service such as Garda, national and secondary teachers, local <Col N="2314" /> authorities and Defence Forces would result in a considerable increase in costs and bring the total up to around £22 million.</P>
      <P>The pre-1968 widows proposed to pay for these increased pensions by adopting the contribution basis which applies to members of the contributory scheme.  However, there is obviously a considerable difference between the contributory scheme, which is based on the insurance principle, and the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme where the liabilities have already matured. Accordingly, the contribution basis of the contributory scheme would not meet the cost of the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme. The pre-1968 widows could only meet the cost of doubling their pensions by paying capital sums, varying according to age and the amount of pension, in order to secure annuities equivalent to the extra pensions.  The capital sums involved would in the majority of cases be considerably in excess of the contribution payable by an equivalent member of the contributory scheme.</P>

      <P>A breakdown of the determinations granted by reference to the various categories is as follows:&mdash; (a) a book or other writing 292; (b) a play 80; (c) a musical composition 19; (d) a painting or other like picture 118; (e) a sculpture 27.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Payments made under the farm retirement scheme consist of (a) the full market value of the lands; (b) a bonus of 10 per cent and; (c) an annual indemnity in the case of persons of 55 to 70 years of age.  The first two categories are payments of capital sums and are not chargeable to income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the third category the amounts of the annual payments made under the scheme are £600 in the case of a married person and £400 in the case of a single person.  As the corresponding tax-free allowances are <Col N="2316" /> £800 and £500 respectively it follows that, unless an individual had other income sufficient to bring his total income above his allowances he would not be liable to income tax on the annual indemnity.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the board have not received any complaints recently regarding inadequate voltage in the town of Rathdowney.  There were voltage problems late last year but these were eliminated by replacing the transformer supplying the town with a larger transformer.  Since then, as far as the board are aware, the position has been satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The board have made provision in their planning programme for the erection of a new 38 kw transformer station later this year to cater for future development in Rathdowney. This will ensure that an adequate electricity supply will continue to be available in the long term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few questions which, if the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to answer at the outset, will shorten considerably what I have to say.  For example, if the Parliamentary Secretary would let me know at this stage whether my interpretation of a particular recommendation is correct, there would be no need for me to say anything further in this regard.  I am not clear about the position of a private Member.  Do the proposed changes mean that a Member, in order to have rights of any worth, must belong to a group consisting of not fewer than seven Members?

      <P>I am labouring under the difficulty of not having got to bed for more than 30 hours and, more particularly, the difficulty that the Deputy has not referred me to the Order in question.  There is no question <Col N="2325" /> of cutting down the rights of Private Members.  From my recollection, the question of a group arises only in one particular context.  In that instance the group is defined as being seven Members of the House.  So far as the purposes of that Order are concerned, that is the force of the proposed amendment.</P>

      <P>My understanding of it is that the definition of a group is intended to accommodate Deputies who form a very small party or are individually non-aligned.  However, there must be not less than seven because otherwise they do not qualify as a group for the purpose of this Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is both necessary and kind to make it clear how I stand with regard to Deputy Blaney.  The Deputy's situation in the House is a difficult one; he has a point of view which represents a large number of people even though they are thinly scattered and the Rules of the House should accommodate him.  I do not wish to be fussy about the matter, but perhaps the Deputy might put in writing his objections and recommendations with regard to the Standing Orders.  I will make the best case I can at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his offer and I shall avail myself of it.  Judging by the contributions in the debate, it appears the House will accept the recommendations.  Is it possible there would be any change as a result of my representations if they were in conflict with the recommendations before us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only give the Deputy a purely personal assurance. Perhaps somebody else in my position would not do that, but personally I have sympathy for the Deputy's situation, even though I have no sympathy for most of his viewpoints.  I will do my best to accommodate him so far as any voice I have on the Committee is concerned. That is all I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I will comment only on a few matters that seem disturbing not merely because I am an Independent Member in the House.  No matter what group a Deputy belongs to, or whether he is attached to any group, he has equal rights so far as the business of the House and participation in that business is concerned. As a representative of many thousands of electors he is entitled to these rights.  This principle should be upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although Members may find it more <Col N="2327" /> accommodating to redraft Standing Orders in order to conform with the normal groupings in the House as we have known them during the years, nevertheless there are many Members in all parties who would not wish Standing Orders to curtail the rights of a Member because he does not belong to a party or to a group of six other Members.</P>
    <P>I would make the strongest possible plea that neither the House itself nor any Committee should be allowed to curtail the rights of any Deputy.  Every Deputy has equal rights which may not be diminished by the wish of a majority in the House, merely because he does not have the strength of a party.  A party can say to the Government: &ldquo;If you do not do it our way we will be most unco-operative&rdquo; and can usually bargain their way through.</P>
    <P>Something that has been a matter of contention here is the practice whereby a Minister makes a statement and only the Leader of the Opposition or a nominated member of the Opposition may make a reply.  Scarcely ever did all Members belong to the main Opposition party though they may not have belonged to the Government.  Such Members cannot be said to be represented by either a Minister or by the Leader or a nominated member of the Opposition.  This is something which should not be allowed to become a Standing Order.  By tradition it has come to be given the weight of a Standing Order.  This is wrong.  I think it was wrong in its application and that is no reflection on the Ceann Comhairle.  I do not believe that the review committee or the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which considered the original review committee's recommendations had the right, nor has this House the right, to say that statements may be made by a Member of the Government and replied to by the Leader or a nominated member of the Opposition, clearly implying that nobody else, no matter how much at variance with what is being said, has the right to express his views and put them on record.  This is gravely wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2328" /> The House should not copperfasten this recommendation and make into a Standing Order that which has already been a denial of the rights of individual Deputies unaligned in this House to speak for themselves. Indeed even a member of the Government party or the Opposition may, on a particular issue, find himself totally at variance with the statements being made by both the Minister and the member of the Opposition. Why should that right be denied even to a member of a party whether in Opposition or in Government? Why should it be implicit that if one does not belong to a party and is not represented by either the Leader of the Opposition or the Minister he is relegated to second class citizenship so far as membership of this House is concerned.  It is an entirely wrong approach.</P>
    <P>There was heretofore, though it was never used to my knowledge and it certainly was never abused, a provision whereby the making of statements by a Government Minister required the consent of the House.  In this way I contend it would have been possible for a independent, unaligned Member of the House to stand up and say: &ldquo;I do not agree that the Minister should be allowed to make a statement unless I am given the right to have some say after the Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have spoken.&rdquo;  That is, I understand, now being taken away.  While we had built up by precedent or tradition a practice whereby the consent of the House was necessary&mdash;I take it that meant the consent of those present in the House before a Minister might make a statement on any given issue, the right of any Member other than the Leader or a nominated member of the Opposition to speak was denied by the Chair.  However, I contend that the right of the independent, unaligned Member was still there to insist that he got his way because his consent was required before the Minister could make the statement.  As I interpret what is being proposed this will no longer obtain.  Therefore, something is being taken away that may seem extraordinary but, which I <Col N="2329" /> believe did exist and should have existed.  I do not recall it having been used and I can say with honesty, that it has never been abused.</P>
    <P>I would have contended that a private Member at any time if present in the House when a statement was sought to be made by a Minister could, if he so wished, object to it being made and his objection could be upheld.  That may be an erroneous interpretation on my part but I believe it to have been the situation. I understand those statements originated from perhaps the announcement of national loans.  Very obviously this would be followed by a statement from the Opposition benches wishing the loan well, recommending it to the public and giving it a good send-off from the House.  I think this is where it began.  It came to be the practice that a Minister made a statement with the unanimous approval of the House and that that statement could only be added to or replied to or contributed to by one other, and that obviously the Leader or a nominated member of the Opposition.  It excluded a single or half a dozen independents though they might totally disagree with everything that was said in the House and put on the record as apparently representing the views of the House.  They were denied the right to refute the views expressed and put their views on the record too.</P>
    <P>I feel most strongly about this.  I would put to the Parliamentary Secretary, through the Chair, my very strong plea in this matter.  This is a recommendation to make it a Standing Order for all time, beyond yea or nay, that nobody, other than the Leader or nominated member of the Opposition, has any right to speak.  Even that right, as I understand the recommendation, is watered down to the point where it would be at the discretion of the Chair.</P>
    <P>I am not again sure if that is the proper interpretation because between the cross-references from the review committee's report on numbers of recommendations, the Standing Orders themselves, plus the report which is before us I must say, whether it is after last night's long session or not I have found it rather confusing to know what <Col N="2330" /> is and is not really proposed to be adopted here.</P>
    <P>From what I listened to yesterday I am pretty sure that the position on this matter of statements by Ministers is on the lines I have indicated.  If that is so then I strenuously object to it.  I hold it is unfair, unjust and, in fact, misleading to have a situation where this House can, through the front bench of the Government of the day, make a statement and put it on record as representing a view, because there is no other contrary view voiced, or at the discretion of the Ceann Comhairle of the time, make a statement either confirming or in contradiction of the ministerial statement that may be put on the record side by side with it but no other view, apparently, will be given any credence whatsoever.  Therefore, I say it is unfair and misleading because naturally if only two voices speak, whether they are two points of view on which there may be a legitimate half dozen points of view in regard to some matter or other, they are of one mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but in fact my understanding of this proposed new Order is that it is intended to go some distance to meet the very point the Deputy is making, not to destroy the Deputy's rights but to go some distance to protect them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  I only hope that is so, but as I read it and as I try to interpret it it does not seem so to me.  As I said the cross-references from one document to another and on to the Standing Order numbers appear to me to show that whatever strength there was in the hands of the Independent has now been taken away and is put beyond a shadow of doubt, out of his reach to have any say in regard to a contrary view to that expressed by a ministerial statement which, as a result, could be said to be misleading.  It could be said that he was present and he did not disagree with it.  I am glad if the Parliamentary Secretary finds it is in some way the reverse of my interpretation.  If that is <Col N="2331" /> the case I will be very glad to hear him on it.  If it is not he might take another look at it and send it back to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who might do something about it.</P>
      <P>In the informal committee report on the reform of Dáil procedure, as I understand from the further report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, No. 21 is recommended for acceptance and probably will be accepted.  This has to do with the fixing of limits of time in debates on Estimates and Financial Resolutions and at a further stage it lays down the actual times and so forth.  If each Member of a large party has half an hour or an hour to speak&mdash;the intention is to try to put down a sort of filibuster in the House&mdash;this means that in a party of 50, if only six or eight Members speak, they give the full views of that party.  One cannot really disagree with cutting down filibustering in the House although it is such a time-worn practice I dislike seeing it ruled out entirely.  If one hour or half an hour is given to each speaker this may be more than enough for a party, because those who did not speak will know they have been truly represented in everything that has been said by their colleagues who spoke.  This is fair enough, but it is not sufficient for Independents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it does not mean the Deputy will exceed the time limit laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not unless I should consider a filibuster in order to try to get my way in relation to some of these things as this is possibly the last occasion on which it may be possible to even attempt it.  An individual, let it be one Independent or half a dozen Independents, gets one hour or half an hour each, even on a matter of grave importance, while they may have points of view widely different from others in large parties, although it could be said to be very just so far as time is concerned, I feel it is not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should give further consideration as to <Col N="2332" /> whether in fact an application of an equal amount of time to each individual Deputy, regardless of whether he is on his own or one of a party of 50, is fair.  Independents should be given consideration.  The point of view I hold might be given consideration although it might never need to be used by an Independent.  They could perhaps be given a bit more time than Members of parties who, when added up together, would have more hours than they required or wished to utilise.  I hope that aspect can be given some consideration as I regard it of some importance.</P>
    <P>One change that I understand is also being proposed is that the number of members who may call for a division is being raised from five to ten&mdash; recommendation No. 30 of the informal committee's report.  What is the reason behind this?  It does not often happen that the question of numbers arises and the doubling of the number from five to ten seems to suggest there is some very good reason for it.  I have been here with all sorts of mixtures over a quarter of a century and I have seen a large number of Independents, times when we had four or five parties in the House and I know of no reason to believe there was any abuse of calling for a vote merely because the number required, if the Ceann Comhairle required them to stand up, for a division numbered only five.  No case has emerged as to why the number should be doubled, as far as I know, and if no case can be made for it, why should the change be made?  If a change were to be made, why go from five to ten?  What is this intended to achieve or prevent in future when we have no evidence of any abuse at present or in the past arising from the Standing Order that up to now entitled any five Members to get a vote taken on any issue before the House?</P>
    <P>There is another group of amendments proposed by the whole Committee regarding the setting up of Special Committees, particularly for taking Committee Stages of Bills as I understand it.  That would be dealt with particularly by recommendations 14 and 15 of the report.  In regard to <Col N="2333" /> that and the further comment made the other day by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Kelly, in regard to Committees set up whether for the purpose of taking Committee Stages of Bills or, as was advocated here, to deal with particularly technical Bills, I would suggest that it should not depend on the decision of a majority of the House or a selection from the parties in the House as to what the composition of such a Committee should be.</P>
    <P>If there are to be Special Committees, involving a curtailment of size, as against a Committee of the whole House, to consider particular matters and they are expected to reach agreement and report back, having put the points of view of their respective parties, unless some provision is made if that practice were to grow there would be a further watering down and lessening of the rights of Members of the House, in particular of unaligned Members carrying no strength by way of party tag.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how this could be overcome.  It struck me that the one way in which this could be avoided if Committees were to be appointed from Government and Opposition parties as such, would be to give independent, unaligned Deputies the right to attend any such Committees and be heard in them if they wished. I do not know if there is any other way.  If you think in terms of expediency and representation and if you remember only that you are dealing with parties and not individual, elected Members regardless of party tag, you can and will, I think, lose sight of the principle that I uphold strenuously that each Deputy is as the other in regard to rights.  It is vital that this principle should be protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to have another look at the Special Committees or <Col N="2334" /> whatever they may be called.  Regard should be had to the manner in which non-aligned Members are to have their views represented on such Committees, bearing in mind that if such Members were to become members of all such Committees, this in itself would create a problem&mdash;they could not be in two or three places at one time which would, to an extent, curtail the usefulness of such Committees. I am not blind to the difficulties but I am convinced that some way of providing for the attendance at and membership of Special Committees for non-aligned Deputies is a right and not something one might plead for.  It is a principle that should not be denied merely because it is more convenient to do it the other way.  I know that is so, that if you had no non-aligned people and were dealing only with Whips you could make arrangements more readily.</P>
      <P>In response to the Parliamentary Secretary's earlier offer I shall not go into detail on many other matters as I might have done but I shall avail myself of his offer to communicate with him, giving my views on some other matters that are recommended and some that are not and which I might through him, put before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges now that we are trying to update, as has been the intention for the past two or three years, the Standing Orders of this House to make them more workable.</P>
      <P>Is there any means whereby last night's performance should not be capable of being repeated?  I am speaking about the performance or the scandalous exhibition that was the discussion on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  We have now passed the Bill at 9.15 a.m. this morning.  That exercise was totally and absolutely unnecessary as was the manner in which it was carried out.  Even if it were necessary by virtue of the time that we have had over the last month or so which we could have used usefully on the Bill there was plenty of time next week, or next month, to go through the details.</P>

We had a protracted discussion throughout the night and there was far from sufficient time to discuss every ramification of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Am I not in order while discussing the proposals of the Committee in regard to Standing Orders to do as others have done and discuss what they would not recommend? I am not talking about the Finance Bill.  I am merely instancing the situation as regards the Finance Bill as one that should not be capable of happening merely at the whim of one, two or three of the Whips.  It should be a matter of gravest importance and of a critical nature which would lead to such a night.  You, a Cheann Comhairle, as custodian of the general behaviour of the House should be enshrined somewhere in the Standing Orders so as to ensure that this sort of thing does not happen unnecessarily or for the wrong reasons in the future. I say that with all due regard to everybody. I will say no more about it but it should be considered very thoroughly.  It is not a good operation nor one which would commend itself to anybody, even though the Finance Bill has been got through at 9 a.m. this morning.  The Bill had to be put to the House without discussion.  I take your point, a Cheann Comhairle, about discussion of the Finance Bill. I have no intention of discussing it but I am merely using it as an example of what should not be allowed to happen.  I would commend this point to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges with a view to making a Standing Order to prevent such happenings in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we may have an opportunity in the near future of talking about further amendments to Standing Orders.  I would like to have discussed further details.  They have not received attention.  That is not really important at the moment.  The House is asked to consider the report before it and Deputies to give their views.  I have made some cross-references.  I am not represented on the reform committee, nor can I have my views expressed on that committee.  Nobody represents me on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but by various cross-references and perhaps as a <Col N="2337" /> result of last night's long session I may have got over my points.  On the other hand, I will take up the offer of the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is generous.  I take it to mean that I can and will convey my thoughts to him.  I will tell him my views in regard to Standing Orders.  There are three or four points which need special consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a considerable number of points in the report. I would like to comment favourably on the decision to limit speeches in this House.  The first time I spoke in this House I said that I never speak for very long.  I mentioned that nobody would buy television licences just to watch Question Time.  I have waited many times one-and-a-half hours to speak.  I remember waiting six-and-a-half hours on one occasion. I am not against any particular person. The speeches may be amusing and we may get &ldquo;crack&rdquo; from them but that is not doing the business we are paid to do.</P>
      <P>I have been in various organisations all my life.  We were always told that we should say as much as we can in as few words as possible.  Here the rule seems to be to speak as long as possible and say nothing.  I have been here only a short time and I have been disappointed.  People may say that I am &ldquo;cocky&rdquo; to be talking like this.  I am delighted that a limit on speeches is recommended.  Anyone who is not able to put his point of view before the House in 45 minutes, if that is the correct time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view what happened last night should never have happened when there is serious business to be considered. I am a member of a number of committees.  On one of those committees we had a very good chairman and after four hours' discussion he adjourned the meeting because he <Col N="2338" /> said that nobody could think clearly after four hours.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is the most important Bill to go through this House in the year.  There were various points I wanted to speak on in the early hours of this morning but I let the opportunities pass because I just did not have the energy to speak.  The Dáil met yesterday at 10.30 a.m. and adjourned this morning at 9.15.  I admire the Minister and the Fianna Fáil front bench for the way they discussed the Bill here last night, item by item.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Callanan said.  I may have left him under a misapprehension.  It is not now proposed that all speeches should be limited to 45 minutes.  This only refers to speeches in Estimate debates. In other words, there is no such proposal in regard to speeches on the Second Stage of a Bill or on a motion.</P>

      <P>This is a valuable restriction which will stop filibustering. I hope it will be recognised that filibustering on Estimates debates can be more advantageous to the Government than to the Opposition because it enables them to carry a debate through and pass the point at which a Vote might be taken at a time when it did not suit them.  I hope it will be recognised also that this rule, which the Government absolutely acquiesced in establishing, is one which deprives the Government of a certain measure of flexibility in suiting themselves in regard to the taking of Votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Callanan and Deputy Blaney referred to yesterday's late night sitting.  I do not want to be contentious or cantankerous, but it should be understood that it was agreed three weeks ago that the Second Stage of the Finance Bill would be taken on the day or days when it was taken and the remaining Stages would occupy a Tuesday and a long Wednesday sitting.  It was never envisaged that there would be any question of sitting all night.  That question arose when the progress was very slow on the Committee Stage of the debate.  Two hours were spent on <Col N="2340" /> the first amendment which was not nearly as important as some of the later material in the Bill.  It was because of the snail's pace at the beginning of the Committee Stage that the House was constrained to opt either between sitting into August or have an all night sitting.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Callanan and Deputy Blaney that this is not a satisfactory way of doing business.  I would like to call the attention of the House, and if it is not disorderly to do so, of the Press and the public, to the fact that the debate last night was unsatisfactory because the Opposition made a horse's collar of it.</P>

I <Col N="2341" /> will make the Opposition a present of the information that the section which dealt with the obligation on solicitors to make certain disclosures was a section on which some Members of the Government parties had strong feelings of an unfavourable kind.

When matters like this are raised, unless they are adequately dealt with from the Government side in reply the idea goes out that the Government, who are blamed for everything, are also to blame for this.</P>
      <P>The Government are not to blame for the fact that although something like 35 hours were spent on the Finance Bill, only one-third of it was properly discussed.  That was not the Government's fault&mdash;that time was recklessly squandered on the earlier sections of the Bill and the later sections, of which I have just given an instance, were not reached at all.  For example, the section about which Deputy O'Malley has promised he is going to break the law&mdash;the section which he has publicy promised to disobey&mdash;was not even reached.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal briefly with some other matters raised by Deputy Blaney and by Deputy <Col N="2343" /> O'Malley yesterday.  Deputy Blaney said that he hoped membership of Special Committees would include unaligned Members or, in other words &mdash;and I hope I am not doing him an injustice if I interpret him as meaning that&mdash;if such Committees are formed he would have a chance to serve on them.  The relevant Standing Order is No. 73; Special Committees are appointed by the Committee of Selection. I have no doubt that the Committee of Selection would take into account the fact that there are two Independent Deputies in the House and that if either of those Deputies made strong representation that he wished to take part in the work of a Special Committee, it would be considered with a completely open mind.  I do not know whether or not that satisfies Deputy Blaney but I completely sympathise with his situation.  I accept that it is a special situation; but there is nothing in what is before the House at the moment which would exclude the possibility of the Deputy being asked, invited, or, if he puts himself forward, being accepted for service on a Special Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the political organisational set-up that constitutes this House, has done and probably will do for some long time to come surely the realities of the situation are that an Independent Deputy has no likelihood of being put on any of these Committees and must go begging, cap in hand, saying: &ldquo;May I serve on this or that?&rdquo;  rather than as of right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to what Deputy Blaney has just said, may I take the example of the Special Committee on the Planning Bill which I mentioned when I was speaking here yesterday and which the Opposition&mdash;for reasons which seemed to them to be good&mdash;did not want to have.  If Deputy Blaney was interested in serving on such a committee I can see no reason in the wide world why he should not be given a place on it; none whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that there is <Col N="2344" /> no provision for such; that is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is no automatic provision for the inclusion of Independents but there is no automatic provision for any special inclusion of anyone.  If the Deputy looks at the Order, he will find that the composition of these Special Committees is left to the Committee of Selection and it does not say anything about the proportions in which places are to be awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about realities; not theories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I did not advert to this problem before. If the Deputy is worried about it and sees some solution to it in the shape of an amendment to the Order&mdash;and if he will put it in writing to me&mdash;I will bring it before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges next time it meets.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney inquired why the number of Deputies who may call a vote was being raised from five to ten.  Frankly, I must say I do not know the reason for that.  I am sorry to have to make such an admission to the House.  I must have been momentarily absent from the Committee while this Order was under discussion. But I take the reason to be to prevent the Opposition from just leaving a very small or nominal team behind and keeping a Government team there in full strength; in other words, something more than a merely nominal gesture is expected from an Opposition. I take that to be the sense of the proposed new Order&mdash;in order to justify the taking of a vote.  I may be wrong in that.  Perhaps Deputy Lalor knows more about it or remembers more about the discussion, in which case I should be glad to give way to him.  But I take that to be the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the length of Estimate speeches was raised also by Deputy Blaney.  Obviously he feels that a Deputy in the special position in which he is placed might not have enough time on certain Estimate debates if limited to 45 minutes.  All I <Col N="2345" /> can say in that respect is that if we legislate, in Standing Orders, for all individual Deputies, we will be in serious difficulty about getting work done expeditiously.  Again, taking the matter from the personal perspective of the Deputy, if a particular Estimate were to crop up on which the Deputy &mdash;for reasons of his political outlook or the people he represents, whether in his own constituency or elsewhere &mdash;felt he was not going to get a fair chance with three quarters of an hour, I, for one, would be very disposed to agree to vary the Order, by agreement of the House, so as to allow him an hour or an hour and a half.  I am completely open to the idea that a Deputy who, for reasons good or bad has put himself in a special position, is still a Deputy and deserves consideration. Perhaps the very special nature of his situation intensifies that merit.  I cannot really see how the Order could have been drafted in such a way as to make allowance for what Deputy Blaney wants without wrecking the purpose of the Order generally.  If the Deputy ever finds himself in the position of wishing to go beyond the three quarters of an hour mark, he will certainly not get opposition from this side of the House.  There would be no anxiety to closure him.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say in regard to Deputy Blaney's contribution is that his interventions here during ministerial statements or statements by the Taoiseach and the reply by Deputy J. Lynch, his attempts here in the teeth of the Ceann Comhairle's ruling to get in on a debate always woke a certain sympathy with me.  I do not suppose there is anybody in the House whose political views are farther away from Deputy Blaney's than are mine.  But he does represent, not only in his own constituency but elsewhere a thin, but nonetheless perceptible slice of people. I think it far better that he be allowed to speak his point of view in a decorous and seemly fashion in the House than that we should have these unseemly and indecorous shouting matches which are the rule whenever this matter comes up.  It was in order to give the Chair a discretion for this very purpose that the new Order has <Col N="2346" /> been drafted.  It may not be as obvious to the Deputy, but I understood the purpose of that Order to be two-fold: to prevent an individual Deputy from inhibiting a ministerial statement and reply on the one hand and, on the other, to give the Chair a larger discretion than it has, by convention, now in regard to admitting further statements. I hope that is how the Order will work.  Perhaps it is disorderly of me to express a view as to how the Chair ought to conduct itself and, if so, I hope I will be forgiven.  But I would be glad pensonally if the Order worked out in such a way that we had no more of these unseemly exchanges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have our views on how the Chair should go about its work.  I must thank the Parliamentary Secretary for making the ground for me because I have something to say on that before the day is out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad if we were to have no more of these unseemly shouting matches in which the Deputy becomes involved with the Chair and if something arises which involves a statement from the Taoiseach and one from Deputy Lynch, I would be glad that Deputy Blaney be given a reasonable opportunity of speaking his mind without having to do so amid the clanging of the bell.  That, I thought, was one of the purposes of this Order.</P>
      <P>I shall not comment on Deputy Desmond's remarks because to do so would be to rehash a series of ideas with which I am mainly in agreement but I would like to make a few remarks in reply to Deputy O'Malley's response to my opening statement in opposing the adoption of this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An unbiased eye, reading a report of what I said here yesterday, would not discern a particle of aggressiveness, of contentiousness or of party <Col N="2347" /> feeling; but no sooner had I sat down when, true to form, Deputy O'Malley made a contribution which, while being well argued and well thought out, was sneering and hostile in its tone.  Deputy O'Malley would appear to be a cradán who is unable to argue any point except in terms of the argument being a bitter assault on him. Nothing that I said here yesterday could have justified the tone in which he replied.  I am sure that that unfortunate aspect of his temperament creates difficulties for him in his dealings with his own party also.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went out of his way to ignore deliberately qualifications which I had made very carefully.  When mentioning the recommendation in regard to the greater use of Special Committees I did not suggest that the House should be buzzing with Special Committees sitting simultaneously.  Of course I take the Deputy's point that a small Parliament from which increasing numbers of Members are being absorbed in outside activities, such as the EEC, cannot service or man a large number of Committees, but I have never suggested that we should be all running around from one Committee to another.  All I did was to make the humble and reasonable suggestion that we might try out a committee system on a sample trial Bill.  My blood runs cold when I think of the nightmare that is ahead of us in the form of the Committee Stage of the Planning Bill when we shall have the Minister for Local Government here and Deputy Molloy on the other side dealing with 111 amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The original Act of 1963 absorbed three months of parliamentary time on Committee Stage, and might I add that there was no division involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I have not got the stomach for long drawn out Committee Stages.</P>
      <P>The reason why the Planning Bill has not been proceeded with since the conclusion of the Second Stage is because it is obvious that it would absorb so much of our time that we would get no other work done.  The list of legislation which the Taoiseach read out here six weeks ago and which Deputy Brennan commented would keep us here until September has been largely disposed of.  The responsible behaviour on the part of the Opposition has been helpful in that respect but no such progress would have been made had we been dealing with the Planning Bill.  I regret that it takes no more than a suggestion from me to turn on Deputy O'Malley's hostility glands, but I hope that the Planning Bill will be dealt with by a Special Committee so that the body of the House may be left free to proceed with other work.  However I would regret that that suggestion be turned down merely from a desire, which I thought I detected in Deputy O'Malley's attitude yesterday, not to agree with any suggestion emanating from me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to my suggestion to committing the Planning Bill to a Special Committee, Deputy O'Malley said that he considered this Bill to be totally unsuitable for such treatment. What is so unsuitable about it?  He said that the large number of Deputies who wished to contribute to it would not be facilitated by having a Committee in some hole or corner of the building where facilities would not be adequate.  I will make a simple suggestion. What is to stop that Committee <Col N="2351" /> meeting on Thursday mornings and sitting in the Seanad chamber? The Seanad do not often meet on Thursday mornings and the business done in this House on Thursday mornings is usually of a fairly somnolent kind.  There is no reason why a Special Committee, perhaps with 20 or 25 members&mdash;and with this number there would easily be room for Deputy Blaney&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Deputy's absence yesterday I was trying to explain to the House the ostensible objections to the Special Committee system.  Of course there are objections if the sitting hours of the Committee clash with contentious business in the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>When I suggested to Deputy Lalor that the Planning Bill might go to a Special Committee his reply was that a large number of Deputies were interested in it.  In fact, the number of Deputies who spoke on the Second Stage was 12 and I agree that is quite a substantial number for an average Bill.  I should imagine that at the maximum perhaps 25 Deputies might have been anxious to contribute to the Committee processing of the Planning Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lalor and his two colleagues are not doing themselves or their party any credit by laughing at what I am saying.  I appeal to the Deputy to give the system a chance, and I suggest this Bill should be sent to the Committee. What is the use of restricting the system to Bills dealing with company law reform or some similar topic?  How often do we have a company law Act? There was one seven years ago, but when will we have the next one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the use in making pious recommendations that more Bills should be sent to a Committee when <Col N="2352" /> Deputy O'Malley says we should send only Bills of a legal technical kind? The recommendation will be useless if it will only mean that.  I would urge Deputy Lalor to seriously consider this matter and to give the system a chance. If it is not a success, if we cannot get a quorum, if the Press pay no attention to it, or if Members who wish to contribute cannot get on to the Committee, then we will drop the idea.  At least we will be able to say we tried out the Special Committee on the Planning Bill but that it was a flop.  In a completely non-party way, I appeal to the Deputy about the matter and would ask him to see if he can persuade his front bench colleagues to agree.</P>
    <P>With regard to my ideas in connection with sitting hours, Deputy O'Malley threw scorn on what was said simply because it came from here.  In a bitter rhetorical question he asked if we were seriously suggesting that the House should be treated like an office, or that people here should be treated as though they were doing an office job.  What is wrong with an office job? What is so despicable or contemptible about office jobs or the hours worked in such jobs?  If the convention in an office is that all people, from senior executives to typists, work from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. it is because that is the natural time of the day to work, not up to 10.30 p.m., not to speak of all night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I admit there are three very long faces on the benches opposite.  Deputy Barry Desmond pointed out that this House has a system of very rigid procedures on which only a tiny inroad is being made by the recommendations produced by the Committee.  The fact that we have these rigid procedures is no credit to us.  Deputy O'Malley blamed me for &ldquo;canvassing&rdquo; my points of view, the inference being that, having being rebuffed once, I should pipe down once and for all on the matter.  My points of view may be false but I should like to hear other ideas on how business might be made more rational and how existence in this House, particularly for office-holders, might be made more humane.</P>
      <P>I am sorry if the Deputies opposite think I have been deliberately holding up matters.  I assure them that is not the case.  I wish to thank them again for their contributions and I recommend the adoption of the report to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The one area where the Government have proved most incompetent in their handling of the economy is with regard to agriculture. The Government's fiscal policies have been ruinous and have resulted in gross mismanagement.  One can substantiate this accusation by some obvious and glaring examples.</P>
      <P>Despite the Labour-Fine Gael Coalition commitment to stabilise prices, we have witnessed unprecedented price increases in the past year and especially in the last six months.  At the moment inflation is running at the rate of 16 per cent per annum, placing us at the top of the EEC league.  The Government may glibly say that inflation is completely outside their control in that it is imported into our open economy but, as was pointed out recently in the report of the Central Bank, a significant portion of the inflation is of domestic origin for which the Government must bear major responsibility.</P>
      <P>This week the quarterly economic commentary of the Economic and Social Research Institute warned that real living standards are likely to fall about 3¼ per cent this year and that the balance of payments deficit will jump from the figure of £86 million last year to £275 million in 1974.  The commentary reported that half of this record deficit is due directly to increased oil prices and to reduced cattle prices.  I shall refer to the latter item again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good barometer of the economic <Col N="2355" /> well-being of any country is the state of the construction industry, and here the situation is dismal.  The commentary of the Economic and Social Research Institute predicts that the number of houses to be completed this year will be lower than in 1973, despite the many assurances of the Minister for Local Government. Rumours are rife that up to 7,500 construction workers will be laid off after August.  Figures released recently indicate that building costs rose by 11 per cent in the first six months of the year, and in the last 18 months&mdash; the period in office of the Government&mdash;costs have jumped by an astronomical 44 per cent, equivalent to the rise over the five years to 1971 when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    <P>We must seriously consider the distinct possibility of a collapse in the Irish construction industry, and it is in this context that the public must judge the refusal this week by the Government to give income tax relief to building societies.</P>
    <P>I now come to agriculture which I will examine in some detail in my capacity as Opposition spokesman and I make these comments in the knowledge that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Clinton, according to newspaper reports, is on a holiday information visit to Denmark at the present time.</P>
    <P>As an introduction to the examination of the current economic status of Irish agriculture I should like to reemphasise that the state of agriculture is a very relevant barometer of the Irish economy.  This relationship stems from the fact that overall our total agriculture is the single biggest industry in this country.  Twenty-five per cent of our population are directly engaged in farming, fishing or forestry and if we include those working in agriculture-based industries such as food processing, agricultural marketing and agricultural service industries, the total agricultural employment is in the order of 45 per cent.  Within Irish manufacturing industry the food and drink sector is both the single biggest industrial grouping and the <Col N="2356" /> leading export performer.  Likewise, because agriculture-based industry processes indigenously produced raw materials it has a much greater multiplier effect in the Irish economy compared with foreign owned industry. Hence its economic well-being is of added importance and transcends purely economic statistics.</P>
    <P>In emphasising the critical importance of the role of agriculture in the Irish economy I should like to remind this House that the single most compelling reason why this country voted overwhelmingly to join the EEC was the anticipated advantages for our agriculture.  The existence of the Community's common agricultural policy was considered to provide the two essential dynamics for an unprecedented expansion in our agricultural industry, namely, first, remunerative prices for our agricultural produce and, secondly, guaranteed market access.  No longer was the development of Irish agriculture to be tied to the British cheap food policy, and in anticipation of the outstanding advantages to be derived from EEC membership commentators referred to it in terms of a bonanza for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>With this brief background let us now examine how Irish agriculture has fared during the past seven months, which can be regarded as the period being considered in this Adjournment debate.  A simple diagnosis forces one to realise that Irish agriculture is currently experiencing the worst crisis it has faced in many years.  In the context of heavy investments at all stages of agriculture and especially at farm level and record increases in livestock numbers, Irish agriculture today is certainly in the doldrums and looks as if it is facing economic disaster.  The crisis facing Irish agriculture is strikingly evidenced by data on Irish farm incomes.</P>
    <P>In 1972 Irish farm incomes increased spectacularly by 38 per cent while they exhibited an elevation of similar magnitude in 1973 of 32 per cent.  This, of course, we have already heard here today from the Taoiseach but he forgot <Col N="2357" /> to give us the estimated figure for 1974 or perhaps he was not advised of this by those in a position to advise him.  I might tell him that his Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr. Clinton, has agreed that farm incomes will decrease by 10 per cent in 1974. Obviously, this is a major disaster.</P>
    <P>At a time when Irish agriculture is facing economic ruin let us ask what action the Government have taken. First, they have decided that this year was an opportune time to put income tax on farmers.  Worse still, not alone were farmers to be taxed on their incomes but they were to be doubly taxed through a tax on income and rates on their land as well.  The Fianna Fáil Opposition appreciating the financial problems facing farmers and the inequity of double taxation, were in favour, are in favour, of only one form of taxation.  That can come about, as was made known right through the night last night, through the derating of land for farmers liable to income tax. Alas, we now know the action the Government took on this particular proposal of ours.</P>
    <P>Secondly, this Government have been severely remiss in not protecting the interests of Irish agriculture at EEC level.  For example, the Government have not introduced various producer subsidies which other Member Governments have brought in to support their own farmers.  Most critically, however, this Government have been guilty of dereliction of duty in not taking speedier and more aggressive steps to remove the monetary compensatory amounts levied on Irish exports of agricultural products caused by the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>The existence of this 15 per cent punitive levy is the single major cause of the depressed prices for Irish cattle and meat exports.  The only solution to the monetary compensatory amounts problem is the introduction of a green £ through the changing reference rate between the Irish £ and the unit of account.  Indeed, the initiative for introducing the green £ has come, not from the Government, but from those involved in farming and indeed from my party, the Fianna Fáil Party.  I might <Col N="2358" /> ask what grudging steps have the Coalition Government taken to introduce the green £.  The topic was raised at last week's beef package meeting of the Council of Ministers but consideration of the green £ was postponed to mid-September.  This stalling tactic by the EEC is poor consolation to the Irish farmers and the Irish livestock and meat industry.  I have no option but to accuse the Government of both indecision and poor tactics as regards expediting the introduction of the green £.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the Agricultural Commissioner, M. Lardinois, told Irish farming representatives some months ago that there should be no problem in getting EEC clearance for the Irish green £.  Furthermore, did not Italy introduce the green lira to reduce the monetary compensatory payments?  Thus, the precedent is already there, and if other countries like Italy, France and the United Kingdom can take steps to protect their agricultural industries, many people are asking why cannot Ireland follow suit.</P>
    <P>I submit that the Irish Government of the day should also take unilateral action to safeguard Irish agriculture. In particular, an immediate and essential step is the introduction of the green £ but because of the Government's non-commitment to and their tardiness in this matter we now have a situation that the leader of one of the farming organisations very recently has been forced to call for a three-man Government ministerial team to lobby support from among EEC Governments for Ireland's green £. This raises the question who is running Irish agriculture at the moment. Because of their inaction and because they are reacting to external advice rather than initiating action themselves one can rightly say that this Government are not directing the development of Irish agriculture.  However, this unfortunate state of affairs is, I suppose, not surprising when one examines the composition of the present Government, an urban-based, city dominated Cabinet, and even if the Minister for Agriculture and <Col N="2359" /> Fisheries, Deputy Clinton, were a formidable advocate of the problems of Irish agriculture, it is now recognised and accepted by practically everyone involved in the industry that he would receive little support from his Cabinet colleagues.  It is, indeed, unfortunate that the Minister, Mr. Clinton, is a poor defender of the interests of Irish agriculture both at Cabinet level and at EEC ministerial level.  I should like to say in fairness to him, even in his absence, that I believe he is certainly trying his best.  I believe that he is working as hard as he can.  to try to better the lot of the farmer.  Unfortunately, for the farmer and for the nation as a whole he is not being successful in his efforts.  As well as a lack of commitment on the part of the present Dublin-oriented Cabinet to Irish agriculture there is also the problem of a lack of funds to underwrite any special subsidies for Irish farmers.  The national coffers I am afraid, have been fully exhausted by the grandiose schemes of the Labour left.  Indeed even if the Minister could persuade the Cabinet to subsidise problem sectors of Irish agriculture&mdash;and he cannot&mdash;there is no money to do so.</P>
    <P>While the dramatic about-turn in Irish farm incomes from a 32 per cent increase to a 10 per cent decrease, of which our Taoiseach is still not aware or if he is he is making sure to omit it, is a major debilitating influence on Irish agriculture.  It is intertwined with a second consideration, namely our representation at EEC level.  This inter-relationship is due to the existence of the monetary compensatory amounts and I have already criticised the Government for ineffectual action in this matter.  However, if we broaden this topic one can also castigate this Government for poor representation at EEC level.  Considering that our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is doing his best, and unsuccessfully, this representation that we have at EEC level is not good enough as it is not protecting Irish agriculture properly.  I have quoted examples of the green pound and the non-deviation from EEC regulations <Col N="2360" /> even though this was necessary for selfprotection and has already been enacted by other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>Let me instance another example&mdash; the listing of disadvantaged agricultural areas by each member county to qualify for special aids.  During the last Dáil session I asked two questions on this important subject.  On each occasion I have been stone-walled by the pat answer that this list is being prepared.  That was not a Michael Pat answer.  In the period between the questions the Agricultural Commissioner M. Lardinois is on record as having accused various member countries, including Ireland, of delaying this scheme by not sending in national lists.  The question must be asked and answered: why the delay in Ireland's case?  Surely the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is both sufficiently competent on and knowledgeable about those areas of our country where farming is under more severe handicaps.  This is yet another area appertaining to the EEC where this Minister for Agriculture and the Government of which he is a member have been found wanting despite constant proddings from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Let me give other examples of poor EEC representation.  The Agricultural Commissioner M. Lardinois promised that sheep and lamb would be embraced within the Common Agricultural Policy by this summer.  This has not happened and the French, through their sluice gate arrangements, recently closed the lucrative French market to Irish lamb.  I would like to know why the Minister has not been more aggressive in having this problem solved.  The EEC farm modernisation scheme has been fully adopted by this country.  I believe, without any concern for the future of our 100,000 small farmers or, as we are now told to call them by those in Brussels, our 100,000 transitional farmers.  I suggest this Government were remiss in not adapting the modernisation scheme to suit situations peculiar to Ireland.  In this context an embracing listing of disadvantaged areas is essential as special national subsidies and interest-free <Col N="2361" /> loans can be given to those areas.</P>
    <P>This country's current negotiations for sugar beet quotas are not, I believe as aggressive as they should be. Instead of getting an increase on our A sugar quota from £150,000 to £175,000 or £180,000 it seems we may end up with a 25 per cent reduction in our current B quota of 50,000 tons. Any reduction in our sugar quota would be disastrous for the confidence of our sugar beet growers.  This confidence I assure the House is already at a low ebb.  Beet acreage has dropped by 20,000 acres over the past two seasons.  With free inter-Community trade we are convinced that we must take every step to protect our home market and make sure it is supplied by domestic sugar rather than by imports.</P>
    <P>Apart from EEC representation there are many internal agricultural developments which have added to the lack of confidence currently permeating the industry.  While these are numerous I will select only one or two examples to make my point.  We have had problems with the agricultural advisory service and county committees of agriculture, festering problems regarding promotional prospects culminating in the agricultural advisers refusing to operate the EEC farm modernisation scheme from the beginning of February to the middle of May.  The grievances of the advisers and the concern of farmers have been accentuated by the action of this Government in announcing their much vaunted plans for reorganisation of the agricultural industry service. It is essential that these plans, promised by the Government since they took office, be released immediately in order to restore the confidence of both the farmer and the adviser.  I should like to ask whether the delay is another case of the Minister for Agriculture being incapable of convincing his Dublin-based, city-orientated and trade union-dominated Cabinet colleagues to go along with his ideas, more critically to go along with them and to pay for them or is it a case of there being no plan actually formulated?  Either way the Minister must act immediately if the <Col N="2362" /> effective and trustworthy working relationship between the farmer and the adviser is to be maintained in the future.</P>
    <P>Secondly we have the very serious problem of a feed shortage this winter which many believe will reach famine proportions.  While last winter was very difficult this winter portends to be a disaster for two reasons.  There are at least 300,000 extra livestock on Irish farms and the new EEC slaughter agreements will result in more mature cattle being carried over the winter, adding to the feed problem.  The poor spring and excessive grass consumption has resulted in less fodder conservation for next winter.  One of our leading farming organisations calculated that 42 per cent more silage would be required next winter.  We must state that the farming organisations rather than the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, representing the Government, have been much more active in alerting farmers to the potential feed crisis next winter.  We all know how farmers acted when the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries advised them to grow more cereals this year.  I do not think it is any secret that the Minister's advice was not taken, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>I should like in discussing winter feed to advise all farmers to take every step to conserve all items of feed which may be available as a by-product to their farm activities.  I am thinking particularly of such items as beet tops, which can provide valuable feed by ensilage.  I am also glad to know that farmers growing peas are baling or ensiling the spent vines. These vines contain a ton of dry matter per acre and should be conserved this year because of potential fodder shortage.</P>
    <P>I will now try to review very briefly the current state of various commodity areas.  As an introduction one can generalise and state that all agricultural commodity areas are suffering the effect of high production costs, an increase of 19 per cent this year, which is due to the greatly increased <Col N="2363" /> costs of essential farm inputs such as fertilisers, seeds, feeding stuffs, agro-chemicals, fuels and so on.  In many instances, especially in the case of fertilisers, the higher prices were associated with low availability.  Fertilisers are expected to increase by 25 per cent next month and all forms of nitrigin are expected to be scarce next year as they were this year.</P>
    <P>General inflation, as mentioned earlier, is running at 16 per cent.  This inflation hits agriculture through increased labour costs, higher prices for agricultural machinery, farm buildings and the like.  The lack of confidence by Irish farmers is supported by a fall off in purchases of new agricultural machinery.  The reduced price for farm outputs and the unfortunate decrease in the price of farm products results from over-supplied and depressed markets and in the context of more extensive inputs have resulted in a 10 per cent drop in farm income for 1974.</P>
    <P>Let us briefly examine some of the more important commodity areas of Irish agriculture.  One need only look at the pigs and poultry industries to honestly admit that these commodities took a very severe beating in recent months due to highly inflated feed costs and also due to the action of the present Government in decontrolling the price of feeding stuffs in an effort to try and win support during the Monaghan by-election of last November. While feeding stuffs are now cheaper pig numbers have decreased and many small pig units have gone out of business but I do not think it is any concern of the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or his Dublin-based Cabinet colleagues how many of them have been put out of business.  The Minister must take full responsibility for this crisis in confidence in the pig industry as he unwisely advised farmers to get out of pigs.  This was contrary to the advice offered at the time by the Pigs and Bacon Commission and I believe it will possibly lead to a shortage of Irish pig meat later on this year.</P>
    <P>In the cattle and beef area it is unfortunate <Col N="2364" /> for this country that the EEC beef market became over-supplied and a severe strain was placed on the intervention storage of frozen beef.  Eventually the beef intervention system collapsed because there was a shortage of cold storage and also there were the continued imports into the European Economic Community from third countries. Under these pressures it is little wonder that the intervention arrangements broke down as it was ludicrous for the EEC and us, as a member, to permit imports in the face of an internal surplus.  In this context the cessation of all imports announced in last week's beef package is to be welcomed but I believe it is a question of too little too late.</P>
    <P>I recommend the extension of the temporary import stoppage beyond 31st October, which is the deadline, if market stability has not been achieved by that time.  While the EEC slaughter premiums have introduced some temporary relief to the fall in cattle prices it is only a temporary solution as it postpones the problem only through distorting normal seasonal patterns. Furthermore, winter storage of cattle will be compounded by the critical feed situation predicted for this winter, as I already mentioned.  The EEC slaughter premiums are to my mind a material subsidy and represent an attack on the intervention system and hence on the common agricultural policy itself.  This is very critical for Ireland.  Ireland must be vigilant in preventing any dilution of the Common Agricultural Policy through a return to a system of national price supports on a permanent basis.  However, the main factor of reducing the price of Irish cattle and beef is the existence of the monetary compensatory amounts. These must be removed as soon as possible through the introduction of the green pound.</P>
    <P>While dairying has been the shining star of Irish agricultural commodities there are problems here also.  Instead of the expected 10 per cent increase in milk production it is still 5 per cent behind last year's figure of 600,000,000 gallons and, believe me, the milk is not being given to the calves at 20p a <Col N="2365" /> gallon as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would like us to believe.  As a result of this increase not materialising there is a loss of surplus processing capacity in the dairy industry. While milk prices are up on last years the dairy farmer incomes have also suffered from the reduced prices they got for their calves and also the reduced prices they are getting for their culled cows.  Even the dairy farmers have had their confidence eroded and their total incomes reduced. The monetary compensatory charge, as applied to dairy exports, represent a levy of £30 per ton on skimmed milk powder.</P>
    <P>Contrary to expectations, the grain acreage has not increased.  This is especially true of feeding grain.  As I have already stated sugar beet acreage is also down for this year by 9,000 acres to a very undesirable figure of 65,000 acres.  I am convinced that Irish agriculture is going through a major crisis because of a 12 per cent fall in farm incomes.  This reduction is due to 19 per cent higher production costs mainly due to more expensive imports, general inflation in the economy of 16 per cent and lower prices for outputs due to poor EEC market management.  This crisis of confidence is accentuated by the inability of this Government to tackle the root causes of the various problems currently plaguing Irish argiculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to realise that the Adjournment Debate is a statement of the affairs of the nation over the last 12 months and the projections for the coming year. The Opposition over the last few days have engaged in the worst type of propaganda we have ever seen in the political history of this State, speaking of a housing crisis and of redundancy when they know this is not true.  Last year we had the same poppycock from them regarding housing.  They said there was a housing crisis, that we would not fulfil one of our promises in the 14-point plan we published prior to the election in 1973. We did fulfil it; we exceeded the <Col N="2366" /> figure we set.  Again this year Fianna Fáil are attempting to create a crisis which does not exist.  It is pathetic that an Opposition should resort to this tactic.  They claim that a previous Coalition Government failed because things went wrong in the building industry and they are hoping the same thing might happen again.  Obviously, their idea is that if you say something often enough and loud enough people will begin to believe it.  This is regrettable because many small builders may listen to them and be afraid to take on new contracts.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government has assured the building industry that money is available and only this week more than £9 million was injected into the industry to ensure that it would perform as we promised in order to fulfil our social commitments and ensure housing for our people.  We have created the situation of housing coordinator in Dublin Corporation because this was necessary due to the neglect of the Opposition when they were in Government.  They showed absolutely no concern for the disgraceful housing situation that was allowed to develop in Dublin where for a number of years we have had a waiting list of more than 5,000 families living in disgraceful conditions in rat-infested rooms.  The National Coalition Government have created this new post to ensure that in coming years the housing situation will be rectified.  Now the Opposition are trying to create a crisis in the building industry because they are bereft of ideas and all they can do as an Opposition is to try to create this atmosphere of despair and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can assure the people that this will not come about because the Government are aware of the needs and the problems.  They are problems created by inflation, the cost of housing and the cost of servicing money.  These problems will not be solved by the tactics of the Opposition.  They can only be solved by a Government with collective responsibility dedicated to social reforms.  We need only look back over the past 16 months to see the progress made in the field of social reform to which I shall refer later.  What saddens <Col N="2367" /> me is that I believe a Government is as good as its Opposition and I am rather displeased at the type of Opposition we have now.  I hope that in coming years it will improve and play a responsible role so that if we are not performing as we should they will let us know where we are failing.  At present they are engaged in this spurious campaign which I believe will be held in contempt by the people.  I think this is what is happening.</P>
    <P>We have only to turn to the last budget and the 1973 budget to see the extent of social reforms.  In the last budget particularly the increase in social welfare in one year was equivalent to the total increase over seven years under the present Opposition, so that one year of National Coalition Government is equal to seven years of Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I do not view social benefits as something provided by a &ldquo;do-gooder&rdquo; Government but as a social responsibility. Prior to the election we declared this.  Social welfare recipients were neglected; they were pawns of the Government.  If it was advantageous to bring in a good budget for election purposes the then Government did so but for the first time the 1974 budget clearly indicated a percentage increase for social welfare recipients which was above the inflationary increase we have experienced.  This is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I believe social welfare benefits should be tied to national wage agreements and that budgets should provide additional increases to ensure that the standard of living of recipients would also be improved.  People who have given their lives working for the State should not end their days depending on the whims of politicians.  If we are a Christian society we could not accept that.</P>
    <P>The present Government are evolving a more equitable and just system of social welfare.  We have looked after the unmarried mothers.  It is very important to ensure that children of unmarried mothers get all they are entitled to get.  This year also, wives and children of people who are incarcerated will not be made suffer.  This <Col N="2368" /> is only right.  Why should the children of a person committed for an offence go hungry?  This clearly indicated the difference between the present Government and the Opposition.  The Opposition became bereft of any sense of social reform.  They were lead by the nose by their administrators, not that the administrators wanted to lead them but they had no alternative because of the ineptitude of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins referred to the Dublin-based Cabinet.  The Cabinet has not been selected on a regional basis.  The best men for the job were selected regardless of where they came from.  We know that the Opposition picked their Cabinet for strategic purposes&mdash;a State car here and a State car there would get them votes.  So be it.  We are concerned about good government. We must ensure that the best men for the jobs are selected.  The Taoiseach did that when he selected his Cabinet.  The Opposition are trying to drive a wedge between the rural and urban Deputies.  This is a cheap tactic. It does not do them justice.</P>
    <P>People say: &ldquo;You are all the same.&rdquo; I would like to indicate clearly that we are not all the same.  Social welfare benefits are paid to people in need. This Government are committed to carrying out a policy of eliminating poverty.  The Minister for Finance allocated £100,000 by way of funds to investigate the causes of poverty.  Our prime responsibility is to eliminate poverty and the only way to do that is by having an in-depth investigation. A committee has been set up.  It consists of first-class people who are aware of the problems.  They will report back to the Government.  We can look forward to the elimination of poverty not by handing out social welfare payments every week but by building up a better society.</P>
    <P>This Government taxed the mines. They were given a tax-free holiday by the present Opposition.  That was a disgrace.  They allowed the mining companies to come in here and mine the wealth of this country and take it out while contributing practically nothing to the economy of the nation. <Col N="2369" /> Even when a Bill was introduced to ensure that the mining industry would be taxed in the same way as any other industry the Opposition opposed it.  That shows that as a party they are truly capitalist.  The wealth of the nation belongs to the people and not to speculators.  We welcome people coming here to operate mining or other industries but they must not do it at the expense of the people. We were sent to this House to represent the people of the country.  It is our duty to see that we enact laws that protect our people and ensure that our wealth accrues to them and not just to the few.  That is another example of the difference between the National Coalition Government and Fianna Fáil.  They lost their political souls.  They are now in Opposition.  They are hoping for some accident to happen and dreaming of a split in the National Coalition.  There will be no split.  The National Coalition Government were elected to do a job. Their job was to give the country good government and to develop a social conscience within the nation. Under the Fianna Fáil Party what was being developed was an attitude of: &ldquo;I am all right, Jack.  If I have something I am not interested in helping my fellowman.&rdquo;  Those sentiments are against the best principles and traditions of our people.  I am glad the change of Government has brought a renewed confidence and a renewal within the people of their responsibility in society.  Everybody knows that social reforms cost money. Once the people see a Government is committed to a genuine social reform they will go along with it.</P>
    <P>Industrial development over the last 18 months, since the Government took office, has been progressing. Last year the job rate rose substantially. This year it is not rising as quickly as we would like.  The Industrial Development Authority are doing a first class job.  They are encouraging new industry by ensuring that the job rate is growing.  When one takes into account the troubles in Northern Ireland one realises just what a good job they are doing.  The Government are giving them every encouragement. <Col N="2370" /> Industrialists see this nation as buoyant and industrious and are prepared to bring their businesses here. That is why I feel that any action by the Opposition to try to create a doomsday situation by propaganda is a disgrace and borders on treason.</P>
    <P>The oil crisis has upset the economies of most of the European countries.  When we compare the effects of the oil crisis on this country with its effects on the wealthy industrial nations, we realise that is has not left as great a mark here as it might have done.  Again, the credit for this is due to the Government.  The Minister for Transport and Power never lost his head in the crisis and so we weathered it.  England was forced to bring in a three day week with the resultant loss in production and earning power.  We maintained our production capacity.  This reflects the attitude of the Government.  It was said years ago that if England got a chill, Ireland got pneumonia.  In this case, England got pneumonia and Ireland got the chill.  Again, this reflects a change of attitude.  The change of attitude was the result of good government. The respective Ministers are on top of their various ministries and relate right through the Cabinet. What we are getting here is genuine collective Government working together to ensure progress.</P>
    <P>This Government will have to apply themselves to the energy problem.  The possibilities of finding oil and gas are no longer remote.  Indeed in the next few years we hope we will have them. This will change the face of the nation.  It will give us a new impetus and a far higher growth rate.  It will ensure that we can undertake extra social commitments.  I have no doubt that this Government will not give away our wealth to the oil companies. They will be mindful of their obligations to the nation and the wealth accruing from such finds.  Again, profits will be fed back into the country.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have approved a nuclear generating station. This was long overdue.  The last Government dragged their heels on this. They did not know how to treat it. <Col N="2371" /> The decision is now made and we will go ahead.  One is always wary of any nuclear development and its consequences. In view of the way the western countries were held to ransom by the oil producing nations last year, it is important that one looks for other means of power.  If the wheels of industry stop the nation will grind very quickly to a halt.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Government are taking the necessary steps to ensure that there is a diversification of energy to ensure that we will not again be the victims of inflated prices imposed by the oil producing nations.  Or, if they carry it too far, we shall have to ensure that we will be in a position to take other steps.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, Fianna Fáil, to try to stampede this Government into false action, are using the spurious statements on housing, which is regrettable. In our one year in office, this Government have more than fulfilled their promises.  Also, as a Dublin-based Deputy, I think I can say that there is a firm commitment to centre city development.  Fianna Fáil were there for 16 years and they allowed this city to decay; they let it be taken over by any speculator who wanted to come in and develop.  This is a disgrace because Dublin is a fine city and worthy of something more than that type of treatment. In answer to Deputy G. Collins, who was bleating about the Dublin-based Cabinet, perhaps it was because Fianna Fáil was a rural-based Cabinet they were not aware of the needs of the people of Dublin.  But I do not use that as an argument.  I believe they merely were not aware of the social problems of the city.  Now 80 acres have been allocated.  This is not just a gesture but is a positive move to ensure that we have genuine urban renewal. This is not necessarily confined to Dublin only, but will also apply in other cities here.  I believe other cities will learn a lesson from the way we allowed Dublin to decay over the years.</P>
    <P>As a member of the housing committee of Dublin Corporation, and as chairman, I might say that the Minister <Col N="2372" /> has given assurance that there will be no shortage of money for local authority housing and development in Dublin.  This is an area which has been badly neglected over the years, when Fianna Fáil showed absolutely no concern and in respect of which there was no planned programme.  In fact, the last Government eliminated local authority in Dublin.  I think that was a measure of its contempt for an authority which it did not control.  It was eliminated at the stroke of a pen and left this city without any elected representatives for three or four years until the Minister for Local Government appointed the City Commissioners last year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They can learn from the work of this Government.  Perhaps they may find the semblance of a social conscience and political philosophy, that the gombeen man attitude, the gombeen man type of Cabinet is gone.  It is important that that be realised.  People have given a vote of confidence to this Coalition Government.  Despite the rantings and ravings of a number of speakers in Opposition for the last 18 months that this Government would not last six months, nine months, 12 months, 18 months, it will last its full term.  We will then put before the people the record of our performance and it will be a matter for the people to decide whether to return us to office.  However <Col N="2374" /> I have no doubt that the people will realise the success of the Coalition since coming to office.</P>
      <P>Despite international complications we have had a growth rate during the past 12 months that is greater than that of the previous year.  New industries have set up here and there are more to follow.  The dynamic attitude of the Government has created a real confidence in the economy.  All of this, together with an opinion that the government are getting too much Press, is antagonising the Opposition.  We make news every week on the various aspects of our economy.  As recently as this week, for instance, the Minister for Local Government announced that he was making available £9 million towards housing.  This is the sort of news that the people want to hear.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to there being a fraudulent aspect to this.  I would not have thought there was anything fraudulent about the making available of £9 million.  But of course the Deputy finds this hard to swallow, particularly after his meanderings of the last couple of weeks on the building industry.</P>
      <P>They are silent now on the other side of the House.  They realise the achievements of the Government and their only contribution is one of scaremongering and of trying to distort the situation.  It is regrettable that the Opposition have to descend to such a low standard of politics when one realises that they were elected for the purpose of making their contribution to the working of Parliament.  Is it not sad that they sit there waiting for something to happen instead of making a constructive contribution to the House?  I suppose the answer is that they are not capable of doing that.  They are devoid of any ideas despite their resorting to think-tanks and a public relations officer. Their problem is that they have no men of talent in the House.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude by reiterating my satisfaction with the way in which this Government are moving.  Despite the problem of international inflation our economic growth is rising.</P>

      <P>I did not intend referring to education during this debate but I am obliged to do so because of a statement made here this morning by the Minister for Education in which he said that one of the first tasks he faced on assuming office was to restore confidence.  I expect that I would be right in assuming that this remark was intended as a reflection on me as his immediate predecessor. In what or in whom did the Minister have to restore confidence?</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that, after the recess, when the Minister is speaking on the Estimate for his Department, he will explain exactly what he meant by this statement and that he will tell us where the need arose to restore confidence and, also, who had lost confidence during my term of office.  Perhaps this explanation would explain certain aspects of the Minister's attitude to education.  However if the task of restoring confidence is his only excuse for his lack of performance in the Department, it is a very poor excuse, indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke also of genuine consultation, and he enumerated various groups&mdash;teachers, managers and so on&mdash;with whom he had consultations. All these groups had consultations with me on many occasions during my term of office.  I had genuine consultations and perhaps I should add also that, having had these consultations, I made decisions.  The Minister stated that he was not tied ideologically to any type of school in the post-primary sector.  Neither was I. If he reads the speeches made by me during my time as Minister for Education, he will find that on many occasions I stated that I was not concerned with particular types of schools, provided I could make available comprehensive education for our young people. I was not concerned whether that education was provided in secondary, <Col N="2376" /> vocational, comprehensive, or community schools so long as the schools concerned were large enough.  Any decisions I took were taken in the interest of the children.  While my decisions were accepted generally there were those who did not like some of them, but this is to be expected when a Minister makes decisions which he believes to be in the best interests of the children.  I shall not go any further in this matter now, but I shall have a better opportunity of dealing with it, later.</P>
    <P>Before the general election the people were being told <i>ad nauseam</i> about the huge reservoir of talent to be found in the ranks of the proposed Fine Gael/Labour Coalition.  So extraordinary was this wide ranging talent supposed to be that it might have appeared that these parties had simply to be elected to government in order that this country be transformed into an earthly paradise.  A 14-point plan was put before the people as a panacea for all ills.  Perhaps it might have been a panacea had it been implemented or, indeed, had it been capable of implementation, but this policy is now in ruins and the shine has worn off the once brightly painted Coalition image. I have no doubt that the people would be only too glad to be given an opportunity at present to trade this academic brilliance for some common sense.  Even the media, which must bear a considerable portion of the blame for helping to foist the Coalition on the people, recognise this now to some extent and are willing to admit on occasion that their idols have feet of clay.</P>
    <P>The present state of the Irish economy is frightening.  The prospects for farmers are the worst for many years.  The building trade is in a chaotic condition.  Unemployment figures are rising at a time of the year when they should be falling.  Inflation continues unchecked and rising prices are putting even the essential commodities out of the reach of some of our people.  The Government are unable to do anything to stabilise the position and, like Micawber, they appear to be waiting for something to turn up.  On the other hand, the <Col N="2377" /> danger signals are apparent to the people, who are demanding action but to no effect.</P>
    <P>My main reason for intervening in the debate is because I am particularly concerned about those in receipt of social welfare payments.  It is true that no group is as adversely affected by rising prices as they are.  They are living on fixed incomes and the vast majority are unable to cushion themselves against the increasing inroads into their meagre incomes.  All of them, particularly those with children, are going through a period of real fear not only for the future but also for the present.  When the Coalition Government took office the economy of the country was buoyant, so much so that the then Opposition speakers during the general election campaign said they would finance some of the projects they put before the electorate from the buoyancy in the economy.</P>
    <P>We had just entered the EEC and all of us were aware that £30 million would be available from savings on agricultural subsidies.  During the election campaign all parties promised to use that money for social welfare purposes. Never before in the history of the State had any Government such an opportunity to provide a worthwhile social security system that would ensure that the aged, the widows, the unemployed and other groups dependent on the State for help would be provided for, that not only would they be able to keep abreast of the rising cost of living but would have an improvement in the quality of their lives.  I have often tried to visualise what the Coalition would have done had this money not been available.  I can only look back on the terms of office of the previous Coalitions to try to gauge what might have been done. On that basis, the amounts that would have been available to those who are dependent on the State for help would have been meagre.</P>
    <P>In the early days of the Coalition, we were bombarded with statements about the concern of the Government for those in the lower income groups, about what the Government had done for them, and the inadequacies of the <Col N="2378" /> Fianna Fáil administration in this matter.  While efforts are being made to sustain this campaign&mdash;some of which can be seen in the Taoiseach's speech today where he makes use of carefully selected percentages&mdash;the statements of concern are shown to be the empty formulae we knew they would be when the Government were faced with the practicalities of the situation.  Instead of thoroughly and speedily investigating the position in which the lower income groups find themselves, with the objective of quickly coming to their aid with further financial assistance, we have had Government speakers trying to defend the indefensible.  They refer constantly to the increases this month in pension allowances and assistance without any regard for the purchasing power of the total benefits available to each individual.</P>
    <P>It is no use harping back on previous years when the inflationary trend did not have anything like the same effect in eroding incomes as it does at the moment.  I have said before that to speak of the total sum made available, expecting commendation when the figure goes into millions, is a useless and meaningless exercise. What one must do is to take the amount available to each individual or family and see how they can live on that sum.</P>
    <P>We know that older people look on £1 as something of great value; they can remember when that amount would keep them in reasonable comfort for a week.  To tell them that they will get an increase of £1.30, as in the case of the old age contributory pensioners, appears to them for the moment to be of great value. However, when they go to the shops they find that this amount of money has little value in buying power and that, even including the increase, their position is worse this year than it was last year.  Not only must they meet costs but they must also cope with the many increases that are announced with very considerable regularity.  We should refer also to the report of the Central Bank which stated that the inflationary trend will be exceptional in the year to come.  We must remember <Col N="2379" /> this fact when we are assessing how much pensioners and other social welfare recipients have got in terms of purchasing power.</P>
    <P>On the Estimate for Social Welfare, I mentioned that the value of the £ in February, 1973 had dropped to 97p in May, 1973, and to 83p in May, 1974. If we are to work out the value of the contributory old age pension in terms of May, 1973 and, for the sake of argument, to accept that the increase granted in July, 1973 had been granted in May, 1973, we would find that by May, 1974, the actual improvement was practically nil, although the income in money terms had increased by £1.30.  Of course the increase was not granted in May, 1974; it was granted in July, 1974.  Quite obviously, then, the pensioner is considerably worse off in July, 1974, than he was on the lower income in July, 1973.</P>
    <P>One must also take into account that since the official figures were published relating to the fall in the value of the £ the price of a considerable number of goods has increased.  Some of the goods in question have a very direct and substantial bearing on the standard of living of persons on social welfare benefit and assistance.</P>
    <P>I have here the Official Report of Wednesday, 17th July, 1974.  On that day a question put down by Deputy Brennan was answered by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach. The reply given contains percentage increases in the prices of various commodities in the 12 month period to mid-May, 1974.  Many of the commodities on the list are necessary commodities and much used by social welfare recipients.  According to that reply the price of bread increased by an average of 21 per cent.  It is hardly necessary for me to state that bread is a staple food of persons on low incomes. The price of biscuits increased by up to 44.5 per cent.  The price of fresh milk, pasteurised, increased by 19.4 per cent; cornflakes by 30.6 per cent; rice by 50.6 per cent.  A rough estimate shows an average increase in the cost of men's clothing of approximately 20 per cent.  These figures show <Col N="2380" /> an increase for such people much higher than the official figure of 16.5 per cent.  This fact must be considered in relation to the situation in which persons on low incomes find themselves. Since May there have been further increases in the price of essential commodities and in bus and train fares, which increased by 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Apart from old age pensioners and blind pensioners, in whose case the Fianna Fáil Government made it possible for them to regard transport cost increases with equanimity, all social welfare recipients, particularly working widows and deserted wives, who have to travel to work are very seriously affected by these increases in fares. When people reach the stage where every penny counts and must be looked at a number of times before it is spent all these extra increases are the last straw.  The pressures of fear, anxiety and worry are bringing many people to breaking point.</P>
    <P>I should like again to stress the fact that even with the increases granted in this month to pensioners and social welfare recipients, these people are in a worse position in relation to the purchasing power of their incomes than they were this time last year. That is not the whole story.  The fact is that the purchasing power of their incomes has been running far behind the purchasing power of their income in July, 1973.  The contributory old age pension in July, 1973, was £7.20 a week.  Taking the list of commodities I have mentioned and the increases in the price of food, fuel and clothing and estimating the volume of these commodities a pensioner could buy in July, 1973, it is quite obvious that as prices rose down through the year the pensioner was in a progressively worse position.  The purchasing power of the pension at the beginning of the year was very much less than it was in the previous July.  The pensioner was placed in the position that he had to go into debt or, which was much more likely, had to deprive himself of necessary food or use less fuel.</P>
    <P>There has been too much talk to date, particularly in this period of escalating inflation, of the actual amounts that have been paid as compared <Col N="2381" /> with the amounts paid when there was little or no inflation.  The Government must face up to their responsibilities.  It is not enough to claim to be a caring Government or to talk about being a conservative one. Action is necessary.  It is not enough to initiate a study of poverty, although I have gone on record as stating that this is something which is very commendable in itself.  As I pointed out on many occasions, I would hope that the fact that a study was being made of poverty would not be used as a device to avoid or to delay taking action in respect of poverty which is too self-evident, that is, the poverty of persons who are depending on social welfare payments in a highly inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, it is the duty of the Government to seek out those at present in receipt of assistance and who are clearly living below subsistence level, who are fearful of what the next hour, not to say the next day will bring.  The Government should ensure that such persons will get the necessary adjustments of their incomes to enable them to live in reasonable comfort.  I do not think that the Government really appreciate the ravages being caused to the incomes of persons in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>Part of this inflation is due to the action of the Government themselves in increasing VAT on a wide range of necessities and also due to their budgetary policy.  It is of little consequence from whence inflation comes; it is the duty of the Government to cushion in a realistic way the less fortunate of our people against its very severe effects.  I have made my case in relation to this on a number of occasions.  I believe I have made a well founded case.  Indeed in relatively recent times, since I spoke on this in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill and on the Social Welfare Estimate, all, I think, of the Dublin daily papers have written leading articles on this subject and have pressed the Government to take action in relation to people who are in necessitous circumstances <Col N="2382" /> in the present highly inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>It might also be well if we were again to take note of the recent Central Bank report in which it was pointed out that the increase in the cost of living in the coming year will be at least as high and possibly higher than it was the past year and to remember that the people who are now drawing the new social welfare benefits are facing into this very difficult situation where price increases will begin almost immediately to erode the purchasing power of the money they get from the State.  I would appeal to the Taoiseach and the Government to take cognisance of the points I am making.  If cognisance is also taken of the fact that three Dublin dailies wrote leading articles on the same matter it can hardly be adjudged as purely political.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this matter to which I would like to refer. The Finance Bill which passed through this House this morning was very different in content to the one we were led to expect.  I think we have a right to wonder what has happened to the various taxation proposals which the Labour Party in particular hailed as an earnest of their commitment to the raising of the standard of living of the lower income groups, particularly those who are unable to help themselves because of age, infirmity, illness or unemployment. What has happened to the proposals which were to bring about the great redistribution of wealth?  I do not ask those questions because of any agreement on my part with the methods proposed.  We recognise only too well the calamitous consequences of some of those proposals.  We have our own ideas and our own plans for improving the lot of social welfare recipients. I am referring to the matter simply because this was the much vaunted Labour way of doing it and I am asking what are we now left with.</P>
    <P>The plaintive cry of the Labour Party after the collapse of the two previous Coalition Governments that had it not been for the Fine Gael Party they would have worked wonders will not be accepted again. <Col N="2383" /> We are all aware, of course, of the pressures exerted on the Fine Gael Party by some of their supporters to drop these proposals, and it is now obvious that they do not propose to proceed with them despite occasional noises made by the Minister for Finance to help ease the consciences of the Members of the Labour Party. One must wonder, however, at the pressures which must have been exerted on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare when he said at a recent function&mdash;I do not purport here to use his exact words; I am simply paraphrasing him &mdash;that some people might think we could solve the poverty problem here by taxing heavily the wealthy 5 per cent of our people but that the facts were that unless the 80 per cent who were above the poverty line involved themselves and were willing to contribute to a solution the problem could not be solved.  That statement to me appears to be a straw in the wind and a pointer to a retreat by the Labour Party from the policy which they proclaimed some time ago.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary to be a man who is personally very concerned about those who are unable to help themselves.  I know he is a man who would do his utmost and is most anxious to ensure that as much money as possible would be made available for social welfare purposes. I can understand his frustration if he has instructions to toe the Fine Gael line.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that poverty problems cannot be overcome unless we have a concerned effort made by all our people, but this has always been our policy and it is far from the policy which was adumbrated by the Coalition in the rather heady days of their advent to power.  Let me stress the need to augment social welfare payments especially for those in the lower income bracket.  I would strongly urge this.  I think I have made a reasonable case in relation to it.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the vote which took place in this House last week.  I do not propose to refer to the subject matter of the debate which <Col N="2384" /> preceded the vote but simply to refer to the vote itself.  The reaction of a man in my constituency to the Coalition debacle of last week was and I quote: &ldquo;Not a crowd I would care to depend on in a crisis.&rdquo;  This reaction was, I am convinced, symptomatic of the general feeling among the public. Apart from those staunch supporters of the Fine Gael Party who would be understandably anxious to portray the Taoiseach's action in the best possible light, the public generally are disturbed that we have a Government who are apparently leaderless, that we have a Government the members of which do not trust one another and who are incapable of taking a decision when faced with a difficult problem.</P>
    <P>We are now facing many very difficult problems on the political front relating to the Northern Ireland situation.  We are facing many difficult problems on the economic front in regard to inflation.  We are facing very difficult problems on the social front in relation to the level of social welfare payments.  Nobody can have any confidence that this Government can hope to have the unified approach to those problems necessary if they are to be overcome.  In the highly emotive political situation and in the highly inflationary economic situation in which we live this is a frightening prospect.  We can now see in its true light the basic reason why we have been floundering from crisis to crisis in the past few months, ever since the Coalition honeymoon period was over. During the honeymoon period the Government coasted along on the firm foundation laid by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>The agricultural policy is now in tatters.  One would be hard put to see which particular aspect was in the most chaotic condition.  Prices are rising out of all control and the old excuse of imported inflation has been firmly knocked by the Central Bank Report.  The Government now state that £9 million has been made available to meet a crisis in the housing industry, which I might add the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance insisted before the allocation was announced was not <Col N="2385" /> in a critical condition.  But nobody, not even the Minister himself, yet knows how this money will be made available.  We were told it will be made available from savings.  In my experience as a Minister, I can say that will be quite a problem.  I might also say that the public are sceptical. So long as the income and loan limits remain as they are, they only result in windowdressing.</P>
    <P>The living standards of those on social welfare payments are being eroded rapidly while the Government make up their minds what to do in relation to this section of the community. The health scheme is pigeon-holed. Why go on?  One could take Department after Department and show how lack of decision is holding the political, economic and social life of the country up to ransom.  What has been clear to us in Opposition for quite a while and what has become clear to most people now is the lack of confidence in each other among members of the Government, and a failure to reach decisions on major matters is now clearly obvious to the people of the country in general.  In recent days the Government have shown a lack of confidence.  This has been the pattern in Coalition Governments before this and one can expect the same thing in the present Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, whatever excuse may be made for the extraordinary spectacle of last week, that the confidence of the people of this country in the Government has been severely shattered.  One can expect very little progress while they still remain in office.  We may expect to see this Government going from crisis to crisis in the future.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce will agree with me that in our system of government the vast bulk of legislation emanates from the Cabinet.  When it is intended to introduce legislation, particularly legislation of grave import, a free, full discussion should take place at Cabinet level, so that when it is presented to the Oireachtas it will have the general agreement of the members of the Cabinet.  In such circumstances the <Col N="2386" /> least one would expect is that the Taoiseach, as Leader of the Government, would express his views clearly and concisely on the particular Bill, so that when it comes to the Dáil it will have the agreement of all members of the Cabinet and it will not simply be the Minister who introduces the Bill to the Dáil who has responsibility for it.  This is known as collective responsibility, and our democratic institutions depend to a great degree on this. If a member of a Government objects strongly in principle to a Bill and if his Cabinet colleagues insist on going ahead with it in spite of this, the Minister concerned has the option to resign rather than be associated with the Bill.  This has happened in Irish parliamentary history, although not quite so often as has happened in other parliaments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the free vote, backbenchers of the Coalition Government would not be regarded as having responsibility for a Bill.  Therefore, when a decision is made to grant a free vote to party members backbenchers can, according to the dictates of their conscience, vote for or against a particular Bill.  I am not discussing whether there should be a free vote in such circumstances.  When a Bill is introduced, after having been discussed at Cabinet level, I fail to see how the same facility can be granted to members of the Cabinet.  I do not want to be misunderstood here.  I am not suggesting for one moment that members of the Cabinet have not the right to vote according to the dictates of their conscience.  The point I want to make is that at Cabinet level members of the Cabinet can decide whether or not to introduce a Bill and also decide on the form it will take. Once that decision is taken, then it becomes the collective responsibility of all members of the Government, who remain Ministers after the Bill is introduced.  Apologists for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education in relation to their action in voting against the Bill speak of conscience matters.  I feel their consciences must have been equally active when the decision was taken to introduce the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not enter into a discussion of time because it is a matter of procedure.  I shall make the observations I wish to make.  I do not want to spend much time dealing <Col N="2389" /> statistically with the economy or with my sector of responsibility in the economy because in the lengthy treatment of this area which was presented in the speech of the Taoiseach and circulated in printed form there was a good deal of information, but I shall say a little because, in the absence of constructive criticism, there is great danger that the Opposition&mdash;not even intentionally; it is just what comes out of them through lack of analysis and lack of ability to be constructive&mdash; would just lay about them to see what damage they can do at a time when external economic circumstances are difficult.</P>
      <P>We have heard from the previous speaker, who is, usually more sensible and measured&mdash;I have heard him in the past trying to be reasonable&mdash;talking about the &ldquo;frightening state of the economy&rdquo;, the &ldquo;chaotic building trade&rdquo;, the &ldquo;precipitation of a crisis&rdquo;. This is a dog-in-the-manger attitude of trying to talk us into a crisis.  It is the attitude that if Fianna Fáil have not sufficient votes to form a Government and run the economy, they are happy to wreck it.  That seems very dangerous and irresponsible.  If we are nearly as bad as Opposition speakers have been saying it would be perfectly easy to seize the initiative from us with constructive proposals that would be endorsed by the people as obviously better than ours.  The lack of a constructive alternative is very striking. It is easy to take the initiative away from the Government if you have something better to offer.  We await that, but failing that&mdash;and there has not been the faintest sign of a constructive initiative&mdash;we are entitled to object from our side to the effort to damage this nation at an objectively and externally difficult time.  That is why I want to say a little about the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Job approvals is part of my responsibility. In the year to 31st March, 1973 there were just over 14,000 of them.  In the year to 31st March, 1974, a recent estimate was 22,500&mdash;and that is too low; it is more than that. There was more than 50 per cent of an increase in job approvals in that 12 months, which included a half-year <Col N="2390" /> from October to March which was extremely difficult pending the outbreak of the oil crisis.  But it was still 50 per cent up on the previous year.  If we take actual job creation, taking the year to December, 1972, and comparing it with the year to December, 1973, the increase was more than 100 per cent in the second 12 months.  Words such as &ldquo;prices&rdquo;, &ldquo;frightening state of the economy&rdquo; and &ldquo;chaotic&rdquo; can be thrown against that background.  It is extraordinary how rapidly people who should know better from their own recent experience of government can become irresponsible.</P>
    <P>Over a comparable period industrial production was up by almost 11 per cent, one of the most rapid growth rates in our history.  In a comparable period in 1973 industrial exports rose by very nearly two-thirds in one year &mdash;64 per cent.  Had it been two and two-thirds per cent more it would have been a two-thirds increase.  One may say inflation is a part of that: it is, but even when you adjust for inflation it is a very remarkable increase when a significant portion of that 12 months was exceptionally difficult in world economic terms.</P>
    <P>I can say that the task I see now in regard to creation of industrial jobs is consideration over the coming period&mdash; not prejudging the conclusion&mdash;of raising substantially the target which had been set out in the past.  That is the perspective regarding jobs and exports and the growth of the industrial sector of our economy which is my particular concern.</P>
    <P>I want to speak about prices, because I listened to Deputy Faulkner and many of the truisms, platitudes and expressions of benevolence that he uttered a number of times were things nobody could disagree with, but they do not seem new or relevant to our current difficulties.  Let us look at the effect, for example, of the rise in the price of oil.  The inflationary effect of this has been mentioned and is very strikingly exhibited within the figures, but there is another aspect of it which is this: it means a net transfer of wealth from all oil purchasing countries &mdash;from the EEC and Ireland, in particular&mdash;to <Col N="2391" /> oil supplying countries. There is a net transfer of wealth away from us and we thereby are poorer and, to sustain the growth in the standard of living, we must compensate in other ways.  So, it not only causes inflation but causes a wealth transfer also.</P>
    <P>The point should be made that the problem which caused the original oil embargo is not solved; it is not impossible that this could happen again.  It is also worth saying that there has been an immense transfer of assets, expressed as the positive balances of the oil supplying countries which themselves will have a profound effect on the economies of the developed countries, all of which are running into balance of payments deficits and all of which will need external borrowing in the coming period.</P>
    <P>We have also seen the example of the oil embargo being noted, assessed and praised by supplying countries, countries which supply other sorts of commodities from the third world, and we have seen simultaneously incredible commodity speculation along with the effort of the supplying countries to increase the prices of raw materials.</P>
    <P>Let us say something about the evolution of prices.  I will not try to read statistics into the record.  I want to urge people to consult the sources, whether they be OECD or statistical sources of the EEC or even the reputable magazines such as <i>The Economist</i> which give figures every week.  One cannot help but marvel at the rapidity of growth of social conscience among the Opposition.  I must remind the House that when we came into office, the quarter which ended in mid-February, 1973, was a quarter in which inflation was 4 per cent, running at an annual rate of 16 per cent when there was no oil crisis or commodity speculation.  The people who are now complaining about the same rate of inflation in the middle of a world crisis are those who took no action to stop the inflation which was then making Ireland unique.</P>
    <P>What has happened due to a large number of activities inside this country is that while our inflation rate is running at 16 per cent we have <Col N="2392" /> been caught by other countries and overtaken in many cases.  The amount of increase which has occurred over the last year is greater in other countries than in Ireland.  Many of the statistical sources I mentioned will bear that out.  The consequence of that in terms of our competitiveness in the world is that we are behaving better than many other countries, dreadful as prices are.  The prices bear heavily on the poorer sections of the community.  Nobody is indifferent to this.  Our relative performance is better than the performance of richer, more powerful and more experienced economies.  Any serious examination of the statistics by anyone not blinded by partisanship will bear that out. This is not evidence of a chaotic situation or a total loss of control of prices, This is evidence that <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors and comparable countries we are controlling prices better than they are, bad as this is. It is irresponsible and damaging not to acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>Let us have some prognosis about prices.  They are important issues here.  There is evidence that the rate of inflation due to world commodity prices is diminishing.  Inflation from that source is diminishing.  We are at a moment which is important in our economic history.  We are in a transitional period from one kind of inflation to another.  We must affirm that from this side of the House.  The propulsion for inflation up to the present and for a little longer has been an imported increase due to the spiralling prices of commodities in not only oil, but in many others.  We may be in transition to a form of inflation which is led by an internal wages explosion.  The crucial thing is to access the cause of inflation at different times.  That poses real questions for us of a type that were referred to by the Taoiseach in the latter part of his speech, and which I will not amplify now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the objective features in the inflation <Col N="2393" /> in which we find ourselves.  Before moving off that subject, I want to make one exortation to Deputies and to the people of this country as a whole.  It is not fair to make comparisons between this country and other countries of the EEC and other comparable countries in the world.  It is obligatory to make those comparisons. I have had occasion to travel to Brussels for meetings of the Council of Ministers and to other countries.  I am thereby enabled to realise that here in Ireland we are not aware, as many other countries are, of the depth of the economic crisis now gripping the world which is the most serious crisis which has existed since the last war.  In that situation our performance is a relatively good one.  It does not help to talk us down, it does not help to pretend that difficulties do not exist.  We have a set of four interrelated difficulties.  One is inflation, much of which is imported.  One is interest rates at an historically high level in the world, which again is totally outside our control and is nothing to do with us.  Another is the matter of shortages of oil and of other commodities.  Another is the question of agriculture which is in profound difficulties here and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not help marvelling at the shortness of memory when I was listening to Deputy Faulkner talking about agriculture.  Surely he must recollect that it was under the leadership of his Party, with Deputy J. Lynch as Taoiseach, that the farmers of Ireland were misled in the most profound and irresponsible way as to their expectations in the European Economic Community.  When I and others tried to indicate that it was not exactly as it was being presented to them, I was offered physical violence to prevent me from putting my point of view.  Now, two years later, Deputy Faulkner has forgotten the irresponsibility of a Government of which he was a member.  He wants to belabour us, and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries for difficulties which have arisen in the Community and which were there to be seen as dangers by anyone who was willing to look at them objectively.  It is irresponsible <Col N="2394" /> of course and short-sighted. It is an example of the lack of serious criticism which is so depressing.</P>
    <P>Now, let us ask ourselves where we are in the evolution of our economy and what we should be doing.  Our task is to keep up growth.  Perhaps I am wasting too much time replying to criticism which were so unresearched and irresponsibly voiced but this is giving me the opportunity to read on to the record something about our growth performance at this moment as a small, weak and under-developed and peripheral economy.  I am quoting from the <i>OECD Economic Outlook,</i> No. 15 of July, 1974, published yesterday.  Figures given in tables 1 and 2 on pages 9 and 10 for growth of real gross national products in seven major countries for 1974 according to the EEC: In the United States, minus half per cent; in Japan, minus 1½ per cent; in the United Kingdom, minus 2 per cent; taking a group of seven major countries as a whole, positive growth for 1974 estimated at ½ per cent; the Netherlands, 2¾ per cent; Denmark, 2½ per cent, the total OECD, plus 1 per cent of positive growth; in that time Ireland, 3½ per cent.  Ireland in fact is well up in the league table, exceeded by a few countries in the OECD.  We are getting significant growth when major countries are not doing so.  What should we do?  We have a spectrum of alternatives.  That growth was projected by the OECD and there are projections which put it a little higher.  That sort of growth is desirable and in the end it is the only way that we can have a real increase in income for all the people, and particularly the most disadvantaged.  What should we do?</P>
    <P>There are interest rates at historic high levels in the world; there is the emergence in all countries of balance of payment deficits; there is a difficulty about borrowing; there are divergent views about what we should do; there is a view that we should cool the economy.  Deputy Faulkner expressed the view that part of inflation was due to budgetary policy.  If that is right, then less spending and less investment would have some tiny effect on inflation. There would, of course, be a proshi <Col N="2395" /> cess the other way, because if you cool the economy suddenly and if you reduce production, you increase unit costs.  In fact, we have been able to stay competitive because our production has been rising so fast that we have had a good control over unit costs.  That was one way to do it.</P>
    <P>We could, of course, push on at the other extreme, not cooling the economy, not going for deflation.  The British have decided that they cooled it too much a few months ago.  Their Chancellor said that later in the year he would refiate quite considerably. He had a marginally reflationary activity a few days ago.  We could cool it but it would be ridiculous and at the cost of growth, jobs, exports and wealth that we need to make people better off.  There is an extremely rapid slowing of growth all over the world. On page 9 of the <i>OECD Economic Outlook</i> they say that the OECD area has just gone through the most exceptional deceleration of growth ever experienced.  That has not happened to us but it has happened to the OECD as a whole.  We could stay neutral in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>We had some advice from financiers and banks.  Banks are primarily concerned about money as distinct from the economy as a whole.  They are naturally cautious and correct.  If we read the economic history of the world this century, we will see that sometimes caution has been correct and sometimes it has been incorrect. Indeed, if one goes back to the period 1929-1932 it was incorrect with disastrous results.  One could produce quotations from citadels of financial orthodoxy.  If people want to see the argument developed I will refer them to the most recent issue of the <i>Investors' Chronicle,</i> which is hardly a radical organ, which talks about the need for reflection now.  Not for a neutral approach to the economy, not for any further deflation but to reflate. I think that is correct and the right balance.</P>
    <P>I notice what the various financial and other advisers say.  I notice also that Britain is talking about reflating. I notice there is some evidence of a <Col N="2396" /> slowing of the rate of inflation in commodities.  There is some evidence of a drop in interest rates.  It is not a time in my view for allowing unemployment to rise or for our growth to stagnate.  That is my analysis of the sort of approach, in very broad terms, which we ought to have to our economic policy at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about the issue of minerals and petroleum because it has already been referred to.  Although I do not propose to talk in detail now I feel I should put something on the record before we go into recess for the summer.  In changing the taxation code for mining companies this Government have already clearly demonstrated their intention to ensure that our resources are developed in accordance with a régime which gives fair shares to the public at large as well as to the business interests concerned.  It seems to me that this is especially necessary in the case of those minerals which are State owned.  State-owned minerals are as much the property of the people of Ireland as the gold bars in the vaults of the Central Banks are the property of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We will be quite happy to remunerate handsomely those who have the technical competence and the other expertise and resources to develop our minerals.  We have to keep things in balance.  We have to give our primary concern to seeing that the public interest is preserved.  It is not enough that those who are exploiting our mineral resources should simply give employment.  It is not enough that large sums of money should be spent in particular localities at a given time. We have to see to it that the return to the State and to the people is commensurate with the value of the minerals in question.</P>
    <P>It was admitted in the past by a number of people involved in the mining business that the tax concessions which were enjoyed until recently by the mining companies were quite unnecessary to induce them to undertake prospecting in Ireland.  The abolition of the tax concessions will do no harm to our mineral development; indeed will do no harm and has done no harm to <Col N="2397" /> the interests of our industrial development. We have already stated, and I reiterate, that we have no intention of discouraging private prospectors; whenever they are fortunate enough to discover suitable, exploitable ore bodies they can be assured that they will receive leases which will reward them well for their efforts.  I should also like to reiterate that we do not regard it as acceptable that our minerals should be simply ripped out of the ground and sent abroad to be processed for the benefit of others. Wherever it is possible to do so, we must ensure that the maximum value is added to our raw materials, which include minerals, so that the greatest volume of employment is given to our people.  There may have been things like feasibility studies in the past and even expressions of hope.  It is my intention to ensure that these plans become a reality.  The same considerations will guide the Government in deciding the arrangements for the development of our oil resources.  I hope to announce those arrangements later this year.  Again, the essential fact of which we cannot lose sight is that these resources belong to the people; that there is room for private enterprise, of whatever nationality, in helping us develop these resources.  What we will be looking to is the public interest and the overall national good.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we are fortunate coming on the scene at this time, in that we can learn from the unhappy experiences and the mistaken activities of other countries because resources have been exploited in an unthinking way.  Indeed, sometimes people have enjoyed brief periods of false prosperity only to revert to a position of stagnation and poverty.  We are determined that nothing like this will happen in Ireland; we will have orderly development of our oil resources, planned in such a way as to give maximum advantage to the Irish people and the minimum of social disharmony or disruption.</P>
    <P>Let us put the thing in perspective of actual discoveries.  To date we have one gas find of reasonable dimensions in our offshore areas.  That is all&mdash;a show of oil but no commercial oil.  Our decision as to how this should be used <Col N="2398" /> was, I believe, soundly based on a true assessment of the most pressing needs of the Irish economy because we have done two things with it.  First of all, it is essential that our fertiliser factories should not be dependent on feed stock from abroad.  The allocation of gas which we have given to NET will ensure that it will at all times be able to provide a good and reliable service at reasonable prices to the Irish farming community, which is such a vital element in our economy. I think that is the only prudent step in the ongoing world situation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, surely the events of the last quarter of last year must remind us of how heavily dependent we are on imported energy?  It was for this reason that we decided to allocate the remainder of the gas to the Electricity Supply Board for use in a very large electricity generating station of 750 megawatts.  This will not safeguard us against future difficulties which may arise in regard to oil supplies for electricity generation because it will not substitute for all of our imported oil.  But it is clearly a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I have already warned against exaggerated optimism in regard to our offshore oil resources.  While the available evidence suggests that our prospects of finding oil and gas may be good&mdash;we have found some gas&mdash;one can never be sure until a great deal of drilling has actually taken place. One is only completely certain when one finds the well and gets the stuff ashore.  In any event, even if we do find oil, the benefits to be derived for us will depend very much on how we manage those resources.  It must be evident looking around the world that there have been countries which have exported a great deal of oil and got precious little for it.  There is no substitute for the human industry, skill and ingenuity properly organised.  No matter how many oil strikes we may have, we must never lose sight of this need to organise correctly.  There is plenty of evidence from other parts of the world to show that having oil does not mean a great deal; it is how one uses it and how mindful one is of the real needs of the people that <Col N="2399" /> determines how much real economic and social value can be derived from it.  Therefore, I want to sound a note of caution and indicate those guidelines now.  Of course, the finding of a show of oil, along with the gas, indicates that oil and gas do occur. They do not always occur together in a particular field, but the fact that they are both occurring together, even though the quantity of oil is not commercially significant, is encouraging.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn not to the question of the Contraception Bill itself, because I have said my piece about that&mdash;I am on the record in that respect and I was as clear and explicit as possible&mdash;rather, I want to turn to the larger question which it raises, which is that of the single party, what I would call a monolithic party versus the idea of a coalition.  As I listened to the end of Deputy Faulkner's speech I heard a great deal of thumping of the idea of coalition, of this Coalition certainly, but he was thumping the very idea of coalition as an inherently bad form of government.</P>
    <P>I think we should have in this country a real debate on that subject. I do not mean the ritual type of abuse that each side hurls at the other; I mean that we should talk it through in a serious way.  First, I think that no single party is going to govern alone in this country for any foreseeable period in the future of any relevance to any of us here.  The public are becoming better and better educated, more critical, and wanting more and more to be told&mdash;to use an Americanism, they want of their politicians that they should tell it like it is.  I think they are getting sick of the protestations of formal unity which they know covers many different strands, trends and opinions. They are also getting sick of the suppression of those differences, because it is my conviction that that is not what society needs.  I will amplify the positive side of it in a moment.</P>
    <P>Let me give just one indication of what I mean about suppression of opinion.  When I spoke on the Contraception Bill I took a position which I know is not shared by very many <Col N="2400" /> of my colleagues to the extent that I wanted to go further than the Bill and I criticised it as being in my view insufficient.  But since then I have had two Members of Fianna Fáil congratulate me on my speech and say that it expressed their opinion.  There were two Fianna Fáil Members who said that to me privately&mdash;not that the Bill expressed their opinion but that my version of what we ought to have did so.  I think that for them to say so privately to me and then vote as they did is hypocrisy.</P>

      <P>I am saying that there were two Fianna Fáil people who voted one way, yet expressed to me an opposite opinion.  I am not putting the finger on Fianna Fáil.  I am saying that, if we have this monolithic idea in our minds, then we are suppressing differences like that which seem to be the very lifeblood of democracy and of change.</P>
      <P>I now want to affirm some things for the record about coalition which I have not always said in public but in fact will surprise nobody.  In regard to the Government, of which I have both the honour and pleasure to be a member, yes, we differ&mdash;we do not always agree.  Is that a great reflection? Is that something strange?  Was there ever a Government the members of which did not differ?  Yes, we compromise, all of us.  Was there ever a Government the members of which did not have to compromise? Yes, we have inputs into our discussions which represent different strands of our society and different social attitudes.  Yes, we do.  Was there ever a Government where that did not happen?  Is it desirable to have a Government where that does not happen?</P>
      <P>Let us look a little at the world outside this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2401" /> Let us leave the United Kingdom and recently burgeoning ideas about coalition there aside for a moment. In the European Parliament the Opposition are in the same grouping as the de Gaullists who have been in Government with Giscard d'Estaing and other independents in France.  Social Democrats and Free Democrats have been in government together in Germany and both France and Germany have had remarkable economic growth.  In Japan, where there has been an economic miracle, an extraordinary economic success, there is public discussion of the different strands and factions within the ruling party and with different leaders.  There is nothing strange about this.</P>
    <P>Of course there are differences inside our own party and there are differences, too, within Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, but why should we pretend to the public that there is no such difference?  If we did not have differences we would not have viable parties.  Therefore why the image of the monolith when it does not correspond to the reality?  What are the problems in the world at present? There is the problem of change because of the rate at which change is accelerating.  There is on the book stands a book called <i>Future Shock.</i> This publication is available in paper back and while it might be to some extent a superficial presentation, even a casual reading of it will indicate the rate of acceleration of new techniques and new knowledge in the world.</P>
    <P>There is the problem of democracy which is a problem of representing in the decision-making process all the different strands in society.  If there are not inputs from the different strands, the differences cannot be reconciled in a way that is non-destructive. This incorporation of the different strands must be attempted at the decision-making stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand how that question could be dealt with on a socialist basis, on a declension from Marx to Galbraith, as the Minister is on record as having done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be happy to discuss those matters with the Deputy on another occasion but I cannot see that they have any relevance to what I am saying.  The Government require inputs from many different sectors of society because the changing roles of different sectors must be kept from reaching open conflict proportions. One must endeavour to reconcile them at the decision-making stage. If we are talking of Ireland rather than of the world in general there is the problem of unity.  Unity may be a distance away but we should be planning in everything we do for a situation in which there is unity.  If one does not accept the idea of coalition, of different inputs from different peoples, how can one visualise the sort of government we would have in a united country?  It would have to be a coalition government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the short-lived Government of Northern Ireland which was comprised of the Faulkner Unionists, the Alliance Party and the SDLP, a Government which represented different strands, was a better Government than the other monolithic unified Unionist Party because the single party of the Unionists could not respond to the needs of another section of the community whereas the Executive could and did so.</P>
      <P>I am not merely admitting the things I have said about our coalition.  I am affirming them because they are not weaknesses, they are strengths.  They are the guarantee that we can respond at the decision-making stage to the different pressures in society and not impose anything on any one sector. Therefore they are a guarantee that our society can evolve without ferocious burst-ups and confrontations.  A coalition of different interests&mdash;mine at one end and at the other end whoever one wishes to name&mdash;are useful and are reconcilable.  We compromise and we accept less than we want.  We do so because we are concerned to settle for some progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Opposition who were in Government will know that when one is in Government, one acts for the whole people and that inputs from different sectors are essential.  I will accept in coalition things that I do not like particularly.  I will even accept in coalition some things which, in some respects in matters of policy, are no better than what was done by our predecessors in government.  I will do this, provided I can get some of what I want.  If anybody should ask the question as to whether Fine Gael or Labour are winning, the answer would be that neither party is winning.  If either party started to win we could not continue but we can continue honourably so long as our Coalition remains in a relationship which accepts the different inputs of the different sectors and which have the determination to compromise.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude by saying a word in regard to the Taoiseach, since this is his Estimate.  In recent days the Taoiseach has received some praise but also a good deal of criticism.  In regard to the contraception Bill the Taoiseach and I have disagreed and have walked in opposite directions into the lobby. That is not something I am particularly happy about.  Neither must it be said that any of us can praise himself for political astuteness or cuteness, but as far as I am concerned we had an indication that where there was a choice between what I am calling political cuteness and manoeuvre on the one hand and the decision of conscience&mdash;a decision with which I disagree but which I recognise as a decision of conscience&mdash;the decision of conscience triumphed over the cuteness. Obvious cute get outs would be very easy to think of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2404" /> I am glad that the Taoiseach has come in because I wish to say that in the 16 months during which I have been in office, I have found him to be a fair man, I have found him to be a just chairman of a group of people who are not identical but who have agreed to work together honourably, who have affirmed that they will compromise and who believe that this is a good thing to do in our social circumstances.</P>
    <P>It could be said that the Taoiseach does not talk enough to people.  I might even say that he does not talk enough to me, but I am certain that this is not because I am a member of the Labour Party.  He may not talk even to people in Fine Gael, because this reluctance on his part is his nature and does not stem from any differentiation between the two parties.  I am sorry if I am embarrassing the Taoiseach by making these remarks, but having said this I want to affirm for any section of the Labour Party or of the people of Ireland who may take note of what I say that I have experienced justice, fair treatment, a sense of equality and a feeling that the input of the peculiar thing which I happen to represent in Irish political life has been represented in government.  I do not expect this peculiar thing to triumph over the views of the people because I realise that I represent a small sector of the opinion of this country.  It is a valuable sector and I am pleased that, through me and through people who agree with me, this view can be represented in proportion to its strength.  I am not only prepared but proud to go on serving under the Taoiseach because I am convinced of that fairness, of that sense of justice and of willingness to permit and to encourage the representation of the different strands which are properly and explicitly in his Government.</P>
    <P>If people think that these statements of mine or that the discussions of the recent past are a source of weakness I can say that so far as I am concerned they are a source of strength, that the presence of a monolithic unity deceives nobody, least of all the public.  We have the strength, <Col N="2405" /> built on the recognition of our differences and the honourable preparedness of all of us to meet each other, to listen to each other, and to compromise. It is for generating the atmosphere in which all of us in Government believe that to be possible that I think the Taoiseach is going to remain Taoiseach for a very long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be mercifully brief&mdash;a great deal briefer than previous speakers.  I have waited a long time to get in on this debate.  I intend, of course, to vote for the National Coalition tomorrow and I wish to explain briefly why I intend to do so, despite my misgivings about it.</P>
      <P>The record of the National Coalition in the field of social welfare, housing and health is extraordinarily remarkable given that it has been less than 18 months in office.  Deputy O'Brien quite correctly drew attention to this. The Coalition have succeeded in presenting the country with what the unfortunate Mr. Dubcek described as &ldquo;socialism with a human face&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This process has been generated largely by Members of the Labour Party and by some surprising recruits to socialism, such as the Minister for Finance.  Here I must say a word in praise of the Minister, with due respect to Deputy Faulkner.  The manner in which the Minister for Finance has been blamed for the economic condition of the country is quite ridiculous, as anyone with any knowledge of the EEC, like myself, knows.</P>
      <P>The public is naturally concerned with rises in prices, but understandably it does not realise that these rises are not in any way the fault of the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They are the fault of external economic pressures, such as the energy crisis and the effective devaluation of the English pound, the French franc and the Italian lira.  In these circumstances, the increase in the price of food to the ordinary housewife derives solely and exclusively from external economic conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I begin to attack the Taoiseach in his presence, which I regret I <Col N="2406" /> have to do, I wish to say to my colleagues on the Fianna Fáil benches that I find it slightly nauseating to see Deputies Meaney and Collins, for example, continually attacking this Government for fluctuations in agricultural prices.  These are simply and solely a function of our membership of the EEC and of the external terms of trade.  In this situation the Labour Party&mdash;and the Labour Party alone of the three parties in this House&mdash;have their hands clean.</P>
    <P>I have made many criticisms of the Taoiseach, who is the key figure in this Adjournment Debate.  At the outset I wish to make one thing clear.  I do not intend to repeat the mistake of my former colleague who is still my friend, Senator Noel Browne, who brought back into office the Fianna Fáil Party in 1951 at the cost of precipitating on the country the most damaging, savage, vicious budget ever produced in 1952 by the former Deputy MacEntee.  I was not brought into the world or dragged into politics to bring the Fianna Fáil Party back into power.</P>
    <P>Having said that, may I comment on one specific point in the events of Thursday, 11th July.  I intend to vote confidence in the Cabinet on the tweedle dum Deputy Cosgrave/tweedle dee Deputy Lynch principle that &ldquo;bad as we are, they are even worse&rdquo;. After nearly 40 unbroken years of power they have reduced this country to a state where it has an emigration and unemployment rate which we inherited as a coalition.  I remain an unrepentent believer in coalition.  I agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it is impossible to conceive of a situation where a party will win an overall majority in the foreseeable future.  In those circumstances coalition is realistic.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the manner in which we demonstrate our differences of ideological approach is much more honourable than the manner in which the Fianna Fáil Party say one thing in the bar of this House, indulge in smutty humour about women&mdash;I freely admit I also do this&mdash;and then come into this House and vote in a united phlanx <Col N="2407" /> for the preservation of some conception of chastity that went out with the Middle ages.</P>
    <P>I shall speak very briefly in this debate, having consulted my cat.  My cat has attained a certain notoriety in the newspapers today but it was a pure coincidence.  I never anticipated this situation but my cat, which is a constituent of the Tánaiste in County Wexford, is called Foxy.  Perhaps, therefore, I should provide him with honorary membership of the mongrel foxes.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on the matter of Cabinet responsibility.  On Thursday, 11th July, the Taoiseach crossed the floor to vote against his own Bill.  It has been said it was a free vote.  Senator Mary Robinson, who is a professor of penal legislation in Trinity College, has made the point that the constitutionality of the Taoiseach's behaviour is open to question.  The point was made to me that in England similar matters of a sexual nature are dealt with by a free vote.  Very true.  But, in those circumstances in recent years a Member of Parliament, for example, like Mr. Leo Abse, is put forward by the Labour Party to promote a Private Member's Bill and permission is given by Mr. Heath and Mr. Wilson to vote for or against the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that we are in a slightly different situation here and I put it to the Taoiseach&mdash;and I will be interested if he finds time to reply to this point&mdash;that it would be a rather unusual situation if Mr. Wilson were to put up his Home Secretary to propose a Bill on a similar subject and then, to the horror and consternation of Mr. Anthony Wedgewood Benn, enter the lobby with Mr. Edward Heath.  This would be a rather extraordinary constitutional situation.</P>
    <P>It is said that this was a free vote.  I am quoting the Government Chief Whip, Professor Kelly, on 4th July, 1974&mdash;Official Report, column 331:</P>
    <P>I will say it once more.  The free vote on which the Government have decided is intended to allow Deputies who have conscientious objections to <Col N="2408" /> this Bill not to support it without fear of disciplinary reprisal.  That is all.  It still remains a Government measure and I interpret it, in my job as Whip, to make sure that a Deputy who has not got a conscientious objection, or does not claim such a thing, will support it.</P>
    <P>I repeat: &ldquo;Does not claim such a thing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce made great play with the virtue of telling it as it is.  I think he said with certain disregard for the rules of grammar &ldquo;telling it like it is&rdquo;.  I wonder if the Taoiseach, when he comes to reply to this debate, will tell us if he told anyone &ldquo;like it is&rdquo; about this subject because he certainly did not tell me &ldquo;like it is&rdquo; and intensive inquiries would not suggest to me that he told anyone &ldquo;like it is&rdquo; on this subject.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce express his personal affection and regard for the Taoiseach, affection and regard which I personally used to hold myself.  All I can say in the light of recent events is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has come a long way since 37 Pembroke Lane where I first met him.  I am happy that he still feels this confidence.  I have never had a great affection for the Taoiseach but I have always felt that if he had inherited one thing from his distinguished father it was absolute, implacable and unbending honesty.</P>
    <P>This problem which faced us on Thursday week does not concern contraception solely.  It concerns the question, as Senator Robinson correctly pointed out, of Cabinet responsibility. If the Taoiseach had risen in his place and said &ldquo;My conscience forbids me to vote for this Bill.  You vote as your, as Deputy Oliver Flanagan would say, uninformed consciences tell you to vote&mdash;you vote for it&rdquo;, then my admiration for the Taoiseach would have gone up.  In fact, the Taoiseach has behaved towards his colleagues which I would find it hard to describe in language which was parliamentary. It certainly displays a lack of trust in the highest degree.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2409" /> There also continues from that problem the matter of Northern Ireland which I think is germane to this debate in which we are permitted to raise broad areas of principle.  In the debate of 11th July the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said that those who would oppose the Bill&mdash;I quote:</P>
    <P>will, among other things, be treating with contempt the pleas for freedom of conscience from the Protestant denominations, thus offering a deliberate and calculated affront to those without whose free consent the unity of the people of this island will never be attainable.</P>
    <P>Amongst those people, presumably, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs now includes the Taoiseach.  Yet he soldiers on cheerfully as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and will no doubt be active in the provision of telephone kiosks throughout various constituencies.  Again he said&mdash;column 916 of the Official Report of 11th July, 1974:</P>
    <P>Consider what the effect of a defeat of this Bill would be on those relations between Catholics and Protestants, and on any prospects of achieving that unity which we are all agreed&mdash;whether we may think it near or remote&mdash;can only be attained by the consent of those who now strongly reject it, and who would see in the defeat of this Bill the plainest and most obvious justification of that rejection.</P>
    <P>It has been rejected.  The Minister soldiers on.  He meets Mr. Orme.  He meets Mr. Abse.  He meets all the other English Labour people who come over here and he tries in some obscure way to justify the incredible performance which this House laid on on Thursday week.</P>
    <P>I say the same of my absent friend, Deputy Blaney, perhaps the most strident Republican in this House. Quite how he justifies forcing nearly one million Protestants into this community and at the same time denying them what they regard as a fundamental natural right, I really do not know.</P>
    <P>I would also make the point that <Col N="2410" /> what the Government with the co-operation of the Fianna Fáil Party have succeeded in doing is producing for at least six months a situation so legally laughable that it would be funny if it were not tragic.  As I understand the present situation&mdash;and my reference for this is the Minister for Justice, if he is still Minister for Justice; I am not quite sure&mdash;anyone can import contraceptives into this country for his own use and may freely distribute them but they may not be sold in the State.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the European Parliament.  I am not a lawyer, thank God.  As I understand this law it means that I as a member of the European Parliament can bring back a cabin trunk-load of contraceptives on every flight I go on, go through the red corridor, declare them, be duly passed on the ground that they are for my own use since I am exceptionally virile, and then distribute them at will to single or married people of any age, sex, denomination or description that you could think of&mdash;and this is what Deputy Oliver Flanagan voted for.</P>
    <P>The point about that Bill was that it was a restrictive Bill and not a permissive Bill.  When it reached the Committee Stage an opportunity would have arisen for those of us who feel like I do, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce does, that it was excessively restrictive to make amendments to it and in those circumstances those who felt that we were wrong could have voted against it.  As it is, by a coalition&mdash;that dirty word&mdash;a coalition of that well-organised regiment of Soldiers of Destiny on that side of the House and the Knights of Columbanus on this side of the House we have a situation where I can flog the country with contraceptives in the morning provided I do not receive 6p in return for them.  In those circumstances I think the House has rendered itself ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I want to get off that subject.  That is all I am going to say about that. Nothing remains to be said.  I want to say a word about a subject in which I am particularly interested, that is, <Col N="2411" /> education.  Our record in education is deplorable.  The speech of the Minister for Education on comprehensive schools, in Thurles, coupled with the attitude of the Minister for Education on inter-denominational education in Dalkey, coupled with the attitude of the Minister to corporal punishment, every one of which three flies in the face of Labour Party policy, makes me concerned as to whether there can be any reasonable hope of progress being achieved in the educational field under Deputy Richard Burke as Minister for Education. I speak here with some experience as a teacher and the husband of a teacher.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, may I finally say why I am going to vote with the Coalition tomorrow.  I emphasise with the Coalition, not the Taoiseach.  I am voting for the Coalition because of their achievements in the field of social welfare and health.  I think the Taoiseach has behaved in an extraordinary manner.  He has been attacked in every daily newspaper have read for the way in which he behaved.  Even <i>The Sunday Independent,</i> reputedly a Fine Gael newspaper, said before the Bill came up that it should be put through and after the Bill was defeated ignominiously that the Taoiseach should exert his well-known conscience to the extent of stepping down.  We have a precedent for that, an honourable one, in the case of General Mulcahy <i>vis-á-vis</i> ex-Deputy John A. Costello.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, may I say to my friends on the Fianna Fáil benches that I have no difficulty going into the lobbies tomorrow to vote for the National Coalition.  For 40 years Fianna Fáil ruled this country.  They brought it practically to its knees.  They made speeches about strapping youths and comely maidens dancing at the crossroads while the reality, as my late friend Brendan Scott pointed out, was that the strapping youths and comely maidens were going over to England to dig roads in MacAlpines's Fusiliers and the comely maidens were going over to get back-street abortions or become the biggest suppliers of <Col N="2412" /> immigrant prostitutes to London.  I have no time for the well-heeled machine&mdash;for once I agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;which last week, with the co-operation of a number of renegades from our side, destroyed this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I want to know is there to be a withdrawal of the statement regarding our Irish girls who have gone to England as nurses and have proved themselves to be wonderful young women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Many so.  I quite agree with Deputy Loughnane.  We have a wonderful record of missionary work and we have a wonderful record of overseas teaching work.  Nobody knows this better than Deputy Loughnane and myself, but the fact remains of illegitimacy, fornication&mdash; as Deputy O'Malley would say&mdash; adultery and abortion.  All these things have been swept under the carpet of Irish life even as we banned successive novelists in our time.  I do not want to be encouraged to digress from the subject but even as we now fume about the fate of Solzhenitsyn while we have O'Casey and McGahern on our consciences that makes me laugh.  No, Sir. I will do nothing to give aid and comfort to a party which for 40 years kept this country in a condition that it could only sustain roughly 2.8 million people, most of whom were in squalor and poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mood of the country is that the National Coalition have achieved things in the realm of social welfare, health and housing which justify their retention in office.  I remain, because I can count, an ardent coalitionist.  Whatever personal ill-feeling may exist between me and the Taoiseach because of what happened on July 11th&mdash;and a considerable amount, at least as far as I am concerned, does exist&mdash;my vote tomorrow night can be in no doubt.  I nevertheless feel that it is a sorry state for this nation that we should be brought into a situation where we should be confronted by two alternative leaders one of whom treats (a) an area of intense private morality and conscience, (b) the Supreme Court <Col N="2413" /> and (c) the Constitution, with contempt &mdash;I refer to Deputy Lynch&mdash;and on the other side a Taoiseach who fails to give leadership to people who expected it. If I may compete with Deputy Flanagan in my knowledge of the Bible may I say, as the Good Book says: &ldquo;All we, like sheep, were led astray&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that when the vote comes tomorrow night in the arithmetical mechanics of democracy, the Coalition will survive and be the Government after the vote.  I am equally sure that it will be a consolation to the Taoiseach and to the more responsible members on the opposite side of the House that that majority will not be dependent on one vote.  I do not intend to follow the last contribution.  It, in itself, is a comment on parliamentary democracy.</P>
      <P>My purpose in rising in this debate is to deal with some administrative matters which would not possibly be, in the political sense, controversial but before I do so I am moved to go back to some parts of the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As usual his contribution was reasoned and material for argument. I certainly do not accept his thesis.  It is difficult to say, if one is having a reasonable argument with a man, that you do not accept anything that he says, but if I understand his thesis aright I am not in agreement with it.  However, I understand the thoughts that prompted it and indeed they stimulated me to say what I am going to say on the question of coalitions.  I understand the Minister's point.  Let us realise here that times change and we change with them, that there are problems for Government today and for democracy that are different, different in kind as well as in current form, from those which existed 20 years ago or more.  Nevertheless, I still feel there are certain principles of human psychology that rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here again Deputy Keating in a modern context has raised the old question of the strength and the weakness of coalition government. <Col N="2414" /> He referred more than once to what he called the pretence of monolithic strength that the traditional system of parties have.  I can understand the reasons that prompted him to this line of thought in current circumstances. It is quite true that in the present day order is breaking down and that it is very difficult to get that order and coherent action in groups and individuals that gives effective results.  It was much easier to get it in the past but the complaint then, with perhaps some justification, was that the imposition of order, regularity and the facilitating of decision making tended to hardness and inhumanity in effect.</P>
    <P>We are now back to the old chestnut. What can one do?  In such a case one has to appeal to experience.  Down the years the system of government, by which you have a Government and an Opposition in Parliament, both with a homogeneous support, the Government having the greater support and therefore the power of decision, has worked. No matter how enthusiastic or critical one is of what has been done in the past in this country for more than 50 years in relation to the successive governments which have ruled this country, with all their defects and failures, one can look back at a record of peaceful and constructive progress, of which we can all speak proudly, in this part of the country.  I say that without distinction or claim for either side of this House because we have all sat on both sides of the House and in our own way all politicians and parties of this country have shared in this.</P>
    <P>I remember on this side of the House a very well-known politician in his own time, not of my party, defended politicians and their efforts, and I think that defence is justified by the record. I do not want to go into the details of the weaknesses and the strength of Coalition.  The Taoiseach, and I, who are both present in the House at the moment, and who are among the older Members, can remember the cut and thrust of this argument and the points of view held.  It will be agreed that there are merits in the Coalition idea and in the theory of it.  There is even <Col N="2415" /> an appeal in it, but in practical terms there are weaknesses that leave it less effective to carry out the work of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating spoke about the sharing of decision making, but decisions have to be made and they are very difficult to make in committees that are not in complete agreement. Delay in decision making, or lack of homogeneity in purpose, must always tend to defeat effective action.  It must always bring in weakness at critical moments.  That, in a nutshell, is why Coalitions are vulnerable.  On the other hand, I admit that the system of homogeneity in Opposition and in Government through the party system, can also be criticised.  Time will not permit it now&mdash;indeed it would need more cut and thrust across the House&mdash; but I would like to have engaged in debate with the Minister for Industry and Commerce about how this affects the present moment.</P>
    <P>I will summarise what I have to say about coalition and I hope I am as objective as possible.  We have had experience of coalition and minority Governments which were not coalitions. They were weak enough, but we have had experience of two coalitions, both of which broke up in difficult circumstances.  I am not making any claim for our party, but it was fortunate that there was a homogeneous Opposition to take up again and carry on.  That is a fact of history. It happened twice.</P>
    <P>I look forward with trepidation to the experience where the Opposition, too, could become a coalition and where the politics of this House could degenerate into a kind of political musical chairs of &ldquo;I am with you today over there; you are against me tomorrow over here while I have another party to hold me up.&rdquo;  While that game is going on there is not much time or energy available to devote to Government business and in regard to running the country it is an operation of being asleep.  I fear for the country if it should ever come to that.  I would throw the ball of the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="2416" /> back in the court and say that his analysis is interesting as far as it goes.  I understand his approach but he has got to go further now and deal with some of the points I am putting up.</P>

      <P>I am talking about coalition here.  We have a constitutional set-up.  We have to realise we are working within a certain constitutional framework.  If you are going to change the whole constitutional framework and approach, sin ceist eile.  I am dealing with the problem we have here today.</P>
      <P>I want to touch on a subject, which is relevant, but which it is distasteful for me to mention.  As a preface, let me say that the remarks of the Minister for Industry and Commerce about his Leader do credit to both of them.  When I make these criticisms I am about to make now I would like the Taoiseach to understand this is in no way intended as a reflection on his integrity, motive or anything else, but I see it as another weakness of coalition government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This free vote that people are talking about here appears to me to have been a device to escape the difficulties of a decision within a coalition because there was a problem here. This was not merely a question of bringing in something that could be taken or left and which if not passed would not leave unsolved an urgent problem that had suddenly developed. Confronting the Government there was what one might call an emergency created by a court decision&mdash; something not unknown in the history of democratic Government&mdash;a case where something had to be done&mdash;or so it appeared to most people.  It was a matter of public importance.  It is not right for us to go into details about personal conscience or private morality but we are concerned with public order and morality and public problems.  Here was one such problem. If the Government had decided to do nothing, as governments sometimes do in certain circumstances, <Col N="2417" /> that would have been their privilege, but we had the position of a Government Minister bringing in a Bill to deal with a public problem.  Attempts to deal with this problem in advance by private Bills were severely&mdash;and I think rightly&mdash;criticised on the grounds that this was not a proper matter for private effort in the Seanad or here.</P>
    <P>My quarrel is with the Government, not with the Taoiseach, for bringing in such a Bill and seeking to evade responsibility by saying: &ldquo;Let us have a free vote.&rdquo;  That political manoeuvre would probably have worked if the Opposition went along with it and there was a free vote everywhere.  If that had happened the result might be quite different. The point is that here again we have another indication of the weakness of coalition government.  I am not making this point merely to seize on the present to beat the Government with it but in direct answer to the arguments of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Here is another case of paralysis of decision.  It has had consequences that are not very happy for parliamentary democracy here.  In saying that I hope I am refraining from anything in the nature of personal criticism of anybody concerned in this: I have no inclination towards such criticism.</P>
    <P>This party has been criticised for voting as a solid <i>bloc</i>.  It is true that there would have been differences of opinion and if it had been a free vote you would doubtless have had people of all parties on all sides of the House.  On a free vote, some of us might have moved in the opposite direction for good and sufficient reasons, but in a matter of this nature one has to consider what the effect would be on the future as well as the issue involved.  I shall not go into the issue itself but on that I could give very good reasons why one would not vote for the Bill as it was.  But, apart from that, a very good reason for what this party did was to maintain the possibility of ordered democracy here and show, as an Opposition should, the weakness inherent in a system that was in our view causing <Col N="2418" /> a Government to abdicate its responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is only one thing I should like to say about the Taoiseach personally. It is that I deplore many of the unkind things that have been said but the Taoiseach is the Leader of the Government and of the country.  He appoints Ministers.  Surely it is a leader's duty to lead and if a Taoiseach is not in agreement with what emanates from his Government he has a duty either to lead the Government in the direction which he believes right or else make the necessary changes that will enable him to lead.  That is as far as one should go, but it is a valid, constitutional&mdash;if you like&mdash;public criticism. I deplore the private criticisms and I very much deplore certain unkindnesses that I heard before I spoke.  I understand the Taoiseach's problems.  He has a coalition but he cannot abdicate his own responsibility as leader.  I do not envy him his task in leading the Coalition, especially one that is so obviously non-homogeneous in its structure, a Coalition for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce with reason and with skill&mdash;I admire him&mdash;had to make the apology that he made this evening.  I say that in no way slighting the Minister, because much of his argument is stimulating and constructive.</P>
    <P>I now come to something that I fear is affecting all the tendencies of Government here and which constituted my primary reason for speaking tonight. I would not have embarked on what I have said had I not been stimulated by the two previous speakers to speak as I have spoken.  While irrelevancies or traditional noises are being made we are progressively losing in this House control of the administration of the country, and, worse still, in times when that control is becoming, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, much more difficult from a political point of view and from an administrative point of view almost impossible. The result is that the whole load is put back on the permanent service.  We shall all be quick enough to blame the permanent service.  I dealt with this on another occasion on which I pointed <Col N="2419" /> out the balance between the permanent service, the political arm and so forth in the working of the economy.</P>
    <P>Time will not permit much discussion although I have to raise this on this Estimate.  The public ordering of the House is a matter for the Taoiseach. We made a bad mistake in the House years ago in doing away with the Vote on Account.  For two years in succession within a matter of ten minutes we have swept through important financial business without any debate, in the pious hope that we would deal with it in the future.  Governments have brought in token Estimates to be discussed afterwards.</P>
    <P>When I came into the House first we had a Vote on Account where one surveyed the whole prospects of the expenditure and social and administrative and economic policy of the country for a year ahead.  They were individual Estimates.  There were time-limits.  The House had to get through the business and the business was got through.  I know that there are political and mechanical difficulties now which were not there then. It is going too far to the other extreme when last year&mdash;and not for the first time in case I should be accused of criticising only this Government&mdash;many Estimates were rushed through.  On the 12th December, 1973, before the Christmas Recess the following Estimates were rushed through:</P>
    <P>Agriculture (Resumed), Fisheries, Local Government (Resumed), Local Government (Supplementary Estimate), Office of the Minister for Justice, Garda Síochána, Prisons, Courts, Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, Charitable Donations and Bequests, Industry and Commerce, Department of the Taoiseach, President's Establishment, Houses of the Oireachtas, Central Statistics Office, Comptroller and Auditor General, Office of the Minister for Finance, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, State Laboratory, Civil <Col N="2420" /> Service Commission, An Comhairle Ealaíon, Superannuation and Retired Allowances, Secret Service, Agricultural Grants, Law Charges, Miscellaneous expenses.  Stationery Office, Valuation and Ordnance Survey, Rates on Government Property, Roinn na Gaeltachta, Transport and Power, Health, Social Welfare (Supplementary Estimate).</P>
    <P>We also had the Appropriation Bill. The whole financial business of the country was rushed through by this House in ten minutes.</P>
    <P>The one comment made on it was that the Dáil, according to Order, went into Committee on Finance, and resumed consideration of Estimates for the Public Service for the financial year ending on 31st March, 1974.  Mr. Colley said:</P>
    <P>For the record our understanding is in relation to this Vote and subsequent Votes whether they be partly discussed or not, that token Estimates will be introduced after Christmas to enable further debate to take place and, if necessary, a vote.</P>
    <P>As everyone knows although that was agreed that kind of thing works out as a pious hope.  I am saying to the Taoiseach in his capacity as the person who decides the ordering of the House&mdash;although I know the Whips come into it&mdash;that this is not good enough.  It is unfair to the administration. The House has done me the honour of appointing me to the Committee on Public Accounts.  In that capacity I meet the accounting officers and hear of their problems and difficulties. One clearly sees the consequences of the failure to deal with matters in advance.  These people are carrying this load without adequate lead.  They do not get a lead from the House or from the Government.  How can the Government lead adequately if the House is not functioning properly?  It is unfair to the Civil Service as a whole as well as being bad business.</P>
    <P>It is all the more urgent because if the debate on the Comptroller and <Col N="2421" /> Auditor General's office had come up the question of how much staff he has would arise.  If we had the Estimates for the Houses of the Oireachtas I would have an opportunity of discussing them at some length and I hope much more constructively than I am doing now.  I thank the Chair. I know I am running dangerously near the limits of being in order.  I have to do this on the Taoiseach's Estimate because there is no other chance.  The Taoiseach is responsible for the public ordering of the House. This is a criticism of the whole method of the operation in this House. Further consequences of this were seen last night.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill has come and has been dealt with.  We did not get round to discussing certain points in that Bill which should have been discussed. The consequences will be far-reaching. The situation is unsatisfactory both for the House and for the administration. We have passed a Bill that gives in a particular form discretion to the Revenue Commissioners.  There is another section dealing with infringement of the privilege between solicitor and client.</P>
    <P>These difficult and important problems must be mentioned.  The Bill had to go through without these problems being mentioned in the House even though we had an all-night sitting.  In what kind of way are we carrying on our business when a Finance Bill which was introduced late&mdash;although I do not blame that on the Government but on the complexity of it&mdash; is rushed through?  The Opposition have been criticised for obstructing it. We in Opposition criticise the Government for not having enough time spent in dealing with the Bill.  We should stop and say &ldquo;How can we put our own house in order about these matters?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Revenue Commissioners in connection with the Bill. I am taking this opportunity of saying something that has been said before. With the late Deputy Sweetman, who was chairman of the Committee, I was on a Committee dealing with the Income Tax Bill.  It was one of the happiest experience I have had in <Col N="2422" /> this House.  That Committee did their work well.  They were well led by their chairman and excellently served by not only the Attorney General's office at the time but particularly by the staff of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>At that time we were all impressed by the efficiency, the integrity and frankness of Revenue Commissioners and their officers.  I have no hesitation in saying, although I should not do so, that if a prize were to be given to a Department for their qualities, in my opinion the Revenue Commissioners would be awarded the prize. Therefore, what I am saying is in no way a criticism of the Revenue Commissioners. It is a criticism of the House because if the Revenue Commissioners had not problems it would not have been mentioned in the Bill. If the Department of Finance had not had problems, it would not have come into the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other sides to these problems besides the administrative ones. These people see them just as we do. Quite rightly, they look at it from their point of view and expect us, as public representatives, to do our part of the work.  That work was not done so far as this Bill was concerned.  I am afraid this is the tendency in regard to public administration.  The Taoiseach, as head of the Government, must ensure that financial and administrative business comes before the House with sufficient time allowed for it to be debated properly.  Proper collaboration between the permanent services and this House, representing the public and the political elements, should be restored to what it was in former days.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned the Appropriation Act goes through.  Reports from Committees, such as the Committee of Public Accounts, will be laid before the House.  Will these matters be gone into here?  I will not lay all this blame at the door of any Government but our present situation does not help us.  This Government have gone further along the lines laid down by the previous Government and brought in the Department of the Public Service.  The time has come for the Taoiseach to arrange <Col N="2423" /> for this administration problem to be reviewed fully in this House and, if necessary, a committee set up to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I have warned against the device of the free vote as a method of avoiding responsibility.  The device of Commissions and Committees can do the same, but certain types of Bills need the attention of Committees. When one sees the size of this year's Finance Bill one wonders whether this Bill should not, in a preliminary form, have gone through a Select or Special Committee.  That could have helped the House.  In the 1950s and 1960s Committees did a lot of consolidation work with beneficial effects for the administration and the community.  One of the consolidation efforts was the Income Tax Bill, which I mentioned earlier.  Would the Government consider this type of Committee to consider such Bills?</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its indulgence in allowing me to make these remarks which I do not want to be taken as a party controversial matter or as a criticism of a particular Government because this is a criticism of Governments in general.  It is wrong that Bills like this should be rushed through.  The same could be said about the debate on the Northern problem which I will not talk about now because time does not permit.  Deputies should not be limited to time when speaking on such a very important subject.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about sharing in decision-making. How can Deputies share in decision-making if the material does not come before them or, if and when it does, there is not adequate time available to discuss it?  I know there can be the abuse of a filibuster but one has to choose between the lesser of two evils in a case like this.</P>
    <P>I have tried to make two points here tonight.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce reopened in a very interesting way the question of the nature of the Government which we should have here-Coalition or single-party Government, or Coalition and single-party Opposition, and <Col N="2424" /> whether we should have homogeneity on either side or a free vote.  We still have these arguments against Coalition. There is still a strong case in principle and on the record for the concept that there are two sides in a Parliament&mdash;a Government and an Opposition.  A Government effectively functions because it has behind it a reliable and sufficient majority.  If these things are taken in a serious way one can dismiss academic vapourings or personal explanations.</P>

      <P>In regard to this important debate on the Adjournment which was opened by the Taoiseach with a very full and comprehensive speech today, I should like to address a few remarks.  Before saying what I had intended, I should like to refer very briefly to Deputy de Valera's comments in regard to coalition.  He described the present coalition in this country as being unhomogeneous, but I expect that any government is unhomogeneous and the present Government in this country might be described as being as unhomogeneous as is Ireland.  It might be salutary to refer to the experience in European countries and many developed democracies and economies where successful coalition governments have been the order of the day for a great number of years.  I do not see any reason at all to become unduly embroiled in ideology or suggestions that there should be a Right/Left confrontation or anything like that.  I think the present Government are doing well in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting back to the debate, it is important to point out and to support the Taoiseach in his statement at the beginning of his speech that the background in which we are discussing the economy and the running of affairs in this country at the present time is one of international crisis.  That is not using the word in any sensational sense: commentators, political commentators, financial commentators, analysts and respected journalists around the world have been talking about events in the world in the last 12 months and &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; is the word they use.  They talk about a commodity <Col N="2426" /> crisis due to events in the United States and in Russia; they talk about an energy crisis which has caused the greatest upheaval in the economies of the modern world probably in this century and, as a result of which Japan states that they are facing their greatest crisis since World War II. We are talking about serious problems in regard to cattle prices; we are talking about inflation, much of which is global, and we are talking about a background of political instability in many countries and particular problems within the European Economic Community.  It seems to me that against that particular background it is undeniable that in this country we have problems at the present time. But against that particular background there is a degree of stability in the air in this country on which I think we can seek the confidence of the people.</P>
    <P>An OECD Report which was published in March referred to what it believed to be the necessity for policy action to stimulate demand and increase output; that this was a desirable approach.  They suggested also that the balance of payments question and the significance of it should not be exaggerated.  It has also been pointed out that, to a very large degree, the problems at present in the area of balance of payments are those affecting all of the developed, industrial nations occasioned by the enormous increase in oil costs in imports. We have observed the cost to this nation alone in the December quarter when the value of oil imports was £19 million; whereas in the March quarter that had jumped by £20 million to £39 million.</P>
    <P>We have an additional problem in Ireland in comparison with Britain and other European countries in that without the resource of coal and gas we have an undue dependence on fuel oil in our industrial programme, to a degree of 68 per cent as against a dependence in Britain and the European countries of 35 per cent only.  It is against this kind of background in Europe, the United States and Japan that we are discussing the affairs of this country.  On this very small island, <Col N="2427" /> where to a very large degree we are susceptible to the whims of imports and exports and events entirely outside our control, we must measure performance.  There has been criticism voiced in some quarters&mdash;and I think Deputy J. Lynch was one of those today who was critical&mdash;in regard to the level of public expenditure in Ireland.  Here again we must weigh up the economy of this country in comparison with the developed economies of other EEC countries, bearing in mind the level of underdevelopment here; the necessity to create conditions of full employment; to have a level of public expenditure significantly higher than the rate proportionately in the developed countries of Europe such as Britain, Germany, France, Sweden and others.  It is also more important in view of the fact that for obvious reasons there is a lesser level of private investment in this country.  Therefore, it seems to me that, from a social, economic point of view, it is essential that there be venturesome policy at the present time.</P>
    <P>If we talk about the question of how we are going to develop the economy or how we are going to treat the problem of inflation at the moment, are we going to be expansionist, as this Government have been, or are we going to adopt a reflationary economy by the hair shirt approach?  The political question I would pose is this: had the Government adopted a retrenching attitude this year rather than an expansionary one, what would be the position of the Fianna Fáil opposition to such a policy?  Some of them have been attempting to reduce the credibility of government, attempting to provoke a loss of confidence in certain areas. But certainly, had the hair shirt approach been adopted, we would have had a message belted out from the Opposition benches of cutting back on expenditure; cutting back in employment levels; suggestions that this was entirely unnecessary, a pointing to the journals to which I have made reference, such as the OECD Report, which talk about the <Col N="2428" /> necessity to stimulate demand we would have had an entirely different approach.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that on the only occasion on which this Government has in any sense had to go before the public since the general election the general policies of the Government were endorsed by the people because, in the local elections this year&mdash;and one does not blame the Opposition for referring to national policies or what they deem to be the failures of the Government&mdash;these did not get a hearing.  It has been traditional in this country in the past for local elections to go against the government of the day.  It seems to me that the results throughout the entire country were most significant and encouraging to this Government and tend to deflate the words of the prophets of doom.</P>
    <P>We have this problem; there is a crisis in other countries; there is no crisis here but there is a serious problem which we must recognise and which has been referred to in the Central Bank Report.  The Government's point is that it is a question of selecting, not the great way of doing things but the lesser of two evils.  I believe that the method of expansion adopted by the Government is the lesser of two evils.</P>
    <P>It reminds me a little of the debate which took place during the EEC referendum campaign.  One of the weaknesses of that debate was that there was too much polarisation.  There was an attempt, for instance, on the part of the party to which I belong to suggest that EEC membership was one of the greatest things that could happen to this country whereas another party were suggesting that membership would be the ruination of Ireland.  However the sensible approach suggested that joining Europe was merely the lesser of two evils.  This Government's policy in relation to the economy is an identical situation to that which obtained at the time of that referendum and our Government are to be complimented on this approach.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank report refers to the balance of payments problem but, although we have these problems in <Col N="2429" /> this country if we are holding our position relative to the other countries in the free market areas with which we are trading, we are doing all right.  It is in that area that it is imperative to maintain competitiveness for Irish products and that is why it is very important to attempt to hold inflation and to attempt to keep wage demands within bounds.  In that way, the greatest national interest can be served.</P>
    <P>One of our national faults is a tendency to look in isolation at Irish statistics.  It is salutary that in their report the Central Bank pointed out that, while there is a satisfactory export position in Ireland, we are talking of the period during which there was a boom in some of the developed European countries.  It is pointed out, too, in that report that in the last year under review the percentage increase of exports in France and Denmark was 40 per cent while the figure for the Federal Republic of Germany was 46 per cent.  Therefore it puts into context our performance and stresses the necessity to be competitive if we are to hold our own today in the world of economics and if we are to increase the real wealth of the country.</P>
    <P>One of the major benefits of our involvement in the EEC is our lesser dependence on the British market.  It is encouraging to read in the Central Bank report that in the period 1965 to 1973 there was a reduction in the extent to which we were dependent on exports to Britain from 70 per cent to 55 per cent and in that period there was a doubling of the level of our exports to the US and to European markets.</P>
    <P>There is a matter regarding industrial development within the country at which I think a look should be taken from time to time.  There has been much comment in recent years about the extent to which there should be development in industry and job-creation. Some Opposition Deputies were suggesting recently that the Government might arrange for higher levels of grants to be given to industrial companies to establish in the west, the north-west or the south west. <Col N="2430" /> I do not think that is the answer to the problem because the present level of grants in the underdeveloped parts of the country are extremely generous at about 50 per cent&mdash;a level that does not obtain in any other country in Europe.</P>
    <P>However, some consideration might be given to the question of the incentives we are giving in respect of taxation to manufacturing industry. At present we are allowing complete relief on profits on export sales.  This incentive applies across the nation. This means that this incentive is available in the city of Dublin to the same extent as it is available in Sneem, the Glenties, Ballinasloe or anywhere else. There is a weakness in continuing this policy indefinitely.  We like to say, and successive Governments have said, that we want to hold development in Dublin at its natural level rather than to stimulate population increases in the city.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that for as long as we continue to give this major tax concession in the city of Dublin, we are giving a particular incentive which is reflected in the fact that at present 50 per cent of the entire industrial development in this country is taking place in the city and 50 per cent of the jobs in manufacturing industry are in the city of Dublin. Perhaps some people would regard this as being a desirable situation but we must ensure a better spread throughout the country if we are to have any hope of stabilising this country in a regional sense.</P>
    <P>No doubt, Deputy Callanan whom I expect will speak next, will discuss matters relating to agriculture.  In a sense I regret that I have not had the benefit of listening to him before making my contribution.</P>
    <P>I intend making only a few remarks about the agricultural industry but I am at the disadvantage of having listened to a couple of Opposition Deputies whom I considered to be less than credible in this area. Deputy Collins, for instance, spoke in a very political sense and seemed to be engaging in some hot gospelling. He spoke, apart from the essential <Col N="2431" /> question of agricultural development, of his belief that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is not supported by the National Coalition Government.  The Deputy spoke of &ldquo;an urban-based Government&rdquo;, of &ldquo;city-dominated Government&rdquo; and of &ldquo;a Dublin-orientated Government&rdquo;. All of this is a lot of nonsense. If a Cabinet is comprised of people who have the capacity and talent to do a particular job and provided they recognise their national responsibility rather than a sectional interest, one gets good government and we are getting good government. The fact that there might be quite a few Dublin Ministers is not in any way having any detrimental effect on the performance of the Government. It seems to me that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has the absolute support of the Coalition for his policies.  This was reiterated today by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The problem in relation to agriculture is different entirely from the problems associated with industry. Industrial development is expanding and we are in a situation where jobs are increasing but the problem in relation to agriculture is social.  It is a problem that we have inherited. Sadly, we have inherited a structure of farming which, in terms of size and fragmentation, bears few equals in Europe, particularly within the EEC.</P>
    <P>We are living in a world of economic and of comparison of income levels. We are living in an age where the demands of the consumer are immense. The basic problem we have is matching the resource of the people we have working on the land with their demands and desires.  It has been fashionable during the past year or so to blame our EEC membership for our problems but that is a lot of nonsense. I come from Mayo and during the past 25 years we have lost about 25,000 of our people.  We were having all this staggering emigration and depopulation long before there was any question of our joining the EEC.  There are certain elements in this country&mdash; I do not blame the Opposition in this <Col N="2432" /> regard because they are committed to the EEC&mdash;who are jumping on this bandwagon in an attempt to suggest, to the small farmer in particular, that his ruination lies in the fact of our having joined the EEC.  On analysis the small farmer should know, as we all know, that in practical terms there was no alternative to our joining the Common Market.  The financial gains are there for all to see and the alternatives, in so far as marketing arrangements for agricultural and industrial products are concerned do not bear much thinking about.  I regret, too, that some people are tending to blame this Government for EEC schemes in the area of farm modernisation and retirement&mdash;I refer to Directives Nos. 159, 160 and 161.</P>
    <P>With regard to our entry into the EEC, the problem, which was spelled out by the Taoiseach today is that it was not a question of being able to go to this grouping of 250 million people telling them that our nation of three million people would join on precise terms.  It was a question of seeking the best bargain that could be arranged, of taking with the better points certain policies that, without question, had created problems.</P>
    <P>In recent elections in my county there was an attempt by some Opposition people to blame the Government, without pointing out that the policies in the area of farm modernisation existed before entry and were to be seen in broad terms of philosophy before we joined the Community. We should point out that there is a scheme for hill and mountain areas and shortly the issue of settling on designated areas will be cropping up. I know that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is concerned that large areas in the west should be designated in the hill and mountain farming districts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred to the drop in beet acreage.  This is rather a social question.  Apparently in some parts of the country farmers for reasons of their own have dropped their production of beet.  It has to do with modern methods and mechanisation and the degree to which certain farms can be mechanised.  It is not really a question of attempting to level the blame <Col N="2433" /> at the Government or the sugar company for the fact that there is a drop in beet acreage.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy de Valera refer to the Department of the Public Service and to the necessity for Dáil reform.  The Department are underestimated in the country in relation to what they can achieve; probably the reason for this is that they have merely been examining certain matters to date in regard to which there have not been public announcements.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Public Service when he spoke in Cork four or five months ago referred to the briefs he had given the Department.  It should be pointed out that one of his briefs was the urgency of reviewing the entire question of regional development, of the organisations and the structures that are desirable for the future development of the country. These matters are under active consideration, as the Minister stated in his speech.  This is necessary because one of the biggest messes we have is the proliferation of regional areas, of State and semi-State bodies, which overlap to the most extraordinary degree and which are not very satisfactory. I hope that in the review that is taking place particular concern will be shown to the necessity of responding to the representations made from western areas regarding the possible development of a western development board so that a structure might emerge, somewhat similar to the SFADCo structure in Shannon, under which there would be more autonomy, a greater injection of funds and more decision-making in the province.  The development of a board on these lines would be very much in the interest of the part of the country from which I come.</P>
    <P>There are problems with regard to the EEC.  One of the problems in the west of the country relates to the regional policy of the EC.  Before the referendum the two main planks on which we suggested to people in the western counties that they should vote for joining the EEC were in relation to agricultural policy and the emergence of a regional policy. <Col N="2434" /> There is a measure of cynicism and disappointment at the moment because the regional policy has not emerged.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs recently referred to the fact that this matter is being taken up again.  Certainly the Government should inform those concerned with this matter in Brussels in no uncertain terms of the degree to which we expect a commitment in that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera quite properly referred to the matter of the Public Service and Dáil reform and he raised some interesting questions in his stimulating speech.  The second point which the Minister for the Public Service stated was under consideration, and which will probably emerge within a few months, was the question of adequate parliamentary control of the semi-State bodies.  This is a matter about which all Deputies will be concerned.</P>
    <P>In the past decade there has been an enormous growth of activity and expenditure in the semi-State area as opposed to direct Government Departments.  At the moment they are acting under a device which many people believe to be unsatisfactory in that they are responsible, through the Minister, to the Dáil.  In parliamentary terms, the access by a Deputy is merely by way of a Parliamentary Question for which there is a prepared answer.  The system is not very satisfactory.  I hope there will be a development along the Committee lines so that there will be an opportunity to review annually or biannually the implementation of policies of the semi-State bodies and the possibility of engaging in dialogue with the chief executive officers of such bodies and their assistants.  If this is to develop we must address ourselves a little to the mechanics of this House.</P>
    <P>At present there is a problem in relation to the Public Accounts Committee and the EEC Committee.  At times it has been very difficult to get a quorum for the PAC Committee because Deputies under the system we operate are immersed in constituency and other work.  With a House <Col N="2435" /> of only 144 Members, some of whom are involved in positions in the Cabinet or in the position of Parliamentary Secretary, there is left a very thin resource from which to staff adequately the committees.  I understand the Government are favourably disposed towards arranging additional secretarial services for Deputies in the House and I welcome that approach.  It is most necessary. Until we can delegate a measure of the work we have to do. we will not have the capacity, the time to study the background of various subjects or be able to engage in the right kind of dialogue.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage where Deputies are better paid than formerly. In the public interest it is all the more necessary that they be able to delegate a large proportion of the work they have to carry out.  At the moment they cannot do this unless they do it out of their own pockets.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to his approach in the energy area in relation to oil exploration. I hope the Department will very soon reach decisions regarding its approach to the issue of licensing and the degree to which it is expected that the State will take up equity in such developments.  The sooner this happens the better because while we do not yet know whether we have oil resources off our coastline such as exist off the coasts of other countries on the Gulf Stream run, it is distinctly possible that we have.  If we consider what has been happening in Norway and in Scotland and the financial implications of the discovery of oil off the Norwegian and Scottish coastlines and the extraordinary extent to which that will improve the balance of payments situation, apart from the basic stability provided by having an oil resource on one's own shores, it seems to me that the sooner we get moving in that area the better.  It is a critical factor and could change extraordinarily the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks in regard to the issue of mining.  I believe the Government were right to change policy in that area.  It would have been <Col N="2436" /> difficult for the alternative government to have done it because they had instigated a different policy.  I believe the State is entitled to part of that resource. As has been pointed out, it is a wasting resource.  There is an end to the ore that can be taken out.  I believe the Government policy to be in the national interest.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by Opposition spokesmen at the time that it would damage the industrial development of the country and reduce the extent to which investment would come from abroad.  It was suggested that industrialists would regard Ireland as a shaky economy.  In the nine or ten months that have passed since the initial speech was made there has been no indication that that is the position and reassurances have been given by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that they are completely committed to retaining the incentives that are given to manufacturing industries at present.  They have pointed to the essential difference between manufacturing industry, which is an on-going operation, and mining. For that reason I believe the present policy to be satisfactory and will result, hopefully, in an improvement in our balance of payments and in increased revenue from taxation, developments that would be in the national interest.</P>
    <P>In relation to Foreign Affairs, I welcome the appointment of an Ambassador to the Lebanon.  The Lebanon is a small country.  It does not have all the significance that the appointment would seem to indicate, but in the Middle East the Lebanon is a catalyst.  The balance of the world has been changed in terms of economics since the energy crisis and the fuel oil situation.  Our presence in the Middle East and the accrediting of a representative of ours to other Middle East countries in the future will be in the long term interest of the country, providing liaison in so far as future oil supplies from that part of the world are concerned and in regard to the possibility of investment here by Middle East countries and of arrangements in regard to exports from this country to that part of the world, apart from the possibility <Col N="2437" /> of our helping with regard to political problems that may exist there.  I hope the Government will keep the country on an even keel and that we will be coming back in a reasonably optimistic mood next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks will be confined to the agricultural sector but first I should refer to what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said on the question of the Coalition Government and their responsibility and their differences.  It is quite true that there are differences in every party. If everybody in the country agreed on every matter it would be a poor country.  There is agreement to differ. At the same time, if a government want to govern and if the majority decide to sponsor legislation and to have a free vote, that free vote should apply only to the backbenchers.  I do not think that the Members of the Government should have a free vote in relation to a Government-sponsored measure.  I am fond of my freedom and can be awkward at party meetings but when a majority come to a decision I bow to it.</P>
      <P>The general criticism that was made of the Taoiseach was not in respect of his honesty but in respect of him as a leader of a Government acting in a particular manner in relation to a Government-sponsored measure.  If the Leader of the Government does not approve of a measure to be introduced by the Government then that measure should not be brought before the House.</P>
      <P>Various comments were made by Deputy de Valera, and rightly so, on the way things are run in this House. In the debate on the Standing Orders Motion I complimented the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on their recommendation that the length of speeches in this House should be curtailed. I have always maintained that it is ridiculous that a Deputy should speak for two hours, repeating arguments, wasting public money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of legislation having to be rushed through the House, as the Finance Bill, the most important Bill that comes before the House, had <Col N="2438" /> to be rushed through last night and this morning.  I have been a member of various bodies.  There was a chairman of one body who would not allow a meeting to go over four hours on the basis that a man's brain would be tired after spending four hours discussing a subject.  Deputies felt this morning that they would be glad to see the debate on the Finance Bill over.  Deputies had special interests and could have spoken at length on the various sections.</P>
    <P>We were vexed with the Minister and the front bench Opposition Members for the way they kept it going when we were all hoping it would end and we could go home to bed.  There were very important items in the Bill on which we wanted to contribute but because of the length of time people had spent in this House we could not do justice to it.  Deputy de Valera spoke on the various pieces of legislation that are rushed through the House and the length of time that is spent talking about nothing.  We should not make laws for the country without putting our own house in order first.  In good business places and on committees people must discuss the business in hand and not be irrelevant.  There is a vast amount of irrelevancy in all discussions here.</P>
    <P>This is a debate on the state of the nation.  I was not here this morning&mdash;I was having a sleep&mdash;when the Taoiseach was speaking but I see that he warns us of a loss of jobs. I do not believe in standing up here and saying: &ldquo;We'll all be ruined, said Hanrahan&rdquo; but I believe things are not well at present with the economy, particularly the agricultural sector but other sectors also.  Even though the Minister for Local Government says there is nothing wrong in the housing sector we know there is a shortage of money.  About five years ago beautiful houses were built in Mervue in the City of Galway. I know a man who bought one for £4,000.  Those houses are now £9,000, while the loans that are available are only £4,500.  No young married couple know where to get the additional £3,000.  This is a serious situation. Nobody knows who will come back <Col N="2439" /> here after the Recess but anyway we will not be here again until next October.  It is only fair that we should point out to the relevant Ministers the seriousness of the situation.  It is well known that the building situation is serious.</P>
    <P>I wanted to speak on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government but I did not get in.  I noticed that the Minister gave only a small paragraph to local improvement schemes.  An order came from the Minister that bog roads can now be included for local improvement schemes at 10 per cent of the estimated cost.  We were thankful for that.  However everybody knows that the repair of a bog road costs much more than the repairing of a road on reasonable land.  Therefore, when bog roads are included the cost will treble and the amount of money we have is not enough.  According to one of this evening's newspapers the price of coal has gone from £34.84 to £67.84 per ton.  We must do something to help people get native fuel.  We have not got nearly enough money to repair the bog roads.</P>
    <P>I give credit where credit is due. I think the Coalition have done a fair job on social welfare but no matter what Government were in power it would be their job to do that.  However social welfare payments are not keeping in line with the increases in the cost of living.  The amounts look good on paper but the acid test is what they will purchase of the necessities of life.  Any recipient will tell you it is not enough. This should be looked into by the Government.</P>
    <P>As far as agriculture is concerned, again I will not say we are ruined but we have not got much confidence at present.  I, like our spokesman on Agriculture, want to say sincerely that I believe the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is doing his best.  I am convinced his heart is in the right place.  I am not convinced that he is getting enough assistance from his Government or from those who are with him in Brussels.  We have heard that people are to be paid £50 for <Col N="2440" /> keeping cattle over the winter.  I presume the only people who will be paid that will be people who have cattle fit for the factories.  If this is done I am pointing out now, for the record, what will happen to us in the West of Ireland.  What are we going to do with our young cattle if the finished cattle are not moved out? By all means give a subsidy for slaughter.  I am not objecting to that but I am objecting to people being encouraged to keep cattle unless some genius comes along and says that we will have a market and that the beef pool will be gone by next March.</P>
    <P>The people I represent carry on two types of farming.  I do not represent the man who feeds over 100 head of cattle.  I represent the ordinary man who is either in milk or has a few cows and calves and is in the beef subsidy scheme.  If the man is in milk he is not too badly off because the price of milk is good but his calf is a dead duck.  He got up to £70 for him last year but he is lucky if he gets £10 for him this year.  The other people I represent are in the beef scheme and they have from ten to 20 cows.  They always have enough fodder to feed the cows for the winter but they cannot feed the calves.  If the people with large herds are subsidised to keep the cattle that should be going out for sale in the autumn who is to buy the medium sized cattle to replace them?  The whole thing is held up.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood here.  By all means pay a subsidy for the slaughter of an animal provided it is continued the whole year.  We had a disaster last year in relation to calves.  When the tariff was put on I was the only person who pointed out what would happen.  If you stop the free flow of cattle and getting them slaughtered you will have the repercussions down along the line.</P>
    <P>The price is very bad at the moment, even for the big men.  You can get £16 and £17 per cwt for a beast of ten cwt but you get very little for the five cwt beast at the moment.  The small man's beast is the hardest hit at the moment.  If you <Col N="2441" /> hold up the movement of the heavier cattle by paying people to keep them for the winter you will also hold up the sale of the lighter cattle.  I believe the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is doing his best but this is a very difficult problem.  Last year I told him to take all the advice he could get but make his own decisions.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree, on behalf of the people I represent, that it is a good idea to subsidise the keeping of heavier cattle during the winter in the hope that some fairy godmother will come and wave a wand between now and next March and say that the beef pile is now gone.  I spoke on this Adjournment Debate because I wanted to get an opportunity before we went into recess to put that point across.  I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is not here to hear my remarks.  It is of vital importance to us in the west that the flow of cattle is kept moving.  If not we are stuck.</P>
    <P>Last year there were smiles on the faces of most Deputies when I pointed out the seriousness of the situation in relation to fodder.  There are a lot of people in this country who talk about stocking rates and what you can keep on land but they assume we have a summer every winter.  There was too much talk last year about stock rates and not enough talk about how they were to be fed.  I read in a paper once that 20 cows could be kept on 19 acres.  You could do that for a couple of months in the summer but how could you do that in the winter?  You would need 20 acres of silage.</P>

      <P>The Deputy always tries to be fair.  There was an old rule that when you had a certain amount of fodder for cattle you always kept 25 per cent extra to deal with contingencies. The average Irish farmer does not do that nowadays.  If he did we would not be in the trouble we <Col N="2442" /> are in now.  Does the Deputy agree with that?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It was not a bad school.  I always heard long ago that old hay was old gold.  There is not much old hay now.  I am not against progress.  No man put more into rural organisation to bring progress about in this country than I did.  I spent a lot of time going around my area doing everything I could to bring up production on the farms and to bring education to the farmers so that they would know how to get the best out of their farms.  If last winter was like the winter we had in 1947, when the fields were covered with snow for eight weeks, what would have happened? The majority of the people would have been wiped out because nobody laid any emphasis on fodder up to now.  The emphasis was on stock all the time.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about people who are farming for pleasure or about speculators.  I have no interest in them.  I am talking <Col N="2443" /> about the ordinary small farmers.  I did not stand up last night and say we should not tax farmers but I could not agree with taxing the ordinary farmer who will be classified as a development farmer.  The earnings per labour unit is £1,200.  We find very few people in the west of Ireland under the £50 valuation who will come up to that earnings per labour unit.  They go into the transitional group.  If the transitional man is over £22 valuation could anybody say we were supporting the big man if we stand up and say that if that man's wife is getting other employment she should lose half her allowances for income tax purposes?  That is all I was saying.  Nobody is less off centre in this House than I am&mdash;and I say that for the Labour Party&mdash;but there must be justice and fair play.  I said and I stand over it: &ldquo;Tax the man who should be taxed,&rdquo; but I do not think anybody should pay two types of taxation.  I said that last night also. It is not our view that because you are a farmer you should not pay your share of taxation: it would be a shame that anybody should get away without paying his fair share.</P>

      <P>I represent them; the small farmers elected me for years on rural organisations.  My greatest vote comes from the small farmers and labourers.  There is no Labour man in my constituency.  I represent these people and I make no apology for it.  The large farmers who may come into this category do not give me No. 1, but I am fair to them and I try to be fair in this House no matter who gets No. 1.  This is my view and I think life is too short for any other view.  I think this is the right approach in politics and I have tried to keep to it all my life.  We could not stand up and say here that everything is grand in the garden. <Col N="2444" /> Anybody who says so is codding himself. Things are not grand.</P>
      <P>Deputy Staunton made a statement on the EEC.  It is about time this point was clarified.  I personally had reservations about EEC but we would probably be worse off if we were not in it.  It is something that happened; we knew nothing about it.  The experts told us that everything in the garden was grand but they did not tell us that if there was a bang it would happen all over.  It has happened; we cannot explain it.  But it is not right to say now&mdash;even though I had reservations&mdash;that if we did not go in everything would be grand for us. One could not say that and therefore that argument is gone.</P>
      <P>The only thing that is clear is that the so-called experts who set themselves up as experts and go around the world in big cars and bring people into something and say to them: &ldquo;I know what will happen in six months time&rdquo; are no experts.  I do not like disturbance at meetings but if ever an egg was needed it was needed in that case.  Too many people are setting up as experts&mdash;even in the Community&mdash;and saying what will happen. Nobody knows that; if they did, there would be multi-millionaires in the country.  I am afraid my time has run out.</P>

      <P>I shall conclude in a few moments but I did not think I had so much time.  Standing Orders are better than I thought.  It is very hard to get something to talk about for 20 minutes but when I have time I shall say a few words about the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we are not tough enough. That goes for those who are members of the Council of Europe.  I believe the Parliament of Europe has very little &ldquo;say&rdquo;.  Directive 159, produced when Mansholt was there, gave no assistance to the transitional <Col N="2445" /> farmer.  It was changed in the negotiation period so as to give certain grants to them.  I argue that when it was changed once, with sufficient pressure from us in Brussels everything can be changed.  This is the point I made on our entry to the EEC to a number of people who were quoting the Treaty of Rome and the principles which could not be departed from.  One of them was that we could do nothing if we were not in the Community; there was no such thing as importing from a third country.  That was stressed.</P>
    <P>I think everybody here will agree that if you are in a co-operative and you amalgamate with another co-operative immediately the policy of that new body can change because another group of people are brought in and you have two groups of people there.  I said that the same thing could happen in the Community and it is happening.  When you had a Community of Six they formed a Common Market and decided on the Treaty of Rome.  They omitted certain fundamental principles.  We were going to get four but we got three.  Now you have the influence of Britain.  They definitely want a cheap food policy and always did.  I believed and said that when you had a Community of Nine there was no use preaching what the policy of the Common Market was, that you should look to the future and what it would be.  I said we should judge on the type of people who would form the new Common Market and what influence they would have.  It was obvious that if the Common Market were to consist of the people who had applied for membership that an effort would be made to do away with the Common Agricultural Policy which was what we went in for&mdash;that and the Social Fund. These were the plums held out to us. I foresaw that but I could find no alternative and that is why I supported entry to the EEC.  I had reservations; I was in no way fooled.  I knew that the policy of a Community which consisted of six countries and would consist of nine was bound to change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Another thing that influenced me was our complete dependence on the British market.  We were only dreaming about EEC when I attended an international conference of agricultural producers in Paris which was also attended by the Community countries. I knew what the EEC was like from meeting them and I had a feeling that it was a big man's club and that there was not much place for a small man there.  I could see no alternative when Britain was going in.  I accepted it as the lesser of two evils.</P>
      <P>There is no use in saying now what we did or did not do; we must now consider the attitude we should adopt within the Community in order to get our rights.  If the Italians and British can get tough, we can get tough.  I do not believe we can be thrown out.  That would not suit the Community which cannot afford to lose one member.  They moved to consolidate the Community and cannot now weaken it.  We must insist that we want certain concessions&mdash; that we cannot do without them&mdash; such as permission to subsidise from our own resources if we do not get the funds required from the EEC.</P>
      <P>The costs of production on the farm have increased.  The farmer's income has gone down and his expenses up.  Many farmers jumped to conclusions and thought that we would never see a cheap beast again. Before we went into the EEC prices had almost gone beyond the EEC level.  Farmers rushed in to buy cattle and rushed out of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it fair to say that farmers sold and got better prices but they had to replace their cattle at higher prices and no allowance was made for that?  Nobody made allowance for that fact that he had to replace at a slightly higher price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

      <P>As a left-wing socialist I must be fair to everybody. There must be fair play and justice. I must not hold up the House any longer.  I got involved in this question of agriculture.  I have a bee in my bonnet about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural electrification is very important to the farmers.  The planning authorities at the moment tend to take people away from the environment in which they were reared and to put them into villages and towns. People should be allowed to build houses in the country.  If a young man builds a house on his father's land, having gone to England to make <Col N="2448" /> money and being prepared to build a house worth £6,000, he is asked by the ESB to pay £500 or £600 for a connection.  The grant for such a house is less than £1,000.  If we wish to keep people on the land we should help them.  If the next generation are brought up in that environment they will be better people.  They will help their neighbours and will be shoved into ghettoes in villages and towns where they have nothing to do. This produces an undesirable society. If young people are reared in rural Ireland there will be a better type of young fellow coming up.  This is all tied up with the question of the ESB connection.  The Government should take note of that.</P>
    <P>I did not stand up to lacerate anybody. The situation is serious.  I have said at party meetings in regard to a free vote by all means let backbenchers vote freely but Governments cannot vote freely.  If I was a member of the Government and that Government came to a decision I would have to toe the line.  Even at present I have often to toe the line. It would be a poor country if everybody agreed.  Decisions that are made must be accepted.  If there is to be democratic government all must vote with the majority.  There is only one alternative to democratic government and that is dictatorship.</P>

If somebody applies <Col N="2449" /> for a postal vote the application is signed by a member of the Garda Síochána, a priest or a high official, but the receipt does not have to be signed by anybody.  I asked the local authority if they had any way to check the signatures and they said that they had no handwriting expert.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the Fianna Fáil Government of 1973 defeated itself.  I am saying this in an objective way.  In 1970 its more active Ministers either resigned or were sacked.  From that day on it was inevitable that so long as an alternative could be offered, a change of Government would come about.  The Fianna Fáil Party is very united.  Since that day in 1970 they have stuck together. Nevertheless, their fate was inevitable.  The people would not condone a situation where they could not trust the entire personnel of their Government on the question of security.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to discuss the change of Government and the performance of this Government since.  I intend to discuss security, <Col N="2450" /> economics, industry and agriculture. Security is the most important subject which could be discussed at this time.</P>
      <P>Everybody from Cork to Ballycastle knows that we on this side of the House, are against violence of any kind.  We go about our work in this regard without fear or favour.  I am not in the most difficult security Ministry but I have found it very difficult to make decisions which would bring difficulty to families. One could find oneself being very hard on people who thought they were doing the right thing.  That was a duty which had to be adhered to.  It was bigger than Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour or the Coalition.  It was our duty to ensure that we would never have a thousand deaths again. These are indisputable facts.  There are Members in high places in this House who a short time ago were named as having subversive tendencies. That is something we must face up to.  All over the country there are people who have what I would call, in the vernacular of my county, a &ldquo;making&rdquo; regard for the IRA.  I mention the IRA not as either first or last but as one of the subversive elements.  The people who have this regard would never dream of hitting anybody, much less shooting them. They would never dream of raising their hands but still they would harbour, help or further, maybe by way of subscription, the cause of the IRA and other subversive elements.</P>
      <P>We as a Government are doing our level best.  There are approximately 450 subversive prisoners in our goals. We are doing our best to cure this horrible cancer.  Over 1,000 people are dead since 1969.  I place as serious a view on the death of somebody who would disagree violently with aspirations we hold as I would with a person who holds those aspirations dearly. How many decisions were made in Dublin, London, New York and other places outside the EEC countries that factories would not be built here? How many boys and girls have not got jobs tonight?  How many people are poorer as a result of what has been happening since 1969?  We will never know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2451" /> No board of directors in London or anywhere else will tell us why they did not come.  I can assure the House that small things sway boards of directors when they want to start factories. As Deputy Callanan said, managements had the incentive to come here to avoid the common external tariff. They could also go anywhere else in the Nine where they would get the workers.  The grants and incentives there were almost as good as they would get here.  They had the choice. When one sees the 31 people dead between Talbot Street and Monaghan, the various executions and killings which took place, the 13 people dead in Derry, remembers the factories which did not come here and the bomb on the plane the other day, one should realise that these events are calculated to keep the tourists and the investors from this country.</P>
    <P>In the face of the most serious crisis which has ever faced this country this Government have done well.  I will not labour the most serious situation.  In my view, the Government have a record, bearing in mind all the different events that occurred, such as the oil crisis and all the other difficulties that will bear comparison with any other period of any other Administration.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the statement of intent of the Government at the time it was elected.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party agreed to offer the electorate an alternative Government. They called attention to the fact that they had an agreed policy and had their priorities established.  They were convinced&mdash;at Point No. 3&mdash;that:</P>
    <P>in the present climate of national crisis, both political and economic, it is necessary to give the people a clear, democratic choice between the outgoing Government and an entirely new Government committed to democratic procedures, economic development and social reforms.</P>
    <P>They were right.  They then drew attention, at Point No. 4, to the sackings of the Ministers to whom I have <Col N="2452" /> referred and the fact that there was no mandate to govern.  Within that Party there will still be people who had been displaced from their positions because of subversive activities. It would be no worry at all if Ministers resigned or were sacked because of ordinary difficulties of any kind. In these circumstances they drew attention to the fact that the only guarantee of strong, stable Government capable of dealing with the nation's problems was, at that time, the National Coalition, and the people elected them.</P>
    <P>As their first tenet they laid down the protection of the individual. Deputy Callanan said, I think, that if one person was affected by double taxation, he would be extremely worried; he would feel it to be his duty as a Deputy to look after that person who felt he had a grievance.  I could not agree more.  Deputy Callanan is entirely correct in that.  That is the job of every Deputy here, whether he be the most important Minister, or the least important and youngest Deputy just arrived.  But the responsibility to protect the individual extends to his person and peace must be through justice&mdash;Point No. 6.  Have all of these things being forgotten&mdash; the behaviour of the previous Government and the 14 points that were set before the people of Ireland in 1973?</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of stopping the price rise.  The National Coalition organised the National Prices Commission; organised a simple system of monthly checks; appointed more inspectors; ensured that this National Prices Commission was made far more decisive.  If world prices went up, that is not our fault; we did our best about them.</P>
    <P>I shall go right across the whole spectrum of Government and then talk about the situation as I see it. Has everybody forgotten the programme of social reform; the ending of social injustice and what was done on social welfare?  Last year pensions and allowances increased by £1 in the personal rates and by at least 50p in respect of every qualified dependant. The monthly allowance under the children's <Col N="2453" /> allowance scheme was increased by £1.50 per child.  And, in 1974, all rates of social insurance and assistance payments were increased by a further 18 per cent which, notwithstanding the rise in the cost of living, will give all beneficiaries a significant rise in their real standard of living.  The children's allowance scheme was extended to provide payment in respect of children between the ages of 16 and 18 who are continuing full time education, who are apprenticed or disabled.  The qualifying age in relation to old age pensions &mdash;in relation to our promise to reduce it from 70 years of age to 65 over five years&mdash;was reduced from 70 to 69 in the first year and to 68 in the next; that includes free travel, free electricity and free television licence. It is our intention to continue that process until we have it down to 65 years.  That is a promise made and a debt that is being paid.</P>
    <P>There is a new scheme for unmarried mothers who are keeping their children; the means test for non-contributory and old age and widows pensions was substantially relaxed. Contributory benefit for deserted wives was introduced.  The removal of liability for any deductions in respect of social insurance contributions in the case of widows, deserted wives and unmarried mothers receiving pensions or allowances from the Department of Social Welfare was a further improvement.  The cost of all of this shows an increase of £171 million, based on the budget provisions of 1972 compared with £229 million based on the first National Coalition budget of 1973.  That represents an increase of 34 per cent.  If that is not trying to achieve social justice.  I do not know what is.  The present weekly rate of retirement and old age pensions is £7.20; the increase in the budget was £1.30, giving a new rate of £8.50.  I could go down through this list and would do nothing but bore the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  But, <Col N="2454" /> at the same time, let the House realise that these things were done. These are not &ldquo;fly by night&rdquo; things, they are facts; our action on security and on social welfare stands proudly and there is nobody who can take it from us.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in his Blackrock speech laid down the principles of power-sharing.  We co-operated with the two other bodies, with whom we could co-operate, to try to achieve power-sharing in Northern Ireland. We were circumvented, not through our fault, but because of the fact that certain other people who held the power decided they would retain it.  We will work in a peaceful way towards the promulgation of power-sharing as the days and the months progress.  We will make every effort we can to see to it that these thirty-two counties of Ireland can remain peaceful. We will go across the religious divide as much as we can and. in so doing, try and bring our people together, letting them work in courage and dedication for the future Ireland of which we can be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider now the question of housing.  Those politicians amongst us who do clinics, as we call them, find that when we have one urban clinic at least&mdash;or maybe two or three of them&mdash;the most pathetic thing with which we are confronted is a young couple with one or two children looking for a house.  One knows&mdash;because one has been in the local authority perhaps the week before&mdash;that they have no chance of getting a house for a year or perhaps two.  That dates back to before the time my colleague, Deputy Lalor was here; it dates back precisely to 1957 when a crisis caused then by the Suez Canal situation, the Korean war, worldwide economic inflation and shortage of money simultaneously was cured by Fianna Fáil by reducing the number of local authority houses in the next five years to 4,000 per annum.  Those are the facts of it.  If the building industry is slowed down to that extent it takes years for it to recover; if you have old houses falling into disuse; if you have young people coming forward getting married, and looking for houses, you <Col N="2455" /> will not catch up except by an extraordinary effort.</P>
    <P>What did the National Coalition do?  They stated that there was a housing crisis; they decided that they would tackle that crisis on several fronts simultaneously, increasing the output to 25,000 houses a year.  In the five years before the National Coalition took office&mdash;and lest anybody should confuse this figure with the figure I quoted on the small amount of local authority houses built in 1957 to 1961&mdash;the average figure for houses built was 15,600.  In the 12 months ended to 31st March, 1974 a total of 25,365 houses were completed.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been caterwauling about activities in the building industry.  They say that building is slowing down, that the building societies are in trouble. They were told today by the Minister for Finance that there would be good news for the building societies.  I am not at liberty to give details but the people opposite can rest assured that action will be taken in this regard.  Steps are being taken, too, in regard to local authority housing.</P>
    <P>However if during our five-year term of office&mdash;and I am confident that we will complete our full term&mdash; we did nothing else in respect of building but succeeded in bringing the number of houses built each year to 25,000, we would have done a good day's work because we would have taken great pressures from young people in so far as housing is concerned. Since coming to office we have been removing spectacularly the effects of the neglect of the previous administration in the housing field.</P>

      <P>In regard to the new Planning Bill I understand that Fianna Fáil have tabled an enormous number of amendments for Committee Stage.  Under existing legislation it is the duty of the Minister for Local Government to decide on planning appeals but the proposed Bill, when enacted, will remove that duty from the Minister and then, appeals will be decided by a judicial body.  In the past Fianna Fáil rejected any such change strenuously and they ensured that during their 16 years in office no such change occurred.</P>
      <P>At the time when Deputy Lalor was Minister for Industry and Commerce and I was his opposite number in Opposition there was introduced a Prices Bill, the proposed section 3 of which defined a house as a commodity. That meant that for the first time legislation was being used to restrict increases in house prices or, in other words, to fix the price of a house.  However, between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage of that Bill, as it was then, that section was removed by ministerial amendment.</P>
      <P>In relation to house prices we have insisted that before grants are paid there will be granted a certificate of valuation.

      <P>I was interested in hearing Deputy Callanan's views on agriculture.  The Deputy expressed dissatisfaction with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Deputy should know that, although the farmers are having a bad time at present in so far as prices are concerned, every one of them knows that the best proponent of their cause who has ever been sent to Europe is the present Minister.  Therefore no effort from the opposite benches to discredit the Minister will succeed.  Indeed it is demeaning to try to discredit a man who has done so much for the farming community, a man whose energy has been so obvious to all and a man whose knowledge of agriculture is, obviously, so much better than that of some of his predecessors.</P>
      <P>I might remind the House that in 1957 the then Deputy Childers asked about cattle prices consistently in this House during a period of about six months.  That action on his part had a disastrous effect because after every occasion on which he asked such questions, cattle prices fell.  Therefore the point I am making is that Deputies opposite have a political and a moral duty to help to boost the farmers' morale and to ensure them that steps have been taken in the Common Market during the past month to improve their lot.</P>

    <P>Not one Fianna Fáil Deputy during the course of this debate so far has adverted to the fact that no longer can cattle be put into the Common Market by the back door but several Deputies, <Col N="2458" /> including Deputy Callanan told us that cattle were coming in here by the back door and we were told that the Minister was not preventing this from happening. They have been stopped from coming in in this way.</P>

      <P>There is no more effective way in which the people opposite can hurt the people of this country than by continuing to caterwaul about prices and to suggest unjustly that there is no likelihood of prices increasing.  This sort of conduct will not put Fianna Fáil back into office but it appears to be the best they can get from their brains in so far as political expertise is concerned.</P>
      <P>Something else of which I am proud in relation to this Government is that our young people are rallying to the security forces.  It is clear that these young people believe that we are doing our job properly.  I am very proud to be able to say that we have brought the strength of our Defence Forces up to 11,500 and that when we inquired as to whether any of the FCA people would be prepared to join on a full-time basis, 450 indicated their willingness to do so and of that number 415 joined.  That is an indication that the young people of this country want no more bombs, that they want law and order.</P>
      <P>I could go on for a considerable time in relation to the performance of this Government but I would digress for a moment to refer to the mess made by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the Contraceptives Bill. Deputy Lynch's suggestion was that that Bill was legalising the widespread importation and distribution of contraceptives and that, consequently, Fianna Fáil would vote against it.  The Bill was designed to restrict the general unsavoury features in relation to the distribution of contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this party were concerned there was a free vote so that people might vote as they thought fit.  I voted against the Bill because that was what my conscience told me to do.  I came to this conclusion while bearing in <Col N="2459" /> mind something I witnessed while on a camping site in the south of England a few years ago.  I saw there vending machines from which teenagers or any others could purchase contraceptives. I decided that a restriction on display and sale of contraceptives was better than that sort of situation.  However, others in my party voted the other way but the Opposition were under the Whip to vote against it.  The Bill was a restrictive one and we can be proud of it.  We can be proud, too, of having a much broader mind in relation to political matters than have Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch also referred to the lack of will to face up to unpopular decisions in relation to the oil shortages.  I remember when all the Deputies on the opposite side of the House were wailing about the fact that the Minister for Transport and Power would not ration petrol or oil but instead worked a system that was operated by every other European country.  Supplies were kept going without applying any severe rationing. People were asked not to hoard petrol but I am sorry to say some of them did.  The Minister got more stick than any other politician but, rather than have a system of rationing that would have been far more restrictive, he persevered with his course of action. If that was not an act of political courage I do not know what political courage is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to industrial disputes, it is true that last year we had a marvellous year and had very few disputes but this year there is an increase in their number.  I am satisfied that the Minister for Labour and his Department are doing everything possible in this and that it is merely a coincidence that two or three of the <Col N="2460" /> disputes came together.  In fact, the bus dispute was an internecine feud between two unions in which nobody could mediate.  We had to wait until the whole matter fizzled out which it did after a long number of weeks.  We are providing a service that is much more effective, both for the working people and the employers, than Fianna Fáil ever attempted.</P>
    <P>I accept what Deputy Lynch said about inflation but I would point out that this is a world-wide problem. Inflation brings in turn a scarcity of money and one must pay the going rate.  While that is true, there is no lethargy on the part of the Government. We are doing everything possible about this matter.  The people are not frustrated, as was suggested by Deputy Lynch.  They are extremely happy that they have a worthwhile Government and the people have the highest regard for the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch on the one hand says we are lethargic and then he says we have excessive spending and a deficit of more than £66 million.  He told us this was grossly irresponsible.  Did he get the figure of £66 million out of the bushes?  There was not a deficit of £66 million at the time of the Budget. The Deputies opposite know that we had a deficit of £39 million at the time of last year's budget but when we finished that amount was reduced to less than £10 million.  That was a very good performance by our Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch has told us that industrial expansion is slowing down. I agree but I would ask the Deputies opposite to consider the base year. They know that the comparison is being made with our best year. Deputy Lynch, who was once Minister for Industry and Commerce, is well aware of this fact.  Last year we had an expansion rate of 7 per cent but, having regard to the oil crisis, inflation, the bombings in Dublin and other factors, how could we be expected to keep up that rate?  If we can achieve a rate of 4 or 5 per cent we will be doing on average considerably better than the average produced by Fianna Fail.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch also referred to the strictures of the Central Bank regarding <Col N="2461" /> increases in public expenditure and in the external debt.  Of course the Central Bank must be prudent. They may tell us not to overdo it and naturally we take serious account of what they say.  The only difference is that if there were an election in the offing Deputies on the other side would take no account of the words of the Central Bank.  Our Government will take serious account of the figures produced to us by the Central Bank and their words regarding government spending and the servicing of the national debt.  We have balanced our budgets and we will balance them again.  We will do as sound and as careful a job as any government.</P>

      <P>I said that in the Budget of 1973 we balanced it to within £10 million.  We will do that again.  Deputy Lynch spoke a lot of rubbish about a deficit of £66 million. I suggest that when we come to the end of this year we will have reduced the deficit by a spectacular amount.  I know that the 7 per cent expansion rate is slowing down but we will ensure that expansion continues at a better rate than was achieved by Fianna Fáil during a period of four or five years.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite are irresponsible when they make statements that are completely untrue.  They do not seem to mind hurting the people of the country.  Deputy Collins spoke about the construction industry.  He predicts there will be a smaller number of houses this year and he is quite entitled to his views on this matter.  He also stated that rumours that 7,500 building workers will be laid off after August are rampant.  Such a comment is irresponsible.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins spoke about the importance of agriculture and the fact that we would have a bonanza when we entered the EEC. He then tells us that agriculture is facing the worst crisis for many years, including a 10 per cent reduction in farm income in 1974.  Where did he get the figure of 10 per cent?  I know that kind of statement will not help the farmer who is bringing his cattle to the sale tomorrow.  It will do him a grave disservice, and it is for political purposes. The Deputy said&mdash;and he was the second Deputy who said this&mdash;that the Minister is remiss in regard to fighting Ireland's corner in the EEC.  We all know that Deputy Clinton as Minister for Agriculture is not remiss.  The Deputy said that various producer subsidies that were introduced in other member states have not been brought in here, that we have been slow in moving towards the green £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that respect the fact is that Italy got the Green £ three times: one of a 5 per cent reduction, one of 2½ per cent, one of 5 per cent&mdash;a total of 12½ per cent.  Every time that happened <Col N="2463" /> millions of pounds flowed into FEOGA funds in the EEC.  Italy was a food importing country.  Italy had to fight for that green £.  Our position is dissimilar.  If we got the green £, if it were possible, funds would flow in millions from FEOGA to Ireland. Therefore it is considerably more difficult for our Minister to succeed in getting agreement from the other eight than it was for Italy.  Yet, Italy had to go back three times before she got as far as 12½ per cent. So, you are talking about common external tariff money that was going into Italy on all the food that was going in there, straight into FEOGA funds.  If we get the Green £ it all flows out of FEOGA funds to us.  The position is dissimilar and Deputy Brennan knows that.  The Minister is not neglectful of his duty.</P>
    <P>France and the UK, said Deputy Collins, took unilateral steps.  You cannot take unilateral steps in the EEC.  The only unilateral step you can take is a veto and a veto says no.  On anything else you are looking for yes, not no.  The Deputy suggested that there were delays in listing disadvantaged areas under the hill farm directive.  He said that M. Lardinois criticised the Government for delay.  That is not true either.  Yet Deputy Collins has the gall to come in here and say all these things.  He said that lambs and sheep were to be covered by the Common Agricultural Policy by this summer and that that has not been done, that instead the French market is closed. Yes, and where is the Minister?  He is out there fighting like a tiger to get the thing organised as best he can. The Deputy asked why was he not more aggressive in protest.  He was most aggressive.  When Deputies over there smile it would seem to suggest that they like this, that they like to see the farmer getting less money&mdash; for political purposes.  Is that true?</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that the EEC farm organisation scheme was adopted holus bolus without adaptation to Irish circumstances.  Then he says that instead of an increase in the quota for sugar beet it looks like minus 20,000 tons.  These are all figments of the Deputy's imagination.  You do not <Col N="2464" /> go to Europe and say what you are going to get and take it for yourself. Every man who ever went to a fair knows that in ten bargains he will have more success with one than with the others.  These bargains are being made and it is a grave disservice to the agricultural community to advert to any losses in price that occur when every effort that could possibly be made is being made by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party today, having listened to the Taoiseach giving his state of the nation address for one-and-a-half hours, found himself constrained to say at the end of it that it was quite obvious that the Government had no plan to deal with the desperate economic circumstances in which the country finds itself at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach dealt with the problems and accepted the fact that they were very many and finally indicated that he fully accepted that inflation was a problem and he accepted the Central Bank's contention that more than 50 per cent of the inflation is generated within the State.  He said that inflation was a problem but it would appear that the manner in which he proposes to tackle it is the manner he spelt out today&mdash;an appeal to the workers not to press for more at the end of the current national wage agreement.  That is an indication of a lack of ideas as to how to settle this problem.  If further evidence were needed of the ineptitude of the Government it has been presented to us by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan, who suggested that Members on this side of the House were smiling at his suggestions.  It <Col N="2465" /> would be difficult not to smile when one had sat here for a long time today listening to speakers on the Government benches telling us that there was no crisis in the nation's economy, that there was no problem in housing, no problem in connection with farm prices.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan, had the audacity to suggest here tonight that if we did not ask questions, if the Fianna Fáil Party did not raise the matter in this House, did not ask questions about cattle or farm prices in this House, prices would automatically start to go up tomorrow, that it was really embarrassing, that we were doing harm to the farmers by asking questions and that we were endeavouring for political reasons to embarrass the Government.  That is the Minister's plan for improving cattle prices. That is the plan brought home by this belligerent Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries about whom he was speaking a moment ago and in whose praise he was loud.</P>
    <P>Apparently the end product of the deliberations in which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has been involved over the last fortnight was a request to Deputy Donegan to go into Dáil Éireann and to say, &ldquo;Listen, lads, cool it.  Do not say anything about it.  If nothing is said about it the buyer will not know that things are so bad and will pay well for the cattle&rdquo; and to tell us that we are doing a disservice in talking about bad prices for farm produce.  On the other hand, he suggests that it is political motivation that is responsible for so many Fianna Fáil Deputies speaking on this subject.  I do not think there is a Fianna Fáil Deputy who has taken part in the debate who has not spoken about the present and pending far greater housing crisis that is on our doorstep.  Each successive speaker on the Government side today has followed the statements that have been made by trying to indicate that there was not a problem, that people are not being laid off in the building industry, that there are not empty houses in the city of Dublin and throughout the country because people cannot get loans to purchase them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2466" /> Here we are at 10.30 p.m. on the first day of an Adjournment Debate the Taoiseach having led off this morning, and we are still being told what was said at a very early hour this morning by the Minister for Finance and repeated at the end of the day by the Minister for Defence, that there are good times coming, that there will be a tremendous announcement, that something is going to be done for the building societies, that something is going to be done to lift the building industry off its knees, despite the fact that every speaker on the Government side today indicated that there is no need to do anything, that there is no problem, that there is plenty of money to enable these people to buy houses.</P>
    <P>We discussed in this House earlier today a new arrangement whereby a Minister can come into the House at any time, by permission of the Chair, and make a serious statement.  This statement is being made tonight because the Minister for Finance said this morning that it would be made tonight.  We have had sufficient evidence in the lifetime of the Government to be in a position to question the veracity of statements made by Ministers.  We had a collection of contradictory statements today.  We had the amazing situation in which the Minister for Defence, a man of experience in Parliament, came into the House and told us not to talk about it and that it would disappear.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity of raising this important issue.  I should also like to commend the Dublin Deputies for tabling this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2467" /> My own position is one of a Deputy in a constituency bordering on the Dublin area, one who has been engaged in youth activities for many years, who was hoping to see the extension and development of the work of Comhairle le Leas Óige to augment the work of the various voluntary groups which are already operating for the benefit of our youth in various towns and villages, to see this work and the function of Comhairle le Leas Óige spill over into neighbouring constituencies and to each part of this country.</P>
    <P>It was with regret then that I heard the Parliamentary Secretary's reply to this question.  I note the regression which has taken place in the city of Dublin.  I am disappointed with the Parliamentary Secretary's reply.  With your permission, I should like to hand over to one of the Deputies who tabled this question&mdash;Deputy Tunney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Deputies who are interested in this matter I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for having done us the honour of allowing it to be discussed here tonight.  I am mindful of the manner in which yourself and our officers and the staff here have been taxed over the last 36 hours.  I hope it will be accepted as an indication of my interest in this matter and of my dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Parliamentary Secretary dealt with the questions posed to him in relation to Comhairle le Leas Óige and youth problems generally in the city of Dublin, more especially the manner in which he dealt with what I know to be the true facts.  A system had been built slowly but surely since 1941 when the Department of Education invited the Dublin City Vocational Education Committee to co-operate with them in organising a system for the welfare of what could then be regarded as the deprived youth of Dublin.  From 1942 onwards Comhairle le Leas Óige, with the co-operation of the Department and working admittedly under certain impediments relating to the Vocational <Col N="2468" /> Education Act of 1930 had succeeded, I suggest, in bringing to it commendation, respect and results which should have been and were the envy of other counties, of other areas, of other institutions.</P>
      <P>Submissions were made by Comhairle le Leas Óige to the Department. I refer specifically to those made in 1968, which were accepted, that having regard to the new needs existing An Comhairle should be assisted towards extending its services to the youth of Dublin.  The Department readily agreed and efforts were made and indeed moves took place towards accommodating the new need that existed in respect of the youth of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the limitations that are on us in the matter of time and other Deputies wish to speak.  Therefore, I must jump rather quickly and say that the position in September, 1973, in respect of officers attending on this service was that there were 12 youth officers engaged in what was regarded as unattached work.  Of those, seven were described as community youth officers and five unattached operating in the central city area.  That was the position in September, 1973.  The position now at the end of July, 1974, is that there will be a total of five community youth officers operating with no unattached officer in the central city area.</P>
      <P>In the light of this tragic development questions were put to the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave a reply of many words cloaking up his inactivity and, worse still, accusing the Deputies who tabled the questions of being removed from the truth.  He began his answer to the questions by saying:</P>
      <P>It is not helpful to the work of many active organisations to suggest that there has been a breakdown of the youth services in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there is a big gap between the lush pastures of County Meath, the lavish comforts of County Meath, and the frugal basements, perhaps, of Dublin city, but I am surprised that any Parliamentary Secretary should come in here and having regard to the facts that were available to him, should <Col N="2469" /> do the youth of Dublin a disservice to the extent that he would deny that a structure which had been created to serve them as best it could and which now because of the inefficiency, the disregard and the lack of interest of the present Parliamentary Secretary, is collapsing, that he should come in here and deceive this House by indicating that it was not so and that if it was, it was happening because he was preparing a general national service.  To me, and I say this with no apology to any rural Deputy, there is nothing in Ireland as national as the city of Dublin and unless we realise that there are more youths in Dublin than in any village or indeed in any county elsewhere, we are not facing the facts.  If we are not prepared to accept, having regard to the density of the population and other social and economic matters, that the youth of Dublin are more in need and more deserving of this service then we are not speaking the truth.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is, notwithstanding appeals made to the Parliamentary Secretary since he took office, he is allowing this Comhairle le Leas Óige service, which as I said has been in existence for practically a quarter of a century, die.  I do not have to delay the House by indicating the trouble that exists in the city of Dublin at the moment in respect of our unattended, deprived and underprivileged youth.</P>
    <P>Perhaps he anticipates in this Government which changes from day to day and which, as I said yesterday, one never knows what one should call them, he will not be the holder of the office next week and does not feel compelled to act responsibly towards the youth of Dublin.  That is not an attitude befitting his office.  We cannot tolerate that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Wilson is to follow me I will be very brief.  I accuse the Parliamentary Secretary of complete indifference to the problems of youth in the centre city area of Dublin and throughout this city generally. His excuse for not taking action has been that he is devising a youth policy.  He has been doing this for the past 18 months and in the meantime <Col N="2470" /> the service has been allowed to run down.  There is nobody in youth work attending to the unattached youth in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary refers to youth organisations who are carrying on the service at the moment and states that the youth service has not broken down.  It has broken down in several respects.  The work that was done in the centre city area was very valuable.  A consultant psychiatrist from the Eastern Health Board told me that the work these unattached youth officers were doing complemented the work they are doing at the special centre in Usher's Island.</P>
      <P>I want to give the House some figures in relation to the number of people, particularly in relation to drug abuse, who were attending the Westmoreland Street office which Comhairle le Leas Óige operated.  Between October, 1973, and February, 1974, 120 people visited.  The total number of visits of these people was 1,006. The average daily attendance was 25. The total number of unattached youth contacted and helped in the centre of the city over that part of the year was over 300.  These are the youth who do not belong to youth clubs.  Those who are lucky enough to be in youth clubs have some place but the people I refer to have nobody to look after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has allowed the service to deteriorate.  He quotes figures in relation to the number of youth officers still employed by Comhairle le Leas Óige but counts the people who are in the headquarters, who do not go out and work in the community, as part of these figures. The total number of areas covered in 1973 in the city by unattached workers was seven.  Those are now down to three.  Places like Finglas had two unattached youth officers, now they have none.  Sheriff Street had an unattached youth officer and now they have none. There was a suicide recently in Ballymun of one of these young people who had been looked after by these youth officers.  There have been other attempted suicides.  These people need help now and the Parliamentary Secretary must act immediately to give <Col N="2471" /> these people the kind of conditions they have been looking for.  The staff and the committee of Comhairle le Leas Óige have been making representations to the Parliamentary Secretary's Department and every time they are pushed aside and told that this will be considered in an overall youth policy.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that Dublin cannot be considered in isolation from the rest of the country. This indicates to me a lack of awareness of the problems in Dublin.  He knows the work these people are doing because I have explained it to him many times but he has allowed this situation to continue.  These Comhairle le Leas Óige fulltime officers emphasise the need for voluntary youth officers and we have to point out that we need young men specialised in dealing with people with very special problems and failure to deal with these can create an explosive situation in this city.</P>

      <P>I do not claim to be the wisest person in the world but I am not the biggest duffer either.  I must confess when the Parliamentary Secretary spoke about this the last time I accepted what he said and I believed him.  I do not believe it now and I do not want him to get up and tell me how much more money he is spending this year than last year.  I do not want him to tell me he is developing a policy. I want him to tell me how many trained social workers are operating unattached in the centre city area?  If there are none let him not tell me that Comhairle le Leas Óige are responsible because they decided to discontinue. Why did they decide to discontinue?</P>
      <P>They did so because the Parliamentary Secretary has fallen down on his job.  He has not provided them with a proper career structure.  He is asleep or he cannot get the money out of the Government.  They have money for everything.  Let him go and kick the door and say he is not leaving until the Government supply him with money to get this youth service going properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not asking for an improvement <Col N="2472" /> on what was there.  I am asking for a return to what was there.  At the moment the service has fallen on its face and there is nobody responsible &mdash;certainly not An Comhairle le Leas Óige&mdash;but the Parliamentary Secretary. I do not like speaking hard words.  The brief looks all right but when one knows the facts about the unattached work in the centre of this city one must get angry, even when tired.</P>
    <P>Let the Parliamentary Secretary get the career structure going; let him fix the salary structure; let him employ people.  Deputy Tunney and Deputy Briscoe outlined the dangers of not having these people.  One of the features in the last seven or eight years from Tokyo to Berlin has been that young people have been particularly interested in social studies because their interest in their fellow human beings has been aroused.  They want to help.  Let not red tape or bureaucracy stop them from doing the job.  Do not let any delay stop them from doing their job in this city.</P>

      <P>We are discussing on the Adjournment Question No. 84 of last Thursday which refers, in the <Col N="2473" /> words presumably advisedly chosen by Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Tunney, to &ldquo;the breakdown of the youth services in Dublin&rdquo;.  That suggestion is not true and it is unworthy of the Deputies who made it.  In fact it was a suggestion which was repeated in some of the newspapers and which induced one of the most prominent people in youth work in Dublin, Father Fitzpatrick of the Catholic Youth Council, to write to the papers specifically to nail the lie that there had been a breakdown.  He considered that because of the work he was doing this suggestion which has been repeated twice by the Deputies opposite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Do the Deputies want to listen to the reply or not?  I pointed out in my reply that the terms of service of these youth workers which they accepted when they took up employment, and which were equivalent to those of temporary whole-time teachers' had been abided by, as was contracted.  In addition, they had <Col N="2474" /> obtained increments, degree allowances and higher diploma allowances. If, after that, they decided to resign it was their decision, not mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We must realise what they are now seeking.  Deputies opposite studiously avoided mentioning specifically what is being sought by the workers.  What is being sought is permanency and a completely new salary scale.  I should like to explain why it is not possible at this time to concede these requests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Those appointed as permanent officers on any body within the ambit of a vocational education committee or anywhere in the public service would be appointed on the basis of specific and clearly understood terms of employment, because they are going to stay in those posts.  The posts must be clearly useful, relevant and related to the work required to be done.  The role of full-time youth workers and how it is defined is central to a youth policy and can only be properly decided in the context of an overall youth policy which relates to their work.  It should be pointed out that if they are in permanent posts it is not easy to move them to other employment within the VEC because most of them have not teaching qualifications. The comhairle is a subsidiary of the VEC and therefore the creation of permanent posts is, in this case, an even more tying determination.</P>
      <P>At a time when we are at a very active stage in considering youth policy it would be premature to create permanent posts.  In regard to the new salary scale which is being sought and which is not related to anything within the ambit of the Vocational Education Committee I would point out that to concede this would create difficulties in relation to relativities for other people employed in the VEC to whom these people up to now had been equivalent.  Also, it would probably create relativity problems elsewhere in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2475" /> It may be necessary to do that but, if one were to do it, one would have to be able to argue very cogently to show that the work is relevant, properly supervised and that it requires to be paid for at the rates suggested. That could be done in the context of an overall youth policy.  I do not believe it would be right or proper to establish a precedent in Dublin which would ultimately have to be followed in other parts of the country.  Some Dublin Deputies may think Dublin is Ireland but it is not.  I have received deputations from people in Cork who referred to the comhairle situation and specifically sought to have the same situation duplicated in Cork.  They may have a good case for this but if it is to be conceded then one is establishing a national policy. If one establishes a precedent in Dublin one must recognise that is what one is doing, establishing a national policy.  I am adopting the right course of action because I want to get a proper policy and when that is established&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are priorities which must be established in youth work.  Employing people involves money which must be found.  Possibly other forms of youth work might be more relevant to the problem and posibly it might be so argued.  Comhairle le Leas Óige, in this nine-month year, is getting the annual equivalent of £150,000 which contrasts rather favourably <Col N="2476" /> with the total of about £100,000 which is what is being made available to all the voluntary organisations, Macra na Tuaithe, the Catholic Youth Council, the National Youth Council and so on.  If one is to establish proper priorities in regard to the allocation of the money available one can only do so in the context of a national policy. I will not be deflected from being fair to all the different approaches to youth work and all the bodies which have good claims to make and I will ensure that they are considered in a comprehensive way in the context of a comprehensive policy.  That is the only way it can be done and, despite the barracking of the Opposition and attempted blackmail by individuals, that is the way I am going to do it.</P>

I am undertaking this work myself and taking political responsibility for any delays that may occur, not trying to hive it off to anybody else or make excuses.

      <P>I should like to point out that the decision to restrict unattached youth work was not made by this Department nor at the suggestion of this Department but by Comhairle le Leas Óige itself.  The workers' decision to resign was made by themselves. The centre in Bewleys was closed and by decision of the comhairle was not replaced.  They made that decision on their own assessment of the situation of which they gave us further information only early this month.  It was not a decision of this Department and it is unworthy of Deputies opposite to suggest that it was.  Unattached youth work must get very careful attention.</P>
