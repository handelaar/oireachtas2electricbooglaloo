    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress on 16th May I had dealt with some of the points made during the debate.  On the following day we had the horror of the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan with considerable loss of life.  Many people were seriously injured and there was considerable damage to property.  Eleven days later the Executive of Northern Ireland ended and with it power sharing, at least for the time being.  I shall come back to these matters before concluding.</P>
      <P>One consequence of the bombings was that the Government decided to recall our contingent serving with the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East.  The exceptional strain imposed on the forces at home at present on security duty made this step necessary.  The Government are, however, committed to supporting the United Nations peace-keeping operations and will play their part in this important work in the future when the situation at home permits.  I want to emphasise that the withdrawal of the troops is regarded as a temporary measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hopefully, and we all must live hopefully, there will be some recession in the dreadful horrors around us at the moment.  When that happens it would be the Government's view, desire and hope that we renew our association with the United Nations and send our troops abroad again.  I want our troops to know this because the fact that they might get a chance of overseas service is a considerable incentive to young people to join the Army.  It is the view of the Government that this <Col N="1716" /> is desirable and our association with the United Nations in this regard has been of a very satisfactory nature. We will send the troops back as soon as the unsavoury job that must be done at home is concluded.</P>
    <P>With reference to the security force mentioned by the Taoiseach yesterday, the present thinking is that it will be operated by the Department of Justice through the local Garda stations.  I would appeal to former officers and men of the Defence Forces and former members of Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil to join this security force.  Security is most important in relation to our present difficult position.  The numbers of people within the permanent Defence Forces and the Garda are not at present capable of producing absolute security; in fact, it is highly doubtful if absolute security is attainable.  However, it would be of help if people were prepared to do watchful duties, to record numbers of cars and to see to it that movements of subversive persons are rendered more difficult by immediate reports to the relevant authorities, whether the Garda or the Army. Therefore, I would appeal to former Army officers and men and former FCA officers and men to join this new force and give of their administrative and training abilities to ensure an end to the violence.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to accommodation in Army barracks and housing for Army personnel. Local authorities have the primary responsibility for housing and my Department's role is supplementary and is related specifically to the housing needs of the Army.  Nevertheless, a good deal of attention has been given to the matter.  When introducing the Estimate, I indicated that two housing schemes for married soldiers have recently been completed. I can now state that it has been decided to build an additional 50 houses for married soldiers at the Curragh Training Camp and it is hoped to have this work commenced within the next few months.</P>
    <P>With regard to accommodation in Army barracks, it is a formidable task <Col N="1717" /> to provide and maintain a good modern standard of accommodation at all locations for a force that, of its nature, is subject to fluctuation.  I have already given an outline of the work that is in progress in this area and perhaps the best further indication I can give of the efforts being made to tackle this problem is to point out that expenditure on Army building contracts and the provision of material for Army building works in the last financial year was considerably higher than the highest level in any year of the previous decade.</P>
    <P>As regards building new barracks, it is a question of priority.  As priority is being given to the needs in Border areas, attention at present is directed towards making progress with the provision of new accommodation in Monaghan.  Deputy Meaney referred to local objections in Dundalk and Monaghan to the arrival of the Army. During the processing of the Monaghan project, my Department have been assured by local representatives that this project is welcomed in the area.  I can speak for Dundalk; the measures being taken there are welcomed locally.</P>
    <P>We are at the point when the consultants have their first work carried out and we are in a position to bring before the Government the question of the new barracks at Monaghan. That will be before the Government at one of their meetings either this week or next week.  From what I have seen of the work done, I am sure it will be a fine barracks.  It will redound to the credit of the Department of Defence and will satisfy serving personnel.  I am sure the House will be pleased at the progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dowling, Bermingham and Malone mentioned married quarters and overholdings.  As I have told the House on a few occasions in reply to questions and also in connection with the Estimates for my Department, the question of overholding is a thorny one. If I sign a document it will be possible to evict an unfortunate overholder and, of course, this is something I could not think of doing.  However, I am divided between my responsibility to the man who is no longer serving and is occupying a soldier's quarters and the man <Col N="1718" /> who is presently serving and is in need of the accommodation.  It is a difficult situation and it comes back eventually to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Some 28 overholders of married quarters at the Curragh recently applied to Kildare County Council to be considered for rehousing in a scheme of 161 new houses being built at Newbridge and four overholders applied to be considered for re-housing in a scheme of 75 houses being built in Kildare town.  My Department made representations on their behalf.  The houses in Kildare town have recently been allotted and I have been informed by the council that none of the overholders has been successful.  I am hoping that in relation to the houses at Newbridge some of the overholders will be successful and I am making further representations to Kildare County Council in that regard.</P>
    <P>Liaison between the county managers and the housing officers in the various county councils is most important.  I would refer to a matter I mentioned in reply to questions recently, namely, that soldiers might build their own houses.  A study was carried out by a young officer and the result was that 17 houses were built in Longford, 18 in Mullingar and a further scheme is proceeding at Dundalk.  I should like if this were done throughout the Army but, at the same time, I am aware there was liaison between the county managers in the cases I have mentioned and there was considerable sympathy in the provision of sites.  My Department could, with profit, conduct a closer liaison with county managers in this regard.  We will press forward to encourage soldiers to build their own houses.  They are now better paid and if they have been paying loans repayments for ten years this may be of benefit if they are transferred to another area.  However, I realise it is not practical for every soldier to build his own house.  Many have large families and are not in a position financially to do this.  They may be in the majority and it would be necessary for the Army or the local authority to rehouse them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> I would entreat county managers and local authorities to realise that overholders are a special case, that the Defence Forces are in a special position at this time, one that is quite different from anything that pertained in the last year.  From 1969 to the present there has been an increase in Army strength from 8,000 to 11,333 and this must put a strain on the soldiers.  My Department will enter into closer liaison with county managers and, at the same time, we will encourage by every means possible the creation of building societies and the building of houses by soldiers themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore raised the matter of electrical work at the married quarters for other ranks in Cathal Brugha barracks.  In fact, he referred to it as the rewiring of flats; that is not exactly correct but I think I know what Deputy Moore was trying to discuss.  The position is that the work is being done to facilitate bringing in a direct supply to the quarters by the ESB.  The work within the quarters is virtually completed but a new substation must be erected and main supply cables laid before the board can take over the occupants of the quarters as direct consumers.  The work is being pressed forward in co-operation with the board in order to give improved supply both to the barracks proper and to the married quarters.  I can assure Deputy Moore I will press forward with that as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney and others raised the question of various lands.  Before I discuss the questions they raised, I should like to generalise a little on the position with regard to Army property. When I became Minister for Defence I found that the Department owned vast quantities of property, both lands and buildings, which I did not realise they owned.  One of the things that has activated me since I took office has been dealing with these properties.  There is one very large one that has to be dealt with, and I suppose you cannot say that, up to the present, there is much to be seen of what we have been doing. <Col N="1720" /> However, generally speaking, I would like to suggest to the House that the property should not be dealt with piecemeal.  It should be looked on as a policy matter and always on the basis that you must accommodate your people in the Army and provide them with the opportunities and facilities for training that are proper to them.</P>
    <P>That entails a change, the selling of property and the purchase of property. That is a policy matter and it should be dealt with in that manner. Certainly what should not happen is that just because some other agency, private individuals or even a Department of State or a local authority, lay their eye on something which seems to them not to be in full use, it should be parcelled off, on the grounds that they think their need is greater.  Let us realise that there could be such a thing as mobilisation.  Let us realise that there was a time during the emergency when there were four or five times as many people in the Defence Forces as there are at present. Therefore, accommodation for training and so on cannot be lightly disposed of.  I want to lay it on the line that the Department of Defence policy and my policy is to deal with property in a manner which is proper and right for the Department of Defence and not to deviate.  Deviation means dealing in bits and pieces, and bits and pieces are no good to anybody.</P>
    <P>That is not to criticise Deputy Meaney or others in regard to matters raised by them.  The first question about Army property was raised by Deputy Meaney in regard to accommodation on the Border.  The House should be made aware that the nearest barracks to the Border in occupancy a few short years ago were Longford. Mullingar and, although not always fully occupied certainly occupied as a summer camp, Gormanston.  That meant that anybody doing duty on the Border had many miles to travel, wasteful of time, effort and equipment. Since that time we have acquired a good property, a closed vocational school, at Manorhamilton, where we can accommodate a company of soldiers.  We have acquired an old school in Lifford and in the words of <Col N="1721" /> the Commanding Officer of the Western Command, it will be the nicest little post in the Army when it is finished. That is giving accommodation on the Border, too.  We have also leased at Cootehill a property from religious who now have not got people to occupy that property, and that accommodation is satisfactory.  There is a post at Castleblayney which is based on the enlargement of an FCA hall.  As the House knows, we are dealing with Dundalk and Monaghan.  There is a barracks at Cavan which is most unsatisfactory, and I am sorry to have to keep soldiers in it, but the exigencies of the present time make it necessary. My desire would be to try to move on from the time of Queen Anne which is the period, I am told, when that barracks was built.</P>
    <P>The sale of 260 acres at Ballincollig Barracks to Cork County Council has been completed and the purchase money has been paid.  The money will be credited to the subhead for Appropriations-in-Aid for the Department's Estimate for 1974.  Appropriations-in-Aid are not, as was suggested in the debate, earmarked for any specific purposes.  Therefore it is a question for Government or ministerial decision how that money will be spent.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in a general way with the question of properties available for sale.  The last general review of properties administered by this Department took place a few years ago. Subsequently the Department disposed of nearly 450 acres of land in various parts of the country.  About 305 acres of that total were sold to local authorities for housing and other purposes. Properties which are found to be surplus to Army requirements are offered to other Government Departments first to ascertain if they are required for other State purposes. Should such properties not be required for these purposes my Department would favourably consider disposing of them to local authorities for housing and other local needs&mdash;with the overall consideration that there is a need for an Army and that, as far as the Department of Defence and this Minister are concerned, the Army comes first and will always come first as long as I am here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1722" /> Again we regret that overholders did not get consideration in relation to one particular housing scheme. However, local authorities have been facilitated by the Department of Defence to the tune of several houses for which sites have been allotted.  I hope, therefore, all this will not be on one side and that there will be a return from the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor dealt with the question of property at the Curragh which is not required and should be disposed of.  A study of the administration, rehabilitation and productivity of the Curragh lands is in progress.  In the course of that study the extent of military requirements at the Curragh will be examined.  At present a civil servant is doing a thesis on this for his doctorate and we in the Department of Defence are helping him.  It is a most difficult position.  There are three groups interested in Curragh lands for their own purposes.  First of all, there is the military.  Of course, the Department of Defence own the Curragh and they have first right there.  There must be a training camp, a military college, and all these facilities that will bring us to the stage where we really have an Army.</P>
    <P>Then traditionally the Curragh has been used by racehorse trainers for gallops and exercise.  That again is most important to our economy, and the military have always tried to facilitate these people as much as possible. Since I became Minister one member of the Turf Club has been designated as in charge of the Curragh and I have been working closely with him. One of the problems there is that everybody wants to gallop a horse on the best place and, especially when the ground starts to get soft or to get hard, the place either gets cut up or is unsuitable for training horses.</P>
    <P>The answer to that problem is to provide, as far as possible, extra gallops and also lunging rings outside trainers' establishments.  If a trainer sees the ground too wet and wants to exercise a horse that he is to run quite soon, he can exercise it in the lunging ring at his premises.  This will entail no expense to the Department of Defence and it is merely a matter of <Col N="1723" /> permission granted to the Turf Club to put in the sand lunging rings with the dual advantage that when there is frost the sand will not freeze or when it is wet the desire of trainers to go out and cut up the Curragh into slices by galloping horses across it will not be so great.  We have been working hard on this during the last year and the Department of Defence have reached the stage of doing 80 or 90 per cent of all that has to be done.  Therefore, it will be for the Turf Club to do the construction or improvement themselves with the permission of the Department of Defence.  If we have more to do, then we shall do it as best we can.</P>
    <P>The third interested parties are the sheep grazers.  At the moment the situation is that the sheep grazers have rights which allow each of them to graze a given number of sheep.  I am informed that the Curragh lands are of high quality but they have not had lime or fertiliser for years.  There is no legislative provision at the moment by which such could be done. I would hope that when this thesis has been produced we will have a blueprint whereby, in the course of the next year or so, I might be in a position to come to this House to legislate in an endeavour to improve the Curragh, bearing in mind that the sheep herders' rights in this regard will have to be preserved.</P>
    <P>Any sheep herder who would have the right to put out 100 or 200 sheep on lands which have not been limed or subjected to fertilisers for decades, perhaps for more than decades, might be pleased to hear that a scheme has been devised under which he could, on payment of money, or on the relinguishing of his shares or the taking up of further shares, or by what medium I know not until I have to hand the best advice I can get, by means of this system, improve his lot. I am not going to put a tooth in it: there are people on the Curragh, be they race horse trainers or sheep owners who are not angels.  I would think it possible that a sheep grazer might have put 200 sheep on the <Col N="1724" /> Curragh when he had permission for only 100.  In fact on the last count, we were somewhat horrified.  At the same time, all trainers do not gallop where they are meant to gallop; all trainers do not obey the Turf Club; they are not all angels either.  But I am the jam in the sandwich.  It is a two-layer sandwich; you have the bottom layer which is, I suppose the sheep herders and then you have the racehorse trainers with the Department on top.</P>
    <P>I will try to do my best between them all.  But, when we have this appraisal which has been commissioned and have had an opportunity of really examining it&mdash;say, by this day 12 months&mdash;I may have to come to the House and do things which may bear criticism.  One cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs and I am ready to bear that criticism as long as I can be convinced that it is for the good of all parties.  We must wait and see.  One of the things that might happen is that, when the appraisal has been fully considered, we might find ourselves unable to do anything.  But I do not think such will be the case.  A deep appraisal of the situation in the Curragh has not been carried out heretofore and I think that this one will bear some fruit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cronin raised a point about Dublin properties which would be of considerable commercial value or be useful to local authorities for housing. I mentioned the question of Cathal Brugha Barracks on the last Estimate. There is a project afoot that there should be a new barracks outside Dublin and that Cathal Brugha barracks should be disposed of.  I want to repeat that it is my conviction that in regard to an area of 47 acres in the centre of Dublin city the people of Dublin will express strong views on how it should be dealt with. I do not think the Minister for Local Defence, the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance or anybody else will get a full say in this regard.  Without criticism of anybody, I think we are all agreed that some of the new properties or housing in Dublin have fallen foul of justifiable <Col N="1725" /> criticism and the manner of development of our city has not been to everybody's liking.  I think that this only real slice left of Dublin city, which can be dealt with properly, should be dealt with properly.  I would hope that the people of Dublin would take a very great interest in it.  It is conceivable and probable that, at a point in time, it would leave my jurisdiction and move to that of another Minister or Ministers.  At that point I hope the very deepest concern will be shown by the people of Dublin, that this very large slice of Dublin city&mdash;I can think of only two other slices of the same sort of size; one is Guinness's Brewery and the other is the Royal Dublin Society grounds in Ballsbridge, but neither of those is available; this is the only one&mdash;will be dealt with properly for the people of Ireland, the people of Dublin.  At the moment the position is that we will soon hold a meeting of the Council of Defence in relation to the first papers that can be put before them in respect of Cathal Brugha barracks.  Certain investigations had to take place and these papers have taken some time to prepare.  I hope that, before another month will have passed, we will have had our initial meeting and, perhaps, will have decided on the site for the new barracks.  That would be the first main decision of this meeting of the Council of Defence.  I am convening this meeting because I regard this matter as of the utmost importance.  I hope that we shall be ready to hold it in about a fortnight's time.  I would have had it long ago, were we ready to act, but these things take time.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Fitzgerald raised the possibility of transferring the headquarters in Cork to a new barracks, sited possibly in Ballincolling.  The transfer of Southern Command headquarters from Cork to Ballincollig would involve the erection of a substantial number of buildings in Ballincollig. This would require considerable expenditure which would not be justified in present circumstances.  My view is that it is low on the priority list.</P>
    <P>Certainly over the next decade we <Col N="1726" /> will see a movement of barracks out of cities.  The fact that in cities in times of terrible uprisings, of huge fires, or anything of that type, traffic gets jammed, leads one, from a military point of view, to site one's barracks within ten or 15 miles of a city.  But I would think that would receive low priority in the face of all we have to do elsewhere.  I might say that Collins Barracks is one of the nicest barracks I have been in, an excellent barracks is one of the pleasant place as well with, of course, the disbility that any barracks sited in the centre of a city at the moment is not an ideal barracks.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Fitzgerald asked also about plans for the Department's property at Crosshaven and whether this was available for other purposes. This has been examined and I think everything is satisfactory there.  Over 45 acres held at Fort Camden, at Crosshaven, are used extensively by the FCA and Slua Muirí for training purposes.  Permission has been granted to Crosshaven GAA club to use approximately three and a half acres of these lands as a playing pitch on a year-to-year basis.  The use of the area will be subject to military requirements.  This is the normal basis for the giving of army lands for playing pitches and it has worked satisfactorily for all parties.  Deputy G. Fitzgerald also raised the question of the use of lands at Ballincollig by the Ballincollig Hurling and Football Club.  This club has the use of approximately ten acres of those lands since the 1st May, 1951, subject to military use of the area, for military purposes and exercises.  This arrangement also has worked satisfactorily for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the position of housing needs in Dundalk.  As I have now received the first valuations and papers from the consultant architects and engineers, I hope that Dundalk will follow quickly because they were appointed at the same time as Monaghan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Malone raised the question of the dual carriageway through the Curragh lands.  The position there is that discussions took place last year <Col N="1727" /> between officers of my Department and of Kildare County Council regarding the construction of a dual carriageway through the Curragh lands.  Subsequently, the council indicated that they were not proceeding with the building of a dual carriageway but intended, instead, to investigate the building of a motorway through the Curragh lands.  Discussion was held on this matter, at which the Department of Local Government were represented also, and further discussions are intended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cronin then raised the question of lands at Kilworth Camp and the possibility of making them available to the Agricultural Institute, or the handing over of them to that institute. I said: &ldquo;Never; you cannot hand over lands in this way.&rdquo; Since then, I have examined the situation and, subject to military requirements and to the handing back of them at any time, on any notice, it may be possible&mdash;we are not quite at the point of being able to offer a lease&mdash;and the House may take it that very probably it will be possible to make available 140 acres of land to the Agricultural Institute.  I saw these lands the other day and they would be most suitable for them.  But I want to emphasise again that the handing over of lands piecemeal by a Department of State is not proper policy and that those lands, if given to the Agricultural Institute, will be intended for retrieval at any point in time.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised by several Deputies of whether or not there was a reduction in the amount voted for general stores.  Such is not so.  The position is that one cannot buy military equipment as one buys a packet of cigarettes.  It takes a long time to acquire military equipment.  The experience has been that most military equipment ordered is delivered in the last three months of the financial year.  I cannot bring to this House fallacious figures.  If it is a fact that, because of the nine months' year this year instead of 12 months, a lot of the goods ordered will not be delivered and, therefore, not paid for until outside the financial year then I suppose the <Col N="1728" /> people of Ireland and the House would be extremely happy that I would not have to come for as much money.  But it may be taken that the increase, on a 12 months' basis, is of the order of 25 per cent and it is merely a question of timing of delivery.  A deposit was paid on jet aircraft in 1973-74.  This year's Estimate includes provision for a further payment, with the balance being provided later.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the new fisheries protection vessel.  I hope the keel of this will be laid down this year and that the vessel will be built in Ireland but, until firm prices and delivery terms have been obtained and evaluated, I cannot state accurately when the vessel will be in commission. While I have an open mind on the number of vessels needed to patrol our territorial waters in the future, the building of a new vessel is a significant step, a clear indication of the importance I attach to the Naval Service. With the secretary of my Department, I conducted an examination on what was our position.  In opening the debate I informed the House roughly of what it was, that there would very probably be a large increase in the area of sea to be covered.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with the exact number of protection vessels or thing type of protection vessles one thing was quite clear and that was that you could not go wrong by ordering a duplicate of the vessel &ldquo;Deirdre&rdquo;. &ldquo;Deirdre&rdquo; has been highly successful. She can do up to 18 or 19 knots. She is, capability for capability, by long odds the cheapest thing that can be bought in the world today. At the present moment a minesweeper, I am informed, runs to about £4 million and this, of course, is quite ridiculous.  There are no old ships from the 1939-45 war that are practical to buy at present and as far as value for money was concerned it was quite clear, on the advice of Captain Kavanagh of the Naval Service and all the appraisal we could get on it, that this was the best buy.  That is why we are building another one. The discussion on whether there should be five, six, seven, three, four, eight or any number, can go on but one thing is certain and that is that <Col N="1729" /> there should be another one built in Ireland this year.</P>
    <P>I hope to see the jet aircraft arriving quite soon, not all of them immediately but I hope we will see one during the autumn and after that jet training can proceed.  This is important. I have indicated before the importance of feeding Aer Lingus with persons who have given perhaps nine years or more of their lives to the Air Corps.  There will, therefore, be a number of technical staff, in Aer Lingus, who will have been trained here and will be entirely racy of the soil itself.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of the sail training ship.  When the Minister for Finance was advised that the life of the &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; was possibly another five or six years and that at the end of its period coasting would be the proper work for it, the Government were faced with a decision as to whether they should discontinue the service that was provided for the training of 200 or 300 young people a year or whether they should continue it.  The Government, I think wisely, decided that it should be continued and the building of the sail training vessel was handed over to me as Minister for Defence.  A designer was commissioned to design the vessel and a committee was formed.  The &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; committee continued and, indeed, I should like to record my sadness at the death of the chairman of that committee, whose funeral I attended yesterday, the late Mr. Frank Lemass.  Mr. Lemass conducted the affairs of the &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; with consummate skill.  Everything was done in his office.  The Office of Public Works just got the bills and everything was then examined.  The &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; was run in a most businesslike way.  We are all sorry to lose him. He acted also, of course, on the committee. I took the entire &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; committee that had been appointed by the previous Minister for Finance on to the committee for the new sail training ship.  I am glad to say that I have with me here in the House the specification for the new ship and the line drawings and final detailed drawings were delivered to my Department <Col N="1730" /> about two days ago.  She is designed by Jack Tyrell of Arklow and now the designs and the specification must undergo the examination of the committee.  I am advised that some of those people are on holiday and that in order to give them time to examine these very detailed plans and specifications the right thing to do is to have a meeting to consider it round about the 20th to 30th July. That I will do and then we will be in a position to send out tenders.</P>
    <P>We have initially inquired how many Irish yards would be prepared to tender for the building of this vessel.  The position is that four yards are prepared to tender.  We would have hoped to have this vessel in time for the tall ships race in 1976 which would be a great fillip for our sail training. It is just a question of whether or not we will succeed.  If we do not, it will not be for want of trying but it may be that when we get the time of building back from the various tenderers we will decide that we just cannot make it.</P>
    <P>The new vessel will be different from the &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; in as much as being so much bigger she will be in the water perhaps for a whole year, perhaps not, but she will be in commission for a far longer period of the year.  She will be in commission during school terms.  I hope that members of An Slua Muirí will at those times be released from their employment if they are in employment and I would ask employers to do this.  I hope to see crews of An Slua Muirí receiving sail training on this vessel.</P>
    <P>The capability will be quite large because it varies at the moment between 18 and 20 trainees.  Therefore, every ten days for about eight months of the year we can put 20 through our hands.  I would hope also to see serving soldiers having sail training.  It is in the Department of Defence now. It is their vessel and I hope to see them getting their sail training and enjoying it whenever the duties they have to perform allow it.  That is going well.  I feel that generally speaking for an island nation it is the least we can do and it is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The question of dealing with the <Col N="1731" />&ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; is one that I will look at in a most detailed way.  The &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; should certainly never be broken up. The previous head of the Naval Service, Commodore Tom McKenna, recommended at the time of the commissioning of the &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; that the &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; should be taken out and put on plints at Howth.  Perhaps it would have been wiser at the time to have taken Commodore McKenna's advice and to have done that and built a sail training vessel but such was not done so we now find ourselves with the &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; with possibly three or four years of its life to run and then a proper decision on something that the State should keep and keep well will have to be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty raised the question of smaller vessels for fishery protection. There is a possibility that on our next purchase we might be changing from the prototype, the &ldquo;Deirdre&rdquo;.  That is something I cannot say at the moment because I am not fully advised but I would say to Deputy Hegarty and the House that the &ldquo;Deirdre&rdquo; is highly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty also raised the question of the purchase of twinengined helicopters.  I raised this question myself shortly after coming into office because the Alouettes do not fly after dark.  I was assured by Colonel Paddy Swan, the then head of the Air Corps, that from the point of view of picking up people for hospital this was not a great disability and that the hours of darkness very rarely had any great effect, that in their training they do, in fact, fly after dark and they could go out in the dusk and come in in the dusk and that sort of thing and that he would prefer &mdash;and that was the basis on which we bought the last two Alouettes&mdash;more Alouettes than more expensive helicopters in lesser numbers.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage where we have to evaluate whether or not we need a different type of helicopter. It would, I suppose, be 1976 before any change could occur because these stores are not bought off the shelf.  The disabilities of the helicopters are matched by very fine <Col N="1732" /> capabilities.  I am told that the British are quite envious of us because we have the French Alouettes.  However, we will now have oil rigs off Cork and we have larger areas of sea to cover for fishery protection.  Helicopters are not suitable for fishery protection and the new &ldquo;Deirdre&rdquo; will not have a helicopter pad on the advice of the Captain of the Naval Service. At the same time, the Alouette does not go out of sight of land.  The Alouette is equipped with a gyroscopic compass and an ordinary magnetic compass and nothing else.  The Alouette is navigationally a very simple type of aircraft.  It has not got radar, decca or various other things.  There is a proposal at present that we might equip one of them with decca but every time more equipment is loaded on to a helicopter like the Alouette its carrying capabilities are lowered.  The examination of twoengine helicopters and helicopters of greater capability is something that will have to be proceeded with and I shall do so but I do not see any change before 1976.  I still take Colonel Swan's point, not for further purchases, but for the purchase we made, that he would prefer to have a greater number of Alouettes than a lesser number of very much more expensive helicopters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan referred to An Slua Muirí.  I am informed that the strength of An Slua Muirí in Limerick city has increased by 25 per cent over the last four years.  In addition to the training carried out on one night each week An Slua Muirí personnel are encouraged to undergo annual training for a few weeks in Cork Harbour where the Naval Service facilities are made available to them, including professional instruction, and naval vessels, where possible.  They are also encouraged to participate in organised weekend training on frequent occasions during the year.  Further, Slua Muirí personnel are encouraged to undergo courses of instruction for two or three weeks at naval base which, when practicable, include some speed going in naval vessels.  While steps have been taken towards procuring a seagoing vessel for An Slua Muirí the suggestion to <Col N="1733" /> use An Slua in special vessels for fishery protection duties is considered impracticable.</P>
    <P>I think that is so because fishery protection involves a pretty tough operation.  In my own constituency I was given word that there was poaching off Clogher Head.  I informed the Captain of the Naval Service and a ship left Cork and chased two vessels off our area about 24 hours later. That sort of thing meant belting around Carnsore Point and up the Irish Sea as hard as they could go but it is the sort of thing that has to be done by people on fishery protection. I am glad to see that the minesweepers and the &ldquo;Deirdre&rdquo; are doing their very best.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of equitation.  When introducing this Estimate I dealt with certain rumours and a discussion in relation to a horse that was owned by a member of the family of a Member of this House. There were all sorts of suggestions in relation to this horse.  Since I become involved in the question of equitation, the rejuvenation of the Army jumping team, which was at a very low ebb, and the purchase of horses, I have found&mdash;I mean this in no carping way&mdash;that the gossip that goes on about horses that are sold is worse than the gossip that goes on about ladies' hats.  You cannot look at a horse but there is gossip, rumours about all sorts of vast sums of money, and all sorts of rumours that the thing has only three legs.  This at first sight might seem to be of no consequence but it is of very serious consequence for the sellers of the horses.  If there is a rumour about a horse away up in the high price bracket that can effect the sale of the horse.</P>
    <P>Our veterinary surgeons do the job for us and we know privately what the situation is.  The private buyer and the buyer from overseas hear this rumour floating around.  Either the rumours of high prices or those about any physical defect are most undesirable.  I do not intend, under any circumstances, to discuss with the Press any particular detail of any purchase at any time.  Purveyors of horses to the Army jumping team <Col N="1734" /> may realise that any of their discustions, whether they reach fruition in the sale of horses or not, will be entirely confidential.  There is no question at all of any outside agency knowing anything about it.  That is the only way we can proceed and it will remove a disability that would be there even for our purchasing team.  If the people selling horses think that if they come to us the next thing will be that somebody will know about it that is bad for us.  I want it to be quite clear that I will not mention anything at all about any particular horse, any views about him, where he went or where he was sold. I want to say from the point of view of the sellers, and from our point of view, it is most desirable that absolute secrecy be preserved.  I did not realise it but when you get into horse dealing and big money there is more gossip about horses than there is about ladies' hats.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald raised the question about co-operation with Bord na gCapall.  I want to tell the Deputy that there is the utmost co-operation with Bord na gCapall.  About four mornings a week I see Bord na gCapall horses leaving McKee Barracks. I call to the Deputy's attention a horse named Wet Water Lily and a young man called Kevin Barry. He is not an Army officer.  He is a rider with Bord na gCapall.  He operates from McKee Barracks along with the officers who are in the equitation school and he rides Bord na gCapall horses there.  If it suited us to win we would put Kevin Barry up on an Army horse just as Bord na gCapall would put an Army man up on their horse if it suited as well. There is the utmost co-operation and we are trying as best we can to put Ireland back on the equitation map.</P>
    <P>Let the Deputies not think that is just window dressing.  It is more than that.  It is the only advertising we can possibly think of for the Irish horse apart from racing.  The position is that the Irish horse cannot be advertised as one would advertise petrol, watches or any of these things.  You can have a good jumping team.  In my view it would be very difficult to produce a <Col N="1735" /> good jumping team this year.  Building up takes years.  We will do our best and while I am not very happy that we will do very well this year, because we have not been as successful in purchasing show jumpers as we have been in purchasing three-day eventers, I can see a fine improvement and our co-operation with Bord na gCapall will continue.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in this particular practice.  As I said, I am out at McKee Barracks four mornings a week.  I am convinced, having looked at this place in detail, that if Bord na gCapall were to set out with a <i>carte blanche</i> situation and money it would be six or seven years before they could produce the same facilities that are available in McKee Barracks.  There are 30 rooms there, skilled men, who spend all their lives in this environment, who have travelled the whole Continent with Irish horses and put them to jump and do the best for the country.  You do not find those fellows growing on bushes and money will not buy them.  From that point of view I am convinced, even from the personnel situation, Bord na gCapall on their own would not be able to provide what the Department of Defence can provide for them for some years to come.  Bord na gCapall must expand spectacularly and they must get to the stage where they can provide all those services.  In the short term there is no doubt that these services must be provided by the Army to help them.  I want to assure the House that the Government, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and myself, do not care who is on the horse.  We want Irish horses to win and it is in regard to that we are trying to do our best.</P>
    <P>We have horses on loan from Bord na gCapall to the Department of Defence. The two bodies share the services of the same trainer, Mr. Eric Bubbel, who is most satisfactory.  I am not too hopeful of a great showing for the Aga Khan Trophy this year because, as I said, we have not been as successful in the purchase of show jumpers as we have been in regard to the three-day eventers.  If they all stay sound I am very hopeful <Col N="1736" /> that we will do well in the world championship three-day event at Burleigh in September.  Our success in Punchestown and our successes at the start of the season show that we have the material and we have the men.  If the horses stay sound we will do well.  It will be a great advertisement for the Irish horses if such occurs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham mentioned the question of making available Army sports facilities, including gymnasia, to outside bodies.  We do that but at the same time we want to keep our facilities for ourselves and there are security problems as well.  We will facilitate everybody, particularly in relation to football pitches, that we can.  I have already instanced the manner in which we do it.  Two examples in Deputy Bermingham's constituency since I took office were at the Athgarvan Gaelic football club.  I had complaints that they had a pitch which was just maked out, that it was being cut up by Army vehicles and all that sort of thing.  I went down to the Curragh myself and had a look at it and it did seem as if they had problems.  We got our lands officer on the job and I am glad to say we got them an excellent football pitch and the people in the village of Athgarvan are delighted with it and it will be a great help to the young boys and girls who will use it.</P>
    <P>We have not reached fruition yet where the Newbridge Soccer Club is concerned but I believe we will do a good job on that.  We may not give away land but where we can provide facilities for young people we will do so and we will do it with a heart and a half.  I have not yet met any Army officer, particularly the Director of Training, who is not of that mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney complained about the Army athletic grounds in the Phoenix Park.  The ground itself is all right.  Deputy Tunney mentioned a building which he said was not of the very best.  This is held under licence from the Office of Public Works by the Army Athletic Association and it is usually controlled by the Officer Commanding the Eastern Command.  The grounds are used by the Army for <Col N="1737" /> recreational purposes.  The building is not satisfactory, but that is a problem for the Board of Works and I have raised the matter with the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cronin and Deputy G. Fitzgerald raised the question of Easter parades and the fact that there was no participation by the Army in these parades.  There was no Easter parade this year and the Deputies should be aware that the Government decided this year that St. Patrick's Day should be celebrated as a day of national commemoration, a day on which all who died for Ireland and all victims of civil strife in Ireland are remembered and, as a corollary to that decision, the State did not participate in Easter ceremonies this year.  That was a very wise decision.  We saw last Sunday cases of assault in Dublin on people who were returning from Bodenstown.  I am sure the patriot was turning in his grave at such behaviour.  We are great people for wrapping the green flag around us.  It is not our job to wrap the green flag around us.  It is our job to stand and salute the flag, see what we can do for it in a quiet and proper way and not trail our coats or make political use of such an occasion, and political use is being made of such occasions but, thanks be to God, this Government has decided not to do so.  Last Sunday I was returning from the Curragh and I suddenly found myself caught up in a procession leaving Sallins.  I left very quickly, I may say, and went on somewhere else, but if I ever saw anything being used for a political purpose that was it.  This Government stands by a decent State, a democratic Parliament and absolute determination that no group of subversives will take from the people what they are entitled to by the power of the ballot box.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan mentioned the question of FCA recruitment.  This is a continuing process.  We lose a number of young men who come in for a year, get fed up and go out again.  This is quite expensive because their equipment and training costs a good deal.  At the same time we get <Col N="1738" /> quite a lot of benefit from the FCA. In the last three months I have got the commanding officers in the various areas to contact members of the FCA and I have had an inquiry conducted to find out how many members of the FCA would be available to come up for full-time duty.  I am glad to say 448 said yes.  Possibly that number will decrease because of family commitments and so on but, at the same time, we had these 448 members of the FCA whose desire it was to come in and help us in our dreadful dilemma of trying to do a security job.  In my own constituency, I am glad to say, recruitment is going well.  The effective strength of the FCA on the 30th April was 16,419, comprising 669 officers, 2,809 non-commissioned officers and 12,741 privates.  This figure is regarded as satisfactory by the military authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nolan raised the question of having boys who had completed their intermediate or group certificate recruited to the FCA to undergo whole-time training between June and September, the object being to build up a first-class defence force with attendant benefits from the point of view of discipline, hygiene and comradeship. That would entail quite a substantial reduction in the lower age limit, which is at present 17 years for enlistment to the FCA.  I have had from officers of the FCA a similar request in their anxiety to try to keep their numbers up.  It has been suggested they should take in 16-year-olds and it has also been suggested that some 16-year-olds have got in.  Perhaps they have.  I do not know.  The best military appraisal of the situation is that, if you are going to put a young man out with a gun and he could find himself on barrack duty this is a responsibility which requires an age of 17 years and I think that decision is correct.  We would wish, of course, to let everyone go to Finner Camp for a lovely holiday at 16 years of age and get a bit of target practice there.  Let us face it; ours is not a toy army and the times in which we live do not allow us to look at these things very lightly.  I am not enamoured of the idea of 16-year-olds carrying <Col N="1739" /> weapons and I do not favour any change in the lower age limit.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to try to get all the 17-year-olds they can in because it is most important that we should have a good FCA force.  I am at the moment conducting an inquiry, the results of which I hope to have quite soon, into how many among the FCA as well as the men who have offered to give part-time service could come in for longer part-time service.  At the moment they come in to do light barrack duty and release soldiers for checkpoints and patrols on the Border as well as the protection of vital installations in other parts of the country. If we could extend that and if there were people who could come in for, perhaps, three months of the year that would mean we could free one quarter of members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>This is being fully investigated.  It is a long detailed business.  One could do various things, such as calling up the Reserve and the FCA, but this is really not practicable because the number of recruits in training among them would mean that training would have to be carried out and, at the same time, calling them up would seriously hinder the security duties of the Permanent Defence Forces.  However, if it is possible to get a larger number who can give three months, with the acquiescence of their employers, they will be taken in.  That investigation is proceeding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor raised the question of uniforms.  Uniforms for the Army and the FCA were some time ago a great bone of contention.  There was mention of cloth known as bull's wool. I am glad to say it has disappeared and the quality provided now for FCA uniforms is the same quality as that provided for the Permanent Defence Forces.  It is a good cloth.  Of course FCA uniforms are not worn as frequently as they are in the case of the Permanent Defence Forces and they do not, therefore, wear out so quickly.  We must wait until we get to the point at which it will be proper to issue to all the FCA these new uniforms.  At the moment a great number of the FCA have had a change of uniform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> The question of resettlement and technical training was raised by Deputy Coughlan, Deputy Malone and Deputy Dowling.  Here I find myself in a tugof-war. It is not for any lack of desire on our part that resettlement services and training for members of the Defence Forces are not at full strength. If everything were peaceful a very much greater number of the Permanent Defence Forces could be retrained for resettlement.  I am torn between the necessity to keep these men on their soldierly duties of helping the gardaí and so on and, at the same time, the desire in their last years of service to retrain them for emergencies in the outside world.  One cannot provide everything.</P>
    <P>I would be dishonest if I did not tell the House that, if a soldier is doing a soldier's duties on the Border, it is quite impossible to train him at the same time in welding or any other skill which would be of help to him when he came out.  I am restricted there but, to the maximum we can, we are trying to arrange training for resettlement. Arrangements exist for the attendance of Army personnel of 40 years of age and upwards with a view to their resettlement in civilian employment at courses of training in such skills as turning, grinding, milling at training centres under the control of AnCO. Due to the present heavy demands on the Defence Forces it has not been found possible to release any men to attend such courses in recent years.</P>
    <P>Another matter of great contention is the question of driving licences.  An Army driver of a heavy truck who has not got a driving licence outside the Army must do a driving test.  I have raised that with the Minister for Local Government and I do not know at this point in time what the result will be. It seems to be a bit ridiculous that a man who has spent ten or 15 years of his life driving heavy vehicles, with full rights on the road, should find himself when he leaves the Army in the position of having to do a driving test.  Apart from anything else, this takes time and, perhaps, causes a little worry.</P>
    <P>The enlistment of young offenders was mentioned by Deputy Tunney, <Col N="1741" /> Deputy Callanan and Deputy Coughlan. Here, again, we are torn between a desire to be decent to a young man who has gone a little wrong, and a desire to maintain a high standard in the Defence Forces.  You must face the fact that if I take a man into the Defence Forces he will probably be billeted with 19 other people.  I slept in dormatories myself when dormatories were not as sumptuous as they are now, and I can tell the House that, apart from the person who snores, there is the person whose habits are not the best and he is a nuisance in close contact.</P>
    <P>It is only right that there should be a high standard of hygiene and behaviour and mental ability in the Defence Forces.  That is not to say that we should make it an elite corps.  That is not to say that the ordinary person has no place in the Defence Forces. Of course he has, and we want him. At the same time, if somebody is a petty thief and would rifle his comrade's belongings, or steal his watch, or take his few pounds, the commanding officer must think about that.  I am afraid I must insist that, except in the case of very minor offences, none of these persons can be considered for service in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>There was a time when judges used to say: &ldquo;I will let you off if you join the Army.&rdquo;  I said introducing my first Estimate here, and I say now, that if any judge says that I guarantee that the person will not get into the Army so long as I am Minister for Defence. I will not billet with 19 other men a man who will make life abominable for them.  After the recruit comes into the Army there is a period before he finally signs.  I get perhaps two or three complaints a month from parents whose boy was sent home to them.  He is not sent home for nothing.  As I say, there is no desire to make the Army an elite corps but we must get to the stage where the people will look up to the Army.  If I want to do that I cannot take people into the Army who will redound to anything but the credit of the Army.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this with the Adjutant General at length many times, and he has assured me that <Col N="1742" /> nobody is being tough about this.  Any of us here who was being billeted with 19 other men would not like to have an undesirable amongst them. Soldiers live in close proximity to each other.  I do not see the end of billeting for some years to come.  There are places where we have cubicles and individual sleeping places but, by and large, the billet for 20 men will stay for some years to come. There is also the association of sitting at table and of working together. I cannot take undesirables into the Army and I will not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney, Deputy Dowling and Deputy Bermingham raised the question of officers' orderlies.  Paragraph 37 of Defence Forces Regulations A16 provides that, if the exigencies of the service permit batmen orderlies may be allotted to officers and there is a schedule showing what the situation is.  It is true that, from a democratic point of view, and from the point of view of the year 1974, it might be considered that batmen are out of date.  At the same time, there are people in the Army who do not mind giving this service and who like giving it.  They can always opt out.  One of them said to me: &ldquo;It is very easy to get out of being a batman. All you have to do is break enough plates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the point that it is possible to get out of being a batman if you want to.  I will watch this situation. Perhaps the appointment of new batmen could be considered.  I have been making inquiries and I find that many of these men are in the last years of their service.  They have grown fond of the families of the officers with whom they are billeted as batmen and they do not want to change.  If a young man is given that job and does not want it, I am not suggesting that he should break plates, but I think that he is a rarity.</P>
    <P>The question of commissions for serving soldiers was raised by Deputy Coughlan and Deputy Callanan.  I want to thank them for raising this matter because the result was that I investigated it immediately.  In my view, the position is not satisfactory but there is a reason for it.  The training of these <Col N="1743" /> men takes quite a bit of time and people have to train them.  There is also the fact that officers and NCOs were quite scarce when we were removing them for Border duties.  We are getting over the shortage of officers. We increased the number of cadets last year and this year and we will get over that shortage quite soon.  There were two schemes for the award of commissions to suitable non-commissioned officers, one in 1961-62 and the other in 1969-70.  Twenty non-commissioned officers were appointed to be officers under the first scheme and 31 under the second.</P>
    <P>One of them is well known to all of us.  He was my instructor during the war when I was a company officer in the Red Cross and he was an Army sergeant instructor.  He travelled the whole of Meath and Louth on a bicycle in those days.  I will not mention his name.  When the cadets are commissioned we will be in a better position regarding officers.  We are also improving in the matter of NCOs.  I hope we will be able to put a class together possibly within six or nine months.  This takes people away from the Border and it takes the cream of the NCOs but they are entitled to this and they have been neglected.  You must give as well as take.  My statement may be taken by the Department as an indication that I want a class put together within six or nine months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Malone and Deputy Bermingham raised the question of bandsmen, and the fact that they blocked off their own promotion.  This is absolutely true.  They give a marvellous service.  I inquired what they got as an extra for being bandsmen.  It is very little really.  They got £2 extra per week but they have blocked off their promotion.  I will look at this as well. It is very difficult to know what you could do.  You cannot have a band with every man in it a sergeant.  I will see what can be done about it.  I am grateful to Deputy Malone and Deputy Bermingham for raising this matter because everything cannot be brought to the Minister's attention by the various people in the Department and, therefore, Deputies who raise these matters are a great help.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> Deputy Bermingham raised the question of civilian employees.  He mentioned that he had been told that the practice of advertising vacancies for these employees on a notice board at the Curragh Camp had been discontinued. I investigated that and the position is that there was a case some time ago where a labourer was put on a panel of tractor drivers without the vacancy having been advertised on the notice board.  The Workers Union of Ireland made representations about this and, as a result, the Corps of Engineers authorities indicated that the normal practice would be adhered to in future. Again, I am glad of Deputy Bermingham's vigilance in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned the question of sick pay to civilian employees and I am informed that this is invariably authorised with the minimum of delay.  Because of the necessity to have sick notes or medical certificates and evidence as to social welfare entitlements it does take a little time to get these payments.  We have all had these irritations in relation to social welfare benefits and in many cases where there are health situations there are delays if one does not get the doctor's certificate in time.  I suppose this is the same sort of thing but we will try to speed it up as well as we can.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham also mentioned delays in the payment of pensions and lump sums to retired civilian employees under the non-contributory pension scheme.  This scheme was first introduced towards the end of 1971 and was made retrospective to the 1st January, 1970.  This meant that considerable arrears had to be disposed of in so far as all employees with the qualifying service who had retired between the 1st January, 1970 and the date of introduction of the scheme had to be dealt with.  These arrears have now been cleared up and we do not visualise any other delays.  There was a large number of people who were entitled to their money and they had to be dealt with first.</P>
    <P>The question of search for arms and security was raised by Deputy Meaney. I do not intend to go into that in great detail because it was raised on the Adjournment and I said what I <Col N="1745" /> wished to say there.  However, I want to say that whenever it is a fact that information reaches the Department of Defence, via the Department of Justice or any other agency, which we believe is something that necessitates a search we will go out and help the guards in that search to the utmost to our ability.  I would call to the attention of the House the fact that in this security game one is playing against an opponent whose scores are all chalked up as people die from bombs in the papers but the score that I want, which is to stop them doing it, means that nothing happens and that score is never chalked up. I wish to draw the attention of the people of this country to the fact that the time the security forces of this country are succeeding is a time when nothing is happening.  This game where the other fellow's scores are chalked up in horror and blood and sacrifice and ours is not chalked up should not delude people into thinking that the security forces are not vigilant and not on their toes.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made about the question of the right of the soldier to shoot.  A headline in one particular newspaper used a phrase which I do not wish to use here because it could be emotive.  We are, at the moment, still investigating and preparing helps for the soldier in this regard.  Deputies may take it that every soldier in the Irish Army is now being instructed by his commanding officers, and his non-commissioned officers, as to what his position is. I am not going into a field which is more properly the Attorney General's but I am merely saying that it is not a toy Army we have.  Nobody wants to damage or do anything to property or to people but we are there to defend and see to it that this Parliament prevails.  If that necessitates certain actions then best advice will be given to the serving soldier on his position under the law.  That is as far as I will go in that regard.  That best advice has been given.</P>
    <P>Dhein an Teachta Tunney tagairt d'úsáid na Gaeilge san Arm&mdash;ábhar nár cheart a phlé ann féin.

    <P>We will do our best to see to it that, as far as possible, the Irish language is cherished in the Army.  No change of any kind has been made in relation to the commands which are given in Irish normally.  Certain changes were made. I had to make certain changes on the question of the reception of cadets. There was, I feel, an unfair situation there.  It was quite incorrect that the persons not coming from schools where teaching was through the medium of Irish should be at a server disadvantage. I made those changes and they were the subject of a discussion in this House in the early months of my ministry.</P>
    <P>I had a recommendation from the Chief of Staff the other day to the effect that it is no longer possible to find enough non-commissioned officers to teach in the Military College in the Curragh through the medium of Irish and I have had to allow a relaxation there also.  Those are necessary things. I must get my men on the Border and I will get them there.  Nothing will stand in the way.  In so far as the NCOs are available they will be taught through Irish.  As well as that we are continuing a course in Irish culture as a subject so that whatever has been lost in one regard will be made up for in, perhaps, a better way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney expressed concern over the delay in settling claims made on the United Nations for expenses incurred in connection with the participation of our troops in peace-keeping operations.  However, the record shows that the position is reasonably satisfactory. I have examined this position since Deputy Meaney made this remark and I am satisfied with the position. Money cannot be paid from such a source just as one might collect one's salary on the 1st of the month or one's wages on a Friday evening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> The United Nations are paying up constantly and as a percentage the amount outstanding is at no time unsatisfactory.  I should also like to remind the House that the United Nations pays all the extra and extraordinary costs incurred by us in sending troops overseas on peace-keeping missions.  When some stores that were left behind had to be sent later by commercial airline I discovered that the cost involved was huge.  I was absolutely horrified at the cost of moving 30 tons of goods from here to Israel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cronin made the suggestion that the local Garda superintendent should be in a position to authorise the employment of Civil Defence in a local emergency.  Deputy Cronin should know that the structure of Civil Defence is that the county manager in each county is head of Civil Defence and that it operates through the local authority.  He should also be aware that Civil Defence operates beside where he was in the park and through the Department of Defence. It is a very good organisation and we have our plans made if there were to be a large number of refugees.  I was entirely satisfied with the speed with which that was done and the manner in which county managers and local authorities co-operated.  The back-bone of Civil Defence, as I know it, is always the staff of local authorities. This is a very proper and right way to do it.  Deputy Cronin was a bit woolly but I should like to draw his attention to the fact that the Taoiseach announced yesterday that through the Department of Justice we are setting up a security force where we hope that good citizens will see to it that subversives do not move untrammelled through our country.</P>
    <P>Army pay was mentioned by various people and I should like to assure the House that the benefits of the first phase increase under the employer trade union national agreement, 1974, have been applied with effect from 1st June, 1974, to the pay of all ranks.  Further pay adjustments provided for in the agreement will be paid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney referred to my <Col N="1748" /> opening reference to a Supplementary Estimate to cover 15th round pay increases but this matter was included in the Book of Estimates.  I can now inform the Deputy that the question of pay increases was included in Vote No. 50 and that the money is available.</P>
    <P>I should now like to move to military service pensions and special allowances.  Deputy Nolan suggested that, &ldquo;veterans should be brought into line with non-contributory old age pensions.  This year if a non-contributory old age pensioner has a wife he gets an extra £3.50 for her.&rdquo; That is what Deputy Nolan said.  The Deputy also referred to, &ldquo;an old IRA man with a pension if he dies his widow gets half his pension with the minimum of £1 per week.  If a man in receipt of a special allowance dies his wife gets nothing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position is that any special allowance holder who is in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension will be eligible for the additional £3.65 provided under the Social Welfare Acts in respect of his wife and this amount will be disregarded as means for special allowance purposes.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be an increase in special allowances in line with the budget provisions regarding pensions.  The amount of the increase will be about £15 or £16 per annum or about 9 per cent. Widows of military service pensioners get an allowance equal to one-half of their late husband's pension or £80 per annum whichever is the better.  This does not apply to the widows of special allowance holders.  As Deputies are aware, there is a clear distinction between military service pensions and special allowances.  A special allowance is meant to help somebody in poor circumstances and it is a very good scheme but, naturally, if you are helping somebody in poor circumstances it may not look to be as attractive as a pension that comes of right.  If you find an old person in poor circumstances there should be a scheme to help him.</P>
    <P>A burial grant of £50 is payable in respect of military service pensioners <Col N="1749" /> and special allowance holders and certain disability pensioners.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney suggested that the means test for special allowances was too rigid and urged that the existing procedure whereby free maintenance which does not include hardship on the provider is assessed, should be discontinued.  Deputies Cronin, John L. O'Sullivan and Nolan also urged greater assistance for the veterans of the War of Independence.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the basic concept of the scheme of special allowances. It is to supplement the income of those veterans with limited means who by reason of age or permanant infirmity are unable to support themselves. The means test for special allowances has been progressively relaxed to the point that social welfare benefits are only partially assessed as means and budgetary increases in those benefits are disregarded entirely or substantially.  Examples of disregarding are as follows: where a single person has an old age contributory pension of £7.20 a week or more only £0.62½ a week is assessed; where a married man has an old age contributory pension of £11.85 a week or more only £1.55 a week is assessed; where a single person has a non-contributory old age pension of £6.15 a week or more only 5p a week is assessed; where one of a married couple has a non-contributory old age pension of £6.15 a week or more no assessment is made; where a married couple have a combined non-contributory old age pension totalling £12.30 a week or more only £0.97½ a week is assessed.</P>
    <P>I would like to scrub these pence that are assessed.  Whether or not I could find it possible to do so I do not know but it appears to me as if the assessment of means is fair.</P>
    <P>Where a person is in receipt of free maintenance which does not impose a hardship on the provider I consider it fair and reasonable that part of the value of such maintenance should be assessed.  It is so small that I wonder whether or not it is practicable. However, let it be so.  Any relaxation of the means test which would involve disregarding such maintenance <Col N="1750" /> entirely would benefit only those persons who enjoyed that privilege and would bring no improvement in the condition of the worst off category of special allowance holders, namely, persons with no assessable means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister but the point I was making was in regard to free maintenance.  There is nothing legally binding between parents and a son or daughter.  Yet the pensions officer assesses it.  I do not wish to interrupt the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get full information on that point.  I thank the Deputy.  Deputy Meaney said:</P>
      <P>With regard to wound and disability allowances there is room for improvement.  We should remember, too, that Army personnel are now exposed to much greater dangers than they were up to recently.  That is true of those at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>They are all home now with the exception of 22 officers.  The existing rates of disablement pensions payable are considered fair and reasonable.  I may add that the Army pension code is under continuing review and the maximum rates are as follows: single officer, 100 per cent disabled, 55 per cent of pay; married officer, 100 per cent disabled, 48 per cent of pay plus £2.10 per week for wife and £1.14 per week for each eligible child; soldiers: single, £14.11 per week; married, £14.11 per week plus £2.10 per week for wife and £1.14 per week for each eligible child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> Where the disablement arises out of United Nations service an <i>ex gratia</i> lump sum of £1,500 is paid in respect of 100 per cent disablement to officers and soldiers without distinction as to rank.  <i>Pro rata</i> amounts are payable for lesser degrees of disablement.</P>
    <P>Deputies Meaney and O'Sullivan urged that the spouse of a veteran should be enabled to travel free independently of the veteran.  The free travel scheme administered by my Department is subject to the same conditions and limitations as apply in the case of old age pensioners.  There is very little that I can do about that. Any question of extending the scheme would be a matter for consideration by the Minister for Finance.  I personally would welcome such a development if it could be managed.  It is up to the Minister for Finance.  The present annual cost of the travel scheme for veterans is extraordinarily high&mdash; £277,000.  I would have thought that it would have been less than that.</P>
    <P>We wrap up this debate on the Estimate for Defence on the basis that, as I have said and would like again to say, the police forces of the democratic State can do certain things.  A democratic State also needs an army which helps its police force.  In the case of a very big State there may be other ideas. Defence means defence of our shores. That can arise in many ways as distinct from standing and fighting at our borders be they sea or land.  I would refer to the fact that there are certain things the police force of this country cannot do.  There are certain services they cannot provide and, because of their numbers, there are certain services they cannot provide in full as required by the people of this State.  There are also services proper to the police that the army cannot provide.  At the same time, at this present time they are the two State agencies who, above all else, stand between anarchy and democracy. We must back our army and police force to the very utmost.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the car bombings in Dublin and Monaghan on 17th May last and to the serious loss of life and serious injuries and damage to property which were caused.  Apart <Col N="1752" /> from the awful toll of death, injury and destruction, I should like to draw attention to something else.  Perhaps in the context of death it is almost improper to follow it up by talking about money and jobs.  Nevertheless, we have to think about that.  I should like the House to consider how many decisions were made in London, New York or on the Continent of Europe not to come here and to start factories.  I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that in entering the European Economic Community we created a situation in which large corporations and various businesses had a reason to come here and set up industry.  That was to avoid paying the common external tariff of the EEC.  We have had new factories coming here in quite large numbers. We do not know how many went elsewhere because of our record of bombings, of death, of pillage.  Therefore, I want the House to realise that the first thing we must do is to clean our slate as far as subversives are concerned.  In that list of subversives I name first of all, as far as we are concerned, the IRA.  As long as they are active, as long as they are there, as long as they bomb, so long will there be the deaths that they cause and so long will there be the deaths that other people will cause.</P>
    <P>We do not know who did that dreadful deed in Dublin and Monaghan on 17th May.  We do know that we must ask every person in this country to back our security forces, to see that it does not happen again. The worst feature is that security cannot be perfect.  Therefore, it can happen again.  I say that those people who are responsible for these deeds are a threat to our way of life.  This Government stand determined to stop them at all costs and by every means in their power.  Such we will do but we could not do it without the backing of the people of Ireland and I am asking for that for the Irish Army and the Irish police force.</P>
    <P>Today, security must colour all our thinking.  The Army, acting in aid of the Garda, are doing a fine job. They need the backing of the people. As Minister for Defence, I will try to give the Army of my very best, to <Col N="1753" /> see to it that they get all that can be given to them to help them in their worthy work.  That being done, I ask the people to back them to the very hilt.</P>

      <P>I have already answered as well as I could a considerable number of matters raised by Deputies on the Estimate for my Department.  I should like to refer to a couple of developments which have occurred since my remarks some time ago.</P>
      <P>I spoke then about the question of the national culture in the relevant section of the Broadcasting Act.  I have tried to cover the question of what is meant generally by &ldquo;the national culture&rdquo; and, in the concluding part of my remarks I should like to discuss Irish language policy with specific reference to the responsibilities of my Department under the Broadcasting Act in relation to the use of Irish in broadcasting.  I would also like to amplify some remarks I made earlier about the use of radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1755" /> Since I last spoke the new international telephone exchange was opened.  I do not propose to say a great deal about that because I made a statement when opening it setting out its nature and functions.  This was published in the Press.  As Deputies are aware of it I do not propose to repeat it here.</P>
    <P>The new international telephone exchange which was brought into service on 15th June has greatly improved our international telephone service.  I should specify, of course, that when I say &ldquo;international telephone service&rdquo; I am speaking of the service which links this country with other countries outside these islands and not specifically with the telephone service to Britain.  Delays of up to two hours which were experienced at times on some routes up to the time of the opening of the new exchange have been eliminated and there is now a &ldquo;demand&rdquo; service.  This means that the subscriber can get in touch with the operator immediately. Calls to certain countries which are not served through the international exchange are still being delayed.  In these cases we are awaiting completion of circuits or other technical arrangements abroad.  We hope that the routes concerned will be served through the new exchange on a nodelay basis within the next few months and some within a matter of days.</P>
    <P>I referred in my opening statement to the proposed establishment of a Post Office Users' Council.  I am now happy to announce that Mr. A.C. Crichton has accepted my invitation to be chairman of this council.  Mr. Crichton is a director of Irish Distillers Limited and a former governor of the Bank of Ireland.  I have written to the following organisations asking them to nominate persons for appointment to the council: Consumers' Association of Ireland, Irish Farmers' Association, Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Association of Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, Confederation of Irish Industry, General Council of County Councils and Comhairle na Gaeilge.  I have also invited the following <Col N="1756" /> large users to nominate members: Waterford Glass Limited, Cork Co-Operative Marts Limited, Stephen Feller of Galway, Dublin Newspaper Managers Committee, Electricity Supply Board, Córas Tráchtála and the Industrial Development Authority. I should clarify, of course, that I have invited these users to nominate members but I have not yet received replies. I thought I should use this opportunity to acquaint the House of the present state of affairs in this matter which affects everybody in this country since we all, in one way or another, make use of the postal services</P>
    <P>I would like to amplify some of the remarks I made in reply to Deputy Colley on 13th June in regard to the use of the radio networks.  I am glad to come back to this matter because many Deputies placed great emphasis on radio and their wish to see the development of the radio services. Significant capital investment has been made in radio in recent years.  The first VHF network, provided to supplement the inadequate medium frequency coverage of the Athlone transmitter and give high quality interference-free reception, could become available for alternative programme use when the new high power Tullamore medium frequency installation, giving coverage to the whole island, is completed in the middle of next year.  In the meantime, I will give every encouragement to increasing the provision of choice in RTE radio programming on days and at times when this is most necessary, through separate utilisation of the medium frequency and VHF networks. The second VHF network, which carries the Radio na Gaeltachta service in the evening, is now broadcasting test transmissions of music for the trade in the morning and afternoon; it is hoped that these transmissions will encourage interest in Radio na Gaeltachta and also the spread of VHF receivers and the use of VHF reception by listeners.  It is also hoped that the proposed pilot radio service for Gaeltacht national schools will begin transmission at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1757" /> The new radio centre at Donny-brook is nearing completion and work is in hands on the development of facilities at provisional centres to improve the capacity for regional programme contribution to the national networks.  A fully equipped mobile radio studio will be brought into operation shortly and will be available for programme origination from provincial centres.  The first steps in local broadcasting have already been taken with the experimental programming from the Cork medium frequency transmitter.</P>
    <P>A new development is that a daily half-hour programme from Monday to Friday is being provided for a period of two months from 24th June.  This service has the benefit of guidance and advice from the newly established Cork Radio Advisory Committee.  The Cork experience in the next few months will be important in indicating the possibility or development of other such services.  If the results of the Cork experiment are encouraging, I hope to see it developed in other areas.  We will be watching the experiment with great interest.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of the role of the Irish language, particularly in relation to broadcasting, but before we can consider it specifically in this regard we must consider more generally the question of what the Irish language policy is, can be and should be.  I will divide my remarks into a discussion of that situation generally and then a consideration of its application to broadcasting.</P>
    <P>With regard to the controversy generally, I made a statement some time ago in Waterford which led to a considerable amount of public controversy. I do not regret that; I think public controversy is a healthy part of our national culture, one we should be prepared to encourage and participate in, trying always to keep it above the level of personal slanging and making it a discussion of ideas.</P>
    <P>Considerable heat was generated in the controversy and, as often, the intensity of the heat led to some distortion of some of the things said including what I said myself.  I do not complain of that because I realise that <Col N="1758" /> a certain amount of distortion is almost inevitable in controversy and if we engage in it we must accept that fact. I stand entirely over the substance of my remarks at Waterford but some people whom I greatly respect and whose attitude to the Irish language I respect have told me that the tone and manner in which I approached this subject on that occasion were unnecessarily abrasive and wounding.  I accept that criticism and I shall try to be guided by it for the future.</P>
    <P>I suffer, perhaps, from the disability that sometimes when attacking a set of ideas I believe to be false I fail to respect adequately the feelings of people who cherish these ideas.  I am trying to cure myself of this disability; a number of critics are giving me some assistance here and I thank them for it.  I should like to point out that it is difficult in this area, as well as in other areas, to criticise ideas that should be criticised without giving some offence to those who hold them. The problem arises here whether we should acquiesce in what we believe to be illusions in order not to hurt the feelings of others.  Perhaps we are inclined to do just that; it is a part of our culture, in some ways it is an amiable trait but it can be costly. Some of the illusions we have let alone, the sacred cows that we have allowed to wander, have now got out of control.  The problem remains of how to criticise ideas while giving the minimum of offence to others, although it must be realised that in making the criticism we will necessarily give some offence.  That will be my approach to this controversy as I speak here.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Act states that in performing its function An tÚdarás shall bear constantly in mind the national aim of restoring the Irish language, preserving and developing the national culture, and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of these aims.  In the earlier part of my remarks I dealt with the question of national culture in other areas than the Irish language.  It is just the aspect of the Irish language I should like to deal with here.</P>
    <P>We speak of the national aim of <Col N="1759" /> restoring the Irish language.  It has never been quite clear to me what exactly we mean when we speak of the restoration of the Irish language. I put that question to a professor of Irish when we were on television &mdash; Deputy Brugha was present also &mdash; and I asked him if it meant restoring it to the position it occupied, say, in 1169.  Perhaps it was a rather abrasive formulation, although I hope not.  The answer the professor gave flabbergasted me.  He said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; that he would be satisfied with restoring it to the position it occupied in 1600.  How could we restore the language to the position it occupied in 1600 unless we also restored the whole state of affairs at that time, the social, economic and other circumstances?  Do we really want to do that?  That reply certainly is not adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  This is part of the problem. Among those who aim at some way to restore the Irish language, or doing some good thing for the Irish language, there is quite a wide spectrum. In fact, although apparently I have not conveyed that message accurately, I am a part of that spectrum.  I hope I shall make this more clear here.  This formulation which is in the Broadcasting Act and, therefore, is pertinent to consider here&mdash;the restoration of the Irish language&mdash;is wrong because it suggests that what we are really trying to do is to change this country, which is now almost all the time English-speaking for most of the people, so drastically that it will become an Irish-speaking country with English as some kind of second language.  I know that many people who are active in the Irish language movement no longer regard that as a genuine and realistic aim but the wording &ldquo;restoration of the language&rdquo; suggests in some sense that it is the aim and, therefore, it ought <Col N="1760" /> to be changed because, in my opinion, the setting of impossible aims is damaging to us in a number of ways. The aims which are described on those benches over there as national aims, restoration of the language and the unification of the country, these two going together mean that what we are setting out to do is to achieve a united Irish-speaking Ireland.</P>
      <P>That is so far out of the reach of anything we can achieve that it is bad for us.  The setting of impossible aims traps us into a position either of despair or at least of permanent shame at not being able to do these things, or cynicism about lip service.  Therefore, we ought to lower our sights a bit.  We ought to see what can really be achieved about the Irish language; what do we want to achieve; and then set about that, and in our legislation and in our administration that is what we should be about.</P>
      <P>Repetition of these national aims assume that the country is now in the same mood as it was in the 1918 elections, conceives things in the same ideological terms as the leaders of opinion did then.  I do not think that is true.  Deputy Brugha chided me the other day, perhaps rightly, for dwelling too much on the past, but I dwell on the past sometimes in order not to dwell in the past.</P>

      <P>We all try in our different ways to be useful.  We are doing our best.  An attitude to the Irish language which is realistic and at the same time positive requires a benevolent acceptance and promotion of bilingualism.  Deputy Brugha nods and I know that he and many others are in agreement with that.  This is extremely important.  The child&mdash;and we are speaking more particularly perhaps of children; there is not an awful lot that can be done with adults in this sphere&mdash;growing up in an environment which is mainly English-speaking must not be brought to feel that English and Irish are hostile aspects of his culture and that he must choose between them.  If he or she does &mdash;we are speaking as much of girls as <Col N="1761" /> of boys&mdash;first of all, it will be psychologically bad in inducing a sense of conflict; secondly, in the overwhelming majority of cases, granted the nature of the context in which the child is placed, if this hostility is felt to be there by the child, it is the English language which he will choose.  He may again feel some shame about that, but that is what he will do.  Quite often, having made the choice he may feel a sense of actual hostility towards the language he has rejected and shame about the language he is using.  All this is psychologically very bad, bad for our children and bad for that which we are seeking to promote, the Irish language.</P>
      <P>I read the other day of an incident which I think typifies all that is worst in certain attitudes to the Irish language.  The report was of a young girl taken by some group on an organised holiday to the Gaeltacht, of which apparently a condition was that no word of English should be uttered. This was upheld with draconian methods.  The girl, experiencing consternation at not being able to find her bicycle on a platform, said a sentence in English, whereupon the dread word &ldquo;abhaile&rdquo; was pronounced and the girl was sent home.  My goodness, that girl will hardly become a pillar of the Irish language movement later.  The experience was hurtful, humiliating, and must have been generally distressing. Believe me, I am not seeking to present this as typical of everything that the Irish language movement stands for.  I know it does not.  I know it is quite an exceptional thing, but I mention the incident only to pinpoint what I regard as the worst and most negative feature in this movement, that is the sense of hostility or at best grudgingness towards the English language; the English language is something you put up with; the Irish language is what you love, and if others will not love it, by golly they had better.  That sort of attitude gets in the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own small son is at what is described, and rightly, as an Irish language school, Scoil Neasáin in Artane.  I have been very impressed by what I see of that, because the six-year old boy there is learning Irish. <Col N="1762" /> His Irish is coming along very nicely, but Irish is taught in that school not by an exclusion of English but in a linguistically ecumenical context, if you like.  The children who go there, as far as I know, do not experience a sense of conflict and hostility between Irish and English, a feeling that they must choose one or the other and feel bad about it.  They associate Irish with the pleasure of learning it and with no friction between it and the language which they use more generally. I observe that this little boy and his friends are using Irish more and more and using it unaffectedly and in a matter of fact way, and this surely is what we want.</P>
    <P>The thing was put very well the other day by the general secretary of the Post Office Workers' Union.  He was speaking, oddly enough, in the same place as I made my famous or notorious address on the self-same subject, in the Ardree Hotel in Waterford.  Speaking on the 5th June he referred briefly to my own remarks and said:</P>
    <P>It merely put into different words the different sentiments on the same subject that arrive in my office from disadvantaged members of the union.</P>
    <P>That is, speaking of the Post Office Workers Union, which is a large union, as the House knows.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>I doubt if very many people remain who have a hostility towards their own Irish language.  Neither do I doubt the motives of those who seek its preservation but defend their viewpoint as they may, their efforts have not produced a national dynamic for its extension.  Instead we seem to have élitist pockets private mini-republics, unintentionally no doubt, but unfortunately no less, giving the impression that they are surrounded with walls of intellectual bigotry creating anything but affection for our language. If Irish was synonymous with joy or less associated with sorrow, loss and punishment its survival and extension would be more assured.</P>
    <P>He went on then to say something which is not directly relevant but it is <Col N="1763" /> peripherally relevant to what we are considering here:</P>
    <P>Visualise the present practice in the Civil Service of notifying in Irish only, special holiday facilities in the Gaeltacht, despite strong staff side protests that such notices should be printed bilingually in order to ensure knowledge of these courses was disseminated far and wide.  The fact of the matter is that, if one could read those circulars quickly and with ease, one should not be sent to the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with that but I see what he means.</P>
    <P>Is the Gaeltacht to be a closed shop for the enthusiast and the Gaelic speakers?  Surely it is the hesitant and reluctant to whom the encouraging hand should be stretched and not the dedicated who have already been won over.  What efforts have ever been made to bring the children from the back streets and the high rise flats into contact with the Gaeltacht?  Must their only acquaintance with Irish be through the cane or the dry-asdust grammar book?</P>
    <P>As regards general Irish language policy in the Civil Service, I can do no more than bring those last remarks, which seem to me to be very pertinent, to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for the Public Service.  Of course, the key sentence in that is the words: &ldquo;If Irish were synonymous with joy and less associated with sorrow, loss and punishment its survival and extension would be more assured&rdquo;.  I think that puts into better words than any we have ourselves yet been able to find the principle that underlies Government policy in this area, and I should like to stress here that it is one Government policy, that I and all my colleagues firmly support; I refer, of course, to the policies put forward by the Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Tom O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were made at various times that there were some differences in policy between the Minister for <Col N="1764" /> the Gaeltacht and myself.  There is absolutely no difference in policy and there is no difference in approach. There is, I am afraid, a difference in style and, I repeat, I should like to learn a little from the Minister for the Gaeltacht in this area without, however, altogether sacrificing whatever is positive in my own approach. But it is a difference purely in style. There is no difference in substance. The idea of encouragement rather than compulsion and the setting of attainable realistic goals in relation to the use of Irish is the centre of it and, as I say, it was put in very good words, indeed, by the Minister for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I should like now to come a little closer to the subject of how all this applies to broadcasting.  First of all, I should like to make it absolutely clear, because of very frequent and persistent misrepresentation in this particular sphere, that I have not at any time been urging, demanding, requiring or wishing that there should be less use of Irish in broadcasting. That is not so.  Neither was I attacking any persons in RTE for their attitude to the Irish language.  I was attacking, or criticising at any rate, the attitude of mind that lay behind that section of the Broadcasting Act the wording of which I have criticised.  That Act, of course, was framed not by RTE, whose only responsibility is to work under the Act, but by politicians here in this House and I propose&mdash;I shall be coming back later this year in more detail and precision to this subject&mdash; to change that wording in that Act and I have been endeavouring to show why this should be done.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na Gaeilge made an interesting submission to the Broadcasting Review Committee and I should like to quote some part of that submission here because of its intrinsic interest and most direct relevance to what we are about here. I do not know if Deputy Brugha has seen the report.  If he has not, I shall be happy to let him have a copy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will forgive me, but I should like to put part of this on the record.  The document was submitted in both Irish and English and I am reading from page 11 of the English text.  It says:</P>
      <P>For our purpose the audience for radio and television programmes can be roughly divided into the following groups.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Group A&mdash;Gaeltacht:</i> The first and normal community language of the people of the Gaeltacht is Irish.  They speak it, not for any ideological reasons, but because it is a normal part of their traditional way of life.</P>
      <P>The Census of 1961 shows that the total Irish speaking population of the Gaeltacht areas is about 64,000.  This is indeed a small number, being less than 2 per cent of the population of the State.  The importance of the Gaeltacht from the point of view of our national identity and aspirations cannot however be defined in terms of numbers alone, because it constitutes the regional base of the Irish language and ensures that it continues to have native speakers, without which a language is dead.</P>
      <P>Taking the State as a whole, Irish might be described primarily as a minority language being spoken mainly in one particular part of the country&mdash;the Gaeltacht.  As an area, the Gaeltacht is of course regionally fragmented and, in addition, no strong sense of identity exists between the different parts.  For historic reasons, the Irish-speaking community has been deprived of the internal unifying forces of convergence which exist in a viable society and this can only be detrimental to the maintenance of Irish. It is, though something which the broadcasting media can help to rectify.</P>
      <P>I should like to add here that presumably it is being rectified to some extent by Radio na Gaeltachta.  That is Group A, the people of the Gaeltacht, about 2 per cent.  Group B&mdash;the Language Loyalists; the wording is distinctly pre-1974:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1766" /> This group is distinguished on the basis of its members' loyalty to the Irish language and their determination for ideological reasons to speak and use it to the greatest possible extent.  This group has played an important part in bringing about a restoration of Irish high culture (literature, thought, <i>et cetera,</i> but, without effective participation by the broadcasting systems, among other cultural and economic forces in the community, their efforts have not had the effect they might have had on the language loyalty and selfesteem of the Gaeltacht population. It is difficult to determine the size of this group as population censuses are unable to distinguish between those who constitute this group and those who claim merely to have a knowledge of the language.</P>
    <P>Could we guess at the size of the group?  Is it as high as 10 per cent? Not more, I think.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent survey which was taken about ten years ago shows that the number of people who say they have a good knowledge of Irish is around 27 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the people who are really prepared to work at it.  I think that is not 27 per cent.  I think it is a good deal lower. Group C is rather quaintly labelled, &ldquo;The Ethnically Aware&rdquo;.  That is an odd one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This group spans a wide range. At one end it includes those who are strongly ethnic, and those who <Col N="1767" /> while their knowledge or use of the language is less than those in Group B, yet have a good knowledge of or use the language from time to time.  At the other end of the scale it includes those who are only marginally ethnic.</P>
    <P>I feel that I fall into that point of the spectrum somehow:</P>
    <P>It may, therefore, be said perhaps to include two sub-groups which we can express as C1 and C2.</P>
    <P>As a group it is the largest of all. It consists of all those who accept Irish as the ancestral tongue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>In parenthesis, if we are speaking of all the people of this island, there is more than one ancestral tongue.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, accordingly it is a sign of our national distinctiveness.  The majority of the group would regard the language as a cultural desideratum and would on occasion show considerable interest in it, (c.f. sales of Buntús Gaeilge, Buntús Cainte, ratings of Watch your Language, etc.)  Generally members of this group have a sort of nostalgic respect for the language and feel it suited to use in some limited domains such as introducing nationalistic or highly ritualised speeches, stereotyped greeting and so on.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless many of them may be quite lukewarm or even hostile towards the implementation of practical policies designed to ensure its viability, and will respond only to a judicious approach.  This kind of discrepancy between practice and attitudinal positions is, of course, common in human societies (e.g., the position of religion in urban Britain) and one must accept it as such.  In general, though, this group constitutes a large reservoir of goodwill towards efforts to maintain our language and cultivate our ethnic individuality. It is from this group that activists in the movement may be said to receive their mandate to define and implement policy.</P>
    <P>It goes on to poor group D who are &ldquo;The Ethnically Unaware&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> This is probably not a large group. It consists of those who are characterised by a negative attitude to Irish, regarding it as irrelevant and of no significance to them. Some of this group may, of course, have a knowledge of Irish and be quite prepared to use it when the occasion requires such behaviour.</P>
    <P>It goes on to speak of &ldquo;General Policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These groups will have different needs and requirements.  As RTE will have an important influence over a wide sphere of thought, activity and language use, a special study should be made of these needs and requirements in a diglossia situation.  In this connection Máirtín Ó Murchu's paper &ldquo;Language and Community&rdquo; (Comhairle na Gaeilge Occasional Paper No. 1) and the Comhairle na Gaeilge report &ldquo;Towards a Language Policy&rdquo; are relevant.</P>
    <P>Fair dealing alone would dictate that Irish speakers, and Group A particularly, should be catered for. RTE might also set itself some further objectives&mdash;increasing the viability of the Gaeltacht as a cultural unit by contributing to the development of a sense of unity. The gradual and sensitive promotion of a formal spoken variety of Gaeltacht Irish, which would be acceptable to the people of the Gaeltacht, would enhance the language's image in the eyes of native speakers&mdash;and this could be promoted in formal domains of language use in broadcasting.  Suitable staffs should be recruited and/or trained to the desired professional level so as to make this aim practical.</P>
    <P>It should be said that the existing RTE policy has produced some worthwhile results.  Generally, the sound of Irish has been introduced as a normal experience for the radio and television audiences in many Irish homes.  There are some good programmes on both radio and TV, more frequently indeed on radio.  The latest schedules&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This was a long time ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" />&mdash;show some improvement.  The establishment of Radio na Gaeltachta will no doubt help to improve the situation but it is important that this should not lead to a less frequent use of Irish on the national service.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Consideration of Present Policy and Programmes.&rdquo;  The main criticisms are that at present the programmes in Irish are too few and too rare, that they are planned somewhat haphazardly&mdash;not surprisingly, since the concept of diglossia is only being developed&mdash;and that they are not planned as part of an overall plan to cater specifically for the different groups listed above.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for the limited number of TV sets in the Gaeltacht, programmes geared specifically to the Gaeltacht's interests are few, the greater number reflecting group C.</P>
    <P>Group C, if we remember rightly, is &ldquo;The Ethnically Aware.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Irish used, particularly in continuity, is often of a substandard variety, the bilingual approach seems sporadic and unplanned, and the total percentage of Irish used is small.  RTE as the national broadcasting authority should ensure that only competent speakers are entrusted with continuity, newscasting and advertising and that continuous training should be provided so that suitable staffs are always available.</P>
    <P>Some of these comments are reflected, apparently, in the Broadcasting Review Committee's Report; It goes on:</P>
    <P>A proper language model is needed not only for the reasons mentioned above, but also for people teaching, learning and speaking Irish all over Ireland.  This model should be determined as far as possible by reference to the usage of good native speakers properly trained in enunciation, presentation, etc.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;bilingual&rdquo; policy of RTE requires examination.</P>
    <P>It appears to reduce the number of the identifiable Irish language programmes, thus not giving <Col N="1770" /> Group A, particularly, and Group B a fair deal.  It also carries the risk of depriving the language of the prestige of full programmes.</P>
    <P>It is not scientifically patterned and while, as recognised below, the instinctive response of professional, genuinely bilingual, broadcasters in this case may be a good general guide in the matter of natural language-switching, it would be more beneficial if it had the support of qualified linguistic advice so as to ensure a closer relation with the linguistic objective which it is desired to attain in diglossia.</P>
    <P>One should not ignore the value of programmes which support and reinforce the acceptance of Irish particularly those which enlist the support of Group C.  That is the Ethnically Aware.</P>
    <P>This may be a by-product of certain prestige programmes, and even the main product, unintentionally, of some other good programmes, e.g. the public relations effect of Buntús Cainte or the direct result of such programmes as Watch your Language.</P>
    <P>Given the foregoing considerations, RTE should review its policy for Irish, with the object of giving it status while being judicious in not provoking negative reaction.</P>
    <P>It then suggests certain guidelines for Irish programmes which go into some detail and are basically more for the programme-makers than at this level for this House.  In the final part under the heading &ldquo;Direction and Structure&rdquo;, which is pertinent to our discussion, it says:</P>
    <P>A view exists that the provisions of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, do not give RTE the direction or powers required to pursue the necessary policy if we are to increase even the receptive use of Irish significantly; according to this view, something more would be required than &ldquo;bearing in mind&rdquo; and &ldquo;endeavouring to promote&rdquo;&mdash; in a word, a more positive direction should be formulated.  This view is based of course on the experience of the initial ten years of RTE's <Col N="1771" /> existence, in particular in relation to its television service, while effective structures were being evolved.</P>
    <P>There is an executive in charge of Irish language programmes on television, but there is a need for a function which would provide for comprehensive language planning over all types of programme output, on radio and television.  This function should provide for liaison with Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann, for the appropriate training of staff and for overall execution of the linguistic planning in relation to all Irish language programmes, and the language content of programmes embracing current affairs, light entertainment and sports, drama and the arts, religious programmes, agricultural programmes, features, educational programmes and children's programmes and the general policy concerning bilingualism and the diglossia concept.  It is doubtful if any single individual below the level of Director General would have the requisite power status and responsibility to ensure effective discharge of such a function.</P>
    <P>I regarded that as of sufficient interest and importance to justify placing it on the record of this House. I think much of it is impressive and much of it would certainly have to be borne in mind in shaping policy here. I am sure that RTE is actually bearing it in mind.  At the same time, I must confess that I have some misgivings about the somewhat hierarchical breakdown of sections of the population into group A, the Gaeltacht, group B the Language Loyalists, group C the Ethnically Aware, and group D the Ethnically Unaware. There seems to be a descending arrangement of the population there with a small number, an élite of a sort, at the top.  I do not find that altogether reassuring.  There seems to be a general implication of a few people to manipulate, to mould a mask.  I see that to some extent this is something that does happen in cultural affairs but there does not seem to be any necessary disquiet about the process which I think should be there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> We agree that the word &ldquo;loyalist&rdquo; is unfortunate but was of the time.  I find &ldquo;The Ethnically Aware&rdquo; a bit worrying.  Ethnic is, of course, strictly racial.  As a country we are of mixed stock both biologically and culturally. and I think that ought to be recognised. There seems to be in the use of this description&mdash;it may not be intended&mdash;a suggestion that the language of the race is there, that this is what the race ought to use.  There is the use of this word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; as the ancestral tongue.  It is certainly not the ancestral tongue of all the people of this island and even in the Republic many of our ancestors have been speaking English on this side of the country for many generations.  Are those ancestors not to count?  Is our historic association with and contribution to the English language not to count?</P>
    <P>There is a tendency to treat the English language as a sort of obstruction, an unfortunate incubus.  I think that is wrong for a number of reasons. During the debate one or two Deputies referred to our misfortune of speaking the English language.  I can see what they mean.  What they mean is that when most Irish people ceased to be Irish speaking more than a century ago something was lost, and that was a misfortune.  That is undoubtedly true.  It was a major event and a tremendously sad event occurring in terribly sad circumstances in the middle of the 19th century.  That event, and the circumstances in which it occurred, have left great scars on our national psyche and if that is what they mean by a misfortune then I agree that a misfortune did occur.</P>
    <P>That is on the loss side, but on the positive side the fact that we possess and have contributed, in no small measure, to one of the great languages of the world in terms of its dissemination and variety of its dissemination in itself is not a misfortune.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach speaking to me just now about this matter referred to our experience on our common television programme, the first one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  That was his personal view.  He speaks for some others and it is this attitude again that we are trying to get out of the works in order to get ahead with something.  Deputy Brugha and I, while we are not completely on common ground on this, have quite a lot of common ground between us, as also we both have with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who also differs quite a lot from me and probably agrees more with Deputy Brugha's part of it.  This is not simply a party controversy by any means. He made a point, a valid point to a degree but not fully, that I was right to object to what the professor said in so far as one ought not to say to other people, &ldquo;you ought to be ashamed of yourself for not being like me&rdquo;, but on the contrary it is right for me to say, &ldquo;I feel it, I am ashamed of not speaking and not using the language which my grandparents used&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I respect the distinction and I understand its validity for some people but I cannot share it.  I cannot feel personally ashamed because of past historic events.  I do not feel ashamed because we lost the battle of Kinsale.  I accept the fact that we did lose it.</P>

      <P>I can certainly feel regret at what was lost, and regret at the impact of the loss on us which is felt now in various ways, including some of the ways we are talking about. I feel all that, but I am not certainly about to feel ashamed of not speaking the language that some of my great grandparents spoke.  The role of shame in this is interesting.  Shame is not necessarily a negative emotion.  If it stimulates you into doing something and correcting a course of conduct and so on, that can be good but to be encouraged to feel what amounts to a vague, subconscious sense of shame about something that you intend to do nothing about, that is very bad and that exists here.  In fact, what has resulted is a rather general sense of shame in the attitudes to both the languages in question.  As regards the English language we have been affected by the feeling that maybe we do not speak English the way the English speak it and maybe we ought to, and this is not very good for us; and then in using English we are encouraged to be ashamed that it is not Irish we are using.  All this induces a sense of tentativeness and insecurity and even jumpiness, which is quite un-necessary and bad for us and quite bad for the prospect of actually getting to like Irish and using it more.  Again, that would come back to what Mr. Quinlan said.  I would repeat his words. They can hardly be repeated often enough:</P>
      <P>If Irish was synonymous with joy or less associated with sorrow, loss and punishment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is how it crept in.  I see it all now.  Yes.  At the core of this&mdash;this is in paragraph 4.3 &mdash;there is this strange concept.  When I say it is a strange concept.  I mean just that.  I do not mean that it is necessarily altogether wrong.  I find it strange and it makes me uneasy.  This is the concept of the mandate.  This is a paragraph about &ldquo;The Ethnically Unaware&rdquo;.  Members of this group generally emerge looking rather funny.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Generally, members of this group have a sort of nostalgic respect for the language and feel it suited to use in some limited domains such as introducing nationalistic or highly ritualistic speeches, stereotyped greetings and so on.</P>
      <P>A sort of Myles na gCopaleen concept, someone out of the country council in <i>Faustus Kelly</i> is rather the impression you get of these people.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless many of them may be quite lukewarm or even hostile towards the implementation of practical policies designed to ensure its viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> The paragraph concludes:</P>
    <P>It is from this group that activists in the movement may be said to receive their mandate to define and implement policy.</P>
    <P>So this quite different group, the admitted hard core described as &ldquo;Language Realists&rdquo; get their man-date&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Using that word again wrongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  It is in the report.  They get their mandate to act, to frame policy, from this group who might unkindly be described as frauds, people who believe in using a few words to introduce their nationalistic speeches and whatever, who are against practical policies.  From these people who are against practical policies the first group is said to receive its mandate for implementing the practical policies.  All that is a bit shaky and there is a sort of Indian rope trick here and I think that requires rather careful looking at.</P>
      <P>I would agree that any mandate has something a bit nebulous about it. The people who are interpreting the mandate and the people who give the mandate are a bit different.  There is a reference to a judicious approach and I think there is &ldquo;guidance&rdquo; somewhere. I find that a bit tricky in every sense.</P>
      <P>I do not believe in the reality of the mandate of Group B from Group C to define policies.  To put my finger on it, that is the core to which I object here.  I do not see that Group C has conferred any mandate but I think the general sentiment which pervades Group C, which is present in the country, has a distinct relevance to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer here to the Language Freedom Movement.  When I refer to them I do not refer either in complete agreement or with anything like a sneer.  I think that they are an entirely legitimate lobby in this area, just as legitimate as the Irish language lobby and perhaps some of their members, like some members of the Irish language lobby, are inclined to go out <Col N="1777" /> on a limb sometimes, but if they say, as sometimes they do, that there is actually an excessive use of Irish in broadcasting in proportion to the actual use made of it in the life around us, it is true in the sense that, there is more use of Irish in broadcasting, I believe, than among the people generally but, if they say that, I think there is an answer there.  There are some recent figures which have not yet been published, which I am not in a position to quote, but they tend to show that the group of people who have a general goodwill for the language without being prepared to do very much about it is very large, and it is clear, therefore, that this group would not wish a reduction in broadcasting in Irish and also it does indicate that there could be favourable ground, receptive ground, for the Irish language to grow in if the right methods were adopted and, as I say, I do not think these right methods include setting impossible aims.</P>
    <P>What I cannot accept is this idea that it is from this group that activists in the movement may be said to receive their mandate to define and implement policy.  This means that these activists have a mandate to define and implement policy from so vague a group as this which did not, in fact, elect them. The Deputy was elected by somebody. I was elected by somebody.  Everybody in this House was elected by somebody. We, I am happy to say, were elected by a few people more.  We went out and said: &ldquo;Here are our policies.&rdquo;  A number of people like us more than others who were there at the same time and voted us in.  We can speak of a mandate.  As I said, there may be a certain blurring at the edges of the mandate but at the same time the mandate has a reality.  We know what we are talking about.  We know how many people voted for us and our policy programmes. These activists did not go before the huge slab of the Ethnically Aware and the Ethnically Unaware and say: &ldquo;These are our policies, give us a mandate.&rdquo;  If they had they would not have got it.</P>
    <P>I have read out the passage in which Comhairle na Gaeilge says what it means.  That is not a term which has <Col N="1778" /> ever passed my lips before.  All I know is what it says there.  I do not want to seem pedantic but it seems to me that there is something important here which has to do with democracy and a tendency in that movement to set itself above democracy in the name of another thing.  It speaks of a mandate to define and implement policy in relation to activists in the movement. Activists in a movement do not have a mandate to define and implement policy.  The people who have a mandate to define and implement a policy are the Government and nobody else.  The activists are not set above the Government by the rather vague and smokey mandate which they are said to receive from the people, many of whom are actually said to be opposed to the practical policies for which they claim a mandate.</P>
    <P>This is a very well written and interesting document but it contains, I suggest, at its core an improper principle. The correct principle is that legislators and Government should be aware of all these bodies, including the poor, miserable Ethnically Unawares who have votes too.  We should be aware of these elements and take all of them, not just one, into account when making policies.  Above all we should not be guided or affect to be guided solely by the views of the one group, the language loyalists.  They deserve to have their views taken into account, to an extent somewhat in excess of their actual numbers by reason of a proven commitment to the issue.  A commitment should be taken into account as well as numbers.  That is different from saying that policy on the Irish language is to be defined and implemented merely by the activists, the so-called language loyalists.  I do not accept that. These groups should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>There is much less fault to be found with their practical suggestions about the implementation of policy than about the ideological framework, as expressed in this concept of a mandate to the activists which ought to be rejected.  When the present controller of radio was asked whether he thought there should be more or fewer broadcasts in Irish, he said: &ldquo;It <Col N="1779" /> is not a question of fewer; it is a question of better&rdquo;.  I agree.</P>

      <P>I would be happy to see more in quantity provided the quality of the programmes was such as to attract more people and thereby build up more actual demand.  There is no use broadcasting in Irish to people who are not listening or viewing.  This is basic.  We get back all the time to this question of encouraging interest.  I would be prepared to give support to RTE within the framework of those general concepts.</P>
      <P>I spoke earlier about my experience with Scoil Neasáin and the use of Irish in a deliberately bilingual framework in a situation where no one suggests to the child that the two languages are hostile.  Both languages are playing an important part in his or her life, and the child grows up with that in mind.  Children's programmes on RTE should be conducted in that spirit.  I hope no one will distort what I am saying.  I am not speaking of Deputy Brugha who never distorts what I say but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sometimes they can help and we can learn something from them.  This may be the case here or it may be necessary, or possible to pursue the same and in a much more informal fashion merely by talking to a few people.  Broadly speaking, we should restate our aims more modestly in terms of things achievable now.  We should get rid of any suggestion of hostility to the English language or shame about it.  We should encourage biligualism, the development of competence in both languages and love for both languages.  We should have regard to the contribution of our own people not just to one language but to both.  If we do that consistently, and if we are seen to live up to what we are trying to do, in that way we shall help to encourage love for the Irish language, a positive feeling for it, a better psychology in the country generally, and thus make progress.</P>
      <P>I have spoken of broadcasting because I have responsibility for it but it is only a part of all this.  It can help but it cannot be an instrument for achieving the impossible, nor yet can it be controlled by a mandate for activist policy.  In this, as in other matters, it comes back finally to the democratically elected Government of the country.</P>

    <P>The Minister referred to a television programme.  On a subsequent programme on television I am afraid I misinterpreted the Minister.  Because of an interruption I thought I heard him say he could not be bothered looking at RTE programmes and the Minister corrected me.

      <P>With regard to the Deputy's question regarding telephone services in the Dublin area, we can expect some improvement as a result of the new exchanges.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the steps he proposes to take to prevent any slow-down in the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have taken steps to ensure financial support for a high level of activity under the public capital programme by providing £281.6 million in the programme for the nine months' period ending 31st December, 1974.  This is equivalent to £384 million for a full year, an increase of £65 million over last year and of £136 million over that provided in 1972-73.  Approximately £179 million of the provision for the period to 31st December next will generate work for the construction industry.  This would represent an investment of £240 million in a full year and compares with expenditure on corresponding work of £205 million last year and £161 million in 1972-73.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme includes £60.6 million for housing in the current nine months period, which is equivalent to £78.8 million for a full year&mdash;an increase of £10.6 million over last year and £32.6 million over that provided in 1972-73.  Furthermore, <Col N="1784" /> the subsidy introduced last year to encourage a higher level of investment in building societies is being continued.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the estimated output of the building and construction industry indicates that the level of output in the year ending 31st March next will be about £443 million at current prices as compared with £378 million last year.  Of the former amount, the estimated value of the output for housing is £173 million as compared with £153 million for 1973-74 and £117 million for 1972-73.  The latest employment figures for the industry as a whole show 63,330 employed at the end of May compared with 61,850 at the same time last year and 61,513 at the end of May, 1972.</P>

      <P>I do not want to cast any aspersions on the efforts of the Minister in regard to the building industry, but in view of the Central Bank's very gloomy prophesy or statement, there is uneasiness as to whether the Minister will achieve the same target of 25,000 next year as this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did mention in the report and in the House a few days ago that I am considering an amendment to the Planning Bill as a first step towards dealing with this matter. Naturally, it will require further consideration. We cannot have legislation by newspaper scare headlines.  While it is a fact that many people have been expressing disquiet not alone <Col N="1786" /> now but over a period about this, the newspaper article brought it to a head.  Until the matter is considered by the appropriate authority, the Attorney General, I think it would be as well if we left if there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and as the Deputy is aware, the party to which he and I belong have made it a condition of membership of a local council that we are prepared to declare whether or not we have a financial interest in these matters.  However, as I say, I do not want here to prejudge what appeared in the newspaper and what people are talking about.  I think there is a more appropriate way of dealing with it and it would be unfair to the people concerned as well as to the people of this House to do otherwise. There is just one thing to which I would like to draw attention.  I notice that Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Molloy have been challenging me about a certain planning decision, and they talked about reversing the decision in the Turnapin Little area.  I would like to point out that of course they made no decision.  The appeal went in in 1971 and it was before them early in 1973.</P>
      <P>No decision was made at all and it was when I went in that I asked to have it and all other long-standing appeals dealt with as a matter of urgency.  It was because it was agreed that the course of a road could be suitably changed and that it would thereby save a factory from being affected that I agreed that permission should be given.  The other permission was incidental to it because it happened to be on the other side of the road.  I hate people trying to make out somebody is tarred with the stick.  If there is a stick of tar going around it is not pointing in my direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will confirm that the figures given by the Central Bank concerning the reduction in the number of private building starts are correct; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the figures in Table 42 of the statistical supplement to the Quarterly Bulletin of the Central Bank of Ireland which sets out economic indicators for building and construction and draws on my Department's Quarterly Bulletin of Housing Statistics for data.</P>
      <P>The figures to which the Deputy refers do not, however, give numbers of private building starts but numbers of new house grant allocations.  In normal circumstances such figures would be fair indicators of probable house starts, since it could be taken that builders would start building within a reasonable time of getting a grant allocation.  However, as I explained to the House in a reply to Question No. 7 on 7th May, 1974, and in supplementary replies to Question No. 24 on 23rd May, 1974, last year's figures were distorted by the efforts of builders to have grants allocated for as many houses as possible before the introduction of price control in February, 1973.  A large number of houses for which the 10,626 grant allocations were made in the first three months of 1973 probably were not commenced for a considerable time afterwards; indeed, some may not yet have been begun. If regard is had to the figures for the preceding quarters of 1972-73 and those for earlier years, the extent of the distortion will be clear.</P>
      <P>I might add that new house grant allocations in April and May of the current year totalled 2,946 and exceed substantially the figure of 1,649 allocations in the same months of last year.</P>

      <P>I am merely asking a question.  Is the Minister aware that the Taoiseach, the head of the Government, had to apologise to the House here in relation to this statement by the Central Bank in regard to the statistics published about the building industry?  The statement in the newspapers showed quite clearly that house building dropped by 43 per cent on the level of the previous year and starts by speculative builders and private houses generally dropped 60 per cent below the level of the previous year.  We are talking about the current year, not statistics issued by the Central Bank.  This was a statement issued to the Press and there was serious dislocation in the building construction industry and the consequences would be that fewer would be employed and there would be future unemployment in the industry.</P>

      <P>Deputy Timmons does not understand what the Central Bank published.  He comes in here and tries to put it across that the Taoiseach had to apologise.  The Taoiseach had to do no such thing.  All he said was that this was not an official Government publication; it was a Press statement issued by the Central Bank. Deputy Timmons puts down a question and he then objects to my replying to that question.  The fact is that 10,000 people started building houses last year in the month of February in order to beat having to get the price of their houses approved by the Department of Local Government. <Col N="1790" /> There was one good thing the previous Government did, but it did tend to distort the number of houses shown for the first quarter of any year; they range between 3,500 and 4,000.  That is the position for every year, except last year, for the reason I have given. They have now come back to the normal 3,500 this year.  Those are the facts and, if Deputy Timmons does not understand them, that is not my fault.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will raise with the Council of Ministers of the EEC the question of the importation by Britain of canned meats from Uruguay and the prevention of their sale in Northern Ireland in order to preserve this country's disease-free status, as there is a danger of foot and mouth disease being carried by such meats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not as yet any EEC directive or regulation on animal health problems in trade in canned meats.  Accordingly, each member state is entitled to continue to apply its existing veterinary controls on the import of such meats.  Northern Ireland has its own separate legislation under which it controls the import of canned meats from other places, including Great Britain, on animal health grounds.  The Northern Ireland authorities are as concerned as I and my Department are to protect the whole country from serious animal disease from abroad and the official veterinary services of the two areas maintain continuous liaison towards that end.  In the circumstances, I would consider intervention by me on the lines suggested by the Deputy to be neither necessary nor appropriate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware of anxiety concerning the continuation of industrial action by local authority engineers; and if, with other members of the Government, he will take action similar to that which he took in the case of the bus strike.</P>

    <Col N="1805" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a number of requests both to myself and the Minister for Local Government for intervention in this dispute.  Together with the Minister for Local Government I have considered these requests very carefully since we are concerned about the effect which the dispute is having on the whole range of local authority fuctions and on the employment of many who are unconnected in any way with the dispute.</P>
      <P>I have given consideration to the desirability of my intervening in the present dispute and whether this would have a positive effect.  Intervention by me in a dispute situation may only be contemplated as a general rule where the existing industrial relations situation has not produced a satisfactory solution.  It is an exercise of judgment in all cases and its expressed purpose is to permit the agencies entrusted with industrial relations to resume the work which is naturally theirs.  My intervention in the Dublin bus dispute took place only after the Labour Court Recommendation of the 10th May had been rejected as a basis of settlement. After drawing up a framework on June 8th of settlement terms acceptable to both sides.  I referred the general agreement on settlement terms to the Labour Court's conciliation service for further negotiations on the detailed application of the settlement.</P>
      <P>In general it may be said that if intervention is to have a positive effect it may only be proceeded with where the disputing parties mutually accept the need for such.  These conditions do not exist in the dispute in question.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have given a great deal of attention to this problem but their efforts so far have not succeeded in resolving the dispute.  There are, however, procedures which if followed within the framework of Congress could bring about a settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the matters relating to this dispute are on the agenda of the annual delegate conference of Congress which opens on Tuesday next.  I would hope that this annual meeting should afford both <Col N="1806" /> parties opportunities of settling their differences.  I have already announced publicly that I would act on a joint request from the unions concerned to make mediation facilities available which would help them reach mutual agreement.  In this way I would hope that there would be provided the essential ingredient of acceptability to both sides which is needed for any successful intervention in this dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is general public anxiety about this industrial dispute, that the public are most anxious that the Minister should personally intervene?

Some members can work to rule and are not anxious to settle the dispute, so that people withdraw their labour. They cannot negotiate.  If they do, the rest of the local officials will withdraw their labour.</P>

If there is willingness on the part of both parties to accept the conclusions reached by Congress this matter will be settled, but lacking the agreement of both sides to any intervention there would be no point in such intervention.  I have said in reply to the original question that I would act on a joint request from the two unions concerned to make mediation facilities available.

      <P>It is not possible at any given time to say how many vacancies there are.  When a teacher leaves and is replaced by another the Department may not know of the change until the school returns for that month come in.  In any event, some managers wait until after the summer holidays to fill vacancies which have arisen at the end of the school year.  This applies mostly in Dublin because they have found from experience that by appointing teachers before 1st July there may be more attractive positions available and then resignations are submitted.  In such a case it is necessary to start looking for teachers within a period of three or four months.  I am reasonably confident that the positions will be filled before the end of 1974.</P>

      <P>The number given by the Deputy could be either a contributory old age pension claim number or a social insurance number.  If it is a pension claim number it refers to a person residing in Dublin who is in receipt of a maximum rate pension and, if an insurance number, it refers to a person also residing in Dublin whose claim to a contributory old age pension was rejected on the grounds that he did not satisfy the condition requiring a yearly average of at least 20 contributions or credits.  The person in question has a yearly average of only seven.</P>
      <P>If this is the person to whom the Deputy's question refers it is open to him to apply to have his case reviewed by an appeals officer.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2.50 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 2nd July, 1974.</P>
