      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy may not take it that way.  The situation is <Col N="138" /> that there are returns available to the Central Statistics Office of the annual balance of payments which give the outflow from the country in the form of income from investments.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This question has been under protracted examination. It seems to me that the only options open to the airport owners are either the removal of a gantry crane at Castlebar railway station or the diversion of the main Castlebar-Claremorris roadway.  In the first case the operational advantage to be gained would be very limited and in the second case the cost of diverting the road would be prohibitive in relation to the existing or likely volume of air traffic.  The question is <Col N="139" /> still under examination and I will ensure that the technical advisory service of my Department will continue to be at the disposal of the owners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that they have received two deputations representing the residents of the Oldcourt and Fassaroe Park estates and, in addition, the district manager and other senior board officials attended a meeting of the residents' association in Bray.  On each occasion it was emphasised that the board would enter into arrangements based on personal circumstances and difficulties for the clearance of arrears on electricity accounts.  The staff at the ESB's Bray office have been specially augmented to deal with the matter.  I regret that there are no funds at my disposal out of which it would be possible to assist these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Industrial Development Authority have recently approved an expansion project for an existing industry in Westport which will lead to a considerable increase in employment.  I am not in a position to give details about the project at present.  Further industrial development in Westport is being actively encouraged by the authority as part of their promotional programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informed here some time ago that there were two projects for Westport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I have a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister state if the projects in question are still coming to Westport?  They related to two German firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be as helpful as possible to Deputy Gallagher and, indeed, to Deputies with similar requests, but firms ask for confidentiality. Indeed, in regard to the expansion project I would be quite prepared to give more information if I had clearance to do so, which I have not got.  I am afraid, also, that it is not helpful to a particular town because different places compete and, indeed, different countries compete for factory projects.  If it becomes public knowledge that something is contemplated before it is settled that can result in great activity, even from another country, particularly in the case of foreign-based firms, to divert the project.  It is being pursued actively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is not related to the project the Minister mentioned.  I asked if he had any information about the two projects which were listed for Westport over 12 months ago and which have not reached fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy says &ldquo;which were listed for Westport&rdquo; this is declaring something as fact and possibly he has sources of information I do not have.  I have confidential information on the note <Col N="141" /> before me which I am informed and advised would be disadvantageous to make public and I will be guided by that information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will outline the Government programme regarding the provision of industrial employment in the western areas; and the steps he will take to protect employment in industries threatened with closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Regional Industrial Plans, 1973-1977, for the western areas published by the Industrial Development Authority have the approval of the Government and are being implemented.  In the first year of the plans, there was a net increase of 1,908 jobs in manufacturing industry in the western areas.</P>
      <P>For firms in difficulties, a special service is operated by the Industrial Development Authority, who work in close co-operation with my Department and with other agencies, including Fóir Teoranta, the Industrial Credit Company Limited and the banks, to help the firms concerned to overcome their difficulties and return to profitable working.  Where this is not possible, every effort is made to secure other industrial projects for the area affected in order to preserve, and if possible, increase employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a big increase in the price of fertilisers is expected; the steps, if any, he has taken to ensure that the increase is justified; and whether a subsidy will be introduced to reduce the cost of fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing arrangements, fertiliser manufacturers are required to give me 14 days' notice of any price change to compensate for increases in costs other than the cost of materials used. They are also required to advise me of any price changes when they occur.  I have not received notice of any expected price increase in accordance with these arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> I am aware, however, that there have been increases in material costs and in other costs, and any notifications received by me will be referred to the National Prices Commission for examination.</P>
    <P>The question of any subsidy for fertilisers would be a matter primarily for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well known in farming communities that there will be a substantial increase in the price of fertilisers.  If this increase comes about, will the Minister ensure that it will be fully investigated so that too high a price will not be charged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly give that assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Will he also ensure that any firms holding stocks at present&mdash;I know of some firms who have very large stocks&mdash;will sell them at present prices and not at increased prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks me to ensure that but I can only say that I will do my utmost to ensure it.  At times of rapidly rising prices where stocks, be they grain or fertiliser stocks, are held in many places, it is difficult to guarantee this.  I will use all the powers I have to guarantee it. If the Deputy or any other Deputy knows of firms who are hoarding stocks, I would be very pleased to know of individual cases so that they might be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What power has the Minister to ensure that stocks are sold at a market price which relates to the invoice price?  What machinery has he to ensure that this practice is carried out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is satisfied that no vital information is being withheld by the two American oil companies exploring for gas and oil off Kinsale, County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister align that statement with the denial by one of the companies that such a strike took place?  But for the vigilance of a journalist in <i>The Irish Press</i> they would still deny that such a strike took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will have to be more specific.  There are two separate things: one is a discovery of commercial quantities of gas and the other is what is called a &ldquo;show&rdquo;, up to now not a commercial quantity of oil.  Which is the Deputy talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>When the journalist made an investigation he found that certain discoveries were made.  He then contacted the headquarters of the oil company concerned.  They denied it and asked where the rumours emanated from.  Three days later they confirmed the strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This version of the facts does not accord with my information. <Col N="144" /> When the Deputy is talking about a &ldquo;strike&rdquo; the inference is that there is a commercial discovery of oil.  At present there is not a commercial discovery of oil.  I am satisfied that the normal transmission of information from the oil companies to the Geological Survey and my Department has been continuing in an uninterrupted way.  Indeed, the head of the Geological Survey has been investigating this specific aspect and is satisfied that there is no concealing of information or delay in passing it on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As announced at the beginning of May by the company holding the exclusive concession, the natural gasfield off the Old Head of Kinsale contains reserves estimated <Col N="145" /> at one million million cubic feet. Discussions are proceeding between the company, the ESB and NET regarding the possible utilisation of the gas, should the field be developed.</P>
      <P>The company also announced recently that the company which is participating in the agreement is testing oil shows in a well drilled off the Cork coast.  Further testing and drilling will be required before the significance of these oil shows is known.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is significant that the first statement we had from the Minister was yesterday and the night before last as a result of these questions being put down?  Surely the Ministers concerned had an obligation to make these statements earlier than they were made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two totally separate things here.  One is the gas discovery which was made a long time ago.  With regard to oil, a statement was put out by the oil, companies which, as far as we were concerned, was factually correct in the light of everything we knew.  All I am doing now is repeating information which has been available for some time.  I have nothing new to say.  It is important to emphasise that what has been found in regard to oil because of the Esso drilling is what the oil men call a &ldquo;show&rdquo;.  There is a &ldquo;trace&rdquo; which is practically nothing, and there is a &ldquo;commercial find&rdquo; that is worth exploiting.  There is something in between which is called a &ldquo;show&rdquo;.  We have a show that is in the course of being investigated and assessed.  We have nothing more than that.  We have nothing to add to what the company have said except this: we hope there is a real resource on the Continental Shelf but we would be mistaken, as a Government and as a nation, to build enormous expectations on it until we have some hard facts.

      <P>The offshore drilling being carried out is being done under agreements made in 1959 and confirmed in 1969.  Even if I wanted to repudiate those agreements I am advised they are legally binding. Nothing that has happened in the tenure of office of this Government has influenced the right of Marathon and Esso to drill under the previous agreements, although we can form whatever opinion we like about their wisdom.  In regard to future permission to drill in areas covered by future licences, it was essential to have a considerable amount of seismic information that was not available when we came into office, <Col N="147" /> and it was also essential to see the exact nature of the British arrangements because they are contiguous to us and have a large oil find, before we finalise the details of our arrangements. The detailed seismic investigation and the awaiting of details of the British arrangements are not just prudent; they are essential if we are to maximise the benefit to this country of what we hope is on the Continental Shelf, both of oil and gas.</P>

    </P>
    <P>After a detailed discussion, the Council adopted the Resolution on the promotion of work relating to the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications pursuant to Article 57 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community.(*)</P>
    <P>The Council of the European Communities,</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission of 11 March 1974;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament of 23 April 1974;</P>
    <P>Whereas certain principles and guidelines should be laid down for the promotion of work relating to the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications,</P>
    <P>Has Adopted this Resolution:</P>
    <P>I.  The Council</P>
    <P>&mdash;acknowledges that Directives on the right of establishment, in particular those concerning the liberal professions, are of importance in connection with education policies;</P>
    <P>&mdash;emphasises that such Directives should be so drawn up that they <Col N="150" /> do not impede efforts towards educational reform in the Member States of the Community;</P>
    <P>&mdash;considers it appropriate that educational policies should make a positive contribution to freedom of establishment, in particular with regard to the liberal professions.</P>
    <P>*One delegation recorded its provisional agreement.</P>
    <P>II.  The Council expresses the wish that the further work in the field of the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications be guided by the endeavour to introduce flexibility and quality.  In this connection, the Council agrees with the following guideline:</P>
    <P>Given that despite the differences existing between one Member State and another in the courses of training there is in practice broad comparability between the final qualifications giving access to identical fields of activity, the directives for the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and for the co-ordination of as little as possible to the prescription of detailed training requirements.</P>
    <P>III.  In order to put this guideline into effect:</P>
    <P>&mdash;lists of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications recognised as being equivalent should be drawn up.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Advisory Committees, the terms of reference and composition of which are still to be determined, should be set up.</P>
    <P>IV.  The Council instructs the Permanent Representatives Committee to ensure, in co-operation with the Commission, that this Resolution is implemented, especially as regards the examination of the proposals for directives on the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The injuries were received in September, 1972.  The scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted, however, applies only to injuries sustained on or after 1st October, 1972, and the tribunal are not empowered to waive this provision in any particular case. Incidentally, this was also the limiting date announced by my predecessor in respect of the scheme he was preparing. The Deputy will appreciate that there has to be some limit on the extent to which a scheme of this nature is made retrospective and that, no matter what date is chosen, it is inevitable that cases will be excluded that occurred just before the time-limit. I regret, therefore, that I cannot hold out any hope that the scheme will be amended so as to extend to the case in question.</P>

      <P>The adequacy of the clerical staffing at St. Munchin's Hospital is primarily a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board.  I have had inquiries made in the matter and I have been informed that the board are preparing a proposal for additional staff for submission to my Department.</P>
      <P>The examination of the board's proposal will, in the normal way, involve an assessment of the clerical staffing of the hospital.

      <P>The Eastern Health Board in normal times provide directly, or by recoupment of city hospitals, a taxi service for medical card holders attending out-patient clinics in the hospitals where, because of disability or infirmity, the patient is unable to use public transport.  An extension of the service within limits has, it is understood, been effected during the period of the bus strike.</P>
      <P>Some hospitals provide a minibus service for conveying medical card holders to physiotherapy clinics.  The minibus service is needed to meet existing demands as respects those clinics.</P>
      <P>I may add that my Department have checked with a number of general hospitals in Dublin and the position is that no significant decrease has been noted in the numbers attending out-patient clinics during the bus strike. This would indicate that in general patients are able to make their own way there.</P>
      <P>Decreases in attendance varying from an estimated 10 per cent to an estimated 30 per cent approximately have, however, been noted in the case of the out-patient services of the Dublin maternity hospitals.  I am asking the Eastern Health Board to look specially into the matter to see what can be done to improve this position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When the general medical service was initiated it was agreed with the medical organisations that it was desirable in order to preserve a reasonable ratio between patients and doctors that there should be limited entry to the scheme and that future vacancies should be advertised and filled by an agreed procedure.</P>
      <P>During the current review of the scheme the medical organisations suggested that there should be unrestricted entry to the scheme by any doctor with specified postgraduate experience.  The departmental representatives gave the following objections to unrestricted entry:</P>
      <P>(a)  unrestricted entry would result in small panels; such panels have unduly high visiting rates thereby adding to the cost of the scheme;</P>
      <P>(b)  the present method of entry is ensuring an improved service in remote and rural areas; if unrestricted entry is introduced it is likely to encourage a movement of general practitioners to the more heavily populated areas;</P>
      <P>(c)  there is no reason to believe patient care would be improved;</P>

Will he agree with me that on previous occasions, when it was desired to sit longer, the agreement of the Opposition was sought, and usually given, to take effect the following week?  Will he agree with me that if it is decided to proceed with the longer hours of sitting tomorrow and to sit on Friday it will have taken many Deputies by surprise, Deputies who for one reason or another and for the good reason that they did not anticipate a long sitting tomorrow and a sitting on Friday, will have made other arrangements?</P>

      <P>I would like the Taoiseach to consider this position seriously.  First of all, while the business was non-contentious yesterday, it concerned the increase of capital to be borrowed by the ESB by some £350 million.  Because the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach thought that this ought to have been finished within a certain time I suggest that, in a fit of pique, he suggested to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;We will teach those fellows on the other side a lesson and sit longer and later&rdquo;.  There is a certain cut and thrust about politics but there is a certain degree of accommodation between the Government and Opposition.  If that kind of accommodation and consultation are not proceeded with then the Opposition, I would remind the Taoiseach, can have the last say in the end as to how long we may take on any particular piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>May I say a few words on this matter?  In two respects this week&mdash;and I claim no particular credit for it&mdash;the Opposition have been accommodated and willingly accommodated by the Government.  The first respect was in the switching of the votes on the two Estimates which concluded last week from last night until tonight, at their request.  The second respect was that the Agriculture Bill, which we would have ordered yesterday and might have hoped to reach yesterday, was not ordered yesterday in order to facilitate the Opposition spokesman.</P>

In the discussions which I had with the Opposition Whip last week in regard to the business yesterday, while the Opposition Whip, in fairness to him, said he did not think the ESB Bill would go through quite on the nod, the impression I was left with from our conversation was that he would get two if not three of the Bills ordered yesterday.  In the end what happened was that from this side of the House the Minister spoke and also a single other Deputy who had a particular interest in the ESB because he works in it, and from the other side 14 speakers spoke on the trot, and it is not finished yet.</P>

It leaves the Government, pushing up towards the end of July with a Finance Bill to be dealt with, with no alternative but to look for extra time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 2, subsection (3) (a), lines 40 and 41, to delete &ldquo;or a practising solicitor and has practised as a barrister or as a solicitor for at least <Col N="180" /> ten years&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;who has practised as a senior counsel for not less than five years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The whole tenor of my argument on the Second Stage of this Bill was that we were in favour of the creation of the post of Director of Public Prosecutions but that the person who would hold such an office should be a person of professional qualifications and experience. Here I propose the substitution of a senior counsel who has practised for not less than five years, but it would be my intention maybe on the Report Stage to add to that amendment &ldquo;a practising barrister of not less than 15 years' standing.&rdquo; That just occurs to me now while I am on my feet.  Section 2 reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  There is hereby established the office of Director of Public Prosecutions and the holder of the office shall be known as the Director of Public Prosecutions and is referred to subsequently in this Act as the Director.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Director shall be appointed by the Government.</P>
    <P>(3)  (a) A person shall not be appointed to be the Director unless at the date of his appointment he is a practising barrister or a practising solicitor and has practised as a barrister or as a solicitor for at least ten years.</P>
    <P>The next subparagraph, (3) (b), is the one we find difficult to accept and difficult to comprehend in relation to the posts we are creating.  We consider the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to be on almost all fours with the Office of the Attorney General.  If the Office of Attorney General is to be held by a person who enjoys the esteem of the legal world and of his colleagues generally throughout the whole profession, be it a barrister or a solicitor, then legally the person enjoying the status of Director of Public Prosecutions should be a person eminent in the law and having the highest possible status both as regards respect and experience.  What this Bill proposes to do is to appoint a civil servant to the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions who need not necessarily have ten years' experience <Col N="181" /> at the Bar or indeed as a solicitor. That is why I consider the amendment to be the most important element in the whole series of amendments I have placed.  This Bill stands or falls, as we understand it and as we want it, on the appointment of a senior counsel who has been practising for not less than five years, or we will concede that a barrister practising for not less than 15 years should be the person appointed as Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>This is no way to under-rate the contribution of solicitors to the practice of the law.  Some people may ask: &ldquo;Why not a solicitor in the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions?&rdquo;  The whole area of criminal law opens here. Criminal law is practised throughout the whole spectrum of the courts and requires a deep knowledge of the criminal law.  The criminal law is practised in the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Court and, in some instances, in the District Court but there must be a wide experience of that whole spectrum.  If there is not that wide experience&mdash;and I think this would be conceded by the solicitors among us in the House&mdash;then, if we are to be consistent with the amendment, I do not think we can appoint a solicitor to be Director of Public Prosecutions.  However, others may argue differently.</P>
    <P>The person we regard as having this wide experience is a barrister who shares the respect and esteem of his colleagues, who has experience in the practice of the criminal law, who knows every nook and cranny, if you will forgive the crudity, of the whole structure of the courts system.  That is the person we seek to have appointed as Director of Public Prosecutions. The Government or the Attorney General may have in mind a civil servant to appoint as Director of Public Prosecutions.  What I am about to say now is in no way intended to under-rate the Civil Service: we believe that within the Civil Service there are men of the highest quality, integrity and so on, but we do not believe and we do not accept&mdash;we cannot accept&mdash;that there is a person practised in the craft of the criminal law sufficiently well qualified to take <Col N="182" /> on effectively the criminal law functions of the Attorney General.  We understand that the Attorney General will hand over his criminal law functions to a Director of Public Prosecutions, plus referenda and election petitions.  If that is so, surely it becomes even clearer that the situation demands the equivalent of a person enjoying the esteem and status of the Attorney General.  We would urge the Attorney General, therefore, to accept that this amendment is tabled purely in a spirit of construction and help and not in any spirit of acrimony. We did not table this amendment merely for the sake of tabling an amendment.  I discussed this with various individuals interested in this and we arrived at a responsible decision, but the tabling of the amendment was my responsibility.  If we are to have a Director of Public Prosecutions the appointee must be a person with a wide criminal practice, a wide knowledge of the criminal law and a wide experience in that law.  We believe this is a reasonable proposition. I shall await the contributions of other members who may possibly wish to say something on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Andrews, with some reservations with regard to the disqualifying of solicitors. On the whole, I think there must be very few solicitors who would have sufficient experience of criminal law at the level required for this particular job but, with that reservation, agree with what Deputy Andrews ha said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should, first of all, look at the position of Director of Public Prosecutions as proposed in this Bill. The title is the same as that appertaining to a similar or analogous position in Britain and one might, because of that, come to the conclusion that the standing of the office and the duties of the office would be precisely the same.  That is not the case.  The office proposed in this Bill will, in fact, be of greater significance than is the office in Britain because the Director of Public Prosecutions here will be quite independent of the Attorney General and will be, as is provided in subsections (4) and (5), in the Civil <Col N="183" /> Service of the State and independent in the performance of his functions.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the Director of Public Prosecutions in Britain is neither of these things.  Ultimately he is subject to the direction of the Attorney General and he does not, therefore, have the total discretion apparently envisaged here for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Since the establishment of the State, the bulk of the Attorney General's work here has consisted of the prosecution of criminal offences and the person who would hold the office of Director of Public Prosecutions, with responsibility for such prosecutions, should be, in my view, of a status not less than that of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything to stop the Government appointing anyone at all as Attorney General but, since the establishment of the State, the practice has been invariably to appoint a senior counsel of considerable standing.  That practice has been a good one.  If men of standing had not been appointed, the office of Attorney General would have suffered considerably.  Difficulties that might have arisen had lesser people been appointed have been avoided.  For the reasons I have given I believe that the office of Director of Public Prosecutions should be held by someone no less eminent than an Attorney General, in fact someone as qualified to be an Attorney General as is the Attorney General himself.</P>
    <P>The qualifications set out in subsection (3) (a) of section 2 do not at all require that any potential holder to the office of DPP should be of the standing I suggest or anything like it. All that is required is that he be a practising barrister or solicitor of at least ten years' standing.  The first thing that strikes me most forcibly about this is the fact that I could be a practising solicitor for ten years or Deputy Andrews could be a practising barrister for ten years and neither of us need ever have set foot inside, a court; in particular, neither of us need ever have set foot inside a <Col N="184" /> criminal court.  One could be pre-eminent among common law lawyers or chancery lawyers and know nothing of the basic tenets of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, one would be qualified to hold an office not less important, in my opinion, than is the office of Attorney General itself.  That is quite wrong.  So far as the appointment of an Attorney General is concerned the Taoiseach has considerable discretion. He can appoint anyone he wishes within reason and no Taoiseach has ever failed, I think, to appoint people of the highest eminence to this particular office.  But this is a very different matter.  This is a position of tremendous importance, the appointee to which will become a civil servant and virtually &ldquo;unfireable&rdquo; under subsequent subsections. If a man who is not of the greatest eminence is appointed he may be there for 20 or 30 years and, if he is not of the proper status and someone who will inspire confidence in the administration of the criminal law and, particularly in the prosecution of offences and offenders, the whole administration will suffer.  I repeat that the appointee should be as eminent as the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews' amendment leaves it open to appoint a man who, if he happens to have been a senior counsel for five years, will be eligible for appointment but may have only a limited knowledge, to say the least of it, of criminal law.</P>
    <P>Ideally something should be spelled out in this section which would require, not alone that he would be of eminence within his profession, but that he would also have a particular and detailed knowledge of criminal law.  The greatest of eminence in respect of other branches of the law is of no use to him or to this country if he becomes the chief prosecutor.  I readily admit that there is not as great a degree of specialisation in this country as one would wish to see and, in particular, there is not a great degree of specialisation in criminal matters.  That undoubtedly gives rise to a difficulty. Nonetheless there are competent senior counsel of standing and experience who <Col N="185" /> have a good deal of experience of criminal matters, apart from the experience they might have in other matters also.  In so far as we can, without laying down a kind of examination standard, we should seek in this section to have people with the equivalent respect as the present and previous holders of the office of Attorney General have had.</P>
    <P>I intend to say something about the proposal in the Bill to allow non-practising lawyers in the Civil Service to be appointed to this position.  Perhaps I might hold that over until the next amendment.  The only point I will make about it now is the general one that I do not know very much criminal law, but I know enough about it to know that the only place you will learn it is in the criminal courts, and that you will not learn it anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Therefore, any civil servant who by virtue of his position is precluded from appearing in court, no matter what his academic qualifications are, will not have the practical knowledge and experience which are necessary for a position of this kind.  That is why I think that, while Deputy Andrews' amendment could, perhaps, be even more precise than it is, at least it is on the correct lines, and at least it is a genuine effort to ensure that the eminence of the individual who will ultimately be appointed to this post will be such as the importance of the post calls for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Attorney General wants to speak.  I assume that he will speak on the amendment and we look forward to his remarks.  I want to clear up some misunderstanding in relation to the amendment.  My amendment seeks to ensure that a senior counsel of not less than five years' standing will be appointed as Director of Public Prosecutions.  Deputy O'Malley has suggested that in some way I should be more precise on that matter and that I should refer to practice in the criminal law in addition to his being a senior counsel of not less than five years' standing.  That matter is taken care of in the third amendment. The committee which would be set up under my amendment <Col N="186" /> would be the very type of committee which would take care of the appointment of a senior counsel of not less than five years' standing, who would be experienced and practised in criminal law, and who would have that status, and enjoy the esteem of his colleagues on that practice.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to sound as if I am quibbling over this matter.  As Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, we consider that a civil servant who may be a barrister, called to the Bar, and so on, may not have seen the inside of a criminal court.  What we are now asking this civil servant to do is to take on the functions of the Attorney General, almost totally the criminal functions of the Attorney General. That is how serious it is.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the Attorney General and the Government he represents that the criminal law is no longer the Cinderella of the common law.  Criminal law goes to the very heart of the community in which we live.  We consider that the person appointed to be Director of Public Prosecutions should be a person with expertise, experience and knowledge of the criminal law. Criminal law is part of the very fabric of the society in which we live.  That is why we consider that the Director of Public Prosecutions who, in effect, will become the Attorney General under another name, should be a person of the eminence of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>I suggest that we are dealing with a constitutional personage.  The Attorney General is a constitutional personage.  Article 30.3 of the Constitution provides:</P>
      <P>All crimes and offences prosecuted in any court constituted under Article 34 of this Constitution other than a court of summary jurisdiction shall be prosecuted in the name of the People and at the suit of the Attorney General or some other person authorised in accordance with law to act for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This &ldquo;other person&rdquo; authorised in accordance with the law that we are enacting now to act for that purpose <Col N="187" /> is the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Constitution provides for and authorises the appointment of the Director of Public Prosecutions. What we are now asked to do by the Attorney General and the Government is to tinker with the Constitution, to appoint to the position of Director of Public Prosecutions a person who has less than a reasoned and reasonable knowledge of criminal law.</P>
    <P>I and other Members of the House who will be contributing would wish to keep this debate on a reasonably high plane.  The more one reflects on it, the more one speaks about it and, I am sure, the longer this debate goes on, the more one sees that the Government's proposals become more offensive to the concept of the whole area of the criminal law.  The Director of Public Prosecutions will be deciding who will be prosecuted and who will not.  That will be a function of his; a man who has no knowledge of the criminal law will be deciding who should be prosecuted under the criminal law.  The thing does not make sense.</P>
    <P>We will be getting into the philosophy of the criminal law later on in the debate, I have no doubt, but there we have the ground set for a reasonable discussion.  The Attorney General has offered us this Bill.  It was presented to the House by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach for Second Reading and we had an opportunity of expressing a general opinion on how we would deal with the Bill on Committee Stage.  What did we get from the Taoiseach's Department? Mere drafting amendments in the name of the Taoiseach.  I genuinely do not think they are taking this matter seriously enough.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General was at the height of his profession in every respect at the Bar when he decided to become Attorney General.  I have been in consultation with many members of the legal profession, barristers and solicitors, and, to put it at its very crudest, they are all appalled at the proposal in relation to the personage who will take on the position <Col N="188" /> of Director of Public Prosecutions as provided in this Bill.  We will let the matter rest there and see if we can get any reaction from the Attorney General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that the amendments to this and other sections have been put down in a spirit of constructive Government.  I also accept, as I am sure the Deputies opposite will accept, that there is room for legitimate differences of opinion in regard to what must be recognised as a difficult problem, namely, the qualifications for what is generally recognised as the very important new office which it is proposed to establish in this legislation. I fully accept that the members of the Opposition are concerned to see that the office is filled by the person with the highest qualifications.  I should like them to accept that this is our concern, too.  Perhaps I could briefly outline the thinking of the Government on this particular section.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the fact that the next amendment to be moved relates to the deletion of the subsection which would permit a person in the Public Service to be appointed.  Unless it is desired that these two amendments be taken together, I will leave over discussion of that aspect of the proposals until we come to that amendment.  I will now deal with Deputy Andrews' amendment which would delete from the Bill the provision by which a solicitor who had at least ten years' experience could be appointed to this post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have to say now will apply to the debate on the next amendment. It is important for Deputies to make up their minds and reach conclusions as to what type of qualifications will be required for this office.  Obviously, they are varied.  Knowledge and experience of the criminal law and its operations will be important. Knowledge of the law of evidence will also be important.  It seems to me, and I speak from limited experience, that probably the most important qualifications will be basic common sense and sound judgement.  This is <Col N="189" /> one of the reasons why it is particularly important that the proposed selection committee be established. We may have differences as to the format of this committee but we will discuss these later.  An effective selection committee would advise the Government on the different candidates seeking the position.  One of the important tasks of this committee would be not merely to examine the academic credentials of an applicant, not merely to examine his ability to pass examinations or even his years of experience, but to judge him in the policies of judgment to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Where perhaps we part company on this important matter is in relation to the necessity, which Deputy Andrews would appear to feel, that he should have experience as an advocate.  The barrister who is a senior counsel of five years' standing would have that experience over any other possible candidate for the post.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting it would not be desirable that an experienced senior counsel should be appointed to the position.  I am, however, saying this: in theory, it does not follow that the qualifications of an experienced senior counsel are such as to exclude anybody else from being a suitable person for this post.  What an experienced senior counsel has above anybody else, be it a solicitor or a professional person in the public service, is, of course, his skill of advocacy and experience in court.  As I said, this seems to be the point where we differ.  While it may be that the proper person to appoint to this position is an experienced advocate, we should not rule out the possibility that other persons might be better qualified.  This could be because of their knowledge of the criminal law and the law of evidence and because of the personal qualities to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>It is true that if a solicitor is appointed he might not have the eminence in the eyes of one branch of the legal profession which one of their own colleagues would have.  Again, I would not regard this as decisive.  It is obviously desirable that a person who fills this post would be of very high <Col N="190" /> standing and so regarded by the members of the legal profession.  I would not be in favour of excluding solicitors to this position.</P>
    <P>It has been thought desirable in the United Kingdom legislation since 1889 to allow a solicitor to be an applicant for this position.  In fact, one of the most distinguished persons to hold this position was a solicitor.  Under the recent legislation in Northern Ireland a solicitor as well as a barrister is also qualified to act as Director of Public Prosecutions.  This is not a decisive factor but it should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there may be members of the legal profession who would disagree with the suggestion that solicitors should be eligible for this appointment.  I would not agree that this is an overwhelming attitude among, say, members of the Bar.  I doubt if it is an attitude which members of the solicitors' profession hold. The contacts I have had in relation to the suggestion that solicitors should be eligible for appointment would not indicate that there is the widespread opposition which Deputy Andrews indicates.  This is a matter about which Members of this House must make up their minds.  As I have already indicated, it is a matter on which there can be legitimate difference of opinion. The Government, having given the matter very careful consideration, felt that it would be limiting the field too much to allow merely barristers to be eligible.</P>
    <P>I apreciate the point which Deputy O'Malley made and I agree that there is a great number of members of the solicitors' profession who do not specialise in criminal law and would not have experience of criminal law. There are, to my knowledge, and to his I am sure also, members of the solicitors' profession who have a great deal of knowledge and experience of criminal work.  The field from which a choice to this important position is made should be as wide as possible consonant with getting the most qualified person for the position.  Perhaps it may not be found desirable to appoint a solicitor, perhaps solicitors may not apply, but I do not think we <Col N="191" /> should exclude such a person from eligibility.</P>
    <P>There are important safeguards built into this legislation to ensure that the best qualified person is appointed.  In particular, a committee will be established to select names for nomination to the Government. It will be the task of that committee, and ultimately of the Government, to weigh up the qualifications of the different applicants.  Obviously a person with little or no experience of criminal law may not find favour either with the selection committee or the Government, and it is equally obvious that a solicitor who has had little or no experience in the criminal field may be slow in coming forward to apply for the position.  It seems to me that experience and knowledge of the law and the standing of the applicant in his profession will be matters which the selection committee will be very careful to judge. A person who is not eminent in his profession or who has not great experience or knowledge, to my mind is unlikely to be appointed because of the safeguards built into this proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>While accepting that there can be differences in this area, all I can say to the House is that the matter has been given very careful consideration by the Government.  It is a matter of considerable importance and the Government consider it would be limiting it too much if the amendment suggested by Deputy Andrews were accepted.  In fact, the amendment goes even further than the present qualifications required by law for the position of a High Court judge.  I realise that is a matter of detail and I can see that the principle behind the amendment is that the post should be restricted to a person who is eminent as a barrister or on that side of the legal profession, but nevertheless I do not think the House should limit it in the way suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General has referred to the principle behind the amendment.  If we consider that the experience required should be <Col N="192" /> greater than that of a High Court judge, this shows how important we consider the qualifications necessary for the Director of Public Prosecutions. The person appointed must be of the highest standard and have the necessary knowledge of the law.  The Attorney General said there is room for opinion here; that is what this debate is about.  There will be room for opinion on every section we discuss because that is what a Committee Stage discussion means.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General said that the civil servant appointed under section 2 (3) (a) and (b) would have common sense and sound judgement and he said that is where he and I parted.  I am glad to say that is so.  The person whom we would propose to be the Director of Public Prosecutions would have common sense and sound judgment but in addition he would have the experience of a practised and practising criminal lawyer.  That is an important addition to the qualities of common sense and sound judgment.  The qualification that is missing, about which we are arguing, is that of experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do we have to go over the ground again, to say that the Bill as proposed envisages that the person appointed will be a man whose function it will be to take on the duties of the Attorney General in accordance with the provisions of Article 30.3. of the Constitution? The law we are enacting now is to give effect to that part of the Constitution which refers to such a personage. Is that person to be a civil servant who has not seen the inside of a criminal court?  That is what the House is being asked to accept but we are asking the House to reject the proposition, as proposed in this Bill, providing for a civil servant with the qualifications as set out but with no experience in criminal law.  I would ask that the principle of the amendment we propose be accepted; we can revise or adjust it.  We are asking for a person who has seen the inside of a criminal court, who has practised in such a court, who has been from the Supreme Court to the High Court, to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Central Criminal Court, the Special Criminal Court, the Circuit Criminal <Col N="193" /> Court, the Circuit Court and the District Courts.  This Bill is proposing that a person will conduct the criminal law on behalf of the State in those courts in which he has not had any experience.  The House is being asked to do this.</P>
    <P>I think this is a horrifying proposal, that the criminal law should be in the hands of a person who has not got an elemental knowledge of it.  When I say &ldquo;an elemental knowledge of it&rdquo;, I mean particularly in the experience and practice of that law.  I describe criminal law as it was described by a very eminent legal luminary&mdash;I think it was Lord Chief Justice Goddard&mdash;as the Cinderella of the common law. That is no longer the position. Criminal law goes to the very basis of the fabric of the society in which we live; it is part of that fabric, part of the make-up of the society.  The person we are being asked to take over to administer that is a person who has had no practice in that aspect of the common law.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General then goes on to make a fair enough point&mdash;he may have misinterpreted what I said&mdash;in relation to the appointment of solicitors to the post.  I do not wish to under-rate the contribution of solicitors to the legal profession generally. But I come back to the basic premise of my argument&mdash;I do not think that there is a solicitor with the practice, the high qualifications, the high criminal law qualifications considered necessary for this post of Director of Public Prosecutions.  That is the only point I make there.  I know many solicitors who support me in this argument. Many solicitors have come to me and expressed their points of view on this section.  They are people whose opinion I value and who feel just as strongly as I do about it.  The point I am making&mdash;to be absolutely consistent&mdash;in relation to the qualifications necessary is that the person to be appointed must be a person of the highest available qualifications. The person who would hold those qualifications would be a man&mdash;and I cannot over-stress this point&mdash;who has had practice of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> To ensure that the House knows exactly what we are at, I shall quote subsection (3) (a) of section 2 which reads:</P>
    <P>A person shall not be appointed to be the Director unless at the date of his appointment he is a practising barrister or a practising solicitor and has practised as a barrister or as a solicitor for at least ten years.</P>
    <P>Then the Government watered that down in the next subsection which reads:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this subsection, service for any period in a position in the Civil Service for appointment to which practice as a barrister or a solicitor was a necessary qualification shall be deemed to be practice as a barrister or a solicitor, as the case may be, for that period and a person, while holding such a position, shall be deemed to be a practising barrister or a practising solicitor, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the reality of the position is that he need not be a practising barrister or a practising solicitor of ten years' standing at all.  If he has spent a certain amount of time in the Civil Service that is added to his practice as a barrister or solicitor, say, of three or four years.  Seven years in the Civil Service, added to three or four years as a practising barrister would be sufficient to qualify this person for the position of Director of Public Prosecutions.  A Cheann Chomhairle, are we being serious here &mdash;to qualify this person for the position of Director of Public Prosecutions? That is how serious the matter is and that, as I understand the reading of the Bill, would be one of the qualifications necessary.</P>
    <P>I accept that the committee will be there.  Let us describe it as a watchdog committee but I shall have a lot to say about that when I come to it. That is why the whole tenor of my amendments is consistent, one related to the other, with one or two small discrepancies which I shall point out as I proceed.  I accept that there may be one or two small amendments to my amendments which may be necessary <Col N="195" /> if we are being offered the qualifications outlined in subsections (3) (a) and (b) of section 2.  But I do not think we are serious about the proper workings of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As we understand it, the person who will be appointed to that position will be an independent personage.  He will have to undertake responsibilities and make decisions which will affect the whole structure of the working of criminal law in this country.  He is now being offered, effectively, the position of Attorney General, not as Attorney General, but as Director of Public Prosecutions who will take over the functions of the Attorney General.  That is why we consider our amendment to be correct in principle. It may need a little rejigging in relation to its drafting but the spirit of the amendment is there.  The principles enshrined in the amendment are also there and will be apparent to the Attorney General who has indicated quite clearly that he is satisfied. He recognises the principle enshrined in the amendment but he is not prepared to accept the practice of the principle by accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>May I say a few words then, on subsection (2) (b) of section 2 and the proposed deletion? <Col N="196" /> As I indicated earlier, it is desired to have the widest choice possible for a person for this position.  Therefore, it was thought desirable not to exclude a member of the Civil Service who might not have had ten years' practice as a barrister or a solicitor before entering the Civil Service.  It is important for the House to appreciate that the area of choice for this proposed appointment is not a very wide one, for the reasons which have been touched on earlier.  The number of persons specialising in criminal law are not very great for a variety of reasons.  In particular, in relation to the barristers' profession, whilst the number of junior counsel who have had considerable practicable experience in criminal courts, are many, the number of senior counsel who have had experience, as senior counsel, are not many.  It is true that, as juniors, they may have got this experience but the number of senior counsel who actually specialise to any great degree in criminal work is not very great.  Undoubtedly, people who would prosecute considerably would have a great deal of experience, but it is quite possible that a person who has done a great deal of prosecuting might not be the most suitable person to be Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The point I wish to make is that if the eligibility proposals made by the Opposition are accepted, the number of people who would be eligible for this important position would be very limited indeed.  Therefore we seek to make eligible solicitors of the standing I have indicated and also make eligible people who have been in the Public Service in the way suggested in the subsection under discussion.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, and I think it has been the experience of other people, that I can think of several people in Public Service who would have made excellent Directors of Public Prosecutions.  I know several solicitors, several barristers, some of whom have been or are junior counsel, who would make excellent holders of this position.  This must be the experience of others also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that this legislation creates categories of eligibility does not mean <Col N="197" /> that the Government will, on the recommendation of the selection committee, appoint any particular one. The concept behind this section, and the reason why it is not possible to accede to the limitation that is now being suggested by the Opposition, is that we should make eligible for selection to this important position people whom, experience would show, should be eligible for appointment.  Again, to make the point I made earlier, a point which seems to be the area in which the disagreement arises, the Opposition would appear to put much greater weight on actual experience in court work as an important qualification for this post than the Government does. The Opposition appear to consider that actual experience as an advocate in the criminal court is the most important qualification and without it this person could not adequately fulfil his functions.  This is where we disagree.</P>
    <P>It does not require the art of an advocate or experience in criminal procedure to act as Director of Public Prosecutions.  A Director of Public Prosecutions has to have a knowledge of the criminal law and a knowledge of the law of evidence.  His task basically is assessment, and that task basically is considering the evidence on documents which are made available to him, weighing it up and considering from his legal knowledge the effect of a statement presented to him.  He is not an advocate; he is a person who has obviously to know the criminal law and the law of evidence, but, above all, he has to have judgment and sound common sense.  These, I would hope, would be qualities which a distinguished member of the solicitors' profession or an experienced person in the Public Service would also have.</P>
    <P>What we wish to achieve here is that we do not limit the choice to members of the Bar, particularly that we do not limit the choice to members of the senior Bar but that the choice be open for appointment from solicitors and from suitable persons also in the Public Service.  It will be a matter for this distinguished and eminent committee formed in the way suggested by the Government or in the way contemplated by the Opposition, <Col N="198" /> the adjectives which I have used will still apply to it, to assess the qualifications of the applicants. Obviously, the fact that somebody has had a great deal of experience in the courts will be a factor which will be taken into account but I would have thought that it is equally obvious that this would not be a decisive factor.</P>
    <P>As we all know, and some of us know from personal experience, a very successful advocate may not make the best judge.  Similarily, a very successful advocate may not make the best Director of Public Prosecutions.  In saying that I am not for a moment saying that successful advocates should not be eligible for high judicial posts nor am I suggesting that they should not be eligible for this post.  I am drawing attention to the important factors which have to be borne in mind in addition to those of experience in the practical field of the law.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, these are areas for legitimate differences.  I have to confess, it is not uncommon in this House, that the Opposition have failed to impress me with their arguments just as I anticipate that I have probably failed to impress the Opposition with mine.  Be that as it may, this is what these debates are about.  We put our point of view forward in this Assembly for consideration. I appreciate that the Opposition are as desirous as we are to have this post filled by the best person possible.  This is an aim we both have but we differ, unfortunately, as to the eligibility tests which we are laying down.</P>
    <P>The eligibility tests which are suggested in this legislation are tests which will produce in time, I hope, a very suitable person for this position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word about amendment No. 2 which we are now discussing, the question of the eligibility of someone in the Civil Service.  It is only fair to point out that most barristers or solicitors in the public service are in it for most of the time that has elapsed since they qualified.  I know <Col N="199" /> that is not universally true but it is true of most.  Very few of them have practised for more than three or four years at the outside.  The Attorney General on the one hand lays little store by practice and Deputy Andrews and I on the other hand lay considerable store by it.  The Attorney General says that it is legitimate for us to differ on this and that that difference will prevail assuming that the House divides in its usual lines.</P>
      <P>That is not a very constructive answer to the argument put up.  I agree with the Attorney General that judgment and common sense are extremely important qualities in this and in an enormous number of other offices but what the Attorney General has completely failed to deal with is the question of public confidence in this office which will not be enhanced by the appointment of a person that nobody ever heard of.  There may be a very suitable public servant and the Government may decide that because he is very suitable, as he might well be, to appoint him.  However, by virtue of the fact that he has been a public servant for most of his working life the public, of necessity, will not have heard of him.  Perhaps, even the profession will not have heard of him. He will go through, therefore, a trial period.  His office, rather than himself, will seek to establish themselves in the public mind and to build up confidence in the office of Director of Public Prosecutions.  That is a period it might not be necessary to go through if somebody whose eminence is already acknowledged generally is appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is enough simply to pick a man of sound judgement and common sense.  I think the public would expect more and be entitled to more than just that, even though, as the Attorney General says, they may be the most important individual qualifications of any man for any such job.  I am aware that there are in the Public Service, particularly in the Attorney General's office and to a lesser extent in the Department of Justice, people who have qualified <Col N="200" /> either as barristers or as solicitors and who have dealt with criminal law matters on and off or, perhaps, even constantly since they entered the Public Service.  They may, therefore, have acquired a considerable knowledge of the criminal law as a result of that work but, like Deputy Andrews, I find it very difficult to accept that a man whose knowledge is only academic or theoretical in the sense that he has never practised to any considerable extent in the actual courts, in the heat of battle, will have the type of experience that would be desirable in this position.</P>
    <P>If we were talking about a medical appointment, for example, a surgical appointment as the senior consultant surgeon of some large hospital in Dublin, I doubt if we would consider anybody or be expected to consider anybody that had not long practical experience of surgery.  It may be argued that those who are working in the Attorney General's office have practical experience, of a kind, of the criminal law but it is only of a kind. It is not the real experience of the real thing.  It is totally different to deal with a problem on paper and to deal with it in front of a jury with a defendant in the dock and a judge on the bench and with witnesses coming in a series to the witness box. One is then faced with human problems and human difficulties and situations that do not arise when one's experience is limited to dealing with problems of criminal law on paper only.</P>
    <P>It may well be that some members of the public service are suitable for this position but, nonetheless, I have reservations, to say the least of it, about the advisability, from the point of view of the eminence of the office which it is proposed to create, of appointing somebody who may be suitable but who is not known or recognised among either the public or the profession as being a man of standing in relation to the criminal law.  There would, I suppose, be the advantage in the appointment of a civil servant that at least it would be seen that the appointment to the office was not one which arose as a result of patronage <Col N="201" /> because great emphasis is being laid by the Attorney General on this committee but a careful reading of this long section indicates that the Government do not have to accept the recommendations of the committee and I am inclined to wonder, as many other people are, what is the need for the establishment, in rather elaborate and lengthy terms in this section, of this committee, if the Government are free to disregard it as apparently they are.  They can keep, it appears, sending back the nominations to the committee and asking for further nominations until they get someone that suits or satisfies them.</P>
    <P>I would hope that even at this stage the Attorney General would, in the interests of a new and important office now about to be established, reconsider this question of qualification for it.  While I accept his view that the question of judgment and common sense are, perhaps, in the last analysis the most important qualities, let us have judgment and common sense from someone who has more than just judgment and common sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Government after considering the report of the selection committee will not appoint someone of common sense and judgment and nothing else and, obviously, the committee and the Government will have to consider the professional qualifications, experience and knowledge of the different applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of divergence between us appears to arise in relation to the attitudes of the public to the future appointment under this legislation because it is admitted by Deputy O'Malley that there may well be somebody in the public service who is qualified but he suggests that, notwithstanding this, the appointment should not be made, because of public attitudes and, as I understand the point, that the question of public confidence would arise because public confidence would be enhanced by the appointment of someone who is well-known, eminent in the profession.  I <Col N="202" /> think we must draw a distinction between the rather narrow world of the legal profession and the public in general.</P>
    <P>In the legal profession the eminent members of the legal profession will be well-known but outside it, apart from certain people who become prominent through constant appearances in court in cases which get widely reported, members of the legal profession by and large are not known.  There are many members of the legal profession who might well be suitable for appointment to this position of whom the public would have little or no knowledge. Obviously, there are many solicitors about whom the public would know little.  This is not a reflection on the members of the solicitors' profession concerned.  On the contrary, the fact that members of the solicitors' profession may not be known to the public is something which may be more to their credit than otherwise.  Apart from the consideration, which I am not for one moment minimising, of eminence in the legal profession on itself, the public generally are not likely to be greatly exercised by the actual name of the person who obtains this appointment. It is, of course, possible that some very prominent person whose name is used a great deal in newspapers may be appointed but it is equally possible that a highly qualified member of the legal profession whose name does not appear very often in the papers and who is not known to the public may be appointed.  While I agree with the importance of public confidence in this position.  I suggest that this public confidence is obtained not so much by appointing a person who is well known to the public through constant court procedure and court appearances being reported in the newspapers but by the fact that it will be known that the person appointed has been appointed in the way that has been suggested in this legislation and, also, and perhaps more important, by the actual way in which the office is carried out.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions, whose title appears a great deal in the newspapers but whose actual personality may well be of little interest to members of the public, does <Col N="203" /> his job properly this will be seen.  It will be seen in the administration of justice and in the administration of the criminal law.  This will be obtained by the procedures which we think should be in this legislation and also by the manner in which the person whom we hope will be appointed as being a qualified person, will carry out his functions.</P>
    <P>I do not wish the Members opposite to think I am just adopting a take it or leave it attitude.  I am not doing that.  I put forward arguments which I believe are valid ones.  I put forward further ones now.  All I was saying in my earlier remarks was that it did not appear to me that I had succeeded in persuading Deputies opposite of the validity of those arguments. I feel that the proposals which we are making will produce a good result and that is why I do not want to limit in any way the area of choice, which limitation would be involved in accepting either of these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a layman, I want to ask a question.  If the Attorney General is anxious to widen the scope of eligibility, would he indicate whether or not, in reference to the Civil Service, he is excluding solicitors or barristers who might be employed by local authorities or semi-State bodies?  It is possible that you would have a solicitor or barrister, who, after successfully discharging his duties in the Civil Service, would have migrated to a higher position with a local authority or a semi-State body thereby adding to the experience which he had in the Civil Service proper.  Is a gentleman of that type being excluded under paragraph (b)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The position will be that any solicitor who is practising as a solicitor in a local authority will be eligible provided he is practising for ten years.  If he has ceased to practise as a solicitor, if he is in a local authority but not practising as a solicitor then, he would not be eligible. The reason for the way in which paragraph (b) is drafted is that when a person applies for entry to the Civil Service he may or may not have qualifications as a barrister or solicitor.  If <Col N="204" /> he applies to the Civil Service, having those qualifications, it will be because he is seeking a post where those qualifications are necessary and, accordingly, he will be involved in legal work in the public service.  If, however, a person has worked for, say, ten years, in the Civil Service and left he will qualify under this, if his years of service are in the legal service.  If a solicitor is acting as a member of a local authority and practising as a solicitor, he will qualify but if a person has not had the ten years' experience and does not practise as a solicitor, then his actual work, other than work as a solicitor, will not be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary position we are in then.  I am grateful to Deputy Tunney for raising this matter with the Attorney General who was more than frank in his reply to the question.  The Attorney General has suggested that the amendment I have tabled is narrow.  It is narrow for a particular purpose.  We want to ensure that the best and most highly qualified person is available for the position of Director of Public Procecutions. Now, according to the information the Attorney General has given to Deputy Tunney, a solicitor or barrister employed in a local authority, who has no practice of criminal law whatsoever, is eligible now to apply for the post of Director of Public Prosecutions, as I understand it.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask another question in addition to the one posed by Deputy Tunney.  How many people within the public service, solicitor or barrister, apart from what we consider so necessary, namely, experience in practice, and so on, of the criminal law, would be entitled to apply for the position of Director of Public Prosecutions?  That is a very fundamental question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are being told by the Attorney General that a solicitor or barrister, a member of a local authority using his legal knowledge for the benefit of the local authority for whom he is employed can apply for this post. What experience or expertise in the law has a solicitor or barrister employed by a local authority?  He is <Col N="205" /> engaged in the interpretation, as I understand it, of Acts which relate to the operation of local authorities, which, in many instances, are totally unrelated to the criminal law.  This makes our case even stronger.  The person we seek is a person with a high knowledge of the practice of criminal law and a knowledge of criminal law, of the administration of criminal law and of the whole structure of the courts.  We accept that common sense and sound judgment should be possessed by this person.  Of course, a civil servant, either a barrister or solicitor, may have sound common sense and judgment but the person we suggest is a highly qualified barrister of sound judgment and common sense who, in addition, has the professional qualifications.</P>
    <P>I ask the Attorney General to elaborate on the very extraordinary reply&mdash;he knows what I mean&mdash;he gave to Deputy Tunney and tell us how many people within the public service, barristers or solicitors, with the necessary qualifications set out in section 2 (3) (b), are qualified to apply for the position of Director of Public Prosecutions when this Bill becomes an Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite certain if Deputy Tunney is in agreement with Deputy Andrews, and, perhaps, the position might be clarified.  I may have misunderstood the implication of Deputy Tunney's remarks, but I understood Deputy Tunney to desire that solicitors who were in the employment of the local authorities would not be excluded.  That, of course, is the very opposite to what Deputy Andrews would want.  Deputy Andrews would want them excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position under the Bill is clear. Under section 2 (3) (a) the person must be a practising barrister or practising solicitor subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) (b).  Therefore if a solicitor has been practising for ten years in the employment of a local authority, he is eligible but a barrister would not be a practising barrister if he is in full-time employment of the local authority and he would not be eligible.  There is nothing extraordinary in this once <Col N="206" /> we admit, as I think we should admit, a solicitor to be eligible for this position.  It may well be that a person in the employment of the local authority may have been involved in no work at all connected with the criminal law and so I would imagine his chances of appointment would not be very high.  On the other hand, every member of the legal profession would know of solicitors in the employment of local authorities who would have a great deal of experience of the administration of the criminal law.  While I am not suggesting that such a person would be automatically appointed if he applied, I am suggesting it is not extraordinary to have the net wide enough to allow such a person to apply.</P>
    <P>In relation to the number of people in the public service who might be eligible under (3) (b), I think there would be three persons quaified for the position in the Attorney General's Office and possibly eight in the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  I think they are accurate figures, but if the Deputy wants them more accurately I can get them for him.  There are not very many people who would come under (3) (b) who would have the necessary qualifications.  However, as I have indicated to the House already, if the House accepts the principle that a practising solicitor should be eligible for appointment, and I think he should, then I do not think the House should exclude somebody who is practising as a solicitor in the employment of the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General has been more than frank and I accept his figures unreservedly. It would apparently limit the applications for appointment to the position of Attorney General to an even greater extent than we had anticipated on this side of the House.  As the Attorney General has properly pointed out, solicitors or barristers&mdash; and I am not making a case against solicitors, as the Attorney General would appear to indicate&mdash;in the employment of the local authorities would effectively not have the qualifications, so they would not be appointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear, by implication, that solicitors within the local authorities would not be appointed.  What practice of the criminal law, so necessary to be consistent with our amendment, would such solicitors have to take on in the performance of the functions of the Attorney General?  That is what our amendment is all about.  We are trying to point out to the House that the Director of Public Prosecutions is taking on the criminal law functions of the Attorney General.  We are now discussing the appointment to that position of a person who engages in the criminal law at the lowest level of that practice in the local authorities. The Attorney General has implied it would be unlikely that such a person would be appointed, but the position is now that there are some ten or 12 people who would have the really necessary qualifications according to the standards of this Bill, standards which we consider to be very low and not necessary to the appointment in question, namely, the Office of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I make the point I made before, that the person we want to be Director of Public Prosecutions and <Col N="208" /> the person most suitable to fill that office is the person with the same status, the same experience and the same qualifications as the Attorney General himself.  I shall not refer back to my argument in relation to Article 30.3 of the Constitution in accordance with which provision is made for the appointment of a person who will now be known as the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Then we are handing over the office of Director of Public Prosecutions to a barrister who may not have practised more than two or three years.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (3) (b) says that in addition to his practice, he may take into consideration his employment as a barrister in the public service, and this will add to his experience, so called. The thing is becoming farcical.  Here is a Director of Public Prosecutions who will deal with the whole practice of the criminal law in the various courts.  He will distribute State briefs, and will decide who will be prosecuted on and who will not be prosecuted on evidence presented to him; in other words, he is taking over the whole paraphernalia of the Attorney General, and we are being offered this in the Bill, which we reject.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection 7 (a) (i), to delete lines 17 to 23 and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(I)  the President of the High Court,</P>
      <P>(II)  the President of the Circuit Court,</P>
      <P>(III)  two persons designated by the General Council of the Bar of Ireland,</P>
      <P>(IV)  two persons designated by the Incorporated Law Society, and</P>
      <P>(V)  the Secretary to the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment goes to the very kernel of the proposition we are making in relation to the Bill itself, namely, the importance of the qualifications of the person who will take on the office of Director of Public Prosecutions.  We say&mdash;unfortunately the amendment has been defeated&mdash; that a person who has practised as a senior counsel for not less than five years should be appointed to hold that office.  On Report Stage we may consider putting down another amendment to the effect that a practising barrister of not less than 15 years' standing should be considered for the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions. To be so consistent a person so appointed should be highly qualified in criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person making the nominations for consideration by the Government for the Office of Director of Public <Col N="211" /> Prosecutions should be highly qualified in the administration of the law and the courts system.  The persons envisaged in the Bill as it stands are the Chief Justice, the Chairman of the General Council of the Bar of Ireland, the President of the Incorporated Law Society, the Secretary to the Government, and the Senior Legal Assistant in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice is responsible for the despatch of the business in the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal.  They are his basic responsibilities.  He is also responsible for the appointment of notaries and commissioners for oaths.  Effectively, the only matters on the criminal side in which the Chief Justice is engaged would be points of law arising from criminal matters.</P>
    <P>We suggest that the obvious person who should be appointed in place of the Chief Justice&mdash;and I am sure the Attorney General will agree with me here&mdash;is the President of the High Court.  The President of the High Court is responsible for the despatch of business in the High Court.  This includes the Central Criminal Court. He is responsible for the Central Office, Wards of Court, and other such matters.  He is also responsible in a supervisory role for district justices.  The President of the High Court appoints the various judges to take on various cases, be they in the Central Criminal Court, or in the Special Court.  On the civil side, of course, he allots the various judges to their own courts.  He decides effectively what their duties will be in relation to the functions they are discharging.</P>
    <P>On the criminal side the President of the High Court is clearly the person who should be on this committee instead of the Chief Justice.  I do not think there is any gainsaying that.  If subsections (2) to (6) are to remain, as they must remain by reason of the last division which went to the Government, the proper person to appoint to position one on the committee is the President of the High Court.  His functions are quite clear.  His functions in criminal matters are quite clear.  We would <Col N="212" /> urge the Attorney General to take note of our suggestion for the substitution of the President of the High Court for the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about the person or persons.  I am talking about the offices and the functions deriving from those offices.  I should not like to make it in any way a personal matter or, in current parlance, to personalise the matter.  Quite the contrary.  I put it forward as a reasonable proposition.  I put it forward arising out of the functions of the President of the High Court in relation to the disposal of criminal matters.  This is a reasonable proposal which the Attorney-General will accept.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the General Council of the Bar of Ireland might not necessarily have wide experience in the realms of criminal law.  We suggest that the Bar Council nominate two persons to this committee with experience of criminal law.  Persons sitting on this committee should have a wide knowledge of the practice and experience of criminal law.</P>
    <P>We believe that the President of the High Court and the President of the Circuit Court have that function. We believe also that the two persons designated by the General Council would have the qualifications necessary in knowledge and practice of the criminal law.  Again, we do not wish to differentiate between the numbers appointed by the Bar Council and those appointed from the Incorporated Law Society.  The president of the Incorporated Law Society may not have any knowledge or practice of criminal law.  He may be a conveyancing lawyer or a lawyer with a specialised knowledge of another field outside the realms of criminal law.  It may be coincidental that the president of the Incorporated Law Society for 1974 may have a vast knowledge of criminal law but that will not necessarily follow year in year out.</P>
    <P>We ask that the Incorporated Law Society appoint two solicitors knowledgeable in criminal law to this committee. We are being consistent that the persons involved have knowledge <Col N="213" /> and practice of criminal law.  They must have sound knowledge and judgment. Consequently, our amendment proposes that the Incorporated Law Society appoint such persons.  We agree in the fifth part of our proposed amendment that the Secretary to the Government be involved as a liaison between the Government and the committee.  I can envisage him acting as secretary to the committee. This would be right and proper.  He would not need to have a specialised knowledge of any aspect of criminal law.  He would be there in his capacity as a link between the Government and the committee.</P>
    <P>Is the senior legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General in a position to apply for the job of Director of Public Prosecutions?  If so, we should exclude him.  It is well-known to the members of this Dáil who are legal men that the gentleman holding the position of senior legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General is of the highest integrity.  He is highly knowledgeable in the law.</P>
    <P>Our reasons for excluding him are in no way a reflection on his qualities as senior legal assistant.  He served as a civil servant under the last Government. The Attorney General has knowledge of him and I am sure he will join with me in paying him a very fair tribute.  In our amendment to the Government proposal the people we propose for the committee would be the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, two persons designated by the General Council of the Bar of Ireland, two persons designated by the Incorporated Law Society and the Secretary to the Government.  This is a reasonable amendment.  The function of the President of the High Court and the President of the Circuit Court is the administration of criminal law in their respective courts.  The High Court includes the Central Criminal Court, special courts and so on.  The President of the Circuit Criminal Court assigns judges to that court.  The persons nominated to the committee by the General Council of the Bar of Ireland would be knowledgeable in <Col N="214" /> criminal law and in addition would need to be well informed when interviewing people before the appointment to the office of Director of Public Prosecutions.  The people nominated by the Incorporated Law Society would have a knowledge of criminal law within the solicitor's profession.</P>

      <P>The Government are anxious that this important committee would not be too unwieldy.  As Deputies know, it is always very difficult in any walk of life to get a committee of the right size to undertake any task.  We wanted a committee which would be representative, eminent and not too large.  The committee proposed by the Government would comprise seven people.  The committee proposed by the Government would comprise five.  I appreciate that this would mean that the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society would only have one representative each. While this is a drawback which must be accepted, the balance of advantage lies in keeping the committee small.</P>
      <P>The Government concept was that this committee should be representative of areas of activities which could make a very important contribution to the process of selection, not just by experience but by their eminence in the eyes of the public.  There should be a representative from the judiciary, the Bar, the solicitors' profession, the permanent public service and the administrators of criminal law.  The committee proposed by the Government is to have a judge as one of its members.  The Government felt that the judiciary should be represented by the highest judge in the land and this is what has happened.  The Chief Justice acknowledged his willingness to act on this committee.  We are very grateful.  Like Deputy Andrews.  I am not concerned with personalities.  I suggest that when we are setting up a committee composed of the most eminent people we can get, it is by far the best thing to get the head of the division.  That is why the Chief Justice was suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see the logic of the argument put forward by Deputy Andrews in relation to his suggestion that the <Col N="215" /> President of the High Court and the President of the Circuit Court should be appointed rather than the Chief Justice.  There is no question of personalities being involved but the argument put forward by the Opposition was that these members of the judiciary would have experience of criminal trials while it is suggested the Chief Justice would not have this experience. As I understand it, the argument is that because of this experience they would be in a better position and be better qualified to judge the prowess of counsel in criminal matters.</P>
    <P>I can see the logic of this but I do not accept the basic premise which was that the DPP should be appointed from the Bar solely.  Once it has been decided he should not, it seems to me the important thing is to have the Chief Justice.  While pointing out the logic of the argument made by Deputy Andrews, I do not accept its complete validity for this reason: it appears to indicate that while the President of the High Court and the President of the Circuit Court would have more experience of criminal trials than the Chief Justice, therefore, they would be in a better position to make the most appropriate choice.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that argument for the reason that the Chief Justice is pre-eminent in the judicial and the legal world in this country.  He is a man of great experience and knowledge and, above all, he knows the members of the legal profession.  He presides in the Court of Criminal Appeal and, apart from his knowledge of counsel gained in the Supreme Court and that gained otherwise than in court, he will have experience of the abilities of the people concerned as practitioners of the criminal law in the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>The basic reason I cannot accept the line of argument being developed by the Opposition again comes back to the functions of the post to be filled and the functions of the selection committee.  The members of the committee will not be concerned primarily with the applicant's ability as an <Col N="216" /> advocate.  They will weigh up many considerations but the art of advocacy is not the primary qualification.  What the members of the committee will have to do is to judge the applicants and their judgment will be based on all kinds of considerations.</P>
    <P>Somebody like the Chief Justice is obviously a highly-qualified person to judge the qualifications of an applicant for the important post of DPP.  He will know the standing of the applicant if he comes from the Bar and he is likely to know his standing if he comes from the solicitors' branch of the legal profession.  He may not have the same knowledge of the applicant if the latter comes from the public service.  It seems to me that because of his pre-eminence in the country and in the judicial field, because of his wide experience and suitability to judge applicants, because of the intimate knowledge he will have of many of those likely to apply for the post, the Chief Justice is a most suitable person to be on the committee. I do not think the arguments in favour of the two other members of the judiciary suggested outweigh the arguments in favour of the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>The Government wished to have representatives of the Bar of Ireland and representatives of the solicitors profession on the committee.  The Opposition agreed with this but suggested that rather than having the president for the time being of the relevant professional associations two members be appointed by the associations themselves.  I should like to make the following points with regard to this argument.  First, it would make the committee too big if there were two members of the Bar Council and two members of the Incorporated Law Society.  One member from each branch would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I accept the force of the argument put forward by Deputy Andrews, namely, that the president for the time being of the Bar Council or the president for the time being of the the Incorporated Law Society may have little or no knowledge of criminal law.  However, I do not accept that as a necessary disqualification for the <Col N="217" /> position.  The fact that the person on the committee does not know the criminal law and has little experience in practising that law is not a relevant consideration.  I do not see the committee carrying out an examination; I do not see the applicant sitting for an examination with his knowledge of the criminal law being tested by the committee.  Of course, they may feel they should operate in that way but that is a matter entirely for them. Rather I would anticipate that the committee will examine the applicants and their qualifications and, from this examination, will be in a good position to assess the degree of knowledge of the applicants.  I fully concede that the president for the time being of the Bar Council may have little knowledge of criminal law but he will have a great deal of knowledge of members of the Bar who are applying.  He will know them intimately and will be in a position to assess their standing and qualifications.</P>
    <P>Apart from any lack of knowledge which he may have of the field, exactly the same considerations apply in relation to the president of the Incorporated Law Society for the time being.  It may well be that, when the appointment comes to be made, the president for the time being will have little or no knowledge of the criminal law but, by virtue of his years of experience, the knowledge he will have gained and because he is President of the Incorporated Law Society, he will have a great deal of knowledge of the various applicants from the solicitors branch of the profession who may apply.  He would be well placed indeed to judge the qualities and qualifications of the applicant.  Therefore, the lack of knowledge&mdash;if in fact it does exist&mdash; of the president for the time being of these two professional associations is not, to my mind, a drawback to their appointment.  However, I accept that the presidents for the time being of the Bar Council and of the Incorporated Law Society might prefer not to act and provision is made for this eventuality.  Provision is made in the next sub-paragraph of this subsection for the appointment of another person <Col N="218" /> to be a member of the committee in place of somebody who may be unwilling to act.</P>
    <P>Regulations are to be made under this legislation.  I would anticipate that the regulations would provide for a situation where, for example, if the president of the Incorporated Law Society was unwilling to act, somebody nominated by him would be appointed by the Taoiseach, under this section; or somebody nominated by him, after consultation with the Bar Council, or somebody nominated by the Bar Council could be appointed.</P>
    <P>The question of the regulations has to be considered later.  I can assure the House that the regulations will be considered with the Bar Council and with the Incorporated Law Society.  We would welcome their views on drafts which will be prepared. But I would anticipate that we would make provision in regulations for a situation where if the president for the time being of the Bar Council or of the Incorporated Law Society did not wish to act, there could be somebody appointed on the lines I have indicated.</P>
    <P>It is true that the senior legal assistant in the Attorney General's office might wish to apply for this position and, in view of the position of the Bill now, he would be eligible to do so.  For reasons of very long precedents in this House, I am not going to follow Deputy Andrews in making any remarks about a public servant.  Even when favourable remarks are made about a public servant it is not usual to follow this line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to say that there is no significance in my silence on this matter.  I draw attention to the fact that the point which <Col N="219" /> is being made by the Opposition is covered by sub-paragraph (2) to which I have referred.  If, in fact, the senior legal assistant of the Attorney General for the time being wished to apply for the job he would declare his unwillingness to act on the committee and so a person would be appointed in his place.  Bearing in mind the concepts which, as I indicated earlier, are behind the Government's thinking, I would hope that the person to be appointed in his place would be somebody in the public service who would have knowledge of the administration of the criminal law.  I can see immediately that criticism can be made of this, in that, if, legislatively, it is provided that the senior legal assistant is a member of the committee and he is not appointed then it would be known that he had been an applicant. I accept this as a criticism but I think it is criticism which must be accepted because of the undoubted advantages of having the senior legal assistant in the Attorney General's office on the committee.  Usually this person has very great qualifications and experience.  It is very desirable to have such a person on the committee because of the desirability of having the committee composed of people as pre-eminent as possible. Therefore, I think we should leave the committee as it has been comprised for the reasons I have given, bearing in mind the fact that the points in relation to persons who do not feel qualified to act or who do not wish to act can be covered by regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General has let slip, I think &mdash; intentionally or otherwise &mdash; that the person who will be appointed, he hopes, will have a knowledge of the criminal law. That sums up our whole argument. That is the very basis of our argument. The reason why we want a person so appointed to have a knowledge of the criminal law is not based on an aspiration or a hope that that will be the case.  We would make it mandatory.  Indeed, we may well make it mandatory when we are returned to office, that the person appointed to <Col N="220" /> be Director of Public Prosecutions will have to be a man with a high knowledge of the criminal law.  The position in which we find ourselves is astonishing&mdash;that the person to be appointed Director of Public Prosecutions does not have the qualifications that we urge, and this brings us back to the amendment.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a clear followon of the principles we have been expounding, namely, that there is a great looseness of attitude and mind in this whole Bill relative to the criminal law.  I do not suggest that the Attorney General does not take the criminal law seriously, but certainly the legislation proposed is not indicative of a serious application of the criminal law and what the criminal law means to this country, or what the criminal law means in the context of the common law.  That is why we urge the Attorney General to take another look at the committee we propose should be set up to advise him on the appointment of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we discover that it is hoped that the person so appointed &mdash; it is hoped &mdash; will have a knowledge of the criminal law.  The Director of Public Prosecutions will have the administration of the criminal law of this country in his hands.  As I have said already, he will decide who will be prosecuted and who will not and he will decide who is going to prosecute. That is the reality of his position.  He is now taking on the full functions of the Attorney General relating to the criminal law.  Might we ask the Attorney General, when he was being appointed &mdash; or in relation, possibly, to the next Attorney General &mdash; would it have been, or would it be, acceptable that such a person hold the qualifications outlined in this Bill, that the Attorney General would not have the eminence and status of the present holder of the office and, indeed, of his predecessors?  That is the basis of our argument, that we are handing over the functions of the Attorney General in relation to criminal matters, electoral petitions and referendum petitions to the Director of Public Prosecutions and it is hoped now that the <Col N="221" /> person so appointed will have a knowledge of the criminal law.  With that attitude prevalent in the House, I do not know whether it is necessary for me to pursue the amendments I have tabled to this Bill.  This is a matter to which I will give consideration in the next half hour.  We will have to consider whether we in the Opposition should be associated, in any fashion, with the loose type of drafting which this Bill has produced and the loose type of thinking which has found its way, not in any deliberate fashion, to the floor of this House.  This is a Bill distinguished for its looseness.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is any tribute to those people, the Government in the final analysis, to produce subsections 3 (a) and (b) and subsection 7 (a).  There is no great distinguishing feature in their thought if they are to take their criminal law seriously. This is not to under-rate the personalities who hold the positions here.  We always have to punctuate our remarks in some statutory fashion in case the people who hold office for the time being are sensitive.  I am not referring to personalities.  I am referring to the offices which they hold for the time being, the President of the High Court, the two persons nominated by the General Council of the Bar of Ireland, the two persons nominated by the Incorporated Law Society and the Secretary to the Government as a liaison.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General very fairly acknowledged the logic of my exposition in the first instance when I spoke on this aspect of the Bill and he dismissed it for reasons which he is entitled to consider proper.  I do not deny him that right and it would be an impertinence of me to attempt to do so but I disagree with his reasons just as he disagrees with mine.  In the meantime this committee has undoubtedly an Alice in Wonderland function.  This committee selects candidates to be appointed to the office of Director of Public Prosecutions whenever so requested by the Government. How is the committee supposed to discover who the candidates are to be?  Who is to approach suitable <Col N="222" /> candidates or personages?  Are there to be letters of application?  These matters are not clear in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General, when replying, may inform me that he can introduce regulations to set out clearly how this is to be done but I should like to know if there is to be a public advertisement in the newspapers seeking applicants for this post.  This is the extension of the logic propounded in this section.  To whom does an applicant for this post apply?  The Attorney General should also address himself to the question of emoluments for this post because they are not mentioned in the Bill.  I accept that section 13 refers to the fact that the expenses incurred in the administration of this Act shall, to such an extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. I do not know whether that covers my point or not.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the functions of the committee.  How will this committee select the candidates for this post?  Are candidates to apply by letter or reply to a public advertisement?  I am entitled to ask such questions.  I feel sure that the committee would like answers to these questions also and be given information as to what type of emoluments the holder of this office can expect. This is information to which the House is entitled.  The House is also entitled to know the emoluments of the person appointed, prior to his appointment, and if these emoluments are comparable with those of the Attorney General because the Director of Public Prosecutions will, effectively, be taking over the functions of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that section 2 (8) states that the director shall hold office upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Taoiseach after consultation with the Minister for the Public Service.  That is all very nice and fine but it does not reveal the <Col N="223" /> figure.  It sets out the machinery but we should be told exactly what this individual is to be paid.</P>

      <P>This is what we consider to be a tidying up amendment.  The Bill has already provided for a committee relevant to the appointment of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Now we have another committee being set up relative to the removal of the Director of Public Prosecutions so appointed.  This is a cumbersome and unnecessary process.  We say that the director may be removed by the Government for stated reasons but why do we have to go through a report of a committee under paragraph (b)? The committee under paragraph (b) will consist of the Chief Justice, a Judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice and the Attorney General.  We strongly recommend that the Director of Public Prosecutions appointed by the Government may be removed by the Government for stated reasons.  There will be no suggestion then that the Government can remove the Director of Public Prosecutions without publishing the reasons. They would have to make public their stated reasons.</P>
      <P>This is a safeguard in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions which we believe he is entitled to. Why do we have to go through a committee system?  Surely when the stated reasons are published they will be backed up by an <i>ad hoc</i> reference to the Chief Justice or the judge nominated by the High Court.  The Attorney General can then act on the advice of the people who are aware of a situation whereby the Director of Public Prosecutions is no longer in a position to carry out his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section proposed by the Government states that the Chief Justice and the High Court Judge nominated by him will investigate the condition of health, be it physical or mental, of the Director of Public Prosecutions and inquire into the conduct of the execution of his office by the director either generally or on a particular <Col N="228" /> occasion.  Why we have to enshrine in our legislation this type of situation is beyond me.  Surely the answer to it is that the director may be removed from office by the Government for stated reasons.  We should exclude all that follows &ldquo;for stated reasons&rdquo;. It would mean that section 2 (9) (b) would go by default if the Attorney General accepts that my amendment is a reasonable one.  I respectfully urge him to consider that my amendment is a reasonable one.  It would be the proper method whereby a Director of Public Prosecutions would be removed from office.  If I could have his views on that in the first instance, then it would be my intention to pursue the matter in a gentle fashion a little bit further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain what the thinking behind this procedure is. The whole object of this subsection is to strengthen the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is desired to make it as clear as possible and as far as legislation can do that that the Director of Public Prosecutions is to be absolutely independent in the exercise of his functions.  That is spelt out in the legislation.  In addition, it was felt highly desirable to have this further safeguard built into this position.  The Director of Public Prosecutions will have the safeguard that every public servant has, namely, that he cannot be removed from office except by order of the Government.  It was thought desirable to give an added safeguard that before the Government would make such an order the conduct of the Director would be investigated in the manner that has been suggested. I think we are legislating for a situation which everybody would hope would never arise, but, nevertheless, it is prudent to consider a situation where a difference of opinion might arise in relation to the administration of the criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be borne in mind that the Director must feel himself to be absolutely independent in the way in which he carries out his office.  It is important that he be seen to be independent.  We think this has been achieved not only by writing his <Col N="229" /> independence clearly into the statute but also by giving him an independence over and above that which an ordinary civil servant would have, namely, that this committee would consider any complaints, any disabilities, which might be a cause for his dismissal.  I would very much hope it would never be necessary to operate this section, but I think it is desirable to have it there, and that it is the sort of safeguard which is very useful to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it then that the Director of Public Prosecutions cannot be removed from office except under this subsection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The Government would do the removing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Government would do the removing, but when the committee report to the Government the result of their investigations, then the Government will, having studied the report and if the report is adverse, act on that report and remove the Director of Public Prosecutions. They will then, I assume, have to publish the reasons for so removing the Director of Public Prosecutions. Therefore, their reasons then become reasons publicly stated.  Like the Attorney General, I hope the position will never arise where any individual, be he the Director of Public Prosecutions or anybody else would have to have his conduct inquired into or be examined on account of his health either physically or mentally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Attorney General give us examples of exactly what he means by that provision?  While we accept that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be independent, of course, under this Bill we do not think he can be by virtue of the fact that he is going to be plucked from the Civil Service; this again, is no reflection on the Civil Service but is being consistent with our proposition that the director should be a man highly qualified in the area of criminal law. However, if, as I say my amendment is accepted, namely, that he can only be removed for stated reasons, it is clearly cleaner legislation than this <Col N="230" /> form of legislation as proposed.  I think this is unnecessary legislation, unnecessary to the extent that you need not legislate to bring about a situation which emerges from the legislation.  I believe a report can be obtained from the Chief Justice or from a High Court judge appointed by him without having to legislate for it.  When that report is received, that person, for stated reasons, is removed from office.  I think it is a totally reasonable proposition, and I do not think the provision in the Bill has anything to do with the independence of the director so appointed.  On the contrary, he has to go through a situation in which the Chief Justice, who may have no medical knowledge at all, or a High Court judge appointed by him, has to sit in judgment on the director's health and physical well-being.  This is a very dangerous precedent.  Then the Chief Justice has to inquire into his conduct either generally or on a particular occasion. The provision says the inquiry is to be carried out &ldquo;in such a manner as he thinks proper&rdquo;.  After all, we are dealing with a human being.  The Government themselves would be well able to manage the removal of the Director of Public Prosecutions without having to go through the formula proposed here.  I do not think it is good legislation or that it brings about what the Attorney General undoubtedly wishes to bring about, namely, the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It does nothing of the kind.  Why should we have a committee set up to inquire into the mental and physical wellbeing of the director when, by observation, without any particular medical knowledge, one could see the physical and mental deterioration of an individual.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge again that the Director of Public Prosecutions be removed for stated reasons, because, in the final analysis, the Government will have to state their reasons, even after the investigation and the report by the committee proposed in section 2 (9) (b) of the Bill we are discussing.  I do not want to take up too much time on this matter, <Col N="231" /> but the Attorney General might say whether the reasons for the removal of the director will have to be published. I would also like to ask whether the director's appointment will be permanent, and as I have already asked, except for stated reasons, whether the Government can remove the director.</P>
    <P>I just ask this question for my own personal information.  Does this Bill envisage that the Director of Public Prosecutions be a permanent office and continues regardless of what Government is in power?  Does it further mean that a new Government coming into power, who for one reason or another, stated reasons, might not wish to continue with the services of the incoming Director of Public Prosecutions, could remove him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy the provision is designed to give the director more independence. The idea is that if he can easily be removed from office there is the danger that he might consider his independence undermined, perhaps, by indications of disapproval by the Government on certain policy aspects of his office that he might adopt.  Secondly, there is the importance from the public point of view that the office would be seen to be absolutely independent and so it will be seen by this legislation that the Government cannot just dismiss the director.  Whether or not this section is there, the Government has the legal power to dismiss any civil servant, but the protection, of course, that civil servants have is that Governments in practice do not do this unless for very grave reasons indeed.  Superimposed on his independence, which he has as a member of the public service, there is the added concept of a requirement for a committee to investigate and report on any matter which would justify his removal from office.  To my mind this is a considerable safeguard. Indeed, there are precedents, not in this sphere but in another sphere; an individual was considered to be acting improperly and investigatory machinery <Col N="232" /> was set in motion.  The investigation indicated that he had been acting improperly and the individual concerned resigned rather than be dismissed from office.  That seems to me to be a humanitarian approach and a very considerable safeguard. If a situation should arise&mdash;we would hope it would not arise&mdash;in which it became necessary to investigate the health or conduct of a director he would be given an opportunity of considering the suggestions made against him and, presumably, he would want to put his case before this committee; if an adverse view were propounded by the committee he would be given an opportunity of resigning.  I sincerely hope this will never arise, but I think it is most important to maintain independence from the Government and this is one of the ways in which it is hoped to achieve that.  He will be a permanent member of the Civil Service and he cannot be removed from office except by the procedure indicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We have certainly some doubts about this section.  It provides that a law officer, and this is defined as the Attorney General, the Director of Prosecutions or the acting Director of Prosecutions, may direct any of his professional officers, and this means an officer who is a barrister or a solicitor, to perform on his behalf and in accordance with his instructions any particular function of the law officer in relation to a particular case or cases or in all cases in which that function falls to be so performed.  This is the type of delegation which Article 30.3 of the Constitution was designed to prevent, as we understand it.  That article was quoted at the beginning of the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have some doubts&mdash;and I am sure the Attorney General will disabuse us in this respect&mdash;about the constitutionality of this section.  We say that there is no basis on which a function of the Attorney General, or a function now carried out by the Attorney General which is to be carried out in future by the Director of Public Prosecutions, should be referred &ldquo;in all cases in which that function <Col N="236" /> falls to be performed&rdquo; to someone in perhaps the most minor position on the professional side of that office.  We believe this an undesirable and even dangerous precedent.  When this party returns to office we will take a very serious look at section 4 in the light of what I have stated.  Will the Attorney General indicate that this section does not run contrary to the Constitution and that it has the merit of constitutionality about it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing unconstitutional in this section.  The concept is not one of delegation.  In certain circumstances, as provided in the section, an officer in the Attorney General's office or the director's office may carry out, on behalf of the Attorney General or the director, as the case may be, some of these functions.  This is not an unusual provision.  There is an analogous provision already in existence in section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  It provides:</P>
      <P>The consent of the Attorney General under any provision of this Part may be conveyed in writing signed by the Attorney General or orally by a person prosecuting at the suit of the Attorney General or appearing on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General post was created in accordance with the Constitution. It cannot be suggested that every criminal case must be prosecuted personally by him.  It does not mean that every act which the Attorney General is required to do by virtue of his office must be done personally by him.  Such an interpretation of the Constitution would lead to complete absurdity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are provisions for conveying orally to the court the attitude of the Attorney General by someone acting on his behalf.  The concept in this section is that there may well be circumstances depending on the particular matters which may arise in the administration of the office where the director or the Attorney General, as the case may be, may direct in the manner indicated in this section, how the provisions are to be carried out.  It is not a delegation; the officers conabus <Col N="237" /> cerned will be acting for and by direction of the Attorney General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General said &ldquo;it is not a delegation&rdquo;.  Does he mean that they will be carrying it out on behalf of the Attorney General? Did he say that these matters will be delegated to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not use that expression &ldquo;delegated to him&rdquo;.  The concept in law would be that the officer will be acting on behalf of the Attorney General or the director, as the case may be.  This will be a concept in law as a result of the statute.  As I have indicated, this is not a novel provision and is not in any way prohibited by the Constitution.  The Constitution created a constitutional organ of State and a constitutional office.  It cannot be read as meaning that every act appertaining to that office must be undertaken by the Attorney General.  While we are avoiding the concept of a form of delegation we are, in fact, indicating that the professional officer will be acting on behalf of and by direction of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that:</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever the Government are of opinion that it is expedient in the interests of national security to do so, they may from time to time declare by order that, in relation to criminal matters of such kind or kinds as are specified in the order, the functions conferred on the Director by this Act may be performed only by the Attorney General, and where any criminal matters stand for the time being so specified, the functions conferred on the Director by this Act in relation thereto shall be performed by the Attorney General and not by the Director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> (2)  The Government may, by order, amend or revoke an order under this section including an order under this subsection.</P>
    <P>Again we express our reservations about the constitutionality of this section as it now stands.  I am sorry to be repetitious in my reference to Article 30.3 of the Constitution which the Government provided in the explanatory memorandum.  This Article reads:</P>
    <P>All crimes and offences...shall be prosecuted in the name of the People and at the suit of the Attorney General or some other person authorised in accordance with the law to act for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I explained the disjunctiveness of the matter when I contributed on the Second Reading of this Bill.  My view has not changed.  The Government cannot by a mere order suddenly switch from the Director of Public Prosecutions to the Attorney General or <i>vice versa</i>.  Consequently, we have doubts about the constitutionality of the section.  Of course, we can only express doubts about the constitutionality of any matter which comes before us.  The only place it can be tested is in the courts.  Until the matter is tested those doubts remain.  In the meantime we would be failing in the discharge of our functions if we did not express them and perhaps the Attorney General would place on the record his reply to the doubts raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Constitution does not prohibit the establishment of a Director of Public Prosecutions, on the contrary, it contemplates the creation of such an office.  In my opinion, the Constitution does not prohibit in any way the operation of the section now under discussion in that there may be circumstances&mdash;I hope they never arise&mdash;where the Government of the day might consider it desirable that certain prosecution functions which had until then been carried on by the director should be carried out by the Attorney General.  I do not see how it can be suggested this is prohibited by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> Once an order is made under the section, the director is no longer a person authorised in accordance with law to act in cases which are the subject matter of the order and the Attorney General becomes that person. It appears to me this is permitted by the Constitution and is a necessary provision.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General was not here on the last occasion when we vigorously pointed out the doubts we had about the efficacy of this section.  The section itself is praiseworthy and nobody denies that.  We agree that anyone who interferes with the due process of the law should be subject to the law.  There are a number of sanctions clearly available whereby if a person attempts to interfere with the due process of the law he is liable to proceedings. Section 6 (1) (a) states:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this section it shall not be lawful to communicate with the Attorney General or an officer of the Attorney General, the Director or an officer of the Director...</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a person whom we consider to be responsible, namely the Director of Public Prosecutions. When we consider persons sufficiently qualified and responsible and appoint them to the eminent positions of Attorney General and Director of Public Prosecutions&mdash;although we may have some doubts about the qualifications for the latter post as set out in this Bill&mdash;such people should not have their responsibilities outlined in legislation of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As section 6 (1) (a) stands, there is no sanction, good, bad or indifferent for a person who contravenes it.  It states that it will not be lawful to communicate with the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions in his official capacity for the purpose of influencing the making of <Col N="240" /> a decision to withdraw or not to initiate criminal proceedings or any particular charge in criminal proceedings, but there are no special penalties for attempting to influence the individuals named in the section. We agree with the principle that the process of the law should not be influenced in any fashion but we do not accept that this is the right kind of section to be in a Bill of this nature on the grounds that the individuals named are responsible people, that they will take action on their own account anyway, and that they will discharge their functions responsibly.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to comment on the matter having regard to what we consider to be a rather fatuous section in the way in which it is set out, not in its principle.  I would point out that no punishment is provided in the section.  The Attorney General must agree with me when I say that if an offence is set out it must be punishable in law and there must be a sanction or penalty available if a person commits the offence.  If a section of this kind is set out, the person appointed as Attorney General would not be a suitable person in his own right and I would ask the Attorney General to comment on that.  The language is the language by which offences punishable in law are created but no punishment is provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons for this section can be stated briefly.  It is not for one moment being suggested that any past or future holder of the office of Attorney General or of Director of Public Prosecutions has been, or will be, influenced by improper communications. The concern of the Government was with public attitudes.  It was considered desirable that the reality of the situation be made abundantly clear and this is the reason the section was so drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree fully that no punishable offence is created and this was deliberate. It was decided that it would not be necessary to have a punishable offence in this Act.  This view may well not prove correct in practice and <Col N="241" /> if it does not the legislation will have to be amended.  But I would hope&mdash;and I think it is a reasonable hope&mdash;that no amendment would be called for because in a very short time, it seems to us, this legislation will become Known.  Of course, it will be known to Members of Parliament. It will be known to members of the public who follow affairs in Parliament. It will also be quickly known to a wider public.</P>
    <P>Therefore, rather than create an offence and have it punishable in relation to persons who may be completely ignorant of a situation and are merely carrying on a practice that has been carried on for many years and so find themselves up against the criminal law through no fault of their own, it seemed to us preferable not to create a criminal offence in the first instance.  I am hopeful that the view the Government have taken of the operation of this section will work out in practice so that it will be unnecessary to create a punishable offence.  But I would hope that, if it became necessary to do so, the Oireachtas would pass amending legislation. However, I am fairly confident that this necessity will not arise and that in a comparatively short time, when this Bill is in operation, the effect of this section will be realised and accepted by the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Then what we are doing is legislating for public attitudes. I do not think we can do that here. It becomes even more reprehensible when the Attorney General makes the point: right, if public attitudes do not attach themselves to the intention of this section, and, in fact, they do contravene the section, then we shall have to come back here and amend the section.  Surely that is bad law in itself?</P>
      <P>Indeed, I made the point, at column 828, Volume 273 of the Official Report for Tuesday, 11th June, 1974, when we were discussing the Second Stage of this Bill, when I said:</P>

    <P>My very fair submission is that the Civil Service have not been found wanting over the years.  They <Col N="242" /> have been seen to be of the highest integrity; they have served each and every Government in a dedicated fashion, without demur, as a Civil Service should do.</P>
    <P>I then went on to quote the section we are now discussing.  I asked: why do we, in this section, effectively condemn men who have been in the public service over the years and who have not been found wanting in the discharge of their duties?  Why do we have to humiliate these people, people in whom we have resided our confidence over the years; who have discharged the functions they were appointed to perform?  I think it is a wrong section and the Attorney General&mdash;while not directly admitting it because it would not be his function so to do&mdash;has said it does not provide sanctions, that we are effectively legislating for public attitudes, that it is designed to prevent people communicating with the persons there.  Would the Attorney General answer me and say is it not a fact that there are sanctions available in instances where it is tried to bring undue influence, relative to criminal matters, on the individuals concerned here?  There are sanctions available.</P>
    <P>Why do we introduce into our legal system now a piece of window dressing&mdash;no more, no less&mdash;which does not provide a penalty at all?  I think it is probably one of the most unusual pieces of legislation this House has ever had to discuss, having regard to its ineffectuality.  I do not think this House has been set up to legislate for public attitudes and, hopefully, expect that by putting in a piece of window dressing the public will accept its intention.  I do not underestimate the intelligence of the public, quite the contrary, but there are a number of people within the society in which we live who will not accept the good intentions of the section we are now discussing.  Consequently, I would say it is bad law.  The principles enshrined in it are praiseworthy but I believe we are legislating badly and, if we are legislating badly, then I think we have to decide that we should not include it in the legislation with which we are dealing.</P>

      <P>As we are dealing with section 6, might I point to subsection (2) (b) where reference is made to &ldquo;member of the family&rdquo;? From my reading of that subsection, there are certain obvious omissions; I know it from professional practice. Knowing family circles, as we all do in this House, I think the words &ldquo;niece, nephew, uncle, aunt and in <i>loco parentis&rdquo;</i> should be included in that paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point Deputy Esmonde makes.  However, the way I would see this operating would be that if a person did not come within the scope of the words &ldquo;member of the family&rdquo; and so was not entitled to make the communications which would be permitted under the section, that person would not be without remedy and in fact could make certain that the points he wished to bring to the notice of the director or of the Attorney General, as the case may be, would be brought to such notice properly. I should like to stress that, in this connection, communications to the director and to the Attorney General, as the case may be, can be of considerable assistance in the administration of justice.  It is not desired to stop people who have the interest in the matter, which is permitted in the section, making these communications. If the people in the category referred to by Deputy Esmonde find that they have information which would be material for the administration of justice, I think it should be possible for them to see that this is conveyed without any infringement of section 6.  It was necessary to indicate who were the people who were fully entitled to make communications under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept is that members of the family should be entitled to do so.  The idea is that we should permit people who know very well the circumstances which give rise to the necessity to make communications, make those communications. It was for this reason that the definition clause was drafted in accordance with a similar clause in the 1961 Civil Liability Act, in wide terms.  I fully appreciate that there <Col N="244" /> might technically be members of a family who, in ordinary parlance, might not be included in that phrase, but I think it would not be desirable to make it too broad.  I think the situation envisaged by Deputy Esmonde can be met by the person with the information seeing that it is got to the director or to the Attorney General through some of the people included in the section entitled to give it.</P>
    <P>I would also stress in answer to the other point raised that I do not think any public official would consider this to be in any way a slur on his integrity. It is not so intended and I do not think it would be so taken. The concept is the one of public attitudes to the manner in which communications are made at the present time.  I wish to differentiate between that concept and what I said earlier in this discussion, namely, the way in which the Bill would operate in practice.  How we would see it operating in practice is that people who make communications contrary to the section will be informed that the communications cannot be entertained.  This fact will become widely known.  Persons who might be innocently tendering these communications will not be in breach of the criminal law if they so do.  It will become known pretty quickly that this law exists.  It will certainly be known to legislators and persons interested in Parliamentary affairs and in the administration of justice.  It will also become known to the general public, and the sort of public attitudes to the present situation will be changed fairly quickly.  In my view this will assist in the general attitudes to the administration of law in the country.</P>

      <P>We cannot legislate for public attitudes.  It is desirable that we should inform the public that if they communicate with the individuals named they are doing wrong but to say that without providing some sort of sanction if they commit that wrong has no merit.  Leaflets could be sent out to the public rather than have this thing enshrined in legislation.  I repeat that we cannot legislate for public attitudes.  If we accept that the Director of Public Prosecutions shall be independent in the performance of his functions why, in section 6, insult him?  If we are going to have a Director of Public Prosecutions who will be a responsible person in every respect and will be independent in the discharge of his <Col N="246" /> functions&mdash;we do not accept that the qualifications under this Bill are high enough&mdash; why insult him with this sort of backhand and unnecessary legislation?</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gave rise to a considerable amount of controversy on the last occasion.  Now that the Attorney General is here it is only fair to point out to him that in the euphoria of having become Attorney General he did state publicly that he would distribute State briefs on a fair and equitable basis.  When that statement was made everybody felt that he would follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Mr. Colm Condon, S.C., a man who discharged his function with integrity and in a fair and equitable fashion.  However, the hopes of the Bar were shattered when gradually we saw the elimination of individuals who could be described as supporters of one side of the political spectrum as against the other.  We saw their replacement with individuals who <Col N="247" /> could be described as supporters of the present Government.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it quite clear, in fairness to the individuals who were deprived of what I would consider to be their entitlement having regard to their undoubted ability and proven competence when they received State briefs from the former Attorney General regardless of political affiliations, that they did not complain of the fact that they were being deprived of State briefs because they believed in a particular political party. I have always expressed the view that members of the Law Library, regardless of political affiliation, men of proven worth and competence, should be given the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we decide, through a public undertaking in this House, that the Director of Public Prosecutions will probably discharge one of his functions, namely, the transmission of State briefs to individuals of proven worth and competence in the Law Library regardless of their political background.  If we could have that statement here, why do we have to have this section in the Bill?  The Director of Public Prosecutions according to the Bill and according to what the Attorney General and Deputy Esmonde have said, is independent and can exercise his functions in relation to the distribution of State briefs.  What happens then in a case where an individual in the Law Library feels aggrieved because he is not getting a State brief?  Can he take a declaratory action asking that it be declared that because of his political affiliations he is not getting a State brief?  What happens if the declaratory action fails or if it succeeds? Why do we have to go through this?  Has all honour failed us?  One of the main functions of a Director of Public Prosecutions will be to ensure that political patronage at Law Library level in the distribution of State briefs is brought to an end quickly.  Why can we not trust him to do that job without having to set up this tortuous procedure?  I can see individuals in the Law Library being offended by this type of procedure. <Col N="248" /> I do not have to spell out the reasons. People can be sensitive.  I will leave it at that.  I am a barrister myself and I am proud to be associated with the legal profession and the Bar in particular. I would like to declare my interests as far as my association with the Bar is concerned.  It is difficult for me to stand up here and be critical but I have to discharge two functions and my main function, as I understand it, is that of a public representative. If I fail to criticise because I am associated with another group, then I am not discharging my functions as a public representative.</P>
    <P>Having thought about this section quite a lot, I believe it will be unenforceable. As a statement of intent it is very worthy but can the Attorney General not say to the House that the Director of Public Prosecutions, who will be the right man for the job according to the Attorney General, will, without having recourse to this type of legislation, discharge his function in relation to the distribution of State briefs?  It is very difficult for me, having regard to the record of the Government since they have come to office, to accept the statement of intent outlined here.  I dealt with this at considerable length on Second Stage and it is not my intention to go into it again but certainly since the present Government have come to office they have distinguished themselves by their ruthless exploitation of patronage, in the law at any rate.  If I thought this section was operable I would support it.  I support the intention of the section.  I think everybody in the Law Library and everybody outside it, although there are not that many people outside the Law Library interested in the internal &ldquo;goings-on&rdquo; of the Law Library, would be glad to see the system of political patronage on State briefs and, indeed, political patronage generally brought to an end.  I would say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to that attitude.  It can give rise and it may give rise to dissension among people with a very proud tradition and anything that might erode that proud tradition should be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>This section is clearly unenforceable. <Col N="249" /> I would suggest that the person who will be appointed as Director of Public Prosecutions will be well able to manage the situation.  The appeals system is quite extraordinary.  There may be declaratory action after declaratory action when people do not receive what they consider to be their dues in the matter of State briefs.  I would ask the Attorney General to comment on what I have said.  I have no doubt he will refer to the statement he made about the fair and equitable distribution of State briefs on his accession to the respected position he holds.  He has been in office now for almost a year-and-a-half and there is certainly no evidence of a wind of change relative to the distribution of State briefs.  Why we have to wait for a Bill of this nature to bring an end to an insidious system, to say the very least of it, beats me.  The Attorney General will admit that the previous Attorney General did give State briefs to individuals, regardless of their political affiliations, and that the previous Attorney General did enjoy the highest esteem of the Bar in his capacity as Attorney General and as a colleague, as he does now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the criticism that this section is inoperable.  I would anticipate that discussions between the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Bar Council would take place from time to time, that there would be a clear understanding as to how this section is to be operated by members of the legal profession, that in accordance with the understanding that would be arrived at the section would be operated and I think it can achieve the end which we are all agreed should be achieved.  I do not anticipate the danger of declaratory actions which Deputy Andrews has referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides for the making of regulations which would deal with the investigation of allegations that the section has not been complied with by the Director or the Attorney General as the case may be. Again I look forward to the co-operation of the Bar Council in drafting these regulations but I would visualise <Col N="250" /> a complaints procedure set up by regulation by which anybody who felt aggrieved at the operation of the section could utilise this complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>I would not accept that this section is an inoperable one.  I think it will achieve the ends which we all seek to achieve.  I am well aware of the criticisms which have been made against me personally in this matter. I feel they are, however, in reality directed against the system which has been operating in this country for the last 50 years.  It is that system we want to change.  I do not propose to deal in any detail with the individual matters raised against me personally because it would be very invidious to do so as it would involve dealing with particular people and this is highly undesirable.</P>
    <P>I expressed the view, however, that the record of the last 16 months can be compared easily with the record of the previous 16 years and people will be able to judge from the record if the criticisms are justified.  As I say, I think these criticisms stem from the system which has been operating for a long time in this country and it is a very good thing that this legislation is now bringing it to an end.</P>

      <P>I have indicated our opposition to this section and we will leave it at that.  I would like to make it clear, once again, that our opposition to this section, so that there will be no doubt about it, is based on the fact that we accept as a statement of intent it is an extremely worthy section.  We believe if the person appointed to be Director of Public Prosecutions is to have responsibility, amongst others, for the dispensation of State briefs, he should be well able to do so without having to have legislation to do it for him.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> ( )  No Acting Director shall be appointed to hold office for a term in excess of 12 months.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment which would ensure that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, when vacated, should not be left vacant for more than 12 months and that no acting director shall be appointed to hold that office for a term in excess of 12 months.  This would ensure that if for various reasons under this Bill a Director of Public Prosecutions was removed from office or died in harness the office of Director of Public Prosecutions would not remain vacant for more than 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is a reasonable amendment and is a very important one.  No acting director should be appointed to hold office for a term in excess of 12 months.

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few comments to make on this Bill.  We appreciate the extension of the capital expenditure of the ESB from £450 million to £700 million.  It is very important for the ESB to expand, but as far as possible, home fuel should be used for the generation of electricity, especially when coal and other fuel is so expensive.</P>
      <P>I want to appeal to the Minister particularly on behalf of the people in rural Ireland in connection with the special charge being imposed by the ESB for the supply of electricity in rural areas.  Many people from rural Ireland have had to go into the cities and towns or to emigrate to England and America to seek employment. Their one ambition is to return home and settle down.  They get a grant to build a house and then they try to get an ESB connection which costs anything from £200 to £600.  In the country a person can get a grant of £420 for building a house, and in one case I know of it took more than the grant to connect the house with electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency we made representations to the ESB to try to have the special charge paid by instalments but the answer was no, that this special charge must be paid down in <Col N="253" /> one sum.  There will be further depopulation of the countryside unless there is a subsidy in respect of this special charge.  I am not blaming the ESB.  It is a non-profit making concern and certain regulations are laid down.  Some people were lucky enough to avail of the ESB supply when it was going through their district and they would have got it at a cheaper rate.  In other cases, perhaps, the people involved were a man and his wife of 70 or 80 years of age and they were not interested in electricity. It should be our aim not to depopulate the countryside.  I am totally against people congregating even in big villages.  The youth are better off in the countryside.  They can go out to their neighbours and bring in the cows.  They will find something to do besides congregating with mischievous thought coming into their minds.</P>
    <P>I was not present yesterday when this debate was proceeding.  This matter of the special charge may have been referred to and it is not my practice to make repetitious speeches.  Therefore, without delaying the House unduly let me say that while I appreciate the necessity for putting money into the ESB, we should do our utmost to utilise native fuel.  We should not let multi-national oil companies reap all the benefits. We should have refineries to refine our own oil.  That is something the Government should take into consideration immediately.  The recent oil crisis was a lesson for us.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that we will never again be caught out as we were in the last oil crisis.  We were held up to ransom.  We have fuel that can generate electricity.  It may be more expensive but we should at least ensure that a shortage of oil will never again have repercussions on our economy.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would appeal to the Minister to make some kind of subsidy available to help those in isolated homesteads to connect up with the national grid.  People get loans to help them to build their own houses and then find they have to pay anything from £200 to £550&mdash;that was highest <Col N="254" /> figure I heard&mdash;in order to get electricity laid on.  I appeal to the Minister to subsidise these people so that they can enjoy some of the benefits that are so easily available to those living in more densely populated areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been quite a long debate on a very important subject, the provision of money for the Electricity Supply Board.  I appreciate Deputy Callanan saying he would not repeat what others had said.  Last night a number of speakers made the same points.  I trust I shall not leave out anyone when I come to deal with these points.</P>
      <P>I shall take Deputy Callanan first since he is here.  There seems to be a little confusion about this Bill.  I do not decide how the money will be spent.  The ESB raise the money and they will have to pay the interest on it and repay the loan in time. They decide how the money will be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the point made by Deputy Callanan.  He probably put his finger on the crux of the matter when he said people did not realise that there will be a charge for connecting up houses.  They do not budget for this charge.  This is unfortunately true. It is not an easy problem where the ESB are concerned or where the consumer is concerned.  It has to be remembered that wires, poles, digging trenches and so on all cost money.  If the connection is to one house in an isolated area it would seem unfair to ask other electricity consumers elsewhere, or even in the same townland, to pay for something that will benefit another individual.  When people are building houses they consider the cost of the furnishing, the cost of laying a path, laying on water and so on, but nearly all seem to think the ESB should come along and provide them free with electricity even though they may be burning 40 watt bulbs in three rooms.  Naturally the ESB want to get a return which will repay them for the capital cost of supplying the electricity.  That is normal business <Col N="255" /> practice.  They are obliged not to lose money.  They cannot make a profit. They must balance expenditure with revenue.  There must, therefore, be a charge.</P>
    <P>A pretty generous subsidy has been provided by successive Governments since rural electrification started in the middle forties.  The last phase is costing £18 million of which £10 million has been provided by the Government by way of subsidy.  That is quite a considerable subsidy purely for the purpose of bringing electricity to remote rural areas.  The rural electrification scheme has been going on now for almost 30 years and when this present phase is completed on 31st March next it is estimated 98 per cent of the houses in the country will be connected to the ESB.  Compared with other countries in Europe and elsewhere that is an extremely high figure.  From 1st April next only 2 per cent of houses will be without electricity.  Now, the further one gets into a scheme like this, the higher the cost of supplying the electricity and supplying the last group will be much more costly.  It is cheaper to supply pockets of population than it is to supply individual houses in isolated areas.  I have asked the ESB to let me know after 31st March how many will still be without electricity and what the cost will be of connecting them.  As I said, only 2 per cent will be without electricity.  One can imagine how isolated these houses will be and how much higher the cost of connection will be.  It will not be possible to supply in groups or areas as at present.  I do not hold out any great hope that we will be able to offer much, if anything, in the way of assistance to these individuals to have them connected.</P>
    <P>I fully support Deputy Callanan in his observation that the more people we can keep in rural Ireland the better.  We must, however, recognise that it is easier to get older people to remain in rural Ireland than it is to get young people to stay there.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but young people like to move away to where there are other young people, to the bright lights and so on.  That is not unique.  The trend is pretty well recognised universally.  Of course, in continental countries the people just do not live in isolated farmhouses; they live in a village and they go out to their farms every day.  That system could have certain benefits for us. Apart from the satisfaction one may get from living in the country there is another aspect; it is one on which the Minister for Health is probably better informed than I am.  I refer to the loneliness of old people in rural areas living on their own.  If they could be made part of a small community in a village it might be better for them and for the whole country. This is a philosophical argument which really has nothing to do with the matter before us.  I should like to argue the pros and cons with Deputy Callanan.  He has a pin up so we cannot go to the place where I might go, but, perhaps, we can have a cup of tea together some time and talk about it.</P>
      <P>In general, I agree with him that the less growth there is in the bigger urban centres of population in the future and the more we can encourage people not to come to Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Waterford looking for work the better.  The more we can place work in their way outside these areas the better, even though they may have to travel some distance. There is a stock of houses in rural Ireland which is not available in the cities and towns.  They could be occupied.  From that point of view I agree with him, but I see tremendous problems because of the psychological pressures we might put on young people to swim against the tide of what their contemporaries are doing.  That is one of the problems. This is a long and, I am sure, very interesting argument we could have at some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the necessity for the conservation of energy.  Deputy Barrett said that he has been continuously urging the Government to introduce means of conserving <Col N="257" /> energy.  He is pushing an open door.  The first intimation I gave about a coming shortage of fuel was in last September or October.  I am not sure of the exact date, but I was speaking in Limerick at the opening of a new jetty for Shannon Airport.  I drew attention to the necessity to be more careful in our use of energy.  Almost daily between then and the end of January, I tried to impress on people the necessity, in their own interest, because I saw the price rises coming, for them to conserve energy and to be careful in their use of energy from the point of view of price rises and from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>We are faced with tremendous balance of payments bills because the price of oil quadrupled between 1st October last year and 1 January of this year.  This will affect all of us and I am continually drawing attention to it.  The Department, and the Government generally, through advertisements and through the setting up of committees, in a very positive way have pointed out to industrialists and householders the benefit to their own pockets of conserving energy which is now costing them so much. I am glad to say that we have had some quite dramatic results.</P>
    <P>There has been some very favourable comment from industrialists who engaged the services of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. The institute told me some months ago that in one very modern factory where they were asked to see was there any other way they could save on their use of fuel, they were able to show that most modern factory a method of saving 10 per cent of their fuel bill.  If they could do that in a modern, recently built factory, you can imagine the dramatic effects they could achieve for older, less insulated, institutions where the machinery would not be as efficient as in a modern factory.  This has been very successful.  We have had very favourable comments from those who engaged the services of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. In the sense of what we set out to do, we conducted an effective series of advertisements over the winter having regard to the compliments we <Col N="258" /> received from the Departments and the knowledge we had from various householders and factories and institutions around the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe said that there seemed to be a contradiction in the fact that we expected a 10 per cent growth rate, whereas there was only a zero growth at the moment.  Two things contributed to this zero growth. One was the price, because when people got the bills with these extra fuel charges they immediately set about saving energy.  This was a very effective way, although I would deplore it, of bringing home to people the necessity to save energy.  The other was the fact that in our campaign to conserve energy the public generally, and industrialists in particular, co-operated with us and we achieved results.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan, Deputy Barrett and a number of other Deputies referred to the necessity to build more oil refineries.  I agree with that.  I think we should be independent of imported products, if possible.  Building more oil refineries does not remove our dependence on oil, because the crude oil must still be imported. The only long-term answer to diversification is the development of nuclear power and natural gas and any other forms of energy there may be in the Celtic sea, or in the other areas around our coast.  These are long term solutions.</P>
    <P>Over 12 months ago before the energy crisis was thought of at all, I remember speaking at a council meeting in Brussels and being questioned by journalists.  I said that one of the things which appalled me when I took office was our over dependence on oil.  I gave it as my opinion at that stage that, as a matter of necessity, we would have to diversify from oil and build a nuclear power station.  A decision to set up a nuclear energy board was taken by the Government very shortly after that in the knowledge that we could not continue with a growing 70 per cent dependence on imported oil for our energy sources.</P>
    <P>That dependence on oil came in about 14 years.  In 1960, we were only <Col N="259" /> 25 per cent dependent on oil for our sources of energy.  In 1973, we were 70 per cent dependent, and growing. Before the gas find was made, an obvious alternative was nuclear energy.  I was a bit disappointed that some Deputies did not raise the environmental aspect of a nuclear power station.  I thought we might have had a useful discussion on that. I recognise that there are people who were at least doubtful about it.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board is there to oversee the erection of a nuclear power station and to see that it is operated safely.  If people understood that the nuclear energy board is their instrument to control a nuclear power station, they might feel less insecure or less afraid of the effects of such a power station.  The preferred site is at Carnsore Point in Wexford. Deputy O'Brien and Deputy Haughey, who referred to this aspect of the nuclear power station, are both Dublin men.  There is a nuclear power station already in operation at a point nearer to Dublin than the proposed Irish one will be at Carnsore Point.  That is the one just outside Holyhead in Wales. Without knowing much&mdash;even though this is one of my responsibilities as Minister&mdash;about winds or metereological services, I would venture to guess that there is far more east wind than south wind on the east coast of Ireland.  I might be wrong there.</P>

      <P>I should not have introduced it at all because I do not think we should have an argument here as to whether there is more east or south wind.  I want to make one other point about the nuclear power station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said he was distressed at the length of time it has taken to get this Bill off the ground. In fact, this is such a big station that, even in 1982, unless we have co-operation through the inter-connector <Col N="260" /> with the North of Ireland, we will not be able to absorb that into our system. We had to grow to a certain level and foresee a certain demand for electricity. If, for some reason, the inter-connector ceased to co-operate, or if the interchange of electricity between North and South ceased, it is doubtful whether we would have one by 1982. At the moment the thinking is that through the inter-connector this station will be available to supply current to the whole island and that, at some future date in the late 1980s, the Northern Ireland Electricity Board will build another one which will also be available.  One station coming on top of our generating capacity as it will exist at that stage would not be fully utilised in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney spoke about the industrial relations in the ESB.  Professor Fogarty investigated the whole sphere of industrial relations in the ESB and made certain recommendations. As far as the ESB are concerned, every one of these recommendations has been carried out.  I do not think any blame can be laid at the door of the ESB in this regard.</P>
    <P>He also spoke about the change in the financial structure of the ESB as recommended in the Fletcher Report. Under the 1927 Act, the ESB are compelled to balance expenditure against revenue in any one year.  What Fletcher had in mind was that they should be asked to form as an ordinary commercial concern making profits on the capital invested.  This would be a further monitoring of their efficiency. This change will need legislation because it is not incorporated in this Bill.  I am merely referring to it <i>en passant</i>.  This is a good suggestion which I favour because it may lead to an even more efficient ESB.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear a large number of Deputies pay tribute to the ESB.  As private individuals we all get annoyed when we see the size of our bills every two months.  By and large the ESB is probably the most efficient company here.  Our realisation of that fact should be that when we press a switch the light comes on.  That is what they are asked to do to foresee <Col N="261" /> the demand for electricity and provide for it.  Plans to meet demand must be laid many years before the demand exists.  They have successfully done that for the best part of 50 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Fitzgerald spoke about the cooling tanks for milk for farmers and the fact that the ESB had not foreseen and catered for them.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries offered grants to farmers to instal milk cooling tanks.  Nobody thought that the existing wiring for the ESB would be sufficient to cater for this demand. Farmers were anxious to avail themselves of these grants and ordered tanks.  They were sold by creameries and other agents as a result of dynamic sales promotion programmes.  The tanks were installed but nobody thought of asking the ESB to supply the current.  That kind of huge influx of orders could not be catered for by the ESB without bringing into commission new staff who could not be trained in the time necessary to do the work.  Inevitably a queue built up with which the ESB are now dealing.  This happened during the last 18 months.</P>
    <P>A very bad storm in the middle of January damaged ESB cables and involved the staff in a lot of extra work.  I think this problem was confined to the southern counties.  ESB linesmen, officials, and electricians put in very long hours to ensure that the people whose electricity had been cut off because of fallen trees would soon be reconnected.  We should remember that this is the type of service the ESB give.  People do not throw them bouquets often enough for the number of times they go out of their way to cater for individuals.  They are usually attacked as a monolithic bureaucratic, money-grabbing and inefficient industry with no thought for individuals.  Anybody who has dealt with them as an individual would not agree with that point of view.  The ESB supply an efficient service and, at times, for themselves and their personnel a most inconvenient one, frequently in the middle of the night and in bad weather because that is when lines go down.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with bills, the price <Col N="262" /> of electricity and the fuel surcharge which was imposed with the permission of the Government earlier this year.  This increase was a direct consequence of the rise in the price of oil by the oil-producing nations of the world.  The price of oil increased by over 400 per cent between 1st October last and 1st January.  An ESB generator is 70 per cent dependent on oil. This higher cost of the basic raw materials had to be reflected in the price of electricity.  There was no way round that.  We would be fooling ourselves if we pretended that the Government or the ESB should absorb this increase and it would never reach the pockets of the consumer and tax-payer.</P>
    <P>The ESB applied for a price increase in the form of a fuel charge to be put on each bill on the understanding that when oil dropped in price this fuel charge would come down, and, if oil came back to its old level, it would disappear.  This is optimistic in the extreme.  I do not believe this fuel charge will ever disappear.  We may see a change in the price of oil; it may come down marginally.  In a few years' time as various other sources of energy are exploited and brought into commission, we may have a surplus oil position again.  This may mean the off-loading of oil at cheaper prices, although they will not come back to the level we knew 12 months ago. Even so, I do not think that will come before the late 1980s.</P>
    <P>There is a special cut rate for night storage heaters.  The ESB must have a generating capacity to meet the highest demand for electricity.  This is during the mid-hours of daylight when the factories are working and cooking is being done in houses.  The ESB cannot store electricity.  Therefore, they must have generating capacity to meet this demand.  If they have generating capacity for the peak demand they will have spare capacity during the night.  This is the principle on which the Turlough Hill station is operated.  When electricity is not used during the night by the consumer it is used to pump water to the reservoir and this is used to generate electricity at the peak time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> Another method of using spare capacity, thus taking the pressure from the peak demand period, was to encourage people to use electricity at night-time by way of storage heaters and the ESB offered the electricity at the basic cost of production.  When the fuel surcharge was introduced early in the year that price could not be reduced.  The only addition was the extra charge on the oil.  That amount was added in equal proportions because the cost for the oil used at night-time was the same as that used during the peak demand.  The cost of night storage oil is still considerably lower than the cost of oil used during the day but it is regrettable that the relationship between the two cannot be maintained.  Prior to the fuel crisis, the price of electricity was at basic cost.  If it is reduced people using electricity during the day time will be asked to subsidise those who use electricity at night-time and I do not think Deputies would consider that equitable.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies pointed out that the snag about the accounting system of the ESB was that people found it difficult to get together the money for the two-monthly bill.  The ESB will accept monthly payments and they will send out monthly bills.  The savings stamp scheme introduced by the ESB was not too successful in the beginning but I think this is changing and it is considered much more attractive now.  If people can estimate their weekly or monthly requirements they can buy stamps in the ESB office which will go towards the bill.  This scheme should prove attractive to people who do not wish to have to pay a two-monthly bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy in a supplementary question to me today referred to two housing estates that were electrically centrally heated and there was mention also of an estate at Corrib Park, Galway.  The ESB have said that in many houses heated by electricity the system is not being used in the most economical way.  They are willing to send an engineer or a qualified person to show the householder how the system should be used and also an <Col N="264" /> accountant to explain the bill to him. If the heating system is set at a high temperature, is left on day and night, and if windows are left open, it will be an extremely expensive form of heating but its use can be conserved and if people use the system intelligently they will have a satisfactory form of heating and at a price no more expensive than that charged for other forms of heating.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe was incorrect in a point he made yesterday when he said this country was more dependent on oil than any other country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I said we were fortunate we were less dependent on oil than many other European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, although we are more dependent than Britain which is only 40 per cent dependent on oil.  Deputy Brugha asked a number of questions and I should like to answer them.  He referred to the Fletcher Report on the ESB.  That report had a high opinion of the standards of the ESB and they approved 100 per cent of the planning generally.  The Deputy asked the comparable cost factors with other electricity undertakings.  It is virtually impossible to make this comparison; one would want to get an undertaking of the same size, with the same spread and the same composition of generating factors.  We believe that electricity in Ireland is cheaper than practically every country in Europe&mdash;possibly with the exception of the United Kingdom where they pay a subsidy. Apart from that subsidy and taking cost for cost, we believe that electricity in Ireland is cheap by European standards; however, we cannot prove this because comparison is practically impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brugha asked about the co-ordination of planning with other energy suppliers.  From the domestic point of view the other energy supplier is what is known as town gas and the number of places where this is available is limited.  There is co-operation between the Dublin Gas Company and the ESB although this is of a limited nature because the ESB <Col N="265" /> must supply the current and the gas company are not in that position.  I should like to see more co-operation between the two undertakings because if the position ever arises&mdash;probably it is many years ahead&mdash;where we could pump natural gas through the gas undertakings in the country it would be desirable to have as many as possible of domestic appliances in Dublin in particular connected with gas.  This would lessen our dependence on imported oil, which is the overall policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha asked about the borrowings abroad by the ESB to date.  On 31st March, 1974, the sum involved was £34 million and this represents about 16 per cent of the total debt still outstanding.  The Deputy wanted to review the costs of Turlough Hill.  I have here some figures of comparison between old and new stations and the difference in costs.  Last year at the Marina the cost of a unit of electricity was .289p per unit as against Poolbeg which was .174p per unit.  Since the oil crisis the Marina has increased to .9p per unit produced, and Poolbeg is .6p. The cost of producing at Poolbeg is only two-thirds the cost of producing at the Marina.</P>
    <P>Somebody made the point&mdash; Deputy Fitzpatrick or Deputy Dowling; I am not sure which&mdash; about the check of wiring in houses. In fact the ESB have no power to do this.  They inspect new installations merely as part of their service.  There is a body called the Electro Technical Committee of Ireland operating under the aegis of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, which is pressing for legislation which will give them power to arrange for such inspections and certification of installations. Again, whoever it was made this point yesterday pointed out also that much of the wiring in Ireland is fairly old, and that it would be desirable to have it checked.</P>
    <P>I hope I have answered each point made.  There are just two points raised by Deputy Dowling to which I should have replied.  He made a long argument about the rights of workers as compared with the Chairman of the ESB and the section in <Col N="266" /> the Bill which he said was there to suit the Chairman of the Board or some such purpose.  In fact, this section is there to give the Chairman of the ESB the same rights as the employees. Up to now he was discriminated against and this section merely gives him the same rights as the employees of the ESB.</P>
    <P>The other point he made was in regard to the necessity for removing VAT from electricity bills.  That argument rings hollow to me because Deputy Dowling was in this House in 1963 when Turnover Tax was introduced and he walked through the Lobby in support of Turnover Tax being placed on ESB bills; again, in 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967: in 1969 when the Turnover Tax was doubled, he walked through the Lobbies again to have it placed on ESB bills.  When VAT was introduced here the year before last, he again supported its being placed on ESB bills.  To come in here 11 years later and say it should be removed may be a good political thing to be saying from that side of the House but it does not carry any weight with me or in my view uphold the sincerity of Deputy Dowling.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by thanking the House for the amount of attention it has given to this small Bill, inasmuch as it is short, but it contains a lot of money.  I appreciate the words of praise for the ESB and I am sure they will also.  I am glad the House has seen fit to give them power to borrow this extra money to invest in the future of our country because we cannot have a future in this country without an adequate source of energy.</P>

      <P>I thought I had covered that when I spoke about the cost of oil.  It is my assessment only of what will be the future of the oil market.  I said I thought there would be a slight slackening of oil prices which will reflect itself later on in the year, in ESB bills.  But it will be minimal only and will not make any tremendous difference.  I thought that if there was to be a breakthrough in the cost of oil&mdash;if there were to be a surplus in oil world markets&mdash;it would not come for, say three, four, five or, maybe, 10 years.  In fact, I said it would never again go back to last year's price but&mdash;if the world went into surplus situation in the oil markets&mdash;it might be that it would drop reasonably significantly at that stage but not in the near future.</P>

      <P>Might I ask a question in relation to the cost of electrical central heating in comparision with other forms of central heating?  The Minister has said, in his reply, that he is satisfied that electrical central heating compares favourably with others.  Is this as a result of the ESB <Col N="268" /> telling him that or has an independent survey been conducted for him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it has not.  What I said was that if it is used in a proper way&mdash;and advice can be got from the ESB as to how this should be done&mdash;then it compares favourably with other forms of heating.  But it can be wasteful if people leave radiators on continuously and leave windows open&mdash;of course, that applies to any form of central heating&mdash;but I think more so to electricity than to oil or gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am under the impression that electric central heating is more expensive than other types of central heating used at the same level of conservation.  This is why I asked the question if an independent survey could be conducted to establish which is the most economical form of heating. From the point of view of the public it is important and they should know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be impossible to get two exactly similar households unless one insulated them in the same way; had the same number of people living in them, having the same habits; one could not have an independent survey in that sense. Up to the time of the oil crisis, I think it was generally recognised that electric central heating was cheaper to instal and marginally dearer to run; that seemed to be everybody's opinion. The cost can be kept at a minimum if people lower their house temperatures; if they ensure that their installations are correct; if they accept the advice of the ESB&mdash;I would stress again that the ESB are willing to give that advice if people would only contact them.  In one area just outside Dublin where they offered this advice they were disappointed that a very small percentage of householders only came to them.  But that advice is available and I would ask people to make a point of seeking it for their own sakes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the Minister made reference to a point I raised when I was speaking here yesterday in regard to the ESB going into trading in electrical equipment.  Do they make a profit on that?  Is the profit used to bring down the costs otherwise?  Does the Minister consider that the ESB are justified in competing with the private sector in this field?  I am not raising this matter to be facetious but it is one of great concern to many people.</P>

      <P>I understand that they did when the company was set up originally; they have grown tremendously since then.  But now, when other electrical traders have entered the market, they are holding steady and making a profit of about 5 per cent which, of course, goes to the common pool and towards keeping the cost of electricity down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that 5 per cent is a very small profit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that the ESB standard is much higher as regards service than other traders.  This is the reason why the profit is so small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the moot point in the whole question of the ESB trading.  They are supposed to be a non-profit making concern.  If they were able to keep the market, by their competition, down to the minimum one might say they were justifying their existence in trading as against the private sector but it does not seem to happen that way.  My knowledge is that private enterprise in the retail business of electrical goods is more than able to compete with the ESB and make a better profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that private enterprise are more than able to compete with the ESB and good luck to them.  I think the ESB need competition in this regard.  This is not an area where, like the generating of electricity they have or should have a monopoly.  I agree that the more competition they have in the retail and service end of it much the better for them.  Perhaps I would like to see the day coming when they might get out of the retailing altogether if there was a sufficient number of electrical contractors in competition with one another who would have the effect of keeping down the retail price of electrical appliances.  I would like to see that day coming but I do not think it will come for a number of years.</P>

    <Title>Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1974: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Col N="271" />
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to make provision for further grants to Córas Tráchtála to enable them to continue the work of promoting, assisting and developing exports.</P>
      <P>When Córas Tráchtála was first set up, under the Export Promotion Act, 1959, the amount which could be made available to it out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas was limited to £1 million.  This statutory limit was raised by subsequent Export Promotion Acts, the most recent of which, in 1971, raised it to £15 million.</P>
      <P>The increasing pace of export promotion activities, involving necessary expansion of Córas Tráchtála's aids and services, both in volume and scope, has naturally increased the board's rate of expenditure.  Payments to the board by way of grant-in-aid up to 31st March of this year amounted to £13,800,885, which leaves a balance of £1,199,115 unissued from the existing limit of £15 million.  This balance is not sufficient to meet the board's financial requirements up to the end of the present financial year, which amount to £1,755,000.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to raise to £25 million the limit of the amount of grants which may be made to Córas Tráchtála.  The actual grant-in-aid provision to be made in each financial year out of this amount will, of course, be included in the Vote for my Department which will come before the Dáil in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is already aware of the role played by Córas Tráchtála in the expansion of exports, particularly industrial exports.  The aids and services which it provides for exporters covers a wide range, from information, advice and basic market research to specialist services in the fields of market research, design management and so forth, and from incentive grants for individual exporters visiting <Col N="272" /> overseas markets to the organisation of national stands at international trade fairs.  These services are kept under constant review to ensure that at any given time the services most urgently needed by the exporters are provided in the manner and in the measure which would be most useful so as to make the best use of the funds available to Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála now have 15 overseas offices&mdash;in Britain, USA, Canada, Australia, Lebanon, France, Austria, Germany, USSR, Belgium, Italy and Japan.  Plans are advanced for a further office in Copenhagen.  There is, in addition, constant liaison between Córas Tráchtála and overseas Irish diplomatic missions, who co-operate in the collection of information and the establishment of market contacts for exporters.  As might be expected, Córas Tráchtála were fully alert to the implications of EEC entry for Irish exporters.  Through their Brussels office they maintain close touch with EEC developments, and are well equipped to furnish exporters with expert advice and market intelligence in this sector.</P>
    <P>The expansion and improvement of the board's services to exporters inevitably results in increased expenditure; furthermore, the cost of providing existing and new services is subject to the same inflationary pressure as other costs.  It is essential, however, in the interests of the continued expansion of exports, that Córas Tráchtála have adequate funds at their disposal to provide the services which are greatly valued by exporters. In 1973 some 780 firms availed of them; as markets are diversified there will be greater demands on these services. The increasing demand by exporters on the board's services has been matched by a significant growth in exports.  The amount of Córas Tráchtála's grant-in-aid in 1960 was £266,000.  The current grant-in-aid is £2.34 million, an increase of approximately £2 million, but in the same period total exports increased by £720 million.  I do not, of course, assert that Córas Tráchtála are solely responsible for this growth, but I have no doubt they played an important <Col N="273" /> part in it, particularly in the increase in industrial exports.</P>
    <P>It is with confidence, therefore, that I recommend the increase by an additional £10 million of the statutory limit on the funds which may be allocated to Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the additional provision for Córas Tráchtála in keeping with the normal expansion.  Inflationary trends have made their problems much more severe.  The CTT is one of the services which Irish industry appreciates and if one finds criticism from some sections of industry it is due to the fact that they have not availed of the services to the extent which they might have.  CTT have grown beyond what they were originally set up to do.  I remember when CTT were instituted it was visualised that they would be an advisory service, particularly a market research service. Such a service is most important, particularly for the small industries. These industries which require advice on marketing and wish to have market research carried out but have not the capital to carry out such research are the ones which most value the services of the CTT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a great many organisations dealing with industry here.  That is only to be expected because if we are to reach full employment and improve the standard of living we must export.  Our home market is only fractional in so far as industrial development is concerned.  We must export the major portion of what we produce and if we can go on exporting more, as we have been doing, particularly in the last ten years, then there is a hope that we will one day reach that very much sought after goal of full employment.  In regard to the IDA, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Council of Industrial Design and the Committee on Industrial Progress I hope the work of all those bodies is co-ordinated and that they are not overlapping.  They are all for the benefit of the industrial manufacturer in the main.  I am not for a moment inferring that there is <Col N="274" /> any unnecessary duplication.  All those bodies are very necessary and as our industry continues to expand they will become more and more indispensable.</P>
    <P>The ten years from 1962 to 1972 were the most interesting in the industrial development of this country since 1932 when we first got industry going with the aid of tariffs.  Those who have taken part in the industrial drive&mdash;what will be described as the industrial revolution in future years&mdash; look back with pride on the tenacity of those who with the use of Irish capital, granted with the protection of tariff walls, which in some cases absolutely prohibited the importation of goods that would rival home-produced products, established Irish industry.  A tribute must also be paid to the Irish public who tolerated the situation and were aware at times that they were paying more for goods produced at home than they would pay for goods if they were freely imported.</P>
    <P>This situation provided an opportunity for Irish industry to establish a base from which to develop.  Industry used that opportunity and has come to the stage where it is virtually facing free competition.  Yesterday or the day before the tariff on goods coming from the Six Counties disappeared completely.  In another year the tariff on goods from the UK will disappear and indeed we will see our tariff, in the case of most countries, gone by 1976 or 1977.  Indeed, before that time the tariff will be so low, with the annual reduction which we have accepted, that it will hardly be noticeable.  The EEC are negotiating a reduction of tariffs with non-member countries, associate members, and even with the less developed states.  Irish industry today is on the threshold of free trade and open competition. The necessary protection that was afforded by tariffs in the past is now history.  Industry must look forward to the time when it is on its own.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that organisations such as Coras Tráchtála, the IDA, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Institute of <Col N="275" /> Industrial Research and Standards and the Council on Industrial Design have a most important part to play. I am sure they are well aware of the important part they have to play if we are to maintain our competitiveness and get our goods into the markets where they are well established in many cases now and continue to have the same rate of expansion as we have experienced in recent years.</P>
    <P>The value of our exports in 1972 was the highest ever.  The volume of our exports was also very high.  I think there was a six per cent increase in that year.  Granted, agricultural prices played an important role but manufactured goods rose and accounted for a greater share of our total exports.  They must be now verging on 50 per cent.  At that stage I think they had reached 44 per cent.  The 1972 Córas Tráchtála Report, and I think that is the latest one that is available, outlined a dramatic increase in exports from 1962 to 1972.  It is a concise but very illuminating account of the activities of Córas Tráchtála since their establishment under the 1959 Act.</P>
    <P>The years ahead will be a challenging time for Irish industry.  The fluctuation of the unit of currency on foreign markets has at times been helpful and at times not helpful.  This is where Córas Tráchtála can anticipate, if it is possible to do so, and advise in relation to coming events. There are at the moment good and bad signs on the horizon so far as Irish exports are concerned.  One bright spot in our economy that is still showing signs of standing out in a difficult time, when inflation is engulfing everything and rendering the money in our pockets worthless, is that our exports continue to rise.  I hope that will be maintained because our exports have a fairly solid base and the ability to export is not something that is generated overnight.  It must be deeply rooted in the past, well established and organised and well-founded. Some of the good signs on the horizon are that certain commodities are tending to fall in price on the import market.  While most of <Col N="276" /> them are not in the engineering or heavy goods class they are signs in the right direction and some of the bigger merchants and builders' suppliers inform me that they expect timber prices which have reached an all time high to show signs of easing. The bad signs are that the consumer in some of the markets where we sell is showing signs of dithering.  This could be bad.  So long as the purchasing power of foreign markets remains buoyant there remains hope that our expansion of exports over the last ten years will continue in the years ahead.  These are only temporary setbacks which industry has got to face from time to time.  It is a testing time for them.  The industries which depend on cash flow could find it very difficult to carry on.  If there is a weak period in relation to exports they might not be able to continue.  Those who are well established and have a reasonable liquidity may be able to ride the storm but those who are dependent on a cash flow and the buoyancy of their business from day to day, could fade out.</P>
    <P>Organisations like CTT have a very important role to play in foreseeing the likelihood of depression or a recession in consumer purchasing in any of the markets where we are selling our goods.  I admit that forecasting is the most difficult part of industry either at home or abroad.  All the experts can tell us what happened after something goes wrong.  We have become accustomed to forecasts which are not borne out.  I remember when I was Minister at a Cabinet meeting we prepared to pay a subsidy on beef if the price dropped below a certain figure.  Our advisers told us that the price of one cwt of beef would drop well below a particular figure.  The Cabinet decided it could not go below that figure and they would subsidise. it.  We never had to pay that subsidy. Despite the advice from our experts the price continued to rise and before two years the price was almost double that quoted at that particular time.  I am merely saying that to show how difficult it is to forecast.</P>
    <P>In the Department of Labour we had <Col N="277" /> an expert, a professor whose duty it was to advise on economic trends and he was the first to admit that it was almost impossible to forecast with any accuracy.  One could only read the economic trends as one saw them, make one's computations based on the signals but they seldom worked out as forecast.  CTT now have offices in many countries of the world.  I notice an office in Copenhagen is to be opened in the near future.  They have offices outside Dublin in London Manchester, Brussels, Dusseldorf, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Beirut and some other places mentioned by the Minister in his brief.</P>
    <P>These contacts in those far flung capitals of the world should enable CTT to have their finger on the pulse of the economic sensitivity in the markets of the countries to which we are exporting.  I think our tentacles, with the co-operation which I hope we have from diplomatic circles, should be sufficiently spread so that future markets can be reported back.  This would enable many firms to diversify, to produce what is required and to produce a cheaper product or perhaps a more expensive product.</P>
    <P>One has only the opportunity at a time like this to pay tribute to the various organisations that are working for the benefit of industry in this country.  Somebody said:&ldquo;We export or die&rdquo;.  That was said many years ago but it is as true today as ever it was.  We are a small community and we are trying to bring back some of our people scattered all over the world who had to go abroad to find employment. In recent years we have shown signs of a growth in population and lower emigration figures.  I believe we have come in on the verge of a completely new Ireland in relation to standards, employment and in relation to our whole economic set-up.  This has been happening during the last 10 years.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope in the inflationary world in which we now live, that nothing will occur to set us back on the road of progress in the one field where real progress has been recorded, the expansion of exports.  I do not want to delay the House by going into <Col N="278" /> the question of domestic inflation.  We are not always ready to admit that wage demands that are not justified by improved output are the biggest contribution to domestic inflation and the greatest hazard industry has to face.  When one says that openly one is accused of keeping down the working man.  If demands for improved incomes are kept in line with productivity and increased output and do not reach out for more than what the increase in the cost of living index justifies, then what the workers get is real money.  When it goes beyond that it becomes inflationary and generates demand in the spiral of inflation.</P>
    <P>The unions have a duty in this regard.  We have been talking for a long time about worker participation. There is great good in that if the workers participate in whatever level workers' democracy calls for participation in.  If it calls for a better understanding by the workers of the problems of industrialists and producers and what real demands should be and the extension to which they can be measured in real money, then the sooner we have workers' democracy the better.  If it creates that education and that knowledge of the problems involved in industrial production, the problems of inflation and the question of real profits, as compared with inflated profits, which when brought down to the nett can be very small indeed, and bring about that high standard it will have reached a new high level and, perhaps, have developed a sense of equilibrium as regards the two partners in industry, the employer and the employee.</P>
    <P>That, perhaps, might seem to be getting away from the purpose of this little Bill, but it is quite relevant, to my mind, in so far as in this Bill we are providing more money for one of the organisations that is doing a lot for exports, market research and information, and in the encouragement generally of industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the opening of an office in Brussels.  The last time I was over there, many people paid tribute to Mr. Byrne who was in charge and I think still is.  The <Col N="279" /> amount of work which that office can do in the matter of keeping industry abreast of developments in the EEC would in itself justify the extra money we are providing for them here tonight.  Again it is understandable that the improvement one would expect to take place in exports and in industrial development as a whole is affected by inflation, and it is only natural that more money should be provided for one of the most useful and helpful industrial organisations we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little bit confused by one of the statements in the Minister's Second Reading speech.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister tell me when he is replying if the amount of £50 million which was allotted to Córas Tráchtála by way of grant-in-aid in 1971 is a cumulative figure or does it go on year after year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>May be the Minister would also tell me why this figure has been increased by £10 million, and then another and so on.  This is a little bit confusing to me.  Why the <Col N="280" /> cumulative figure?  Why not budget for each year.  Maybe the Minister would explain that when he is replying. I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the people in Córas Tráchtála on the first-class job they do.  Many people in this country who are not engaged in industry or in top management in industry are probably unaware of the value of the work of this board and also of the high quality of the personnel whom they employ.  I have met some of the executives from time to time and have never failed to be impressed by the high standards. In order to maintain this high standard and to ensure continuity, the pay of these people should be such as will attract this kind of person to the service of Córas Tráchtála.</P>
