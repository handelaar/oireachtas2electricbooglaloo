      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Taoiseach if in view of the speculation in yesterday's newspapers that there would be an early budget and information to the effect that the Taoiseach may have told members of ICTU and the Federated Union of Employers that we would have an early budget, can the Taoiseach make any comment?</P>

      <P>May I ask one other question, not arising on this?  Some couple of weeks ago I raised a question about official publications reaching Deputies in good time.  In particular I referred to the Prices Commission's monthly report.  At that time the Minister for Industry and Commerce assured me that Deputies would have that report in their possession simultaneously with the news media.  Again this morning an account appears in the news media of the contents <Col N="1280" /> of that report but no Deputy has received a copy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I was speaking on developments in prisons. I am glad to see that renovations and the provision of new prisons are proceeding at a rapid rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 15th November, 1972 the present Minister for Justice asked Deputy Desmond O'Malley, the then Minister for Justice, whether he intended to implement the recommendations of the report of the Committee <Col N="1281" /> on Court Practice and Procedure regarding the extension of on-the-spot fines and, if so, when.  According to the Minister's speech on this Estimate many of those recommendations are before him and legislation will be prepared in due course.  Perhaps the Minister will say whether there are certain specific recommendations which he can introduce such as on-the-spot fines.  Perhaps he feels he does not want to introduce reforms in a haphazard manner but this is something which is of interest to us.</P>
    <P>Last week I spoke for about 1¼ hours and I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House. I referred to the need for certain types of cases to be heard <i>in camera</i> if that was possible.  I cited the example of unfortunate persons who could not pay their rates, did not qualify for a waiver and lived in terror of being brought before the court.  There must be hundreds of similar types of cases, for example, maintenance orders. Family cases should be heard in chambers out of the public eye.  I would be very interested to hear the Minister's comments on this.  It is very important and something we may have tended to overlook.  There are cases of deserted wives who will not take action against their husbands simply because they would feel disgraced going before a court.  If such cases could be heard <i>in camera</i> I believe that greater justice would be seen to be done.  I hope the Minister will look into this.  Something that disturbs me very much at present is the number of people who are having nightmares about how they are to pay their rates.  When it is suggested to such people: &ldquo;If you have not got the money you cannot pay and if you go to court the judge cannot make you pay what you have not got; the day of taking people's furniture out of their houses if they do not have the financial resources to pay their rates is gone; people do not do that any more&rdquo; they still have this terrible terror of going before a public court. There is a tremendous need to move fairly quickly to have certain cases of that nature dealt with.  They are not criminal cases in my view and should not be regarded as such.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> The final point I want to make is in relation to the appointment of a public prosecutor which was referred to.  I do not know how soon this legislation will come before the House but one of the things I would ask the Minister to bear in mind is that the appointment of the public prosecutor should be seen to be an impartial one.  This man should be appointed by the Civil Service Commission and should be a senior counsel with at least five years experience at the Bar in that capacity.  If, as the Minister has already stated, the intention is to remove the patronage, as it were, from the appointment of barristers, then the best way for this to be seen to be done in a fair manner would be for the Civil Service Commission to appoint the man after an interview.  I reiterate that point&mdash;that it should be a senior counsel with at least five years experience.  I cannot speak for my party&mdash;I am not the spokesman on Justice&mdash;but I believe that that would probably go a long way towards satisfying anyone's fears that this was going to be a political appointment and particularly if&mdash;as I have heard it said&mdash;this was going to be a life appointment, that would at least help to allay any concern.</P>
    <P>I should like to finish, as I began, by congratulating the Minister on his excellent brief.  It was extremely helpful and useful and it did show the extensive range of his Department's activities.  I was pleased because he dealt extensively in it with a field that is very near and dear to me, that is, the field of youth work and the added interest which has been taken in it by the Department over the last few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Begley) Michael Begley">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Begley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House very long.  First of all, I should like to compliment the Minister on the wonderful brief he put before us.  He dealt in detail with many aspects of his Department's work and the contribution I shall make is in relation to a few matters which could be corrected at the moment by the Department of Justice.  There are certain things happening <Col N="1283" /> in this country at the moment about which I am very unhappy.  The first thing I would mention are these house detectives or whatever they may be called, in the supermarkets.  I think these house detectives have adopted their own bully boys.  I know from personal experience that there have been cases of unfortunate mothers who happened to run out of the shop because their child had run out and they could not watch him or her while they selected something from the shelf.  The next thing was they were hauled in before these super-detectives and intimidated for long periods.</P>
      <P>At the moment, in every Garda station, the Department of Justice&mdash; and rightly so&mdash;have a notice on the wall explaining to persons about to be charged that they have certain rights.  The Minister should go a step further and put a notice with regard to this question of rights in every supermarket and in every store where you have these house or super-crime detectives, where these unfortunate&mdash; and, perhaps, in 85 per cent of the cases, innocent&mdash;people are hauled up before them.  It is unfortunate at the moment that some of these people are hauled in&mdash;and I know some of those people who were quite innocent; who came from very respectable families &mdash;just because they are unable to look after a child for five or ten minutes when they are taking something from the shelf.  The fact that the child runs out of the shop means that the parent has to run out after it.  In a case like this there is a lack of common sense being shown in these stores at the moment.  I have no intention of naming these stores in the House; I do not think it would be fair to them.  But the very fact that I mention it should give notice to the directors of these companies that there is general public concern, in all cities and large towns about the way these super-bully boys, these house detectives, are operating. I would again ask the Minister if it is not possible for him to insist that the rights of a person be displayed in the office where the unfortunate, or innocent, person is sometimes hauled before these super-detectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> There is a second point I should like to make to the Minister.  We have new squad cars on the road.  I am sure these are there primarily for the control of traffic, for detecting faults in cars and for law breakers. However, I think some of these gardaí are over-zealous in the course of their duties.  It is ridiculous in this day and age to be hauling an unfortunate farmer or a commercial traveller before the courts just because there may be a tiny bit of mud on his number plate.  For an innocent person, who has been a law-abiding citizen all his life but who, for some reason or other, did not see the piece of mud on his number plate, to be hauled into court, to have to employ a solicitor, to have his name in the paper&mdash;that Johnny Moriarty from some part of Ireland had an obscured number plate&mdash;is ridiculous.  Some of these over-zealous gardaí should take a dose of cop-on tablets.</P>
    <P>There is another case where in the course of a journey and unknown to the motorist the rear light or the number plate light may blow.  The next thing that happens is that that man is hauled before the courts just because the light was not working.  I would put it to the Minister, as a layman&mdash;not a solicitor's point of view&mdash; that the way to get over this particular difficulty would be to adopt the method used in another instance; for example, if a person has not his tax or insurance when he is pulled up by gardaí he gets a fortnight or ten days to appear at the local Garda station with his tax and insurance and, when he does so, there is no prosecution.  I would urge the Minister to have the same method adopted with an unfortunate man, or woman, who is caught with a dirty number plate or a brake light missing&mdash;that if they took their car to the Garda station within the following week or ten days with those faults corrected there should be no prosecution.  There is a tremendous amount of goodwill for the Garda Síochána but, if we want to build up that goodwill further, I do not think these petty little summonses help. Perhaps the Minister will think that this lay point of view is not 100 per <Col N="1285" /> cent but I think it would be a very easy way out of it.</P>
    <P>The third point I should like to make is with regard to the question of Garda patrols in tourist resorts in the summer season where there is a vast influx of visitors.  Unfortunately, the resorts would be better off without some of those visitors.  But, I suppose, in every walk of life the crowd follows the crowd and there are bound to be a few bad pennies in every crowd. But, during the tourist season, the Minister should have some contingency plan to ensure that there would be extra gardaí on patrol duty, not driving around in squad cars, but on foot patrol duty in these resorts.  An awful lot of malicious damage is done in the dark of night by these undesirable people who roam the different resorts in bands, who intimidate and sometimes assault people grievously without reason.  I am sure the Minister knows what I am talking about; probably he has received complaints from other Deputies in this regard.  But I should be very glad if he could, in the summer season, see his way to putting extra gardaí on foot patrol in the tourist resorts.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to rural stations.  In Dingle the station closes at 6 o'clock at night.  We are 31 miles from Tralee.  Ballyferriter is 12 miles further back, 43 miles from Tralee. There is no telephone service in the Garda station at night.  That is a retrograde step so far as the policing of the area is concerned.  It should be possible to get in touch with the police at any time day or night, especially in the peninsula of west Kerry.  I do not know if the same situation applies in the rest of the country because I am not an authority on the subject.</P>
    <P>If a person wants to send a message to the Garda station after 6 p.m., he must ring the post office.  The post office people will get a member of their family to go to the local sergeant and tell him that he is required. In this day and age that is not good enough.  A place like Dingle appears to be ripe for crime.  All a criminal would need are gloves, pliers and a torch.  He could do what he liked because <Col N="1286" /> it would be impossible to get in touch with the gardaí for hours.  The Minister is not responsible for this situation.  Whoever brought in this streamlining of Garda stations did not know his onions so far as west Kerry is concerned.  The people of west Kerry are law-abiding but it is possible, especially in the summer months, that potential criminals could be roaming the county.  As there is no way of contacting the Garda station, the area is wide open for them.</P>
    <P>There is undue delay in the mapping section of the Department of Justice.  People have been waiting five or six months for maps.  Can the Minister do anything about that?  I am sure that every Deputy here gets letters from solicitors or constituents almost every day asking him to expedite the issuing of the maps.  Perhaps the Minister in his wisdom will do something about the staffing of that section in order to make it more efficient.  I do not know how long the waiting list in that office is, but I am sure the people there are doing their best.  It is unfortunate that Deputies have to deal with such queries.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity of expressing my views on these points.  I hope the Minister will take notice of them.  Policing an area is a matter of concern to all law-abiding citizens.  In my area we are worried, as I have said, because it is impossible to contact the Garda during the night.  This situation has gone on too long.  I hope the Minister will give me a clear statement on it in his reply.  A night telephone should be connected to the station and to the homes of the superintendent or sergeant so that they can be contacted immediately, even when they are off duty.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his report.  It is refreshing to note that, as Minister for Justice, he went to the trouble of visiting all the prisons in order to obtain first-hand knowledge of what is happening.  We have read from time to time that all is not well in our prisons.  It is enlightening to hear that the Minister took his courage in his hands and went there and met <Col N="1287" /> prison officers, governors and prisoners. That is a step in the right direction.  I am pleased that he plans educational facilities for these prisoners.  So far as his remarks on children are concerned, we should spend some time considering them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take steps to ensure that lawabiding citizens will not be intimidated when shopping in supermarkets and large stores.  Approximately 85 per cent of people accused of shoplifting are innocent. Steps should be taken to ensure that the notice on the rights of the individual which appears in Garda stations will be displayed in a prominent position on the walls of these supermarkets. I am deliberately labouring this point because some of my best friends have been hauled in and accused wrongly by a nonentity of a store detective.  This detective apologised after three hours when the Garda refused to prosecute.  This type of intimidation must be stopped.  The Minister should do something about it. It can be said that these people are within their rights to summon the detective for wrongful arrest.  These people are mainly women.  Some of them are in the age group of 60 to 70 years.  They have no intention of going into court because it would cause undue stress in the family.  I know of a case where an innocent person, subjected to such treatment, has lost her nerve.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very active since he took office ten months ago. When he completes his term of office, our prisons will be reformed and, we hope, educational facilities for prisoners will be vastly improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of wishing the Minister well in the frightful task which lies before him. Anybody who believes in democracy will give him all the help possible so that he can protect the weaker sections from the stronger and more violent sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has covered very good points in his brief.  There are certain aspects of the record for the last year with which I am not very happy.  The <Col N="1288" /> Government propose to appoint a Director of Public Prosecutions and come to the aid of FLAC&mdash;the Free Legal Advice Centre.  These people are doing such wonderful work that they deserve all the help we can give them. I hope that the grant which is being given to them will be sufficient not alone to maintain their present service but to expand it.</P>
    <P>An incident which worried me a great deal took place two months ago. Before going into detail on this I should like to state that we always thought that justice must not alone be done but be seen to be done.  The incident I wish to refer to occurred in County Donegal.  A number of men were arrested there and it was specifically stated by several people that they were arrested so as to create a good impression to help a certain politician in the North.  With the exception of one man all those arrested were released the following day, something which suggests that in this exercise there was a grain of truth in the allegation that we were not so much seeking to apprehend wrongdoors but that we were trying to safeguard a politician in the North from the wrath of his own party.</P>
    <P>Every politician in the democratic world has trouble within his ranks at some time but one could imagine what would happen if we were to continue this sort of practice.  It would be a terrible situation if in order to save somebody in public life a guard would act in this way and arrest people not as an exercise in justice but as an exercise in politicking.  The guards were being used, therefore, not for the sake of justice but for some queer cynical and political exercise. It reminded me too much of George Orwell's book, <i>1984,</i> where he predicts that &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; will arrive by that time.  Big Brother, being the State, will decide that anything goes if we are going to perpetuate the Establishment.</P>
    <P>This is wrong and the exercise of arresting these men has driven a lot more people to sympathise with what we call the subversives.  It has also caused us to stop, to think and to <Col N="1289" /> remark that it is possible that all the claims these people are making are not false.  I hate to see our very fine Garda force being used in such an exercise.  The Garda force, since their establishment and down the years, have portrayed an image of efficiency and fair play.  I would hate to see anything happening that would tarnish that reputation.  Very few people today would help to bolster the Establishment if it were to indulge in exercises such as this.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take steps to to ensure that this will not happen again.  If the Garda have suspicions that certain people are engaged in subversive activities the legislation is there to apprehend these people. Fifteen people should not be hauled in merely for the sake of making the path easier for a Northern politician when he faces the wrath of his party. What happened was a cynical exercise and one that should not be repeated no matter what effect it is to have on the North.</P>
    <P>Police forces, indeed, the whole form of Government, are under attack not alone in Ireland but all over the world because our society has changed so much.  It is a strange fact that the more affluent we become the more dissident we become.  As we get wealthier the crime rate gets bigger. The Minister's figures in relation to crime are alarming.  He told us that while the figures rose last year over the previous year they were not as high as in previous years.  The Minister suggested that because the detection rate in London is lower than ours we should not become complacent.  It should be remembered that London has a population of almost ten million people and that the society there is almost completely materialistic. Therefore, without adopting a holier than thou attitude, I suggest there is no comparison between London and our State.  We have only one-third of the population of London in this State and, generally, our people think differently from those residing in London.  Therefore, we must be alarmed by the crime rate.</P>
    <P>I am not referring to the individual who is apprehended for stealing an <Col N="1290" /> apple or a packet of cigarettes but there are people in the city who are making money out of crime.  Very often these people are not apprehended. When people are being sentenced for crimes we should take into account their background.  It sometimes happens that society has offended against such people by the very fact that society did not give them a chance.  I am not suggesting that all law breakers come from one section of our society.  We occasionally have the big-time operator, who has, perhaps, defrauded his wealthy company and has had all the advantages that society can offer, breaking the law.  The fact is that as human beings we err occasionally and come into contact with the law and are punished accordingly.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the work of the Garda crime squad and the methods they use in detecting crime.  These men must work in ways which cannot be publicised.  However, I wonder if we have sufficient gardaí in this city which will soon have one million people so that we can meet the challenges which our society will face in a short time.  If we continue to accept that the anglo-American society, and its standards, are correct we must face the fact that the crime rate there results from the fact that the old laws have been overthrown.  The new morality, that might is right or that money can buy anything, will give us a legacy of crime which will continue to increase.  People who cry for more liberty in every aspect of their life must face the fact that they will have the problems which English and American societies have.</P>
    <P>The great crime rates in the world are in the developed societies.  We have to face the fact as we change our laois and as we try to ape the Americans we are going to have a crime rate as great as theirs in proportion to their population.  Some future Minister will point out that respect for the law is dying out and people are not co-operating with the police force.  In England there is a complete reversal of what used to be the solid English character whereby people always co-operated with the <Col N="1291" /> local constable.  Because of this change they have a crime rate in England which will not improve unless there is a change in the attitude to morality and life in general.</P>
    <P>I have watched the Minister since his appointment, and his attitude in regard to the prison services generally. I accept that he is trying hard to improve the whole prison service.  With Deputy Andrews I visited prisons in the city.  Having read about and seen demonstrations about the allegedly frightful conditions I was pleasantly surprised when I visited St. Patrick's and Mountjoy.  A prisoner in either institution is assured of food, clothing and lodging.  These items are the right of any man but they are guaranteed to a prisoner although he may not thank us for them.  I walked every inch of Mountjoy prison and I saw what is being done.  I met the officials of the prison and I wish to pay tribute to them for the valuable work they are doing.  Having accepted the fact that we must have prisons, an effort is being made to have the highest possible standards.  Mountjoy prison is very old but when I asked a qualified person if he would make changes if he were designing a prison he replied he would make very minor ones.  The radial complex at Mountjoy is thought to be the most suitable.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the educational facilities offered.  I should like to pay trbiute to the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and to the Minister for their work, but we have much to do in this connection. We should ensure that enough money is provided so that young people in particular can be given the best possible educational facilities. We must remember that the vast majority of prisoners have been denied educational opportunity in the free society.  If a person does wrong he must be punished but we should ensure that on his release from prison he is better educated.  Lack of education is at the bottom of many of our ills.  Any money spent on extending the educational facilities in Mountjoy will repay society a thousand-fold, apart from helping the prisoners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> In the last few years our prison service has been the target of subversive elements in our society.  It is easy to see their intention; if they could wreck the prison service this would be the key to bringing about the downfall of a democratic society as we know it.  We must try continally to improve the prison service but I am convinced that it is as good as we can make it at the moment and I am not complacent when I make that remark.  This is known even to the subversive elements who parade around this country as well as elsewhere. The objective of the most violent subversive groups is to bring down the prison service.  If we have not a place in which to put people who break the law it is easy to imagine the type of society in which we would live.</P>
    <P>These subversive groups do not attack the State on financial or social issues but they try to show that the prison service is very bad.  Irish people in particular are concerned, perhaps they are even a little soft, about anyone who loses his liberty and is put in prison.  This may not be a bad trait because it shows we are concerned about our fellow-men.  The Department of Justice must tell the people what they are doing to improve the prison service, especially with regard to educational facilities.  This is a matter of the greatest importance.  We must show that democracy, despite all its drawbacks, is the best system.  Some of the subversive elements may try to import a kind of Marxist doctrine here without mentioning the kind of prisons in the country where the Marxist-Leninist doctrine prevails.  Our prisons are humane but are in need of improvement all the time.</P>
    <P>We do not want to provide bigger prisons; we hope they will never be necessary, but recently certain disturbing things have happened.  The other day a young boy was charged with a dreadful crime against an old person but he could not be sent to a home because there was no place for him.  The boy was very young and with treatment he might have become a good citizen.  None of us was very mature at 15 years.  We <Col N="1293" /> come back to the educational facilities available.  The boy I have mentioned has probably left school; he will probably drift around for a while until eventually he is tried and possibly sent away.  This young person should be examined by a psychiatrist or a doctor who would examine his background.  He should not be allowed to roam the streets and get into more trouble.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the welfare officers, the prison officials and the visiting committees.  The latter group are not paid but they spend a considerable amount of time carrying out their work.  With goodwill we can ensure that our prison service will be second to none.  The reason I place emphasis on the prison service is that last year or the year before there was an attempt by subversive elements to disrupt the service. We all know what happened in the various prisons.  This would have been the <i>coup de grâce</i> to bring down the democratic system, a short cut to anarchy.  It did not succeed and I do not believe it will ever succeed.  At the same time we must ensure that our actions are not spiteful or penal but are taken in the interests both of the people who do not break the law and those who break the law.  We should seek to reform those in prison and ensure that our prison service is second to none.  We must ensure that if people are making money from crime they will be put in prison&mdash; not the poor devil who steals a loaf or a packet of cigarettes.  We must get the &ldquo;bigtimers&rdquo; who make money out of vice.  I should like to pay tribute to the Garda vice squad for the work they are doing in this city.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the appointment of the public prosecutor.  I hope that when he is being appointed the Government will ensure that he is the best man for the job, and that he will not be appointed because of his political affiliations.  We owe it to the country to ensure that legal appointments are not made because of political motivations. I am not suggesting that if a man has strong political affiliations, that should be held against him.  Legal appointments should be made on the basis of ability in legal matters.  We <Col N="1294" /> would sleep more soundly at night if we believed in our hearts and souls that the very best men were being appointed to the jobs, irrespective of political or lack of political affiliations. In some of their appointments the previous Government showed that this was the right practice to adopt.  They set a pattern which I hope the present Government will follow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley, the Parliamentary Secretary, mentioned prosecutions for not having a tail-light on a car and that type of thing.  In Dublin to a great extent the Garda are not so concerned with traffic matters since the traffic wardens were appointed.  If you are driving at night on any of our suburban roads or streets you will find cars parked dangerously at corners. If you tell the owners that they cannot park there they tell you it is after 6 o'clock, whatever that means, as if it were a magical hour after which motorists can do what they like to a great extent.  I am not criticising the Garda on this point.  I know they have a lot of work to do nowadays.</P>
    <P>The traffic wardens are doing a very good job in some cases.  Theirs is not a very popular job.  With the number of cars on our roads increasing by something like 7 per cent per year, we must tackle the traffic problems, particularly in the city.  We will be spending millions of pounds on roads in the next few years.  Many traffic surveys have been carried out.  Perhaps somebody will suddenly discover that our traffic regulations are bad and that they are causing congestion on the roads.  The cry is for new roads.  If we had more thinking on traffic matters we might save a lot of trouble and prevent accidents.  I have never seen a garda chasing a person because he had no tail-light on his car.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which does not come directly under the Department of Justice but which should be examined.  I understand there are many young people driving in the city without insurance because they cannot get insurance at a reasonable rate.  I presume their cars are not taxed either.  This is terribly wrong. One can imagine the trouble caused <Col N="1295" /> to a person who is involved in a serious accident if the car is not insured.  The Minister for Justice in conjunction with the Minister for Industry and Commerce should examine this aspect of car insurance for young people and people who are not so young.</P>
    <P>In this city a 40 per cent loading charge is added.  When I queried this I was told that accidents are more common in Dublin than elsewhere and therefore an extra 40 per cent is charged.  To my mind this is wrong. Accidents may well be more common in Dublin but there are many drivers in the city who never had an accident. They are being deprived of any remission on their policy simply because somebody decided that there are more accidents in Dublin than elsewhere. You might as well say there is more crime in Dublin&mdash;which there probably is&mdash;and therefore we should impose extra tax on Dubliners.  The Minister should inquire into how many cars are being driven in the city without insurance. He should then get in touch with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce to hammer out a proper insurance scheme for young people and for the not-so-young. I am sure the Minister will say he has plenty on his plate without taking on another Minister's job but, strictly speaking, it is his job also. These people are driving without insurance and, therefore, they are breaking the law.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to security men in supermarkets. I have no experience of what he said but I accept that it is true if he says it.  There has been a tremendous growth in security services in the past few years because we could not ensure that the State police force could take on all these jobs and give results.  I am not terribly enamoured of security forces.  In many cases they are doing a dangerous job but I wonder is it not the State's job.  It may be said that we could never have a police force large enough to take on all the jobs.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing is a phenomenon of the 20th century: private <Col N="1296" /> police forces.  With the trouble in the North they have to be employed in certain buildings to prevent people from placing bombs and, perhaps, they have saved some lives.  I have never known them to abuse their position but the Government should examine the whole set-up of peace-keeping forces.  We have the Garda and the Army.  Now we have traffic wardens.  These private security forces should be examined.  I am not condemning them in the least.  They are doing a good job in some ways. We have now accepted the principle that uniformed men can carry out certain duties.  The Government must decide where this is to stop and whether they should set up comprehensive crime prevention units in which these people would have a place.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary talked about people who are accused of shoplifting.  I understand that shoplifting is a very big problem especially in the city.  Again, who should deal with it?  The forces of the State appointed by a democratically-elected Government or some private concern who set out not so much to preserve or protect property as to get a financial dividend?  I have some qualms as to whether we should have a force motivated not with a desire for the common good but as a business enterprise giving a service.  The Government must now examine the spread of these organisations and what their duties actually are, and how they can be absorbed or involved in our own crime prevention organisations.  In every city in the world now you see these men.  They are a product of the 20th century which, at times, seems to be going crazy.  I suppose all through history there have been these phases, although they were not as sophisticated as they are today.  We must ensure that the State will offer the greatest possible protection to all citizens.  Therefore, I would not condemn these private bodies; we should examine the position, see what power they should have, if any, and try to make sure these powers are used for the prevention of crime rather than its detection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> We often hear the cry today: &ldquo;Protect youth&rdquo;.  I wonder if the State is doing all it possibly can to ensure that by the use of our instruments of democracy we are ensuring that our youth is not being perverted by alien influences, deliberately or otherwise. I refer to censorship of books and films.  I know that the film censor has been criticised for allowing some pictures through but one must sympathise with him.  He may ban a picture from being shown in, say, a Dublin cinema but how often when one goes home and switches on television does one see a programme which borders on the erotic?  While the censor can penalise the cinema owner there is no way of keeping out a foreign channel if we wanted to do so.  In future, under the policy of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, when we share the British stations, we shall have an extension of this problem.  The Government cannot stop it unless we ignore democratic procedures.  If somebody wants to watch a foreign channel there is no power to stop him &mdash;I do not suggest we want to stop him.  Therefore, we shall have some of this evil propaganda coming into the privacy of the home.  We certainly would not tolerate the idea of having a police force that would try to watch, as &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; watches, what is on the television screen.</P>
    <P>What can we do?  We can educate our youth to put this imported material in its proper place.  We are one of the oldest of western civilisations and we are not going to succumb to the influence of the material turned out by film and television studios or publishers.  Some time ago we had a shop which was selling erotic reading matter.  I questioned the owner and pointed out that these books which were erotic were beside children's books.  I drew her attention to this and she said: &ldquo;Do not worry; it is all mature men who buy these books,&rdquo; meaning the erotic books.  I wonder how mature they were.  This person for sheer profit was selling these books.  If under the centorship laws I wanted to get these books banned I should have to buy three successive copies of the book and send them to <Col N="1298" /> the censor.  I am told those who make money out of pornography do not issue three successive copies but bring out one publication on which a big amount of money is made.  When that is sold out they do not repeat it but take something else, out of which they make more money.  If somebody had the time and mind to follow up these things and tried to buy three successive copies he could not do so.  The view is, I am told, that if you produce one of these pornographic books that is all right if you do not repeat it but these publishers are producing one book under a certain name and then the next will have a different address and perhaps a different publisher's name and, of course, a different title. They can produce possibly 50 of these in a year and make a great amount of money and do frightful damage to young people.</P>
    <P>I realise the difficulty facing any Minister trying to curb this pornographic penetration.  I suggest, however, that he has some power over the written matter even if he cannot control television.  A television programme may last an hour or so and life changes so rapidly now that one may forget that programme after a week but printed matter is lying around all the time, being passed from hand to hand and is much more dangerous and insidious.  When I see young people in trouble and being taken away when they have done something wrong and &ldquo;disgraced the family&rdquo; I often think that it is not the youngster or his family who should be in the dock but the person who wrote the pornographic matter and influenced the young wrongdoer and made a profit from it.</P>
    <P>The Minister might well look at the censorship laws.  Censorship is regarded, perhaps, as old-fashioned until one realises that we are paying for this attitude in crime and wrongdoing. In this country we still have an opportunity of showing that you can have a good society without pandering to the demands of people who want to have a &ldquo;way-out&rdquo; society.  If it suits them they can always start an agitation and build it up to suggest that some small problem is really a great <Col N="1299" /> problem.  We cannot alter the law to give more of what is called freedom and continue doing this without paying some price.  If we examine other societies we find that they gave in to these demands in the interests of personal liberty and now face terrible problems.  This is so much the case in Britain that they have to introduce legislation to try to curb the growth of crime and vice and pornography.  I am told this measure will be tougher than anything we have had here.  I hope to get a copy of this legislation. If, in sheer desperation, they are trying to remedy some of the ills of their society and correct some of the frightful exploitation of youth by money-mad speculators in pornography, should we not take stock here and see what we can do to try to save young minds, particularly, from this onslaught of vice and crime?  There is no use blaming them or putting them in prison when they commit crime.</P>
    <P>This year the Department of Justice will spend £34 million.  I hope that at least half that sum will go on crime prevention rather than detection. Some of the stress in the North must overflow into the South.  People should realise that that will eventually pass and peace will come to the North and to the South as well.  People on both sides in the North have done wrong. The fact that hundreds of people have been killed shows how terribly wrong they have been.  When the trouble in the North is over I believe we will face in this part of the country as big problems as they have in the North, although they may be on a different scale.  It will get harder and harder for any Government to rule in an equitable and honest way.  Therefore, we have got to examine where our society is going and what we can do to prevent crime.  We must also perfect our means of detecting crime.</P>
    <P>In the most affluent parts of the world today they have to fight crime and they have got to examine why people commit crime.  It may be that the Ten Commandments are considered a bit out of date but what a wonderful world we would have if they were not so out of date.  I feel <Col N="1300" /> that soon society in general will look at crime and realise that adherence to the principles laid down in the Ten Commandments is the solution to all our ills.</P>
    <P>We have no racial problems in this part of the country because, apart from anything else, we have a small and not a very cosmopolitan population. Nevertheless, we have got problems which face the more sophisticated societies of the world. Generally speaking, we are approaching our problems in the right way, but I do not think we are approaching them speedily enough or putting enough effort into solving them.  We are inclined to suggest that some of the things that happen in other parts of the world could not happen here. We are adopting the Anglo-American type of society.  We are inclined to accept the things that happen without question.  It is our duty to question what is happening.</P>
    <P>We should try to educate our youth not to accept without question everything in books and films from abroad. They have no greater merits than the books written here or the films made here.  They should examine the principles enunciated in these films and books.  It is our duty to ensure that our youth are given the education they deserve because if we try to save on this type of thing we will pay very dearly afterwards.</P>
    <P>We should not put all our emphasis on youth.  Some of our old people are having a rough time in some of our housing estates.  I am not suggesting that this is new because when we were all young we sometimes jeered at old people.  However, because we are living in a different type of society today our old people are getting it rather rough.  While most emphasis is put on youth problems the Minister might, in co-operation with the Garda and the various voluntary bodies who do great work with the old people, look at the problems facing old people in our society.  It is not so bad in our rural society because we have not the concentration of old people we have in the city.  The Minister should ensure that the various voluntary bodies who work with old people have the full <Col N="1301" /> backing of the State so that those old people will be given full protection.</P>
    <P>Recently we saw in the paper where a person of 84 was brutally attacked. We may well ask ourselves what type of society we are living in.  That is an isolated case but I feel that today life has changed so greatly in the social sphere that the old people may be the first to suffer.  The Minister should set up a section in his Department to examine the problems of old people. He should seek advice on the housing of old people.  When one is preparing a housing scheme for old people it is not always easy to put them into a built-up area because it means they will have a noise problem and we cannot isolate them.</P>
    <P>I came across a case recently where windows were broken in old people's flats by a person who was caught and was said to be a drug addict.  I doubt that because I noticed that the three windows he smashed were the windows of flats occupied by old women. He did not smash any windows of flats occupied by men.  Sometimes we come across people who are not normal human beings, who suffer from certain defects but glory in this and get sympathy from people.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the problem of the aged in Dublin is very great. Indeed, it is a proud boast of Dublin that when we had the old tenements nobody died alone because there was always somebody near.  Society has changed and sometimes our old people are stranded in houses away from their friends.  Their problems are much greater than they were years ago.  I do not believe they are as happy as they were when they were in the old tenements.  Old people are weak and cannot look after themselves very well.  We have some dedicated gardaí who try to look after those old people and see that they are not disturbed at night.  The officials in the Department of Justice, from the top to the lowest on the ladder, are dedicated to making our society a better one but I do not know if they have the facilities to do this.  We may be skimping on the money we give them but if we skimp on money for this Department we will reap a harvest <Col N="1302" /> later which will cost us a lot more money to try to heal the damage done to the fabric of our society.  It is bad economics to skimp on money for this Department.  We should ensure, if the Minister for Justice requires more money to run his Department, that he gets it.  While we on this side of the House may criticise the Government for spending too much sometimes&mdash; this is natural for an Opposition Party &mdash;we will ensure that the Government will allocate the moneys they are spending to the Departments which need it most.  The Department of Justice needs all the money it can get because we are behind some countries in our set-up of peace-keeping forces.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at length in connection with the Garda Síochána.  I would ask the Minister to consider the condition of some of the Garda stations in Dublin city.  There is a Garda station in Irishtown which must be 200 years old.  Up to recently a passerby could see the cells there.  In the old days the public were able to look at a prisoner in his cell and even to torture him by staring at him.  The doors have been closed so that the cells are hidden from public view.  I suggest that a new Garda station should be built in this district.  It is almost impossible for a member of the public to discuss a matter with a garda in that station with any degree of privacy.  The building is very old and the situation is unsuitable.  There is no parking space around the station. The gardaí have to park their cars at some distance from the station.  I have appealed on previous occasions for the provision of a new station in the area.  The population of the area is increasing.  The area is a very quiet one.  The gardaí tell me it is one of the quietest in the city from their point of view.  At the same time we should not impose on the generosity of the gardaí there, who are doing a great job in terrible surroundings.</P>
    <P>A Garda station should be regarded as part of the broad educational scene.  A Garda station should not be merely a place to which wrongdoers are brought.  A Garda station should have a role in educating people to the fact that society must be protected and that justice must be done and <Col N="1303" /> must be seen to be done by every member of society.  This must be a difficult role having regard to the conditions in which the Garda Síochána work in the case of this old building. Some people suggest that the building is Georgian; it would seem to me to go back to the Plantagenets.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have regard to the condition of Garda stations.  The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Begley, referred to a station in Kerry which has not got a telephone. I am sure that the station in Irishtown to which I have referred has got a telephone but that makes the appearance of the building all the more ludicrous because of its age and bad design.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by asking the Minister to consider the censorship laws governing printed matter; to review the accommodation provided for young offenders; to carry out a comprehensive review of Garda stations which need replacing.  If the Garda Síochána have not proper conditions in which to work the best results will not be obtained.  The importance of conditions of work was realised by industry many years ago.  That is why there are garden factories and that type of thing.  The gardaí who do not protest all that much, are entitled to proper conditions of work.  I do not think the House would cavil at the extra expense involved if the Minister were to propose in this year the building of 20, 30 or more new Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I look forward to some of the legislation the Minister has promised in the near future.  I assure him that while we will be very critical he will not find us wanting in support for any worthwhile measure that he may introduce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamBurke" hpid="Mr. L. Burke Mr. L. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see from the Minister's statement that a serious effort is being made to bring official Garda accommodation up to acceptable standards.  Many of the Garda stations in my constituency fall very short of the required standards. The Garda headquarters station at Union Quay, Cork, is entirely unsuitable <Col N="1304" /> for the immense volume of work carried out there.  I strongly urge the Minister to have this station modernised and brought up to a standard befitting a police station in the second city of the country.  It will be conceded that gardaí cannot give of their best if they are forced to work in substandard conditions.  For a number of years past proposals for the erection of a new district headquarters station at the southern perimeter of the city has been under consideration but to date there has been no concrete result.  This new district headquarters was intended to embrace the sub-districts of Passage, Carrigaline, Crosshaven and other centres.  The present position is that the superintendent at Cobh, which is 30 miles from Crosshaven station, has control for administrative purposes, including district court duties, of these three Garda stations and has to pass through the superintendent's districts of MacCurtain Street and Union Quay to reach these outlying stations of his district.  Furthermore, when these stations are closed at specified periods members of the public urgently requiring Garda assistance have to get in touch by phone with the central station at Cobh, some 30 miles distant.</P>
      <P>It was in order to rectify this unsatisfactory situation that the new district headquarters station at the southern perimeter of Cork city was mooted.  The work load of the existing headquarters station at Union Quay is far too heavy to permit it embracing these three outlying stations.  In the interests of the general public and of Garda efficiency I would urge the Minister to examine this serious problem as a matter of grave urgency.  It is understood that a new Garda station is being established at Blackrock Road, Cork.  This is a rapidly expanding and populous residential area and the provision of a station at this centre is a matter of great urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda station at St. Luke's Cross, on the north side of Cork city, is very badly placed, being situated at the city side of this sub-district, the major portion of this administrative area being due north and northeast <Col N="1305" /> of the station.  The building itself is very old and unsuitable.  The provision of a new station more centrally placed is imperative.  I understand that a site has been acquired for this purpose. If such is the case the erection of a new building should be pursued with all possible haste.</P>
    <P>The formation of the new motorised traffic unit in Cork city and county was an important step in the right direction.  Strict and impartial enforcement of traffic laws and regulations is bound to have a very beneficial effect in the promotion of road safety.  In this connection I would suggest that this unit, for a period at any rate, should aim at educating the public to observe a good standard of behaviour rather than endeavour to achieve this purpose by wholesale prosecutions, particularly in the case of trivial offences.  It is well known that in the past there has been wholesale evasion of Road Fund licence duty.  It is hoped that this new unit will bring these dodgers to book, or at any rate make it increasingly difficult for such people to escape detection.</P>
    <P>The use of motor vehicles not covered by valid insurance is still going on and having regard to the serious repercussions arising from the use of uninsured motor vehicles it is felt that the penalties meted out in some courts are far too lenient. The Minister should consider amending the Road Traffic Act and making it mandatory on courts to impose consequential disqualification orders on first conviction for this offence.  As the law now stands it is optional for courts to impose disqualification orders for first convictions.  I would also suggest similar punishment for hit-and-run offenders.  These should, on conviction, be automatically disqualified from driving for a minimum period of at least six months.</P>
    <P>As in the case of insurance offenders it is optional for the courts to impose disqualification from driving in respect of hit-and-run culprits on first conviction.  Invariably disqualification is imposed on first conviction. The depriving of a culprit of his right to drive is the greatest deterrent <Col N="1306" /> against a repetition of serious traffic law violation.  I would urge the Minister to make it arbitrary on all pedestrians and pedal cyclists to wear luminous arm bands and for persons in charge of animals on public road to wear luminous waist bands or belts during periods in which compulsory lighting on vehicles at present applies.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a fair measure of discontent among gardaí with regard to the system of promotion.  I believe that senior members should be given preferential treatment over the less experienced and overambitious younger men.  Promotion boards are always comprised of three Garda officers, a system regarded by many candidates as not being absolutely fair.  It might be better if a high-ranking official of the Department of Justice were included in the board or, perhaps, a person qualified in the matter of assessment of merit who would be absolutely independent and impartial.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern to gardaí is the written examination conducted yearly for the purpose of qualifying members to compete at interviews for further advancement. These written tests are based on the entire criminal code of law, textbooks on criminal law and criminal investigation, including a very hefty code of Garda administrative matters dealing with all aspects of Garda work and finance.  In addition, members sitting for inspector written tests must study a hefty volume of the law of evidence.  I consider it absolutely unfair and outmoded in these modern times to expect gardaí to study and memorise this immense programme in their spare time.  Even professional and experienced lawyers must, of necessity, consult their law library before arriving at a decision.  Surely candidates for written promotion examinations should be permitted to use their textbooks.  It is well known that many excellent gardaí have suffered physical ill-health studying for these absurd tests prepared by officers from textbooks at their disposal.  I am aware that many excellent gardaí of officer potential are debarred from promotion because of their fear of <Col N="1307" /> undergoing this unreasonable test. The whole promotion system requires a complete overhaul so that some system acceptable to the main body of gardaí can be devised.</P>
    <P>A sizeable number of Garda personnel are engaged in routine traffic bye-laws enforcement in Cork and Dublin. These duties should be taken over by the local authority and thus relieve the gardaí so engaged for more essential police duties.  In Cork city a ticket parking system has been approved by the corporation and its early implementation by the Minister for Local Government would lead to the takeover of parking regulations by civilian staff employed by the corporation.</P>
    <P>Another factor is that assaults on police officers are not infrequent in this country.  I fear that the courts in some cases are far too lenient with offenders.  Our police force should have the full protection of law and I would advocate that a mandatory prison sentence, without the option of a fine, should be imposed on persons who deliberately assault members of the police force lawfully engaged in the execution of their duty.  It should be specifically provided that the Probation of Offenders Act cannot be applied in assault cases.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a good deal of the criminal law brought up-to-date. Take, for example, the licensing laws. There are at least 20 statutes still in existence from the years 1815 to 1924 and since the introduction of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, we have had a number of new licensing laws.  The position is now so confused that nobody seems to understand the entire code of licensing law.  It is high time that a consolidated Bill was drafted embodying the whole code of the licensing laws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to echo the Minister's compliments to the Garda force for their efficiency, loyalty, dedication and integrity and <Col N="1308" /> for the exemplary manner in which the members have performed their duties since the formation of the force to the present day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>My first duty is to wish the Minister well.  He comes from Athlone which is only a short distance from where I live.  I wish him well in spite of the fact that he made some statements with which I could not agree.  I think he means well.</P>
      <P>Many of the things I intended to say have already been said.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Begley, mentioned quite a number of them. I have the greatest respect for the Garda force.  The majority of gardaí are excellent but there are the few who damage the force in the eyes of the ordinary people.  These are the few who will pick on a law-abiding citizen for some very technical offence.  It turns the general law-abiding public against authority when they see that crimes are being committed and there are no gardaí there, while a law abiding citizen is caught for a technical offence.  Four or five years ago I parked my car in a town not too far from my home.  I parked my car perfectly. I saw a man who had just buried his sister going into a doorway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I got out of the car.  I did not lock it.  I took the ignition key and went to the door.  I sympathised with the man.  He asked: &ldquo;Will you come inside for a moment, I want to see you?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I am in a hurry&rdquo; but anyway I went in and when I came out about ten minutes afterwards, there was a guard standing at the car. He said: &ldquo;Your car is unlocked.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;That is correct.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;Your handbrake is out of order.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;That is correct.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I suppose you will tell me it went out of order coming into the town.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;  I thought, by telling the truth, I was going to get away with murder.  I said: &ldquo;Not at all; it is out of order for the past couple of weeks but I will get it fixed tomorrow.&rdquo; Fair enough.  I came home, got the handbrake fixed, rang the Garda station and told them that the handbrake was perfect now.  I showed it to the local guards.  The next thing <Col N="1309" /> I received was a summons to appear at court a distance away.  I could not attend.  I called at the Garda station and told them I could not attend but that I had my handbrake fixed.  The next thing was that the event appeared in the local paper.  I was fined £2 for not having the door locked and £2 for not having my handbrake in order.  Fair enough.  The handbrake was a genuine case.  I deserved to be fined because it was not working.  But, hang it all, I explained to the guard that I went to the door to sympathise with the man, not locking the door, having parked perfectly and that should have been enough.  If you left the key in the ignition, there would be a case where anybody could come along and take the car.  But these are the types of little offences that amount to a type of technicality.</P>
    <P>Another night my white light had blown.  In a certain town a garda came over to me and said: &ldquo;You have no white light&rdquo; but, as he was speaking, a car flashed past at about 80 miles per hour right through a crowded street.  Now, it was too hard to catch that guy.  He could not be caught anyway.  He was gone like a flash.  But mine was an easy summons. This is the type of thing about which I am speaking now.  Very few of the guards do this.  But there are the few &mdash;to whom the Parliamentary Secretary referred&mdash;who summons people for small technical offences.  These are the type of things the gardaí during their training period should be taught to overlook.  They should just tell a man he should not do it again. Summonses in those cases, to my mind, are too technical and will only get the general public to think less of the gardaí and less of law and order.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make is that some of the fines imposed are not in keeping with the offences committed. This is very important.  I experienced a case where a couple of fellows took a few jars too many. They got into a row, followed a crowd and beat them up.  They deserved to be well fined.  Nobody had to go to hospital and everybody was astonished on opening the papers&mdash;I admit young fellows should conduct themselves; I <Col N="1310" /> am not apologising for them at all&mdash;to see a fine of £100 for one.  There was disqualification for the man driving the car and he was not allowed into dances in the surrounding area for a certain period.  It was the talk of the place.  This terrible fine was not in keeping with the offence since nobody was injured.  It was a row and we have experienced rows down through the years.</P>
    <P>I had experience of another case where there was a row between two committees.  Posters were pulled down by one of them.  I have seen posters pulled down by political parties all my life and, right enough, it is a thing I do not like and I feel it should not be done.  But when you see a fine of £26 or £28 inflicted on a fellow caught pulling down a poster&mdash;when everyone, indeed, who has anything to do with politics knows that it has been pulled down and they are pulled down &mdash;you think it unfair.  If he were fined a fiver you would consider he had been fined enough.  Those are the type of things that do not help people to respect the law.  Even though they are isolated cases, I think they should be looked into because, somehow or other, I imagine these fines are not in keeping with the crimes committed.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is endeavouring to do something in prisons to try to prepare people committed to them to re-enter ordinary life when they come out.  To my mind, education inside prisons is very important because, when a person commits a crime, he is ostracised by society.  He goes to prison.  The attitude to him is: keep him down.  Keep him down all the time.  And, when he comes out, nobody wants him.  The position is that he is likely to fall again.  God knows, he has nowhere else to go.  Perhaps some effort could be made to get such people to learn a trade to enable them to be employed when they come out and also to have lectures for them so that they are not finished for all time. They can start again and will learn that crime does not pay.  I believe the Minister means well in this area.  I think something will have to be done about this.  Long ago it was a question of beating the person up, keeping him <Col N="1311" /> inside and doing nothing for him. I do not believe that that ever stopped anybody.</P>
    <P>I come now to youth clubs which are something I would ask the young gardaí to become involved in.  I started a couple myself and young gardaí have come into them.  I believe that the teenagers of today are not one bit worse than we were.  As a matter of fact, they are better in ways.  I did quare things when I was a young lad.  I did things which were not very law-abiding.  I always believed in the saying that the wildest of youth makes the best old men.  The youth today are more Christian in many ways than we were.  In my day a fellow was a good boy.  He was a Catholic.  He went to Mass and he did everything he should but his attitude was: to hell with you Jack; I am all right.  The youth of today get involved with other people and, therefore, I think anybody who condemns them as being terrible is all wrong.  If we could get the youth off the streets into youth clubs and if we could get the younger guards to go in&mdash;which is what we are doing in my home place&mdash;and mix with them and get to like them, there would be respect for the law straight away.  They would not be looking at a fellow passing in a uniform outside saying: &ldquo;That guy is out to get me.&rdquo; Instead of being outside, he is inside talking with them, joining in their games and whatever fun they may have and, again, not quoting law to them.  If you want to put something across you should get somebody in the audience to put up an idea and sell it.  It is your idea but give the impression it is not.  If a garda goes in and gives youth that impression, asks some of them to get down to this question of decent standards of law and order inside the youth club, I believe this would be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>Another matter in relation to which I should like the Minister to use his influence concerns the showing by RTE of too many crime films.  He could use his influence with his colleague in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  If I had time to relax <Col N="1312" /> I would like to view a bit of comedy but, as far as I can see now, it is practically all crime.  This does not help young people.  There is a young chap at home and the moment a crime film comes on he has two toy guns in his pocket and he wants to know who will draw quickest.  This is what he likes to look at.  I think we have too much crime and too little comedy on television.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in long speeches and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said we could not refer to legislation.  I did intend to do so but I shall not because I realise we are now dealing only with Estimates.  I should like to add my voice to that of other speakers about conditions in some of the Garda stations throughout the country.  Certainly, they are not good.</P>
    <P>I know from the Minister's speech that he is making an effort in that direction.  I wish him well.  I hope my remarks will be taken as constructive criticism.  I do not want to be taken as criticising the Garda force because I am not.  I am suggesting ways which could improve their image with the ordinary law-abiding citizen who very seldom puts a foot wrong, but if he does he is caught.  Everybody in public service should use common sense.  That is all I ask.  I compliment the force.  They are doing a very good job.  I wish the Minister well.  I hope he succeeds in his prison reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister and his staff on the very comprehensive brief on this Estimate. I wish to deal with a number of matters raised by the Minister, notably, adoption in so far as it is within the Minister's competence, contraception, the reform of the legal profession generally&mdash;we in Government must press ahead with such reforms&mdash; drunken driving, Garda training, the use by the Garda in future of computers for the keeping of criminal records, the prison system and children's courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has indicated that he is now in a position to put proposals to the Government and that he hopes to have amending legislation introduced during this session <Col N="1313" /> in regard to adoption.  I welcome that statement.  This measure is long overdue. Our legislation is 20 years old. It came into effect in 1952 and was subsequently amended in 1964.  There is a serious need at this stage for major changes in the field of adoption under a new Act and I strongly urge the Minister before the end of this session to bring in amending legislation.</P>
    <P>It is not a criticism of the staff of the Department of Justice to suggest that in the various Estimate speeches of successive Ministers for Justice we have had the perennial issue that amending legislation would be introduced. The previous Minister, Deputy O'Malley, promised us legislation before Christmas 1973&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would like to indicate its position at this stage.  In an Estimate debate the Deputy may not advocate new legislation.  We can only deal with the administration of the Department by the Minister under existing legislation. We may not criticise existing legislation nor advocate new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that ruling.  I suggest that the operations of the Adoption Board are within the compass of the Estimate.  I hold the view that the Department of Justice are not the most appropriate Department under which the Adoption Board should operate.  Since reading the Devlin Report I have felt strongly that we should have a Department of Social Affairs.  This Department would amalgamate the health and social welfare side of child law and be responsible for the whole range of child care, including adoption. The Adoption Board should not be under the formal aegis of the Minister for Justice.  I appreciate that the passing of necessary legislation will come within his ambit but the operations of the board should be an integral part of the child welfare and child care services.  The board could operate in what one might call a more open legislative framework.  This is in no way meant to decry the tremendous work done by the board and its members.  I firmly believe however, <Col N="1314" /> that it should be removed from the ambit of the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>In relation to adoption, the Minister should accept the experience of the Adoption Board.  I do not regard third party placement&mdash;placement mainly by clergy, doctors and some nurses&mdash;under adoption as being in the long run desirable or satisfactory. I prefer to see more effective statutory safeguards available to children in relation to such adoptions.  We should discourage what I call third party sponsorships as a whole.  I urge the Minister to consider that suggestion. I fully appreciate that normal arrangements between relatives in relation to adoption cannot be frowned on.  These are called family adoption arrangements.  This is normal practice in many areas of Irish life.  Haphazard and casual third party adoptions by third party sponsorships should be discouraged.  I strongly commend that to the Minister.  I have publicly made my views known on that subject.</P>
      <P>The Minister, who has statutory control over adoption societies, should encourage a greater emphasis on their employing a greater number of trained professional staff.  I am aware of the fact that many of the staff employed by such agencies and societies are quite expert although they may not necessarily have formal social work training.  Many of them by their compassion, care and dedicated public service are performing a great service for the community, but it is generally accepted now that such agencies should have a high quota of trained professional staffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that all placements, in so far as any of them can be monitored, must have a full social and medical examination prior to placement and that there should be thorough supervision.  I am particularly worried about this in relation to what I would call casual sponsorship. There should be a system of tighter control in this regard.  It is important to note that in Britain all societies which arrange adoptions must be registered with the local authorities and these local authorities must be satisfied that the society concerned is a charitable one, that it is employing <Col N="1315" /> competent staff and is properly administered.  A similar situation exists in Northern Ireland.  There adoption societies must be fully registered with the responsible ministry and an adoption child register has to be kept by the Registrar-General for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should take note of the British departmental committee report on adoption.  That committee recommended, almost ten years ago, that their law should be changed to require all adoptions to be arranged through a registered adoption agency or a local authority.  It is in the national interest that we should adopt and evolve towards a similar situation in this country.  I have no doubt that the various adoption societies here would fully co-operate and continue the work which they have done down the years.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with the other aspects of adoption because they require amending legislation and, I am precluded from dealing with such amending legislation.  I urge the Minister, and the Cabinet, to bring in a new adoption Bill as a matter of great urgency.  It is ten years since we had the last amendments in this country. In 1964 such a Bill was introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Haughey, but the situation has changed dramatically in relation to adoption since then.  There is now a far greater public awareness of the role of adoptions in society and there is a greater public understanding of the safeguards and changes that are needed.  Public opinion is much more sophisticated in relation to adoption and many changes in the interests of the children and in the interests of the adoptive parents could be brought in with agreement. This legislation should be pressed forward as speedily as possible by the Minister.  I have made my views known on this matter in various articles and in public comment.</P>
    <P>I should like also to draw the attention of the Minister to an aspect of an administrative nature in this regard.  In my view it is an important matter.  In <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the notices of the making of the adoption orders are published.  For example, in the current <Col N="1316" /> issue, 390 names are given.  The Christian names of the children involved and the full names and addresses of the adoptive parents are also given.  I appreciate that under the Adoption Acts of 1952 and 1964 the Adoption Board, in making adoption orders, is obliged to lay out particulars in regard to such orders but it is disturbing that it is necessary to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the Christian name of the child and the name and address of the adoptive parents.  Such publication could conceivably be open, if I may use the term carefully, to abuse by commercial interests.  The announcement of births in newspapers is followed by a flood of letters to the parents offering them all sorts of things for their new arrival.</P>
    <P>It could be suggested that the publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, which is a public document, could be open to prying individuals or, more dangerously, to disturbing the individuals involved in adopting the children.  I query the statutory necessity to have such information published.  I appreciate the need for a statutory register of children adopted but is there a need for the publication?  Those who adopt children have certain rights of privacy and a certain privilege on the question of making the information public. The appropriate confidentiality of such arrangements should be respected by the Minister to whom I will make the current issue of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> available.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is in the Seanad at the moment but I am glad of his decision to introduce amending legislation in relation to contraception. I appreciate I may not comment on amending legislation as such, or discuss the details of legislation, but I should like to talk about the general principle of change.  I am glad of the opportunity to say in this House that I welcome the decision of the Minister. It is of grave importance that there is now clearly established a Government acceptance of the view that every family has a fundamental human right to plan and space its family, availing of the best possible medical advice and in accordance with its own moral beliefs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> The introduction of such legislation is the clear responsibility of the Minister for Justice and I welcome the decision of the Government and the Minister to remove the legal prohibition in the way of such families exercising that basic right.  I stress the point that the change envisaged by the Government would mean that families would be entitled to avail of contraception if they so wished and in accordance with their human dignity as individuals and their own sense of moral responsibility.</P>
    <P>In that regard it is quite erroneous to suggest that the proposed changes in the law in any way would force contraception on anyone.  All the changes would do would be to allow citizens who wish to regulate the size and spacing of their families to avail of contraceptives without having to break the law.  This is the important matter the Dáil must face.</P>
    <P>If I might comment on the current position, which is of direct concern to the Minister and entirely within his responsibility, I would make the point that at present we have the very illogical situation whereby the Supreme Court has ruled it is not illegal for people to purchase contraceptives, for example, in Newry, and to import them into the State for their personal use, or for distribution if they wish without sale being involved, but it is completely illegal for them to make the same purchase in Dundalk.  This is the illogicality of the current position.  I am pleased to note the Government are concerned that they should at least ensure that the law as it now stands will not be brought into complete disrepute and have decided to introduce amending legislation.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy in elaborating his point of view is falling into a breach of the traditional rule that one does not advocate new legislation or criticise existing legislation on an Estimate. Doubtless there will be an opportunity for the Deputy to express his views by way of a Bill or a motion on the specific subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the <Col N="1318" /> point that I may not specifically advocate the introduction of new legislation but I should like to conclude that statement.  In my view it is not merely a question of the responsibility of the Government in changing the existing law arising from the Supreme Court judgment; it is not merely a question of providing changes in the law for the minority; it is essentially a matter of fundamental human rights.  The legislators have a basic moral responsibility in relation to the human rights of the individual or the family.  Irrespective of their spiritual beliefs, the legislators have the fundamental obligation of introducing that change in the law.</P>
      <P>The options of the legislators are quite narrow and I hope the Dáil will introduce such major changes as are necessary.  While I respect the ruling of the Chair that I may not advocate the introduction of new legislation, so far as the Minister for Justice is now responding to a slightly new situation his decision is welcome.  I would point out that the situation is new only in that there has been a further development at Supreme Court level; the situation has been with us since 1935.  It is time this country established the right of every family to avail of contraceptives as they may wish and in accordance with their own sense of moral values.  This is a fundamental human right and it is on that issue I shall discuss this matter at a future date in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to Fianna Fáil, I submit that party should face up to their responsibilities.  I was disturbed to note the suggestion that before the Ard-Fheis the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party decided by a substantial majority not to co-operate with the Government. I have not been able to receive confirmation of that but it has been said there was a suggestion at a Parliamentary Party meeting by the Leader of the Opposition that they should co-operate with the Government in regard to this matter but it was thrown out.  If that is the case, I challenge Fianna Fáil to declare themselves on this matter.  If that is the case, then the Ard-Fheis decision to defer the matter was an even bigger  <Col N="1319" /> farce than the decision actually taken.</P>

      <P>Yes, and I hope to see us use that majority.  Also, I hope Fianna Fáil will not avail of the position whereby if legislation is restrictive they will have the luxury of opposing it because it is too restrictive, or if the legislation is too open they will have the luxury of opposing it on that account.  Fianna Fáil must make up their minds on this matter; they cannot have the luxury of both options.  In other words, if it is restrictive legislation it is impractical and, therefore, they must oppose it, and if it is open legislation it is undesirable and, therefore, they must oppose it.</P>

We can have a long discussion on the practicality and the constitutionality of other aspects of that legislation at a later date.  Meanwhile I do not think Fianna Fáil can have the privilege&mdash;because of their distaste for the Government&mdash;of exercising the options on both sides.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter.  There is a big difference between human rights and the future of a Deputy's seat in any given area.  I will pass on to the need for reform in the legal profession.  As I have the benefit of not being a member of the profession I can comfortably give my views.  Part of the legislative programme of the Government should be an effort to unify the legal profession and to abolish excessive duplication of work done by solicitors, senior counsel, junior counsel, and so on.  I am a trade unionist and I do not like restrictive practices in any employment. It has always worried me that when a profession with a plethora of hierarchical functions, the legal profession, manages to involve itself in litigation and in property conveyancing, the cost inevitably becomes very high to the community.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I would urge the Minister to take up where the previous Minister left off.  Deputy O'Malley and previous Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice were progressive on the question of unifying the legal profession. I know they ran into a fair amount of flak from the then Opposition. There is great need for a review not only of legal education but the whole system of legal education, the whole out-dated, lunatic anachronism which operates, for example, in the Kings Inns. the old feudal throwback of middle-class legal professional practices. We should up-date legal education and integrate legal functions and the country would be a lot better off for it.  I strongly recommend to the Minister that he should consider working in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer now to legal fees and solicitors' fees, particularly in relation to property conveyancing.  I gather that solicitors' fees are based on the value of the transaction of conveyancing property from A to B. Such fees are on a fixed scale approved by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  I further gather that the scale of fees depends on the price of the property being sold.  Many <Col N="1321" /> young couples have to bear very heavy legal charges in relation to house property.  This is an area where the Natinal Prices Commission could usefully be asked by the Government to undertake an investigation into the scale of the fees charged.</P>
    <P>It always strikes me as being very odd that I can walk out of this House and buy a new car if I have the money&mdash;I could not even buy a secondhand car at the moment&mdash;for £6,000 or £7,000 and no legal costs are involved.  If I could afford the weekly repayments on a £6,000 Rolls Royce I could buy it on extended credit.  If I buy £6,000 worth of property in Dublin or in any other part of the country&mdash;and you would not get a whole lot of property for £6,000 now&mdash;immediately I become enmeshed in legal fees for conveyancing and so on.  I also become involved in auctioneers fees if I am selling land. I suggest to the Government and the Minister that there is need for a thorough examination of legal costs in relation to house building and property.</P>
    <P>In the lifetime of this Dáil we introduced legislation making changes in auctioneers' fees.  It is time we had changes in the fees for services rendered by solicitors in respect of property. It may well be that the National Prices Commission should investigate the role of solicitors who act for the buyer and seller, where the same solicitor is acting for the two parties. This is an area which the National Prices Commission could usefully investigate and decide whether there should be substantial reductions in fees.  They might even investigate whether such a practice is desirable in a property transaction.  I am conscious of the fact that we hear all sorts of exhortations about the national wage agreement.  There are holding companies making £1 million out of Tara Mines, for example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant to make £1 million.  If we expect <Col N="1322" /> restraint from trade unionists under a national wage agreement, this must apply to all sections of the community, and those who make £1 million on property, and those who make substantial incomes from property conveyancing in the legal profession, must come under the broad ambit of wage restraint and wage control.  It sickens me that in relation to shares a group of individuals, Irishmen allegedly, can make £1 million while the industrial worker is asked simultaneously to support a national wage agreement.</P>

As a trade unionist who intends to vote for a national wage agreement and who voted for the previous one also, I make the point that we must be seen in this Government to ensure that in all areas of life, equality of income and opportunity will operate.  I strongly recommend this area for Government consideration.  I leave it at that and thank the Chair for its tolerance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Passing on to the operation of the courts I should like to place on record that the establishment of a District Court in Dún Laoghaire with jurisdiction in all matters, which came into operation on 1st January, has been welcomed very much by the public of south County Dublin, also by the Garda and by the legal profession. I have been harsh about some aspects of the work of the legal profession but I say that quite rightly they have welcomed the setting up of this court.  Dún Laoghaire is the fourth largest urban area in the country.  It was denied a District Court with full jurisdiction since 1934 and sittings of the court in Dún <Col N="1323" /> Laoghaire now will give residents the facility of having all their district court legal business transacted at local level.  This is generally welcomed and so are the children's court sittings in Dún Laoghaire.  It will be far more convenient than travelling to Dublin courts.  I also welcome the opening of a full-time District Court office in the area and the appointment of a full-time probation officer.</P>
    <P>District Court work for the whole of south County Dublin should, I think, be dealt with in Dún Laoghaire. While I appreciate that there are legal difficulties which prevent this being done now, the Minister should introduce legislation&mdash;and I ask him to do so&mdash;to provide for sittings for the whole of south County Dublin in Dún Laoghaire.  This area is growing at a tremendous rate and there is need for a full District Court for the area.  I strongly recommend this innovation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider making arrangements for Circuit Court sittings in Dún Laoghaire during the legal term.  There is now no Circuit Court sitting between Dublin and Wicklow and I understand that the Wicklow Circuit Court is grossly overworked.  Therefore, the Minister should consider arranging sittings in Dún Laoghaire for the whole of south County Dublin and part of County Wicklow, including Bray.  Work in the Dublin Circuit Court is greatly in arrears and I think sittings in Dún Laoghaire would relieve the situation. I suggest these matters in regard to both the District Court and the Circuit Court in the Dún Laoghaire area for the Minister's consideration. Dún Laoghaire Corporation should be given credit for making substantial improvements and for providing accommodation in the courthouse for the extra District Court sittings.  Other local authorities could usefully take a leaf from Dún Laoghaire's book but ultimate responsibility for maintenance and upkeep of courthouses should be a matter for the State and not for local authorities.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the very substantial seizure of arms and explosives last year and I commend <Col N="1324" /> the Garda for having, with great difficulty in many cases, and in some cases with no small risk to their lives, succeeded in getting possession within the State of 330 rifles, nearly 300 pistols and other hand weapons.  As the Minister said, they also got possession of 518 grenades, 15 rockets, four rocket launchers and a sizeable quantity of explosives.  These statistics prove that the Garda have been vigilent to ensure that unauthorised possession of weapons and explosives in the State has not gone unchallenged. The Garda are to be commended in that regard.  I think it can be said in relation to armed robbery, particularly in the greater Dublin area, that the public recognise there has been an extraordinarily high success rate of capture very soon after commission of the offences.  The Garda again are to be commended for their competence in this connection.  If this criminal activity had gone unchecked and undetected, no doubt we would have had an epidemic of it, as in Northern Ireland.  Due to the vigilance of the Garda I believe we have been spared an epidemic of armed robbery or attempted armed robbery in this State.  This shows the competence and effectiveness of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister and the Government to draft a comprehensive Landlord and Tenant Bill which I hope will be submitted to the Government and introduced in the House as a matter of the utmost urgency.</P>

      <P>I appreciate this and I am glad the Minister has indicated his intention to introduce this legislation.  I should like to draw attention to one area which is within the direct responsibility of the Minister, the area of rent control.  I want to stress my very great concern about the gross exploitation of very many young persons coming to Dublin and living in private rented dwellings.  I also want to express my very great concern about the abominable exploitation <Col N="1325" /> of homeless couples, couples newly married and couples who have one child and who are on a long waiting list for local authority houses in private, uncontrolled rented dwellings in this city and in the greater Dublin area as well as throughout the country.  The Minister for Local Government is to be commended for the achievement of building 24,000 houses in 1973.  The Fianna Fáil Party did not do it.</P>

      <P>In 1974 it could work out at 25,000.  No matter how large the local authority building programme is its real social contribution is destroyed if we have on the other side a situation where in private rented dwellings there is gross exploitation.  I give one simple example of a case in my constituency.  This is an appalling example of a young apprentice electrician. I know him, his wife and child well.  His gross earnings are £19 a week.  He is 20 years of age and will not be out of his time as an electrician until January next year.  He is a housing applicant with Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation.  He is paying £8.50 a week for what can only be described as a rat infested &ldquo;kip,&rdquo; a basement room in Dún Laoghaire which has been regularly and vigorously examined by the health inspectors in the area.  They have done their best to serve sanitary orders on the landlord concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently this young man got the 'flu.  Instead of his wages he received disability benefit.  I know his family went hungry in order to pay the rent of that basement room.  He went back to work before he was well enough, against his doctor's advice.  I appreciate that the existing law of the land is that a dwelling has to be pre-1941 otherwise the benefit of controlled rent does not accrue to the individual. I implore the Minister to introduce up-to-date rent control legislation as soon as possible.  I do not accept the suggestion of the Leader of the <Col N="1326" /> Opposition at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that we should have a rent rebate system for private dwellings.  I hope he will have a rethink on that suggestion because in my opinion a rent rebate system for private dwellings is nothing more than a licence to private landlords to raise their rents by the amount of the rebate.</P>
    <P>The only way out of this, and it is not a perfect way, is to do two things. First of all, we should insist that rents, the structure of rents and the increase in rents should be the subject of a thorough investigation and control by the National Prices Commission with recommendations for amending legislation where necessary.  The Minister should simultaneously review the provision whereby houses built prior to 1949 are the only ones, if the tenancies go back that long, where protected tenancies arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I am greatly concerned about the fact that when many workers get substantial increases under national wage agreements landlords know about this and jack up rents.  When many workers, their families or old age pensioners get social welfare increases landlords increase their rents.  Some landlords are in a state of poverty. They are not getting any advantage from the situation in regard to rented dwellings at the moment.  There are some landlords who cannot afford to do basic maintenance repairs on their houses but there is a large number, including some of the property speculators of this city and of the country, including some auctioneers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who have houses in my constituency and are making a fortune, exploiting young couples, having from five to ten young families in a house and charging them a weekly rent of £8 and £9.  The gross income out of most of those houses is £100 per week.  In some cases I have <Col N="1327" /> enjoyed advising the Revenue Commissioners of some of the information that has come into my possession regarding some of these people.  I pay my taxes; the average industrial worker in the country pays PAYE; the average tenant of a private dwelling pays his taxes and I see no reason why any private landlord should enjoy a situation in which in the absence of legislation he can charge what he likes.</P>
      <P>There is no legislation to compel people to have rent books.  You can demand a receipt and you get it.  In Britain under the statutory rent reforms people at least know what they are paying, under what section of the Housing Act they are paying and when their rent is subject to review.  I appreciate I may not advocate legislation and I also appreciate that rent tribunals and the statutory method by which one fixes fair rent is an enormously complex and difficult area for any drafter of legislation.  I suggest there is a grave need for it.  This is the only way we can put an end to the exploitation of young couples and single people who would never get on to a housing list but who are in need of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pass on to another matter, namely, the question of free legal aid. I welcome the decision of the Minister to set up an informal committee to advise him on the introduction of a system of civil legal aid.  I want to make one suggestion.  I hope the terms of reference will be agreed as quickly as possible; I hope the membership of the committee will be decided on as quickly as possible; I hope they will do their work as urgently as possible and bring in reports as speedily as possible.  Since 1969 I have, in Dáil Éireann, heard many statements of intent about changes in this, that and the other respect.  We have had many promises from many areas of government, not least the Department of Justice.  Nobody knows better than the Minister or than those of us on the Government side the appalling pressures that are on the Department of Justice, in relation to the security situation, in relation to the very contentious <Col N="1328" /> legislation that we had in the past year, in relation to the prison situation, and so on.  All that has totally immersed the staff of the Department of Justice.  Consequently, the staff has not been able to do this kind of work.  Now that we are a bit better organised, now that we are in a kind of hiatus, I certainly hope the new scheme of civil legal aid will be introduced as a matter of the utmost urgency.</P>
    <P>I want now to pass on to another area of the administration of the Department of Justice, namely, offences under the Road Traffic Act, 1968, and the amendment of 1973.  I appreciate that the Garda Síochána have to operate this Act.  I appreciate that it is an offence to drive a car or to attempt to drive a car or to be in charge of a motor vehicle while the level of alcohol in the blood exceeds 125 milligrammes.  There is provision for the taking of breath tests, blood tests and urine tests and so on, under the law.  It is the job of the Garda Síochána to implement the law.  I also appreciate that amendments to the Road Traffic Act were introduced by the Minister for Local Government and that these amendments are now in operation and that it is the job of the Garda Síochána to implement the law in that regard.</P>
    <P>The prescribed limit of alcohol in the blood under the Road Traffic Act is 125 milligrammes.  The prescribed limit under section 7 of the Road Safety Act, 1967, in Britain is 80 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of blood or other such proportion as may be prescribed in regulations made by statutory instrument by the Minister.  Therefore, the limit in Britain is substantially lower than the limit in Ireland.  In many continental countries the limit is even lower than in Britain.  In Czechoslovakia the limit is in the region of 30 milligrammes. One would need to be very careful about taking even one drink in some countries.  In many continental countries the limit is lower than 80.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point here which may not be a very popular point to make in public.  Recent reports, many of them published by the British Medical <Col N="1329" /> Association, suggest that at 60 milligrammes drivers are twice as likely to be responsible for causing an accident; at 100 milligrammes they are six to seven times as likely to cause an accident and at 150 milligrammes they are 25 times as likely to cause an accident.  In other words, at 150 milligrammes the chances of avoiding an accident are very seriously diminished.  Remember that our limit is 125 milligrammes.</P>
    <P>The British and American scientific evidence in this regard strongly supports legislation making it an offence for persons with a blood alcohol concentration in excess of a figure in the region of 70 milligrammes to be in charge of a motor vehicle.  This is the common proposition now of a great mass of scientific evidence in respect of driving a motor vehicle on a public highway.  In that light I wonder about the efficacy of a limit of 125 milligrammes.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that a very substantial proportion of accidents in this country arise from and are directly attributable to the consumption of alcohol by persons in charge of motor vehicles.  It is time for a review.  I am very pleased to note the clear-cut statement of the Minister for Justice that he will not entertain any representations regarding such charges because there is a popular assumption, now that there has been a change of Government, that perhaps we might be more lenient towards some people who have been caught driving while the level of alcohol in the blood is over the limit.  I am glad the Minister for Justice has given no reason for that belief.  It is essential that this fact should be borne in mind.  I make that point because I come from a constituency which has perhaps the highest car ownership in the country.</P>

      <P>Car ownership is no longer a status symbol.  My constituency has the highest number of registrations in the country.  It is important to point out that many families suffer catastrophically because <Col N="1330" /> of loss of life arising from accidents directly attributable to drunken driving.  In my view district justices should send persons guilty of drunken driving who are involved in accidents which entail loss of life and mutilation of persons to the accident wards of this city on a Saturday night between 9 p.m. and 3.0 a.m.  A few compulsory visits imposed by district justices as part of the penalty for drunken driving would cure some drivers of taking the risk of driving while drunk.  There is still a good deal of drunken driving notwithstanding the breathalyser test.  That is a matter that the Government must consider.</P>
      <P>I have been critical enough this morning on a number of issues, critical in a constructive way, I hope. Now I want to congratulate the Government on the decision to institute a system of independent public prosecution and a system of independent allocation of State briefs.  I had a rather interesting question down yesterday.  One of the reasons why I put down that question was because a number of people said: &ldquo;Now that there is a change of Government I bet you will not put it down this year although you put it down for the last three or four years.&rdquo;  I put it down and it makes interesting reading.</P>

      <P>I will, indeed.  I promise that.  One way or another, the question will go down.  The previous practice highlights the need for an independent system of allocation of briefs.  It is a disgrace that for so long we have had a system whereby you got nothing unless you were a Fianna Fáil sympathising barrister or a Fine Gael sympathising barrister. There are so few socialist barristers around one has to track them down. They had nothing to gain from being <Col N="1331" /> in the Labour Party, I suppose apart from a clean conscience and they were not unduly honoured with State briefs.  The change to an independent system of allocation of briefs is long overdue and deserves to be commended. I hope the necessary legislation will be introduced as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about another system of appointment which we must have here.  That is an independent system of judicial appointment.  There is a story going around the Law Library at the moment that the slogan for the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis is: &ldquo;Be a good judge and vote Fine Gael&rdquo;. Whether this is true or not I do not know but we on the Government side should change the system of appointment of the judiciary.  We would be doing yet another major act of political hygiene if we did this.</P>

      <P>That is not the advocacy of new legislation.  It is just cleaning up a bad situation.  I make no reflection on the judiciary.  I am precluded from reflecting on the judiciary.  I suggest that the current system is one of political patronage, that it brings politics into disrepute and that it must, in the long run, erode public confidence in the judicial system.  It is appropriate that there should be an independent judicial commission set up.  I have an open mind on the composition of such a commission.  We might have a commission which included, say, the Chief Justice&mdash;so that the old school tie would not feel unduly excluded on appointments.  Suppose one had the Ceann Comhairle, just for argument sake.  After all, he is the chairman of the Local Appointments Commission. One might have the Taoiseach of the day.  I would be magnanimous and bring in the Leader of the Opposition of the day.  There are quite a few good Fianna Fáil barristers around who might make good judges.  So that the Labour Party gets its whack in, I <Col N="1332" /> think I would have to bring in the Tánaiste.  I think we will exclude the President.  He is above it all.  Anyway, he was never a legal man.  It will be great when he gets the Contraception Bill.  There is need for a judicial appointments commission comprising, perhaps, the people I have mentioned. Let them sit down and appoint judges in future.  It would be far better than having the Cabinet scouting around checking the credentials of an individual in respect of this party or that party.  That change is necessary and I would strongly recommend it to the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to family legislation, I am glad to note that the Minister has asked the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure to make recommendations on the substantive law as to the desertion of wives and children and the attachment of wages and the desirability of establishing special family tribunals. The Minister said he hoped to have their recommendations in the near future.  He also said the drafting of amending legislation will then commence as a matter of urgency.  This is the fourth occasion in 19 pages on which he has promised amending legislation.  Let us have it and let us have it in this session if at all possible. I commend the Minister for extending the terms of reference of the committee to bring in these areas.  There is an urgent need for the legal attachment of the earnings of husbands who desert their families.  I fully support the view that earnings should be so attached under the law that husbands who desert their wives and children will have their earnings attached internally at any rate.  To catch them in Britain is a big problem.  Any Minister would have serious difficulty in getting agreement with the British Ministry on this matter.  There is now a substantial public opinion which supports the view, and I have been amazed at various meetings at the strength of the view, and which has only come about in the last five or six years, that husbands who desert their <Col N="1333" /> wives and remain in the State should have their earnings attached.  Indeed, I would go so far as to suggest that where a wife who deserts her family is working there may be a case for a similar attachment.  There are in our community deserted husbands.  I would strongly commend to the Minister to have amending legislation introduced.</P>
      <P>I would agree with the Minister that the present training course for gardaí is too short and too shallow.  It always surprised me that the Garda Síochána have been so good considering the fact that their training is so bad.  I do not in any way blame the training authorities in Templemore for this situation. I blame the legislative and regulatory arrangements.  The training period for gardaí in this country is appallingly short.  The training period for prison officers is even worse&mdash;four or five weeks induction training and off they go, making prison officers out of them, which is a joke.  I also strongly support the need for refresher training for serving members, especially during the first half decade of their service.</P>
      <P>Bearing all these facts in mind, the Garda Síochána with relatively little time allocated to their training do a very good job.  This is the point I most wanted to make&mdash;those who try to produce trained gardaí do a very good job in a very short space of time of putting them through a training school.  With the growing sophistication of crime, with the growing need for understanding between communities, particularly in the urban areas, and in the relationships between gardaí and young offenders, there is a need for better training.  I strongly commend to the Minister to extend, broaden and give greater depth to&mdash; and the Conroy Commission were of the same view&mdash;to the training of gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister to expand the juvenile liaison officer scheme.  In this regard, I would urge him to be very flexible.  There are not sufficient such juvenile liaison officers in the country.  I think the scheme is a very worthwhile one.  In the past six months the juvenile liaison officers have been given more freedom. I suggest that they might be given better <Col N="1334" /> allowances.  For example, the idea of a juvenile liaison officer going around on his bicycle dealing with juvenile offenders, in the absence of an effective car allowance, is the kind of nonsensical thing which technically could happen but which, in practice, does not.  Not so long ago, however, it would have been the official attitude that it should happen.  The role of the juvenile liaison officer is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The other point I should like to make&mdash;and it is a purely personal one &mdash;is that Tom Fitzpatrick is not a Dublin man; I am not a Dublin man either, but I have lived in Dublin for the past 15 years.  I would suggest to the Minister that an effort should be made to recruit gardaí and juvenile liaison officers from within the Dublin area and, in many respects, I think they should operate within that area. I remember coming to Dublin in the 'fifties; it literally takes one three or four years to get the feel of any city; to get to know people; to get to know social attitudes, which are somewhat different from those in a rural environment. It must be traumatic for a young garda, recruited into Templemore, banged out after a very short training course and slammed up into, say, Pearse Street or Harcourt Street, or into Dún Laoghaire or Ballyfermot, and so on.  It must be a traumatic experience for a young man in his early twenties with very little experience of an urban community where the little subtle nuances of some young fellow in Dublin making a hard-chaw comment may be totally misunderstood.  It may finish up with the new Garda recruit taking a very different attitude, which I would have taken when I came to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I do make the point, however, that in view of the predominant recruitment of gardaí from rural areas, a special effort should be made to attract persons who have grown up in urban environment.  God knows it is not a great environment but there are things about it which can benefit the community in terms of understanding, in terms of community contact, in terms of different areas of tolerance and so on which could be contributed <Col N="1335" /> to by recruits from an urban area.  I do not know how the Minister can handle this.  I think it is a remarkable tribute to the Garda Síochána that men from so many widely differing backgrounds can operate in difficult urban areas, on occasions, and can do so with such tremendous competence and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to deal with the question of the computerisation of criminal and other records.  I appreciate the need for computerisation of police data.  I appreciate the fact that the Garda Síochána may not get a computer of their own and may have to share it with another branch of the public service.  I appreciate also the assurance given us by the Minister that the Garda section of the operation will be self-contained and that the Garda only will have access to stored information giving criminal records and the like.  Notwithstanding this assurance from the Minister, I want to express serious concern about this development.  I am in favour of the computerisation of criminal police records.  I see no alternative to the sophisticated operations of any police courts but I am not entirely convinced that as yet within the community&mdash;both within the Department and within the Department for the Public Service&mdash;there are sufficiently agreed standards of protection for the records so contained.  For example, I would commend to the Minister the strong recommendations of the Council of Europe in regard to the right of the individual that his records would not be made available to any unauthorised person.  I would strongly recommend that that be investigated by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to see any prospect of a situation developing&mdash;as it has in America&mdash; where there would be widespread access by a whole range of public officials to data such as the number of traffic violations of a particular individual; whether he has ever been checked out by the Special Branch; a little asterisk here and there on a feedout or play-back of a computer tape: to ascertain on how many occasions he has been out of the country: applied for an alien's permit; applied for a passport.  It would be very simple in a room a fraction of the size of this area&mdash;and I have seen these police operations on the continent&mdash;to record a great deal of highly confidential data relating to almost every citizen.  I believe that the police force have a perfect right to use computer data but there has to be the greatest care taken, the greatest protection for the citizen and the greatest prevention of any possible abuse of that information. While I accept the assurance of the Minister, I remember tabling questions to Deputy Colley in this regard in relation to the operations of other computers.  I think, perhaps, some form of code has to be drawn up by the Government, by the Departments, to make absolutely sure that there can be no breach in that regard. I welcome the statement of the Minister so far.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his decision to approve the new scheme for the Garda station at Cabinteely.  That station, which I pass regularly, was a dump.  I am glad it is being improved and developed.  I intend making further suggestions about other Garda stations in my constituency later.  I do not intend to delay the House with local matters any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> The section of the Minister's speech dealing with prisons was most heartening and impressive.  His approach showed that he had very liberal views on this subject.  His public image, through a combination of factors, may not have been fantastic in the past 12 months but, in my opinion, he is the most liberal Minister for Justice we have had in recent years.  On the issues of family planning, landlord and tenants, adoption and ground rents, his overall attitude was liberal.</P>
    <P>When discussing the prisons he showed he had a continued enlightened approach.  Deputy O'Malley is to be commended for his efforts during his two-and-a-half years in office.  We must press ahead with prison reforms. It is not fully appreciated by members of the public that an analysis of the social, family and educational backgrounds of those who are in prison, particularly of juvenile offenders, shows that even the very youngest, come from environmental conditions which very often are conducive to direct criminal behaviour.  This is a very important point.  Housing conditions in some urban areas are appalling. If social pressures are put on persons of low intelligence and poor educational backgrounds, is it any wonder that they finish up being sentenced to prison?  Many prisoners are emotionally disturbed, but not perhaps to a degree where they may require normal psychiatric treatment. Many persons committed to prison are socially inadequate.  We, as adults, tend to under-estimate the demands of young people in society.  We tend to under-estimate the need for persons to read&mdash;a high proportion of those in prison today are illiterate.  We tend to under-estimate the tremendous pressures on persons to develop their capacity of rapid calculation, to write, to learn to handle machines, to use telephones, to drive cars, or to have a trade.  There are many people who are incapable, by virtue of their low level of intelligence, or deprived family background, or the appalling housing conditions in which they live, of responding to normal requirements in society.  Society has itself to blame if persons of slightly below average <Col N="1338" /> intellectual endowment or a combination of that and deprived upbringing, finish up in prison.</P>
    <P>A good deal of work can still be done in the training, retraining and employment of prisoners while they are in custody.  I appreciate that in many cases they are in custody for only four or five months and sometimes less.  Notwithstanding the efforts of the Department of Justice, a good deal of leeway remains to be made up in the area of work, training and education.  We have not done half as much as we could within the prison system.  A reasonable effort at educational development in prison and at obtaining work of good quality within the prison, is very good training.  I am confident that if during his prison sentence a prisoner can be shown how to do a typical industrial job, even for a short period, he will have a better chance of taking up normal employment when he is discharged.</P>
    <P>We all blanche at the thought of another committee.  Committees are the bane of Irish reform.  I advocate strongly the setting-up of an advisory committee for the employment of prisoners.  The trade union movement could be called on to make a better contribution towards the employment of prisoners.  Our teachers could make a more dynamic contribution.  Visiting committees to prisons could be more deeply involved in the training and employment of prisoners.  Employer organisations could also contribute in that regard.  I suggest therefore the setting up of an advisory committee for the employment of prisoners in the State on, if necessary, a semi-statutory basis.  This committee could develop work and training systems within the prisons.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister and the previous Government in regard to the corrective training unit in Mountjoy.  This is a tremendous step forward.  A point might be made to the shame of Deputies, especially Dublin Deputies, that they do not go near Mountjoy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, there is.  We are a little tardy in that regard.  Somebody might ask the Minister at a later stage for details about women's prisons.  Information on that subject was sparse in his contribution and I would strongly recommend that he elaborate on the matter in his reply.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I should like to congratulate the prison staffs for the tremendous work they did in the past 12 months.  I was pleased to learn that a further 70 prison officers are to be recruited because prison officers have been under an appalling strain in the last couple of years. A number of them are constituents of mine and I know of the strain they have gone through with almost permanent obligatory overtime.  I am also aware that the training system for prison officers is just a training system in name only.  They spend a couple of weeks here and there and do an induction course of four weeks duration, all of which is completely inadequate.  It is miraculous that the prison officers have done such a fantastic job bearing in mind the inadequacy of the training course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> The teachers who go to Mountjoy and St. Patrick's are also deserving of congratulation.  They have helped out greatly, particularly in the educational unit in St. Patrick's which is staffed by teachers from Scoil Eanna in Cabra.  The work of these teachers should be availed of more frequently because they could make a more elaborate contribution.  The Department are to be congratulated for the work they have done in the open centres, Shanganagh in particular. The work done there is very impressive but the visiting committee could be re-vamped and improved.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on a fine speech when introducing his Estimate.  It was unfortunate that due to the pressures of publicity in other areas his speech was not widely reported in the newspapers but it was a tremendous contribution. The Minister, now that he has settled into his Department, will prove to be a fine Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I can assure the House that any remarks I make will be constructive and I have no intention of discrediting the Minister in any way.  I fully appreciate the difficult task a Minister for Justice, irrespective of what party he belongs to, has.  The Ministry of Justice is a difficult portfolio and one which warrants the very highest integrity.  It is a very important Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> The Minister, in his opening speech, said that his basic concern must be for the security and safety of the State and its institutions and unless the State and its institutions could be secured from attack no progress could be made in the field of economic and social reform. I agree with that statement and I assure him of my co-operation to ensure that the basic institutions of the State are protected.</P>
    <P>On the question of crime, anybody resident in Dublin knows of the continuous increase in crime down the years.  It seems to be an unfortunate situation that the more affluent we become the higher the crime rate.  The Minister has informed us that in the year ending September, 1972, there were 39,237 indictable offences, an increase of 3.8 per cent.  That is a substantial increase.  I hope the Minister was correct when he expressed the view that this would decline, but the feeling I get, and the feeling of people living in Dublin is that crime is on the increase.</P>
    <P>The report of the Garda Commissioner on crime shows that crime in the past ten years has increased out of all proportion.  It is important that the Minister, and the Garda, should tackle this in a vigorous manner.  I do not envy the gardaí in the task they have. They are doing an excellent job but I doubt if there are sufficient gardaí in Dublin to deal with this increase in crime.  The Garda Commissioner's report stated that the crime rate in Dublin works out at 28 per 1,000 and in the country areas it is comparatively lower.  It is obvious that more policemen are necessary to keep supervision in the city, especially in the areas where we have local authority flats.  It is unfortunate that down the years local authorities took the view that these high-rise flats were a quick way of housing people but I doubt if they serve their purpose as far as being the proper place for people to live in.  No consideration was given to the need to have proper playing facilities for the children.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the greatest part of our crime comes from these urban areas.  Many of those guilty of crimes come from deprived backgrounds but <Col N="1342" /> when one sees and understands the background of some of these offenders one can understand the reason why they have embarked on a career of crime.  They are living in bad conditions and quite often their fathers are unemployed.  If we are to make any headway we must tackle this situation through the juvenile liaison officers. It is important that the number of these officers operating in the city be increased.  A liaison officer can get to know the community, he can visit the youth clubs and the tenants' and residents' organisations.  In this way we can prevent crime.  I realise the duty of the policeman is to detect crime but much depends on the juvenile liaison officer if we are to direct young people on the right lines.  Reference has been made to the numbers of visits made by the juvenile liaison officers to youth clubs and houses in the last ten years.  It is necessary that we increase the number of such officers.</P>
    <P>Recently I watched a television programme which showed the work of these officers in Scotland.  They taught young people physical education and as a result of contact with them they won their confidence.  We should concentrate on this aspect because in this way the crime rate can be reduced.</P>
    <P>Frequently it is difficult for policemen to patrol areas containing blocks of high-density flats.  There may be a certain resentment felt towards uniformed policemen who are patrolling these areas, but a liaison officer in plain clothes can get to know the young people and learn of their problems. Many of these young people have little education; they may not have a happy background and indeed, some come from deserted homes.  A liaison officer may be able to encourage those young people to join youth clubs, to attend vocational schools and get training for jobs.  In many cases the liaison officer has been able to place them in good positions.  We read of many cases of housebreaking and other crimes but if the problem had been tackled at the beginning these crimes might not have been committed.</P>
    <P>In the chart attached to the report to which I have referred it is stated <Col N="1343" /> that in 1963 there were 16,203 offences, while in 1972 there were 39,237 offences.  In the course of ten years there has been an astronomical rise in the crime rate.  We must ensure that persons and property are protected. In certain parts of the city people are afraid to go out at night-time and anyone with a knowledge of the centre city knows that after 10 p.m. or midnight it is not uncommon to see brawls between rival gangs.  We know a special squad has been set up by the Garda Síochána to tackle this problem but anyone who runs a business in the city knows of the difficulties that exist.</P>
    <P>It is apparent that there has been a considerable deterioration in the situation. I know it is difficult for policemen to handle this kind of situation but we must show these people they will not be allowed to get away with this kind of vandalism.  They have shown a complete disrespect for property throughout the city, especially in the centre.  I am glad the Garda authorities have taken a firm stand and have let these vandals know that this city will be a safe place in which to walk at night.  I should not like to think we would become like some American city, and I have experience of one such place.</P>
    <P>Breaking and entering private property is becoming increasingly common. It is bad enough where commercial property is concerned but I take an even more serious view of breaking and entering private homes. It is obvious the same protection cannot be given to private property which is especially vulnerable when people are away on holiday or, for instance, where the husband may be away at night-time.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to a man recently who bought a colour television set prior to the installation of the communal aerials.  At that time the special type of aerial for colour television was quite obvious.  The man bought the television set on a Friday and it was stolen the following Monday while he was in his home.  It is difficult to know what society can do <Col N="1344" /> in such matters.  Householders have a part to play in preventing this kind of crime.  Frequently when people go on holidays they forget to tell the milkman they they will be away and, consequently, it is obvious to anyone who has the intention of stealing that the house is empty.  Some people draw the blinds but I do not think this is a very good idea.  The fact that blinds are drawn during the day is an indication that the house is empty.  The public must be careful in their behaviour and make sure that, by their actions, they do not encourage this kind of crime.</P>
    <P>The Garda have had a very difficult problem in the last three or four years, perhaps more difficult than at any time in the history of the State. The police force in the city are doing a worthwhile job and their behaviour in very difficult circumstances is a credit to the force.  This House should ensure that any necessary improvements for them are readily available. We depend for our security on these men but if they are not happy in their work we cannot expect a proper service.  I agree standards have improved considerably in the past few years but they are entitled to every benefit.  We need a considerable number of gardaí particularly in Dublin, especially when we see the crime rate in the built-up areas in comparison with rural Ireland.  Many of the additional police who were recruited over the past few years have to be deployed along the Border, unfortunately. I would hope that when the Border question is finally resolved they will be able to concentrate their efforts in the cities and towns for the proper protection of the community. They now have a task which must be done and therefore they cannot be employed in other places.</P>
    <P>It was said earlier today that a more extensive training course for the police is necessary.  That is true.  The course at the moment is not comprehensive enough and, by virtue of the time limit, I doubt that they are fully qualified to deal with a difficult situation in urban and built-up areas.  I know the police force would welcome this extension.  It must be difficult for <Col N="1345" /> a young boy who is recruited into the police force and who was never in Dublin before in his life, to find himself in Store Street, or Pearse Street, or Mountjoy, or Kevin Street, after a course in Templemore.  They lack the knowledge a person living in the city has.  It is difficult for a young policeman to go out on the beat never having lived in a city.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies appreciate the problem of any young person who come to work in the city as a civil servant or in business.  He finds it strange for the first five or six months and he does not have to parade in public and try to uphold the law. Even to live privately for the first five or six months in the city is difficult. It must be far more difficult for a young policeman to try to do his duty effectively in the more difficult parts of the city.  By and large he has no choice about coming to the city because the biggest number of the new recruits are allocated to the urban areas.</P>
    <P>When a number of new recruits are sent to Dublin they should be trained for the first five or six months in the easier parts of the city and phased in gradually to an urban society.  They can then be moved around gradually to the more difficult stations.  I have no doubt that the Department can easily pinpoint how the crime rate stands in various parts of the city where experienced policemen are needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said they are looking at the possibility of providing new police uniforms, especially in the summer.  I know that a light uniform is available for policemen on traffic duty during the summer.  In warm days the present uniform is rather cumbersome and heavy.  A uniform in a light material and a light colour would be more appropriate in the summer.</P>
    <P>Many of the police barracks in the constituency of Dublin Central are very old.  They must have been built 100 years ago.  I am talking especially of places like Kevin Street, Kilmainham and the Bridewell.  I know it is a difficult problem completely to remodernise old structures.  When they were built they were probably suitable. <Col N="1346" /> We all require improvements in our places of work and the police force are also entitled to an upgrading of the standards in their places of employment. These police stations could be up-dated and improved immensely. Certain improvements were carried out in Kevin Street and they are welcome, but improvements should also be carried out in the Bridewell and Mountjoy, which are also in my constituency. This would help the police force in their difficult task of combating crime and various types of hooliganism.</P>
    <P>The public must be made aware of the important functions of the police force.  In olden days they had a bad image.  The public thought that the police were against them.  They are now developing an awareness that the police force are there to protect and help the public.  We must cultivate this new outlook because there is still a hostile attitude towards the police force in some sections of the community. We must try to build up a good public image for the police force. We must try to integrate the police force into the public at large.</P>
    <P>The juvenile liaison section of the police force can build up a good image of the police.  They can integrate into youth clubs and into homes.  The figures given of the number of visits made by liaison officers are very encouraging. I hope developments along this line will show young people in built-up flats, and parts of the city where they are very liable to fall into crime, that we have a sufficient number of liaison officers to meet them and to encourage them to attend vocational schools and eventually find a position in life.  If we do this we will certainly reduce the number of crimes.</P>

      <P>The answer to the question is this.  There is, of course, a need of a certain kind in many isolated areas for telephone kiosks and this is expressed from every part of the country.  My Department, quite obviously, must set certain priorities as it always did&mdash;this did not just suddenly come into being in March of last year, as the Deputy well knows&mdash;and in providing these according to priority, of course there <Col N="1352" /> are certain areas which will be disappointed and deprived.

Although I am not minimising its importance, I do not anticipate that funds from that source will be going in that particular direction.  They are more likely to be required in other directions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the reason a telephone kiosk of this nature in a sub-post office is not used is that there is no privacy and also that the post office is only open during certain hours?  A survey by his Department would be very much hindered by those two factors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">

      <P>There are 11 houses in the immediate vicinity of the sub-post office&mdash;this is the scale of the problem we are dealing with here&mdash; and four of these have telephones. The call office telephone in the sub-post office is little used.  The revenue amounted to £37 in the year ended 31st March, 1973.  The provision of a kiosk is not warranted at present.  If the use made of the call office increases substantially, the question of its inclusion in a future programme could be considered.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Minister may not be fully aware of the situation in country areas.  He probably has no experience of rural post offices.  In the case of these sub-post offices, as I said already, people are reluctant to use the open phone because when they go into a shop there are people at the counter and everybody can hear their conversation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy well knows, this applies in many areas of the country.  People would prefer kiosks.  I would prefer to provide them as I am sure my predecessors also would have preferred.  I have explained the difficulties in the way, the priorities that have to be assigned. The sub-post office in which the Deputy is interested and other sub-post offices in which other Deputies are interested, do not match up to the priorities.  Only when they begin to match up can they be included in the scheme.</P>

      <P>I can answer the question.  The creditable receipts from the Main Street kiosk for the year ended 31st March, 1973, totalled £431.  It is estimated that about 30 calls a day are made from the kiosk and this is not regarded as excessive use.  The creditable revenue would need to be of the order of £500, or £600, on the charges effective since 1st October, 1973, before an additional kiosk would be warranted.</P>

      <P>If I am not interrupted by any Deputy opposite I will try to answer a question put by one of their number.  There is a big volume of work in progress and awaiting attention in the Dublin North Engineering District of which County Monaghan is a part.  The number of waiting applications on hand represents about ten months' work on connections. The Monaghan area is representative of the district as a whole.  The best forecast that can be made for clearance of the waiting applications in County Monaghan is that service will be provided for the remaining 1971 and 1972 cases during the summer, the majority of 1973 cases before the end of the year and the balance early next year.  In short, the existing waiting applications will be cleared within the next 12 months or so.  I share the Deputy's concern about that situation and I regret it for the sake of the people affected in Monaghan.  He has asked me whether I will see to it that proper priorities are observed among those on the waiting list.  I shall, of course, as I do in all other areas try to ensure this and if the Deputy brings any particularly hard cases to my attention of people deserving of priority for illness or some other reason I shall certainly <Col N="1366" /> always try to meet him or any other Deputy.</P>

      <P>The telephone line of the fire brigade and ambulance officer was affected by extensive damage to line-plant caused by the storms of 11th and 12th January.  The repairs required the replacement and rejointing of aerial cable which had been broken by falling trees and it was not possible to restore service until 17th January.  There is, however, a special arrangement in force in Maynooth automatic exchange whereby calls to the fire brigade and ambulance officer's telephone can, in the event of a fault on his line, be automatically diverted to the telephone of his assistant and this arrangement was put into force when the first mentioned telephone was reported faulty.</P>
      <P>The conditions which existed in the aftermath of the storm were exceptional. When repairing main cables and priority lines, repairs were carried out at the same time to ordinary telephone lines affected where this did not require a great deal of work. There was, however, no question of not giving priority to the emergency services.</P>

Can the Minister say why supply was restored to his next door neighbour and why supply could not be restored at the same time to Mr. Flood who is in charge of the fire brigade and ambulance service?  Would I be right in saying that representations were made for his neighbour to have that supply extended to him and restored? Would the Minister not agree, if he looks at his file, that the information he has given me is not factual and that whereas his letter states, and he states in the House, that supply was restored on Thursday my information and the information which I am led to believe is correct is that the supply was not restored until Saturday and, lastly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.  As indicated in the agreed statement issued after my recent meeting <Col N="1379" /> with Sir John Eden, British Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, on the question of an Irish &ldquo;Open Broadcasting Area&rdquo; Sir John has agreed to ask the BBC to estimate the cost of providing BBC 1 in its entirety for broadcasting here.  He explained, however, that if the Irish Government found the arrangements acceptable and decided on broadcasting a BBC service in the Republic this could not be construed as binding the British Government to broadcast RTE in Northern Ireland.  He also explained that the British Government had not yet decided whether the Fourth Television Channel should be brought into use and that any decision about its use in Northern Ireland would have to take into account the Government's general broadcasting policies at the time and the views of the Northern Ireland Executive.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that the Northern Ireland Executive will be receptive to the idea of providing a wider choice of programmes on a reciprocal basis throughout this island and as I mentioned in my reply of 24th October, 1973, to a question by Deputy Brugha, the indications are that opinion in Northern Ireland is moving in the direction of making the RTE service available to all in the North who want to see it.  I believe that, in Ireland as a whole, the movement of opinion is in favour of lifting such restrictions and widening freedom of choice, within the framework of democratic responsibility.</P>

      <P>Although the present RTE television service provides a service for about 98 per cent of the population, there are many areas throughout the country where reception is not, unfortunately, satisfactory. It is not possible to give any precise figure for the number of such areas, some of which would be merely small pockets containing a few houses. There has been no appreciable change in the position since this time last year.</P>

      <P>RTE carried out work to increase the reliability of the transposer serving Cahirciveen during 1973 and were involved in a co-operative effort with the Leap community to provide a simple cable <Col N="1382" /> system there as a method of improving reception.  The last transposer provided by RTE was in December, 1972, to serve the Bantry area.  It had been hoped to provide transposers to serve Roscarbery and Clonakilty before the end of 1973 but delays in delivery of the equipment render this impossible. The storms in the recent past have contributed further to the delay as the ESB have not been able to provide electric power to the transposers because of staff diversions to deal with the storm damage.  RTE have not got a forecast of when the ESB service will be provided.  RTE completed a detailed examination of reception in the country as a whole and proposed a three to four year programme costing about £1.25 million which they suggest would be financed by repayable Exchequer advances.  This matter is at present under consideration.</P>

      <P>Mails to and from County Donegal were routed via Portadown, Strabane and Lifford up to November, 1971.  Because of difficulties caused by violence in that area they have since had to be routed via Sligo.  This involves the conveyance of mails over a greater distance and the unavoidable results have been that morning deliveries in most of the county are somewhat later than formerly and posting times somewhat earlier, while second deliveries have had to be suspended in some places. Apart from these alterations, the standard of service has been maintained and the majority of items which would have secured next-day delivery under the pre-November, 1971, arrangements still do so.  However, I will be glad to have any particular cases of delay investigated, if the Deputy cares to furnish details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that an inefficient postal service is a serious setback to the commercial and business life of any county, and particularly to the almost isolated county of Donegal.  While I appreciate the change he made in rerouting the transport via Sligo in recent times, we have had a rather erratic delivery and despatch of mail. On some occasions the mail arrives on the second day but on other occasions it does not arrive for three or four days.  This is hardly explainable by the fact that the mails have had to be routed via Sligo.</P>

The fact is that the provision of the service is <Col N="1384" /> being as efficiently conducted as is possible in the circumstances which have been caused by the peculiar political situation in the area as a result of violence.  I should like to place on record a tribute to the postal workers concerned for what they are doing in difficult circumstances and I am sorry Deputy Brennan did not see fit to do so.</P>

      <P>Bord na Móna are the national authority charged by the Government with the exploitation of our turf deposits.  The annual tonnage of briquettes and machine turf produced <Col N="1386" /> by Bord na Móna for sale to the public is at present about 800,000 tons which is in excess of the average combined production during the years 1944/48 by the county councils and Bord na Móna.  In addition Bord na Móna are at present supplying about 400,000 tons of machine turf and about two million tons of milled peat a year for the generation of electricity over and above the quantities produced in 1944/48.

Further, would the Minister indicate if other agencies might be brought into this, for instance, the Department of Local Government?  There is no use in the Minister splitting hairs and talking about the money under his control. This is a national emergency and, as far as Donegal is concerned, it is a major emergency.

With regard to money for roads, my Department can only provide money for roads leading to bogs.  The Department of Local Government provide for ordinary county roads.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The current restrictions on deliveries of oil products are based on the normal requirements of all areas and I am satisfied that the Donegal area is suffering no greater hardship than other parts of the country.  Accordingly, there would be no justification for making additional supplies available to County Donegal or any other particular county or area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making my orders I have been conscious of the need to give priority to certain sectors and accordingly the cut for agriculture, horticulture and commercial fishing has been kept <Col N="1391" /> down to 10 per cent of normal requirements. I have also arranged that, because of its importance, the machine turf industry is to receive up to 100 per cent of last year's requirements. Also, recognising that transport is an essential service, I have provided in the recent orders made by me that the restrictions on deliveries of gas diesel oil, kerosene or fuel oil shall not apply to: (i) CIE; (ii) Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company; (iii) plated hauliers; (iv) licensed road passenger services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Question No. 38 can be taken with the other questions.  While Questions Nos. 36 and 37 deal with fuel oils, Question No. 38 deals with the fuel crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I did not see the justification for treating it differently. If, as the Deputy has said, there is no railway in the county, I would point out that these orders are based on a base period 1st October, 1972, to 31st March, 1973.  Presumably the use of fuel oil and petrol was proportionately higher in Donegal at that stage than in other parts of the country where there is a railway service. Consequently, their quota this year would be correspondingly higher than in other parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get clarification of the evident mixup of Question No. 38.  In view of the difficulties of transport in Donegal and the fact that other transport companies from outside the county are not inclined to use their petrol and oil supplies <Col N="1392" /> to travel to Donegal because of its geographical position, this does not mean there is a quota in Donegal based on the volume of traffic to and from that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a restriction on the supply of oil and other fuels but the Deputy is wrong when he says there is not a quota in Donegal for these people.  If they were going in there on the base period last year, of course a 90 per cent quota is there for them, if they drew supplies there last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that road hauliers are reluctant to go into Donegal delivering stuff because they have difficulty in getting supplies to return because of their increased consumption, and they could do more profitable runs to other places where the same consumption of diesel oil would not be required?  This lack of railway services calls for special consideration for County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree.  If there was a base period last year in which because there is no railway in Donegal there was more use of road services by lorries and cars, then that increased use in Donegal is reflected in this year's quota because there is a percentage base.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The quota is in Donegal because that is where it was drawn last year.  If the haulier filled his lorry in Dublin and went to Donegal and filled up there again that quota is wherever he filled up in Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's various replies, could I ask him whether he is aware that the practice today is somewhat different from what it was in normal circumstances? Is he aware that the driver of road transport going from whatever point to a given point and returning, must ensure that he not only takes fuel with him to get him there but that he also has enough fuel with him to take him back and that this is working sadly to the disadvantage of transport to and from Donegal?  In addition, will he not concede that having regard to the absence of railways to and from Donegal, while it would have the effect, as he says, of higher quotas as a result of greater usage in the past, the difficulties being encountered as a result of the shortage of fuel and the isolation of the county are aggravated by the fact that because Donegal has no railways cannot, as other counties are doing, divert some of the traffic that heretofore was carried by rail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point that Deputies are trying to make.  If transport going into Donegal on the base period last year was picking up <Col N="1394" /> fuel in Donegal for the return journey, that fuel is in Donegal now on a quota basis and should be available for hauliers going from Dublin or Galway or Limerick or anywhere else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If you want a truck to go to Donegal now the first thing you are asked is: &ldquo;Will you fill us up when we get there?&rdquo;  In the case of trucks coming from Donegal there is no place here that they can fill up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether, in view of the prohibitive prices of fuels, he will consider conducting a survey of all bogs from which turf cannot be cut due to their waterlogged condition; and if he will make a special fund available for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have in mind the introduction of emergency schemes such as was done during the last world war period.  I do not consider that the extent or possible duration of the present difficulties would justify the introduction of such schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funds are already available under the local improvements scheme, for which provision is made in the Vote for the Department of Local Government, <Col N="1395" /> for the drainage of small bogs worked by groups of farmers.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that Bord na Móna are preparing plans to expand their activities, including a substantial increase in the production of sod peat and briquettes for sale through their normal outlets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask one general question which the Minister will be able to answer in relation to all these questions so far.  In view of the energy crisis, has he had consultations with any of the relevant authorities such as the local authorities, or the officers of his own Department and other Departments, regarding the need to do something in a special way to meet the increased turf production which will be required this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Have I had discussions with other Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Surely this is a national problem with regard to the potential output from the bogs this year over and above any other year due to the emergency.  If the Minister is doing his job, he must be probing the requirements to meet this in the matter of roads, a survey of bogs, construction of new roads, the allocation of bog plots, a survey of what bogs are available in the country and where Bord na Móna will open new schemes.  This is a national emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a national emergency.  It is a very serious situation but it is not an emergency.  Bord na Móna are the statutory authority with responsibility for turf.  As I said in reply to this question and to an earlier one, they are preparing a report for me on how much further they can go into bogs that appeared to be uneconomic up to now.  Up to last September, they had decided that they were at the limit of bogs that could be uneconomically harvested. That position has changed because of the increased price of oil making turf more competitive than it was up to that.  They are at present investigating for the Department of Transport and <Col N="1396" /> Power what other bogs can be brought into production as quickly as possible.  As I said to Deputy Cunningham, obviously this is urgent because the harvest season for turf is coming near and they must have a decision made and a list of the bogs ready to go ahead at that time.</P>

      <P>Deliveries of gas diesel oil for agriculture and agricultural machinery are at present restricted to 90 per cent of requirements.  Where a farmer did not receive a supply of oil during the basic period or increased or decreased his business significantly or changed the character of his business since March, 1973, there is provision for determination by me, after consultation with the oil wholesaler or distributor concerned, of a revised quota.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that by exercising reasonable care and economy farmers can carry on normal operations within these allocations.  The delivery of petrol is restricted to 82½ per cent of requirements in the case of retail outlets and 90 per cent in the case of commercial consumers.</P>

    <P>These are the highest levels of delivery that can be made in the current supply situation recognising priority and essential needs.  Agricultural needs are regarded as a high priority and are on a par with industrial processing.   <Col N="1399" /> Should there be a further improvement in the situation the restrictions will be eased to reflect the improvement.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>Pursuant to orders made by me under the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, 1971, deliveries of oil products are restricted to percentages of deliveries made in the period of six months ended 31st March, 1973. Under the most recent order made on 30th January, wholesalers and distributors are required to deliver up to the limit of the quota so fixed within a tolerance of 100 gallons.  Where no appropriate quota exists or where a customer's business has changed significantly in volume I may determine an appropriate quota and I have done so in a number of cases.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that discrimination of the kind referred to by Deputy Callanan is being practised. One specific complaint of this kind which was made to my Department was on investigation found to be without foundation.  I am prepared to have investigated any other specific case brought to my attention.</P>

      <P>Yes.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Arab States reduced production following the outbreak of the Arab/Israeli war and imposed an embargo on deliveries to certain destinations.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>I have explored with the oil companies and other parties the possibilities of securing oil from production sources.  A number of offers of varying degrees of credibility have reached my Department through various channels. They all involved large amounts, high prices and long-term contracts.</P>
      <P>The Whitegate refinery has a total throughput of about 2¾ million tons a year.  Supplies of crude throughout the crisis have not dropped below 80 per cent and are at present at 100 per cent.  It would not be possible, therefore, to process any significant quantities of crude oil through the Whitegate refinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if quantities of crude which the Irish market could absorb in refined form, could be obtained and refined abroad it would still be necessary to provide for their importation and distribution through commercial channels which possess the necessary storage and distribution facilities.  It was stated to be a condition of the various offers which reached me that oil should not be handled by any of the major oil companies.  In general, none of the proposals which I have investigated so far appeared to offer a practical prospect of securing additional supplies at tolerable prices and <Col N="1404" /> without the danger of prejudicing supplies through normal channels.</P>
    <P>The proposal was that the Government should enter into a five-year contract for the purchase of five million tons of crude oil per annum at a price corresponding to then current reported prices for participation oil, that is oil sold by Arab states to independent customers, but alleged to be capable of negotiation downwards. There was also to be a brokerage fee of $2 per barrel.  It was claimed that the refining of the oil could be arranged abroad and products not required by Ireland bought back by the promoters of the deal.  The Government would thus be committed to trading in oil products to the value of some £150 million per annum under a five-year fixed price contract which included commission to the brokers of some £30 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Were it practicable at present to provide additional supplies of products for the Irish market by the purchase of crude oil from producing states I am confident that we would be able to deal direct with them in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite catch what the Minister said.  Were any efforts made to purchase oil directly other than the efforts by some brokers to flog oil?  Did the Minister make an effort to negotiate the direct importation of oil either in the context of the present emergency or on a long-term basis particularly to ensure that the panic created in the last few months would not recur?  In relation to the effort which was made to flog oil here by some brokers, particulars of which the Minister has just given, has he got an indication that there is oil available to those who are prepared to give most for it?  Is he also aware that we are the victims of a colossal cartel which is actually creating a situation where high profits on oil are to be obtained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There was always crude oil available during this emergency, participation oil which I have referred to, at very exorbitant prices I refused to deal with people who wanted a long-term contract for this <Col N="1405" /> oil at these prices because I would not tie this country to paying enormous sums of money for five years hence. There is also the fact that a commission was looked for for two individuals, which would be on the back of the taxpayers for the next five years, at £30 million a year.  I think my attitude to this is quite correct bearing in mind what happened in the Kuwait Oil Market yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just stated that two people were going to make a whole lot on this particular oil deal.  Is it not a fact that unless he deals directly on a sovereign State to sovereign State basis the same thing can happen again?  Is there any difference between a brokerage company and a large combine, such as Esso and the others without naming the seven of them making a profit?  Is it not the same thing except a different pattern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly agree that in future this country should, if possible, be self-sufficient in its oil supplies.  The fact of the matter is that for a great number of years now crude oil to this country could only be refined at Whitegate, which supplies less than half of our needs.  It is the only refinery in this country.  It is owned, by the way, by three of the major companies.  Transport in regard to that crude oil is owned by major oil companies and the distribution chains in this country are owned by the major oil companies.  There is no way in the short term that we could get out of their hands.  This is the reality of life in the oil business at the moment.  In answer to Deputy Brennan's question the Government are looking at this to see if there is any possibility of direct importation of oil but, as I pointed out we must have additional oil refineries.  Crude oil is no good to us.  Whitegate is running at 100 per cent of its capacity. Offering us crude oil at the moment is like going into a tailer, offering him a flock of sheep and asking him to make a suit for you.  That is the analogy in regard to offering crude oil to the Irish Government at the <Col N="1406" /> moment.  We have not the transportation, the refining capacity or the distribution systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that we have not transportation. Is it not a fact that it is very easy to charter tankers at the present time to transport oil?  Is it not a fact that it is possible to get crude oil refined on the Continent at the present time if we want to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is easy at the moment.  It was not easy before Christmas.  It is much easier now to charter tankers.  They are available reasonably freely at the moment. There is some doubt as to whether we could have got oil refined on the Continent.  I think it may have been possible to do that but we have not got the distribution system here in this country.  The distribution system belongs to the major oil companies.  A condition of all the offers we have been made of crude oil was that it should not be handled by the major oil companies.</P>

    <P>The current orders restricting deliveries are in force until 31st March and I presume that circuses will not start their tours until after 1st April.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to the United Kingdom legislation introduced in early December, 1973, subjecting the export of petroleum products to licensing.</P>
      <P>There have been discussions with the British authorities about the impact of these restrictions on supplies of oil products to Ireland.  They recognise that Britain and Ireland are parts of a single integrated market in which the oil companies maintain supplies to all their customers on an equal basis.  They have agreed to licence exports to Ireland on a basis equivalent to the general level of supply in the whole market.  While I have had reports of some delays and difficulties in connection with the issue of licences, the general flow of oil products at an equitable level has been maintained and I do not anticipate a change in this position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that stocks of coal held by coal merchants are low at present.  This is due to an increase in demand since the energy crisis arose in October, 1973, and difficulty in obtaining shipping to transport sufficient coal from Poland. Although there may be short-term difficulties, the position about supplies for the future seems to be reasonably satisfactory.</P>
      <P>As virtually all our coal comes from abroad the importers must pay the going price which, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, has been substantially increased in recent weeks.  It is not possible at this stage to give any reliable indication of future price trends.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that the Dublin Gas Company warned consumers of possible rationing two or three months ago and figures revealed that there was a substantial increase in supplies of oil to this company in the three month period up to December. Will the Minister comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Gas Company were in trouble about supplies of oil just before Christmas. They use a special type of oil called naphtha which has been in short supply and tending to become extremely dear for the last few years.  In fact, at one stage before Christmas they were down to a couple of days' supply. At that stage additional supplies of naphtha became available to them, <Col N="1420" /> some of them at very dear prices, as a result of which they were able to postpone their decision to bring in rationing of gas in the city of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the reason for the rationing scare by the Dublin Gas Company was that certain multi-national oil companies who have contracted to supply naphtha to the gas company were trying to opt out of their contracts because they were reforming the naphtha into petrol in order to get a higher priced product?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not.  I agree with the Deputy that one company which is a contractor to the gas company for naphtha were dissatisfied with the price they had negotiated, I think, six years ago and this question was resolved by arbitration in October before the scare came in December.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>Some complaints have been received in my Department in recent weeks about delays in deliveries of coal supplies in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the delays in deliveries are due to increased demand since the energy crisis arose in October, 1973, difficulty in obtaining shipping to transport sufficient coal from Poland, an unofficial strike in December and exceptionally wet weather. <Col N="1421" /> The coal merchants concerned have assured me that they are doing their utmost to expedite deliveries within the limitations of the supplies available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was tabled a considerable number of weeks ago.  It has been suggested to me that this question of a merger between the Dublin coal distributing companies has had a very severe reaction on consumers who have recourse to these firms.  I had complaints from people who had to wait four or five weeks before their needs were met.</P>
      <P>On the whole question of mergers, is it desirable, in the public interest, that these should take place when it is quite obvious that it is a disadvantage to the consumer?  It is significant that within the last week or two, because of the enormous increase in the price of coal, consumers are being satisfied.  I would ask the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, there is an answer to this question put to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. In regard to the merger of the Dublin coal merchants, this was done at the suggestion of the National Prices Commission about two or three years ago. They suggested that there was an awful lot of wastage of resources and men because of the fragmentation of the coal trade in Dublin.  They suggested, at that time, there should be one yard and one set of deliveries. That suggestion was put to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce who raised no objections to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put forward a suggestion&mdash;like Deputy Callanan&mdash;that the Minister might possibly appoint a co-ordinating officer to try to bring some order into the chaos in Dublin at the moment.  The old people of this city just cannot get coal, turf or any other solid fuel and I can assure the Minister that these people are suffering very markedly as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that what Deputy Moore says is quite correct.  I have a lot of sympathy for the people in that position, especially as they would be buying regularly small lots <Col N="1422" /> of coal and turf.  A number of Deputies in Dublin have contacted me about this.  I hoped that the position, even a fortnight ago, would have improved so that there should have been no problem then.  I agree that there certainly was a problem here from the middle of December until the end of January as regards coal.</P>

      <P>One last point.  Perhaps in this reorganisation the Minister might try to ensure that the small bellman will not be crushed by his big brother taking over this whole industry.  Perhaps the Minister might ensure that these smaller men will still earn their living out of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not got precise information as to the stocks of coal held by coal importers at the time of the recent price increase but I am aware that <Col N="1423" /> for the past few months stocks have been generally low because of increased demand since the commencement of the energy crisis and shipping difficulties.  There was a large backlog of orders on the date of the price increase and I understand from Irish Coal Importers Ltd., who undertake the bulk of our coal imports, that coal ordered before the date of the price increase was not affected by the increase.  I have no information about smaller firms.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the price of coal went up by £8.50 on the 30th January, 1974.  I am also aware that the demand for coal has been falling for a number of years in this country but, because of the energy situation here in October, there was a vast increase&mdash;up to 30 per cent&mdash; in demand for coal for the last six weeks which the coal importers were unable to meet for a number of reasons.  Firstly they resented having to pay an increase of 73 per cent in their contract price.  Secondly, because of the British miners' dispute, there was no coal available from that source.  Thirdly, because many other countries were seeking to improve their stocks of coal ships were not available or if they were they would have to pay increased charges and, fourthly, there was the very wet weather in which the Deputy may be aware that coalmen in the city of Dublin particularly will not deliver stocks.</P>

    <P>77.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if his attention has been drawn to the assertions of the mayor of Limerick that Shannon is dying; and if he will make a statement on the future prospects of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the reduction in traffic at Shannon Airport in 1973 and the decision of Pan-American Airways to cease the opertion of scheduled services to Shannon have given rise to some disquiet locally.  However, these matters should be seen and understood in their proper perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fall in traffic through the airport in 1973 affected mainly transit traffic which was down by approximately 17 per cent.  This type of traffic has always been subject to a certain amount of fluctuation, depending on a variety of factors outside our control, and it would be a mistake to attach particular significance to the returns for a single year, particularly a year like 1973 which was affected by so many special circumstances.  The <Col N="1430" /> drop in the more important terminal traffic was only 4½ per cent while the reduction in aircraft landings at the airport was less than 1 per cent.  I do not consider that the reductions of this order provide grounds for pessimism about the future of Shannon.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, concerned that there should be no avoidable interruption in the growth and development of Shannon and during the year I had consultations with the various agencies concerned and with all interested parties.  The study group which was set up under Aer Rianta auspices has been investigating the causes of the disappointing returns for 1973. The group attributes the traffic fall-off to a variety of factors including, in particular, the continued coverage given to the Northern Ireland situation, the uncertainty created in the American market by currency changes particularly the much reduced exchange value of the US dollar in Europe, the increased surveillance by the US authorities on the operation of illegal affinity charter flights and the failure of the new travel group charters to gain popular acceptance by the American public and travel trade.</P>
    <P>There was also a stoppage during the early summer because of an industrial dispute and during the last quarter of the year traffic was affected by the fuel situation.  The Deputy will appreciate that these factors were largely outside the control of my Department and this naturally affects the scope of the remedial action that can be taken.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these considerations, Bord Fáilte, Aerlinte and SFADCO are stepping up their promotional efforts in North America for the coming season.  The immediate prospects, as in so many other areas of activity, are governed by the fuel situation.  If there is no deterioration in this area, the prospects for the coming season are reasonably encouraging.  An indication of prospects for the North American market is the fact that advance bookings for tourist attractions featuring the Shannon gateway are currently running at 7 per cent <Col N="1431" /> ahead of the corresponding period last year.</P>
    <P>There has been good progress in the industrial estate.  During the year 1972-73, 11 new firms were established and expansion took place in six existing firms.  Employment rose by 435 jobs.  Since then a further six firms have been established and five existing firms have expanded. The Shannon town population increased by 800 during 1972-73 and there has been a further increase of over 600 since then.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to re-emphasise that the Government are fully committed to maintaining Shannon as the transatlantic gateway and to giving priority to the development of the Shannon region and the western areas.  In the light of Shannon's past achievements and the manner in which previous difficulties were tackled and overcome, I have every confidence in the ability of Shannon to meet the present challenges and to retain its position as a major development centre.</P>

      <P>It is CIE's intention that as soon as the section of canal is closed to navigation it would be permanently blocked and drained of water and at that stage the board would be prepared to discuss with the city commissioners the question of handling it over to Dublin Corporation for the purpose of improving the amenities in the area.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Maynooth Telephone Service.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for raising this matter on the Adjournment is because of the lack of answers I received to Question No. 23 this afternoon. My question dealt with the delay in restoring the telephone service to Mr. Tom Flood, Maynooth, who is the station officer for Maynooth fire brigade and for the local ambulance service.  This particular service serves all the area of North Kildare, Celbridge, Leixlip, Straffan, Kilcock, Maynooth and Donadea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are that on Saturday, <Col N="1436" /> 12th January, the service to 286222 was not available from 18.30 hours and it was restored on Saturday week, 19th January, at 16.20 hours.  On Wednesday, 16th January, the service was restored to a private line next door, telephone No. 286239.  I should like to give the details of the work carried out by the brigade and the ambulance during the months of December, 1973 and January, 1974. Calls in December, 1973, were as follows: 5th, fire at Carton, Maynooth; 7th, fire at Kilcock; 8th, fire at Kilcock; 8th, road accident at Celbridge; 11th, fire at Celbridge; 14th, fire at Celbridge; 15th, fire at Kilcock; 20th, an accident, which proved fatal, at Maynooth; 26th, fire at Naas; 29th, fire at Kilcock and 31st, fire at Rathcoffey. The calls for January, 1974, were as follows: 4th, accident at Enfield; 6th, fire at Kilcock; 10th, accident at Maynooth; 16th, accident at Kilcock; 17th, accident at Maynooth; 17th, fire at Maynooth; 19th, accident at Maynooth; 20th, accident at Celbridge; 20th, fire at Mulhussey; 22nd, accident at Kilcock; 26th, accident at Maynooth; 27th, fire at Celbridge; 28th, fire at Rathcoffey and 31st an accident, which proved fatal, at Enfield.  I give those details in order to give the House an idea of the work carried out by this service.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter by way of letter to the Minister and, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I should like to quote from the reply I received from the Minister which is dated 6th February.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, T.D., Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, wishes me to refer further to your recent complaint about the delay in restoring telephone service for Mr. Tom Flood, St. Anne's, Maynooth, who is the fire brigade and ambulance officer for the area, and the fact that service was restored a day earlier&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy is quoting but it is a convention of the House that if at all possible, names should not be mentioned nor should they be mentioned <Col N="1437" /> in a way as to make those persons identifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>In quoting the remainder of the letter I will endeavour to do that.  The letter continued:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for a veterinary surgeon.</P>
      <P>Services to Maynooth subscribers were very seriously affected by storm damage on 11th January. Underground and overhead cables were extensively damaged and repair work was put in hands immediately. In normal circumstances the two lines referred to are given priority attention in the event of faults.  On this occasion, however, due to the extent of the overall damage, progress on repair work would have been seriously impeded if some subscribers had to be identified and restored to service in advance of others.  The repair work was programmed with a view to restoring service in the area to normal with the minimum delay and the fact that this other person's line was restored first was, therefore, purely coincidental.</P>
      <P>A special arrangement is in operation at Maynooth exchange which enables calls for the fire and ambulance officer to be diverted to the assistant fire chief's residence in the event of a fault on the fire officer's line.  It is understood that this arrangement was in operation during the recent outage on the officer's line.</P>
      <P>The Minister regrets that the fire officer concerned had cause for complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information given there is not true.  The supply was not restored on the following day, it was restored on Saturday, 19th.  With regard to the special arrangements mentioned by the Minister, the assistant fire chief lives in another part of Maynooth.  A farm labourer, he is out during the day and is only available at night time. Therefore, the arrangements would not have proved entirely satisfactory. It might be as well for the House to know what happens in the house I have referred to when an alarm rings. When the telephone rings and the message is given that the fire brigade <Col N="1438" /> or ambulance is needed the man concerned turns on a switch in the garage which sets off a buzzer in the houses of the members of the fire brigade. This man drives his car to the local Garda station, switches on the siren there, opens the fire station and gets ready the brigade or ambulance.  The members are usually on their way within four minutes of receiving the call.</P>
    <P>To give an idea of what speed means in a case like this, this brigade were on the scene of a fire in Celbridge within nine minutes of receiving the call.  On 22nd January they attended an accident at Kilcock.  Any delay could have proved fatal for a little girl who was injured in that accident and the fact that that little girl is alive today is a tribute to the speedy service of this particular group of people who work voluntarily.</P>
    <P>As a result of the storm of Friday night and Saturday morning a lot of phones were out of order.  On that Saturday the man in charge of the fire and ambulance service went to Maynooth Garda station and, in the presence of witnesses, he telephoned Crown Alley, 775581 at 18.35 hours, five minutes after the breakdown.  He had some difficulty in getting through and getting satisfaction and he had to call the superintendent before he could get the right number.  Whoever answered him eventually gave him abuse.  I presume the person at the other end was under severe strain with calls coming in from many parts of the country but the fire officer was interested in having the phone restored as soon as possible for an important service.</P>
    <P>The neighbour of the fire officer, telephone No. 286239, lives just across the wall and he had his phone restored on Wednesday, 16th.  That is a private line to a professional man. I am aware, as is the fire officer, that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Deputy Bruton did intercede for this professional man.  More luck to this man if Deputy Bruton was in a position to get service restored quickly but if that could be done for a private individual at least the other line should have been restored at the same time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> The members of the Maynooth fire brigade feel they deserve top priority in restoring their phone connection. The Minister's letter did not assure me of that.  These men took on an ambulance service&mdash;I am not aware of any other fire brigade who operate such a service&mdash;after they had been assured by the fire chief and by the officials of the local authority that they would get priority.  The Minister should assure us that such a coincidence as occurred in this case will not happen again.</P>
    <P>The members of the fire brigade think they have a right for special treatment in a case like this.  They consider someone else was given special treatment and that a week's delay was too long for restoring a service of the kind they operate.  It is possible the Minister may not have been aware of all these facts, perhaps he was hoodwinked.  On at least two occasions he told me the telephone was restored three days earlier than it was.  The members of the Maynooth fire and ambulance services believe, and they have good reason for their belief, that Deputy Bruton interfered and made representations on behalf of a private individual whose phone service was restored.</P>
    <P>My reason for putting down a question today was to give those people an assurance that their services are appreciated and that priority should be given to them.  If what I have said is true, and it will take quite a lot to make the members believe otherwise, it is plain that somebody has been playing politics with the vital services of the fire brigade and the ambulance.  People's lives are not to be trifled with.</P>
    <P>I put down the question today to elicit information and I asked some supplementaries.  My appearance may be belligerent but I can assure the Minister I was not motivated by spite and I had no wish to barrack him. This is the first time I have had occasion to raise a matter on the Adjournment.  My only reason for doing so was to get an assurance from the Minister that he realises the importance <Col N="1440" /> of the service and that these voluntary workers should not be made political pawns.  If the Minister does not know the facts he should examine the files and he should set the minds of honest people at ease.</P>
    <P>It might be well to remind him that about a year ago, prior to the general election, the party with which he coalesced produced their hand-out which stated the following:</P>
    <P>On February 28th you have the opportunity&mdash;with your vote&mdash;to help transform Ireland into a successful progressive society based on social justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see the relationship between the item the Deputy is quoting and the subject matter of the question.  We should get back to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the Chair.  I can see no connection between the promise of social justice for the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also concerned with the protection of the individual, with the need to protect the liberty and the safety of the individual and to uphold the democratic institutions of the State.  I am convinced the example I have quoted gives no proof that the promises have been carried out.  The Minister's colleague, whom I hope has not been contaminated by his colleagues as yet, promised to restore some honour and decency to Government. I would ask the Minister if he would admit that there was a longer delay than he first admitted?  Does he not think the telephone service of the fire brigade and ambulance should have been restored when a neighbour was singled out for special treatment? Can he promise me this important service will get priority in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised the Deputy should complain of a lack of answers to his questions. He got a reasoned and a reasonable <Col N="1441" /> written answer, and he also got a rather longer than usual oral answer at Question Time.  However, he wants more information and I shall try to give it to him.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to his comment that although his appearance may be belligerent he had not been barracking me.  I quite agree he did not barrack me, although a certain amount of barracking was going on at the time.  I appreciate the Deputy is seriously concerned and it was entirely proper he should raise this question. I can also understand what is worrying him in this connection.  I appreciate the importance of the voluntary fire service and understand its importance to the community and the urgent necessity of restoring telephone communication for the voluntary fire service.  All that I appreciate, and if the Deputy were right in the supposition he has made to the effect that an unauthorised person got priority in advance of the fire service because of representations made to the Minister, this would be wrong. That is not what happened.</P>
      <P>The position is the following.  The two people to whom the Deputy is referring&mdash;I am debarred from mentioning names by the ruling of the Chair so I must be rather circumlocutory&mdash;are the voluntary fire servicemen and another person.  Both cases were priority A and both were entitled to immediate restoration of their telephone service where that was practicable.  I have to identify the other subscriber to this extent in order to say why he was entitled to priority &mdash;he was a veterinary surgeon and it is a principle in my Department and has long been that veterinary surgeons are entitled to priority A treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did one get ahead of the other?  The answer is a technical one. The installation of the voluntary fire service gentlemen is served by a polythene cable which was broken by fallen trees.  The county council had to remove the trees and supplies of cable had to be obtained before the repair work could be undertaken.  The repair work involved the replacing and rejoining of sections of cables, including a section that was underground <Col N="1442" /> Service was restored, according to my information, on the line on Thursday, 17th January.  I shall come back to this point because the Deputy disputes it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Saturday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come back to that.  I am not taking this information as necessarily gospel.  The Deputy may be right, the information I have may be wrong and I am ready to have it checked out again.  There was no avoidable delay in carrying out repairs.  On the other hand, the installation for the veterinary surgeon is served by open wires which were broken by the storm.  Obviously open wires are easier and quicker to repair and, consequently, the lines were restored to service a day earlier than the cable route to the fire service premises.  I can assure the Deputy that, and only that, is the reason the veterinary surgeon had his phone restored before the fire service.  If the supply of cable to the premises had been the other way around it would have been the fire service first and the veterinary surgeon then.  According to the priorities granted, neither was entitled to priority over the other.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy believes the information he has about the restoration of service.  I have checked on this matter and at this stage I have confirmed that engineering records show that the telephone of the fire brigade and ambulance officer was restored on 17th January.  However, in view of the Deputy's statement I shall have further inquiries made and will communicate the result to him.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that there was widespread disruption of services, an inevitable result of a minor natural disaster, the big storm on 11th/12th January.  As Minister I regret the disruption in question, which was particularly severe at Maynooth.  My Department are very conscious that disruption, particularly in priority categories, may have extremely dangerous consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the engineering, technical and other officers of my Department who worked extremely hard, and as fast as they <Col N="1443" /> possibly could, to restore communications after that difficulty.  I am sure Deputies opposite would wish to join with me in a tribute to those staffs. In conclusion, I may assure the Deputy&mdash;and I hope he will accept <Col N="1444" /> my assurance&mdash;that no improper priority whatever was accorded on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 26th February, 1974.</P>
