      <P>I should like to ask the reasons for the refusal by the Government to allow time, which was agreed at three hours on this morning, to debate the Dublin bus dispute.  The request was made by Deputy Dowling last week and, in deference to the suggestion of the Taoiseach, it was not pressed because at that time consultations were going on at the Labour Court.  I suggest that now that the bus strike is over it is no excuse not to have a debate.  On the contrary, to have a debate now would be about the best thing that could happen and no time would be more opportune to have such a debate.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition is aware that the request was to discuss the bus dispute which has now ended and the situation is very different.  If Deputies wish to discuss any matters connected with it, I suggest that the appropriate time would be on the discussion of the <Col N="650" /> Estimate for the Department of Labour.</P>

      <P>The fact that the bus dispute has now ended is not a valid reason.  The bus dispute happened and it was the longest bus dispute in the history of this country.  There were many reasons why this might have been avoided and these reasons could have been debated here.  There are many reasons that could be put forward to avoid a recurrence of such a long and, let me suggest, hardly necessary dispute.  I suggest that the immediate aftermath of that dispute is the most appropriate time.</P>
      <P>However, I have made my protest. It is unusual for a Government to refuse an official request by the Opposition Party to debate a matter of public importance of this nature.  I accept the Government's attitude and these attitudes can be taken up again when conditions change.</P>

      <P>May I have an answer to our request delivered to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, as Chief Whip, for an <Col N="651" /> Adjournment debate at the end of this session?

      <P>The matter can be considered but as the Leader of the Opposition is aware the Opposition have requested a longer interval between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill. This is a fairly wide debate in close proximity to the end of the session and, in the circumstances, if one debate is protracted it is not unreasonable to suggest that that would cover both aspects of the matters which the Opposition wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the debate on the Finance Bill is on the contents of the Finance Bill and on the taxation which it seeks to impose. A wider discussion, which is normal on an Adjournment debate, would almost certainly be ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, and rightly so.  I suggest that this is an attempt to deny us the usual facility for an Adjournment debate. It is another attempt by this Government to avoid criticism, genuine and necessary criticism, from the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sole purpose of this short Bill is to enable county councils to give increased contributions where necessary towards the financing of county committees of agriculture in the local financial year commencing 1st January, 1975.</P>
      <P>The committees of agriculture are financed each year by means of contributions from their respective county councils together with State grants related to such contributions. The State grant normally approximates to the local rates contribution by the county councils, but in the case of the 12 committees of agriculture in the small farms areas of the west and north-west of the country, further State assistance is granted by way of a contribution of 75 per cent instead of the normal 50 per cent towards the cost of employing adequate numbers of advisory staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> The existing statutory ceiling of county council contributions, which has been in operation since 1st April, 1972, is a sum not exceeding 15 times the produce of a rate of 1p in the £ in the area consisting of the county, exclusive of any urban areas therein.  Under section 1 subsection (1) of this Bill, it is proposed to increase the ceiling to 40p in the £ with effect from 1st January, 1975. This maximum does not, of course, make it mandatory on county councils to reach it or, indeed, to meet the demands of committees of agriculture, unless they see fit.</P>
    <P>Section 1 subsection (2) would enable county councils to make any necessary preliminary arrangements during the current financial year with a view to adopting a suitable rate contribution, within the proposed new maximum, in respect of the coming financial year.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade there has been a considerable expansion in the agricultural advisory services, the total number of advisory staff under the committee has in that period almost doubled from 354 to 654.  There is still a need, however, for further strengthening these services in most counties.  In recent times I have approved of the creation by each of the 27 committees of agriculture of a post of deputy chief agricultural officer with special responsibility for educational matters.  In addition, there will now be over 70 posts of senior instructor the holders of which will supervise, under the CAO, the work of all advisers in a particular advisory district.  A significant development in recent years has been the provision of much needed headquarters for committees of agriculture, and also the provision of new agricultural education centres.  To date 16 such centres have been provided at a total cost of some £415,000, and my Department have paid a total of £183,000 in grants towards the centres.  A further seven centres are under construction.  I have recently increased the maximum grant towards the cost of each approved centre from £15,000 to £20,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> In the year 1973-74 ten committees were on a rate between 14.5p and 15p (maximum) in the £, while a further ten committees were in receipt of the produce of a rate between 12p and 14p in the £.  Increased salaries have contributed to the deterioration in the finances of all committees, whose staff, in addition to having secured increased remuneration under conciliation and arbitration proceedings, have been granted the benefits of the national wage agreements, including the 15th round which was payable from 1st June of this year.</P>
    <P>This Bill is required, and is, in fact, essential to ensure that those committees which in the immediate future cannot carry out their statutory functions on their present incomes, will be permitted to seek sufficient funds to enable them to do so.  Some committees either now have or will have substantial deficits on 31st December next.  Unless action is taken now the position will deteriorate further.</P>
    <P>I would see an advantage in having the statutory upper limit abolished entirely, if only with a view to avoiding an over-frequent resort to amending legislation which is inevitable in present circumstances of undue restriction on the necessary contribution from the rates.  I am advised, however, that the abolition of a maximum rate contribution as it exists would not be feasible unless it were substituted by other statutory amendments which would confer new powers on me thus limiting the activities and finances of the individual committees of agriculture. Because of the administrative and other difficulties this would involve and more particularly as it would remove from the committees and from the county councils a responsibility which desirably they would have, I consider that the present system should continue, but that the maximum rate contribution should be fixed at a sufficiently high level to permit committees of agriculture to perform their functions without an undue pre-occupation with trying to avoid deficits.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I consider that the existing maximum rate contribution <Col N="655" /> of 15p in the £ should be increased to 40p in the £.  Accordingly, I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening paragraph described this as a short Bill.  He could have gone further and said that it is also quite an expensive Bill.  By enacting it as legislation we will increase the contribution in many counties from the maximum of 15p, which it now is in ten counties, to 40p.  The difference as far as County Limerick is concerned is something in the region of £125,000 a year on the ratepayers of that county.  I accept that there is need for more money because the expenses of the county committees of agriculture are much greater now than ever before.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Increased salaries have contributed to a deterioration in the finances of all committees, whose staff, in addition to having secured increased remuneration under conciliation and arbitration proceedings, have been granted the benefits of the national wage agreements, including the 15th round which was payable from 1st June of this year.</P>
      <P>I would not have expected any Minister of any Government to lay the blame for the poor finances of county committees of agriculture on the just rights of the employees of those committees.  We all know that in years gone by the demands on the county committees of agriculture were small and few in comparison with what they now are.  We have heard, those of us who are not old enough to have attended, about the old winter farm schools.  This was one of the principal ways in which the agricultural instructor of the day communicated with the farming community.  He went along, sometimes in his bicycle, and later when people became slightly more prosperous, in his car, to different parts of his area to communicate, to educate, to inform and discuss with those involved in agriculture and to do his best to help them in every way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Things have changed considerably. There are now far greater demands <Col N="656" /> on the system and I believe that it is the greater demands on the system rather than increase in the salaries of small numbers of people that has led to the deterioration of the financial resources of the committees.  The days of the old winter farm classes are over.  We now have demands for farm schools in the daytime where young people want to learn more about agricultural skills, to be fully briefed on machinery, its operation and maintenance.  They want to be fully briefed in building and the mechanics of building so that in the present age of raging inflation if they have to build they want to be able to do it themselves.  There are many more areas of operation in which these services are required.  They should become much more involved with the farming community and give their technical and academic skills to the people who are looking for this information.</P>
    <P>We know many of our voluntary farming organisations have good plans that could benefit the agricultural community.  We know there is much more that has to be done, particularly in the small farm counties, where many of the young people who will take over family farms will not have the benefit of having spent a couple of years in an agricultural college and certainly will not be able to avail of agricultural studies at third level education.  This is the principal reason why the extra money is needed, not for the reason the Minister stated.  He devoted practically a full paragraph to the increased salaries.  Of course, they have contributed but this is not the major reason for the increased money.</P>
    <P>We all accept there will be much greater demands on our county committees of agriculture and our advisory services.  Let us be very clear, as we are on this side of the House, that it is wrong of the Minister and the Government to think that the present system of financing these committees is a good one.  It is not a good system in this day and age.  I am very disappointed that the Minister did not come in here this morning and give us <Col N="657" /> new methods of financing local committees of agriculture.  As I said, the difference in income between 15p and 40p in the county of Limerick alone is £125,000.  If the Minister or his officials think it is right that old age contributory pensioners, who must pay their rates, should be asked to pay more to provide services for the farming community, then I think something is wrong.</P>
    <P>We know that these services have to be provided.  Something should be done about the system.  The Minister has a glorious opportunity to do something about it but he has again reneged on one of his responsibilities. In the latter part of his brief he said he considered the present system should continue.  This can only be interpreted as proof of the Minister's intention to do nothing in the near future, or for however long he is Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, to relieve the burden on the rates when it comes to financing local committees of agriculture.  We know from him that in certain circumstances and in special cases some committees do not have to pay the ordinary ratio, the Department putting up half the cost and the local county committee putting up the other half.  This ratio is in operation in some counties.  We had from the Minister this morning a statement that in certain counties, the western and north-western counties, the Department pay 75 per cent of the finances of the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister is increasing the limit of the maximum from 15p to 40p is an indication that he wants to do a clean-cut operation so that, as he says, he can get this job over with once and for all.  It appears that having completed his job here today, he wants to put this extra burden particularly on poorer people who cannot afford to pay their rates, and to put this file into a drawer, lock it up and say that this job is out of the way for many years to come.  Until such time as the maximum of the 40p is reached, he will not have to bother again.  He feels he will not have to hit the ratepayers again as hard as he hit them today and perhaps when the <Col N="658" /> next general election comes they will have forgotten that Deputy Mark Clinton, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, came into the Dáil and, as far as County Limerick alone is concerned, hit the people for £125,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the least. I would welcome, at this stage with the permission of the Chair, any interjection the Minister may make to prove that what I am saying is wrong.  I know we cannot enter into a cross-examination on it but what I am saying is perfectly true.  If the Minister tries glibly to suggest, through a brief interjection, that what I am saying is untrue then I say to him he is either not aware of the facts, is not fully briefed, is not accepting his brief from his advisers or is deliberately trying to mislead this House to say in a nice, friendly, smiling but glib way that what I am saying is untrue.</P>
      <P>Let every Deputy work out what the difference in income will be in his own county when the maximum is increased from 15p to 40p.  It is very easy to work that out because one penny on the rates in County Limerick will bring in £5,000.  If the Minister wants me to do a multiplication sum for him I will do it but he can accept from me that it is a £125,000 increase in Limerick.  I accept that more money is needed to provide more and more services but if these services are to be provided let us not cripple the urban people, those living in the villages and towns throughout the country, small shopkeepers struggling to eke out a living against the many supermarkets.</P>
      <P>In this year and with our involvement in the European Economic Community agriculture should not be dependent on the rates.  It is now a very big business and it is a very bad decision if rates, which are a form of taxation, are to be used to finance the county committees of agriculture in their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister believes, as he professes to believe, in Government through consultation&mdash;he pays lip <Col N="659" /> service to that principle as do many members of his party&mdash;I should like to know what consultation the Minister or the Government had with the ratepayers with regard to this new blow to them.  I know for a fact that ratepayers, the roadworkers, shopkeepers living in towns and villages, will greatly resent the fact that they are being asked to finance a job which must be done when, in actual fact, the system is so old and so antiquated that one would have thought the Minister would have worked out a new system of financing the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>What control, if any, will the ratepayers have over the services given by the county committees of agriculture? What control will the county committees have over what is being done?  Is it a fact that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have far more control over the day-to-day operations of the county committees of agriculture than the Department of Local Government and the Minister have over the day-to-day operations of the county councils?  New thinking is urgently required in this field.</P>
    <P>Many farmers who are availing of services from the county committees of agriculture will not have to meet a fair share of the new demand on the ratepayers in the different counties because of agricultural rates relief.  The Minister knows that.  What I am trying to get across to the Minister, successfully I hope, is that the person who does not qualify for any rates relief and who is bordering on the subsistence line is being asked to contribute.  There is something wrong there.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has a social conscience.  Indeed, he had quite an active social conscience in Opposition. If he tries to justify what he is now asking us to do, and tries to get the country to believe, through this House, that what he is doing is the right thing, to my mind he will have completely lost whatever social conscience he had, even the one he had <Col N="660" /> when he was in Opposition.  If the Minister thinks it is right or fair that people in the urban areas, people who are dependent on small sweet shops, small cigarette shops, small grocery shops, roadworkers, should have to pay more tax to run a service which we know is needed, and which should be financed from the Central Fund, I am sure he will be able to enforce that system by marshalling his troops from the Labour and Fine Gael benches.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that, when we are here today making a case against further demands on the rates which will affect poorer people in particular, there is not one member on the Labour Party benches even to listen to what is being said.  That is a sad reflection on a party that purport to represent the labouring community and it could lead one to accept a suggestion which has been made that they are no longer interested and have been gobbled up by their big brothers, the big partners in the Labour-Fine Gael Government of the day.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the day-to-day operations of the different committees of agriculture.  I do not want to repeat myself, but every help and assistance must be given to them.  If we are to be competitive, as we must be for survival, particularly now that we are a member of the European Nine, everything possible must be done to ensure that those involved in agricultural production are fully geared in every way for doing the job they have to do.  No expense should be spared in giving the necessary education and advice to those on whom many of us depend because agriculture is the major industry.</P>
    <P>It is now time that we had fresh thinking on and a new look at this system of financing.  It is very wrong that the Minister of a Labour-Fine Gael Government should look for more money from the rates when he knows that the system of financing the county committees of agriculture, as it now is and particularly as we know it will be because of the greater demands on it, is so unfair and so unjust that, unless something <Col N="661" /> is done about it very quickly, we will be making a very foolish mistake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not anticipate that there would be any controversy regarding a measure such as this.  Those of us like Deputy Meaney and myself who have served on committees <Col N="662" /> of agriculture know that it is an advantage for a committee of agriculture to have the power to make a recommendation to a county council and the county council, in turn, have power to grant additional moneys if and when they are required for carrying out the important works and functions of the committee.</P>
      <P>This is more or less an enabling Bill.  It grants powers to county councils to increase their contributions, if they so desire, from the present maximum of 15p up to 40p. Everyone appreciates the dwindling value of money in recent years. Naturally, 15p will not do now what it used to do two, three, four or five years ago, and cognisance must be taken of that.  As we all know, county committees of agriculture are mainly composed of members of county councils and any demands from a committee of agriculture to the parent body, the county council, would only be made if the majority opinion on the committee of agriculture is that the obtaining of this money from the county council is necessary for the carrying out of their functions.  As the law stands, ten committees of the 27 in the country are at the maximum; the rate is 15p.  Therefore, if they require additional funds it would serve no purpose to request the county council to grant such additional funds even though they might be essential, as the council have no power to do so. What the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is doing here today by bringing forward this Bill is to give the council the authority to make this money available if in their opinion&mdash;there is nothing mandatory about the Bill&mdash;the granting of such funds is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was pressured not too long ago by Deputy Collins, in particular, to create additional powers and to advance the status of people dealing with the agricultural industry, such as agricultural officers and so on, and rightly so.  Everybody here recognises that agriculture is our main industry and as such deserves special attention and special credit.  The Minister is only 15 or 16 months in office and he has made a lot of changes in the structure <Col N="663" /> of our agricultural services.  I am relating my remarks to advisory services first.  Deputy Collins was not there but his predecessor, Deputy Gibbons, and the other Ministers that were in office in Fianna Fáil Governments down through the years, made little advance in regard to this question of restructuring the services, the appointment of deputy chief agricultural officers and also the appointment of senior agricultural officers.  The Minister met very fairly the respresentations of the agricultural officers organisation, and I say without fear of contradiction that Deputy Collins of the Fianna Fáil Party did not help in solving that dispute&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  Such occurences are unfortunate in a relatively small State like ours.  Whether we represent Fine Gael or Labour, Fianna Fáil, or are here as Independent Deputies, I believe there is an obligation on all of us to pool our resources in order to find the best solution and the best settlement possible for these disputes which disrupt the life of our people.  We have had the bus dispute, and goodness knows what other disputes we may have in time to come.  It is unfortunate this country is bedevilled by such disputes and disagreements, with strikes and so on, which hinder our advancement and impair our economy.  Our experience tells us that strikes are always around the corner.  I hope that for the future <Col N="664" /> we shall be relatively free of such disputes or differences.  I was relating my remarks to the agricultural officers' dispute which fortunately has been settled amicably.  Everything is moving again as it should move.</P>

      <P>The Bill deals with the need for additional moneys and the granting of powers to county councils to make such moneys available from their resources for works which the county committees of agriculture regard as necessary and justified. I think everybody agrees that committees of agriculture have contributed, and I have no doubt will continue to contribute, a great deal to the development of our agricultural industry.  Committees of agriculture are made up of people such as the Deputy I am looking at in one of the back seats of the Dáil, Deputy John Callanan, who in their own way have <Col N="665" /> a great deal to offer from their knowledge and practical experience of farming.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Callanan will get an opportunity of contributing to this discussion.  In any case, I believe that the autonomy enjoyed by committees of agriculture should continue.  Naturally if local committees are appointed from local representatives through local elections, then some of these charges must come from local revenue through rates.  This Bill does not impose any additional taxation or any additional charges on county councils.  It is purely a matter for each county council to decide whether or not in their opinion it is advisable to make additional moneys available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>But I did say earlier that in the main committees of agriculture are made up of county council membership, so that, in actual fact, Cork County Committee of Agriculture, for instance, constituted <Col N="666" /> of 28 members, all of whom, with the exception of one or two, are members of the county council, are making a demand for the money more or less to themselves.  The same applies in other areas, but everybody is, I think, clear that it is the function solely of the county council to determine whether or not the applications should be granted.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the desirability of office improvement and the cost of such improvements.  He said 16 centres are being provided at a cost of £415,000.  It is, of course, highly desirable to have such centres, and to have them properly equipped to ensure the smooth running of the centres by enabling staffs to work efficiently.  All this money will not be for advisory staffs only.  Other essential services may require help and, as a result of this, county councils will be able to grant such assistance if they wish to do so.  I think it was Deputy Collins who said this Bill could impose a charge of £125,000 on the ratepayers of County Limerick.  I think that was the figure he mentioned. I do not know where he got it or whether he just pulled it out of the sky.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of the Parliamentary Secretary, I showed how it would come about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has explained the reasons for putting the charge as high as 40p.  It is done to avoid the necessity of bringing in a new Bill every year or every two or three years, which could happen if he were to peg the figure down to 20p or 25p.  He has moved it up to the optimum to avoid the necessity for too frequent legislation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Deputy Collins' allegation that this will impose more burdens on ratepayers, the figures are there to prove the opposite.  We have the record of this Government so far as relieving ratepayers of liability is concerned. The record is an exceptional one in the history of this State.  We all know local revenue charges were increasing year in and year out and we had an annual outcry when it came to striking the rate to the effect that the burden was <Col N="667" /> becoming too heavy on the local ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's query, the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I have said this Government's record where relieving the burden of rates is concerned is an exceptional one.  In the two main fields of health and local authority housing, in the year 1972-73 local ratepayers were asked to contribute £43.2 million towards the cost of health services and local authority housing; in 1973-74, the first year of the National Coalition Government, the charge was reduced to £32.4 million and, in the current year, for the nine months from 1st April to 31st December next, the charge is reduced to £16.2 million.  One group that must be thankful to the Government is the group pressuring for a reduction in the rates.  Let not Deputy Collins try to tell me now that Fianna Fáil, had they been returned to office, would have removed rates altogether from housing. That was thought up only seven or eight days prior to the election on 28th February.  It was thought up by the policy planners of the Deputy's party subsequent to the issue by the Deputy of his election advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of interest, when was the Parliamentary Secretary's 14-point plan thought out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy suffered a little, but he was able to bear his suffering.  This plan was born, as I said, subsequent to the time the Deputy issued his advertisement. <Col N="668" /> Facts are facts.  When it is asserted that this Bill will throw additional burdens on the ratepayers, it will only do so if the citizens' representatives on the local authorities so decide.  The Minister will not command and neither will this Bill command any local authority to grant additional funds from local revenue unless the local authority so decide. I assume that any such decision will be taken by a majority of local councillors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given all the relevant facts and the reason for introducing this legislation. I am sure Deputies on both sides will agree that it is only right that local authorities should have these additional powers and that the county committees of agriculture should have the power to make requests for additional money, knowing that the local authorities have the power to grant those requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very disappointing Bill.  I assumed that a Bill like this would have included many provisions beneficial to agriculture in general and to the advisory services. I took it the advisory services would have to be expanded more and more. When we are discussing advisory servises here it should be realised that we are talking of both men and women in these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought the Minister would have something to say about decentralisation and, secondly, about regionalisation of the services in general.  We are moving into a new era.  We have the farm organisation scheme and the Minister is depending on the agricultural advisers to work that scheme. Surely the whole country will not have to submit all their reports to the Department in Merrion Street.  We were optimistic that regions would be set up.  We believed the dairying region, for instance, would have its own headquarters; it would probably be comprised of the Munster counties and possibly part of Kilkenny.  Then you would have the factory areas. <Col N="669" /> The Minister could have defined the different regions with their own headquarters which could issue payments, make decisions and sanction various grants and loans.  But that is not to be the set-up.  That has not been mentioned.  Apparently we are going to continue with the same old system, a system that has many flaws in it.</P>
    <P>If a county committee of agriculture decide to raise the money to the maximum and make a demand on the local authority will it be mandatory on that local authority to grant that demand?  Has this Bill got real teeth in it so far as the county committees of agriculture are concerned?  I agree they must have more money and I welcome any measures which will help towards this end.  I wish to point out the flaws in this Bill.</P>
    <P>What will the Minister say if a county committee of agriculture meet, decide they want to pay extra, get their headquarters and rooms for their instructors to meet the people and make a demand on the county council for 40 pence in the £?  Can the county council say that they will only give them 25p, 30p or 35p?  The county committee of agriculture must have some say in this once they make the demands.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that this Bill will result in higher rates to the ratepayers.  That is obvious under this system.  When the Minister brought in this Bill I expected he would make it a condition that the ratepayer would not have to pay a penny extra for the advisory services but that the money would come from central funds and the present contributions from the ratepayers in each county would not be increased.  The Government are boasting about what they are doing for the ratepayers. They say they are taking the health charges and housing charges off the rates.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about health and housing.  If he looked at the roads, water and sewerage schemes in Cork he would see that nothing is being done there.  No man will realise that more than he because he gets around.  He knows every road <Col N="670" /> there, be it narrow or wide.  It is very strange that he did not mention them in his speech.  When money was snatched from us last year and handed over to the county, the Parliamentary Secretary was as mute as a mouse.  He never fought for us one way or another.</P>

      <P>It is now up to the committee when they increase their money and go to the county council, to get a greater share of the money they collect. In most areas 50 per cent will still go back and in the western areas the Government will pay 75 per cent. It is the ratepayer who will feel this. All parties have agreed that our rating system and collection of rates are unjust.  It does not take into account the ability of the ratepayer to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition Government stated that they are taking the health and housing charges off the rates.  Yet the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries brings in a Bill which will put up the rates in any county which operate this scheme in full.  What does one deduct from that?  What can anybody say about it?  Is one to take it that the Minister for Local Government is more powerful within the Cabinet?  Or is it that the Minister <Col N="671" /> for Agriculture and Fisheries cannot put his case?  There are a number of people saying that he cannot put his case in Europe.  It is bad if he cannot get the same concessions as the Minister for Local Government.  If the Minister states in his reply that he will get this money from central funds, we will all back him to the hilt.</P>
    <P>It is about time that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries was decentralised.  Different areas should have their own regional headquarters. Agricultural schemes could be easily worked then.  A large amount of money will be required in the years ahead to implement these schemes.  Various instructors and instructresses throughout the counties will have to use a lot of common sense.</P>
    <P>A new post of deputy chief agricultural officer with special responsibilities for educational matters has been created.  That is very good.  All our instructors were trained in a certain way but not every one of them was able to give down-to-earth advice to farmers.  There is a great need for more classes throughout the towns, cities and small villages, for home management classes.  The housewife should be educated to buy wisely. How many housewives can walk into a butcher's shop and know the value of different cuts of meat?  These women are trying to raise families. They often buy the dearer cuts when the cheaper cuts would be just as nutritious.  There is a grave lack of education in that sphere.  I hope the deputy chief agricultural officer, when he takes over his responsibilities, will dwell on that matter.</P>
    <P>The young farmer was under pressure to produce more and ignore cost. Competitions were organised over a number of years to find out who was the best young farmer of the year.  He was judged on his output and not the actual profit.  This was very bad.  The Department and the agricultural officers should discourage this practice completely.  What is the point of ploughing in £1 if the return was only <Col N="672" /> 16s.?  There was no point in that.  It was based on a falsehood that the more one produced the more profit one had.  That was not the case.  Many a young man thought he could have his cattle out grazing in the early days of March.  We should all remember that weather conditions can affect everything.  We should face reality.</P>
    <P>At the present inflated cost of fertilisers, people should learn to use them better.  A few years ago agricultural instructors and others seemed to think that the pig slurry out of the silage pits was no good.  Now the position is reversed.  We should never allow such a situation to develop again.</P>
    <P>I have a personal request to put to the Minister which I know the Parliamentary Secretary will oppose.  Could the Minister include a clause with regard to the selection of temporary agricultural instructors or instructresses by the various committees of agriculture?  I have been a member of such a committee for a few years. It is very sad that when a vacancy for a temporary position occurs and the names are put before the members of the different parties those boys and girls will have to canvass every one of those members.  The applicants are depending on their votes to become temporary instructors or instructresses. It is very humiliating for parents who have educated their sons and daughters to have to go with cap in hand to every political member on the committee of agriculture to ask them to vote for their son or daughter. It is degrading and demeaning.  It tears through our educational system. I raised this subject in the Cork Committee of Agriculture.  Twenty-seven members voted.  The Parliamentary Secretary voted against me.  I had only four who supported me although that did not worry me.  We will have to have some kind of selection board.</P>
    <P>The applicants for other jobs in the county committee of agriculture come before a selection board and we do not have to vote for them.  I do not see why it is necessary for the parents of any child who wishes to get a job in any committee of agriculture to belong <Col N="673" /> to a political party.  There are many people who do not take any part in political life, who vote quietly without telling everybody about it, but if their children wish to get a job in the county committee of agriculture they have not a chance.  There will be somebody else in the area who has connections with Fine Gael, Labour or Fianna Fáil, or with the Independent Member, and they will be successful.  Before money is spent by the committee of agriculture, the Minister should bring in some clause to rectify this situation.  If he does that he will be doing a good day's work.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill because it makes provision for the necessary expenditure incurred by county committees of agriculture.  I should like to thank the Minister on behalf of the people of Clare, who will be contributing in rates, for the increased contribution he has made in the grant from 50 per cent to 75 per cent which will help small farms in the western counties.</P>
      <P>This measure should have been introduced many years ago but it was left to the present Minister to do it. In his wisdom, the Minister decided that committees of agriculture should continue to function and to operate the service they have been giving during the years through the agricultural advisers and the home management and poultry instructresses.  In fact, there are many more officers operating now than heretofore.  This is necessary because educational facilities are much appreciated by young people who intend to make their living on the land.</P>
      <P>I was very surprised when I heard some of the statements made by the shadow spokesman for agriculture. Usually he takes the trouble to get his facts right but on this occasion he made a few serious errors in his contribution. He spoke of his regret that the urban dweller will be saddled with the extra contribution in rates as a result of the measure to help the committees of agriculture.  I am speaking subject to correction but it is my reading that they are excluded.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a county council I am very familiar with the operation of the scheme.  The county manager exercises his function. The Opposition need have no fears about the ratepayers.  In fact, it is not mandatory that the committee of agriculture should reach its maximum of 40p in the £ with any specified limits.  Also there is a rates remission on the first £20 of valuation to all farmers.  Therefore, one can appreciate that people with low valuations will not be paying this additional sum if the committees of agriculture think it necessary to impose it.  And additional sums must be needed because salaries have been increased in the 15th round. It is essential, therefore, to ensure that there is an all-round appreciation of the work of all of the agricultural officers who are part and parcel of the agricultural life of our country.</P>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Meaney when he suggests that the practice of making it a necessity for a young graduate to go around from district to district, personally or with his relatives, canvassing a member of a committee of agriculture to get that member's vote in order that he would be appointed to a post on a committee should be discontinued.  I think it is a degrading practice to say the least of it.  It is one which is rotten through and through and one which should have long since been eliminated from our public life because it is a sad fact but the truth, that in areas where particular parties have a majority, there is a tendency to give appointments to people and families who are known supporters of a particular party.  This does not apply always but, when a party is in the majority, it can abuse its position.  But, in some cases, we find that justice prevails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, had we a broad membership in committees of agriculture, such as representation from the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party, the Fianna Fáil Party and the balance of Independents, <Col N="677" /> we would probably have different thinking.  In my own county, unfortunately, the Labour and Fine Gael Parties have not enjoyed the advantage of membership of the committee of agriculture, at least in my memory.</P>

      <P>Certainly I would support Deputy Meaney and I am sorry he is not in the House at the moment.  I would appeal to the Minister to give further thought to introducing a commission or an interview board which would sit and determine who would be appointed to such posts in order to wipe out this rotten practice which has not improved our image in public life over the years.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased the Minister has made provision for committees to carry on their necessary functions and that we can foresee in the future a much greater interest in the activities of committees of agriculture. We shall welcome the Minister's initiative in the years ahead in introducing many new ideas into his Department which would be channelled down to our county committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening paragraph the Minister states that the sole purpose of this short Bill is to enable county councils to give increased contributions, where necessary, towards the financing of county committees of agriculture in the local financial year commencing on 1st January, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the principle which the Minister endeavours to establish in trying to make more money available to county committees of agriculture but, like my colleagues who have spoken already, I am not happy with the manner in which the Minister proposes to have the moneys provided for the county committees of <Col N="678" /> agriculture.  We all appreciate the wonderful work done by them over a long period.  Indeed, they have been severely handicapped over the years through lack of finance.  In many instances it has prevented the degree of expansion which the committees would like to achieve.  In my own county we have been lucky in that we had down through the years members who were enlightened and who wanted to see our agricultural programme expanding in a way relative to the type of agriculture being pursued in the county.  As an example of that, I think we had the highest number of applications in the whole country under the small farm plan.  We had something like 3,750 and this necessitated an increase in the number of advisers in the county.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, when our committee applied for an increased number of permanent officials&mdash;I think we asked for 24&mdash;we got sanction for 12 only.  One of the reasons was that funds were not available to the committee in order to appoint the necessary officers to service this wonderful scheme which has now gone by the wayside as a result of the EEC programme.  The advisers have done a tremendous job.  They have managed to get down to talking with the farmers and explaining to them how farming can be approached in a businesslike manner.  We had many schemes, such as the pilot area and home management schemes, where the advisers maintained close contact with the farmers.  I suppose one could regard it as a personal service and the people concerned are to be commended on their wonderful work. But, as I have said, one of the snags which has persisted over the years has been that the committees have been handicapped through lack of finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that we allow county councils to go from 15p to 40p in order to assist the county committees of agriculture.  In county Mayo the rate is over £7 and this would mean that the county committee of agriculture in that county might be asking the ratepayer to contribute <Col N="679" /> in the region of £3 if we accept the maximum increase.  In a poor county like Mayo this would not be welcome.  The effect would be that the committee of agriculture would not be able to expand to the satisfaction of the members.  The members would be thinking of the ratepayers because the majority of them are county councillors and county councillors realise that their first duty is to the ratepayer, the person who elects them to the county council.</P>
    <P>While we have a very progressive committee of agriculture in Mayo they would be very slow to ask the ratepayers to make any advance in the contribution towards a programme of expansion.  One would have thought that the Minister would have been able to use some of the EEC savings or would have endeavoured to avail of some of the EEC funds in order to help in this matter of providing more funds for county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Another matter with which I do not agree is that this scheme will not operate until 1st January, 1975.  The county committee of agriculture in Mayo are constantly in the red and this Bill is not going to bring them any consolation for this year.  In his speech the Minister made reference to the number of extra posts which will be available because of the recent discussions with the advisory service. This is very welcome.  We had a situation where the avenues for promotion were very limited but the additional staff will mean that those on the advisory service will have more room for specialisation, something which is tied up at present but which, with the advances in agriculture, is very necessary. I hope the advisory services will always have the best attention of the Minister.  In my view the agricultural advisers are due a great deal of thanks from the nation for the wonderful work they have been doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider the question of imposing this provision on the ratepayers.  It is all very well to say that there is no obligation on a <Col N="680" /> county council to meet this extra demand but county committees of agriculture would be anxious to carry out the programmes and would find themselves in the position that they would have to go to the county council for the extra money necessary. They cannot have it both ways and we are leaving them in a position where the demand will have to be met by the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned educational centers but in my view this programme is not going as speedily as it should.  If this scheme means that the agricultural instructor in future will go to the educational centre, a departure from the traditional system under which the instructor provided night classes in local schools to the benefit of local farmers, I do not think it will be welcomed by the rural farmer.  The traditional system should be continued because in this way the agricultural adviser maintains the closest contact with the farmer.  He has built up this close contact with the farmers over a period of years.</P>
    <P>The ratio of farmers to an adviser should be reduced.  If one examines the figures for various counties one will see that even though advisers are doing an excellent job it is next to impossible for them to meet every farmer in their own area during a particular period.  I accept that this again comes back to the question of the necessity for money for county committees of agriculture because it is all part of a plan to develop agriculture. We all appreciate that we must have a sound programme and policy with regard to agriculture because it is our main industry.  If we have the situation in which agriculture is not going well the whole economy suffers.</P>
    <P>Even though this Bill may seem to be small&mdash;it has been described as a short Bill&mdash;it can have a very important effect on the future of our agricultural industry.  I welcome the Bill in principle but I ask the Minister to be more generous in his contributions from the Central Fund to county committees of agriculture.  The Minister should try to avoid the situation where it would be necessary to impose higher rates on the ratepayers who <Col N="681" /> are already finding it very hard to meet their commitments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Bill was not before the House I, and many members of county committees of agriculture, would have been making represensations and approaches to the Minister in an effort to ensure that a large scale financial contribution would be made towards the financing of these committees.  The three Members opposite I presume are members of committees of agriculture in their respective counties and I am sure they will agree that over the past number of years the situation has reached the point where committees of agriculture were working on a very limited budget. They were managing to exist on the contributions they were allowed to obtain from county councils.  Committees of agriculture have found that they were being asked to work on a shoestring.  The county committees of agriculture are the launching pads for all educational and working schemes in each county.  They are the most important bodies throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I have been here at Question Time on numerous afternoons and heard the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries being severely criticised for not making contributions to agriculture.  He came in here today with a Bill which will lead to a large-scale injection of finance to our most important industry. We had Deputy Collins, Deputy Meaney and Deputy Gallagher agreeing in principle with the Bill but voicing doubts and reservations, saying they are not happy with the method of payment and so on.  It is a serious duty of the Minister for Finance to ensure that the committees of agriculture are financed to meet the job that is at hand.  I believe the farmers will realise that it is necessary to ensure that the committees of agriculture are properly financed.  It is up to us as Members of Dáil Éireann and as members of committees of agriculture to ensure that the staffs of the committees work as hard as they can, which they are doing, and to their full potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers have expressed some doubts in regard to the method of payment.  It must be remembered <Col N="682" /> that whatever sum is put up by the county council is met pound for pound by the Department.  Agriculture needs this money at present and whether it comes from the Central Fund or from local funds we must ensure that agriculture is maintained as our foremost industry.  In County Offaly in 1972-73 our rates were 5.187p in the pound and in 1973-74 they were 5.15p in the pound which was a reduction.  This year is not a full calendar year but the rates are 4.28p in the pound.  The money must be found to ensure that our farmers receive the very best advice that is available.  It is unfair of Members opposite to have reservations about this Bill because if we want agriculture to continue as our foremost industry we must ensure that the money the Minister is looking for this morning is given with generosity.</P>
    <P>The committees of agriculture are our means of bringing to farmers the most modern technique in all aspects of farming.  Young boys and girls today attend schools, universities, colleges of technology in order to equip themselves for life but even after qualifying they need to keep up to date with educational matters because we are living in a changing world.  This is even more important in the case of farming because methods and techniques are changing so rapidly.  We must ensure that educational facilities are available for farmers in their own counties.  I am happy to say this is happening in County Offaly.  I am sure Deputy Callanan is ensuring that it is happening in his area too.</P>
    <P>Committees of agriculture are basically educational but they have other functions too.  They have a vast number of schemes in operation at present.  There is the small farmers incentive bonus scheme and there are different pilot schemes.  In Offaly we have an intensive system of cattle production and the Minister saw some farms in County Offaly last year and the excellent work that is being done there.  There is a vast volume of work carried out by those committees.</P>
    <P>There is one point the Minister did not mention in his speech and I think it is one of the main reasons why this <Col N="683" /> Bill is before us.  I refer to Directive 159 of the EEC.  All Deputies are aware that this directive will increase the volume of work for county committees of agriculture.  Deputies who are members of county councils have had to fill in some of the new application forms for grants and will be aware of the vast amount of information that is required when completing those forms.  Under this directive there are three categories of grants&mdash; development, commercial and transitional. There are 30 per cent building grants available for development and transitional farmers, 50 per cent grants for land projects and land improvement works.  It is the duty of committees of agriculture to ensure that our farmers benefit fully from the finance that is available from the EEC.  Each farmer will have to carry out the scheme set out for him by his agricultural adviser.  When this scheme is completed, he will obtain his benefits under the grant.  This shows how much extra work will fall on the different agricultural instructors. Extra advisors will be needed to ensure these schemes are properly carried out.  If those schemes are properly carried out, it will mean agricultural instructors will have to attend on a regular basis to ensure each particular farmer is carrying out his scheme and is doing everything in accordance with the regulations. It is important to ensure that the best services are provided for our farmers so that they can utilise the money available to them under Directive 159.</P>
    <P>I want to speak now about some of the projects carried out by the county committee of agriculture in County Offaly, especially that on the Sliabh Bloom Mountains, which run between Counties Laois and Offaly. At the moment 40,000 acres of land in this area in County Offaly are available for development.  There is a total area of approximately 100,000 acres available across the Sliabh Bloom Mountains in County Laois.  I hope the county committees of agriculture in Counties Laois and Offaly will consult with each other to work <Col N="684" /> out a development project for the benefit of farmers in this area.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should see how this land can be utilised to the best for the farmers in the area.</P>
    <P>Some farmers at the moment are utilising this land and they are carrying out schemes.  Some of them have carried out ploughing, seeding, drainage and have even made some roads through it.  This land is neither forestry nor grazing land at the moment.  It is suitable for very little. There is very beautiful scenery in this area and I compliment the Department of Lands for making some roads through it.  I believe in each constituency throughout the country there is a vast area of land which could be developed and utilised for the benefit of small farmers.  Farmers' sons should be able to obtain these lands, get married and rear their families.</P>
    <P>In the midlands different projects could be carried out by Bord na Móna.  I refer particularly to the bogland areas.  When the turf is cut away, excellent agricultural land is available in those areas.  Some of this land in County Offaly is used by Bord na Móna at the moment.  They have cattle on it.  Bord na Móna have done quite a lot of research but they have also got aid from the county committees of agriculture in both Laois and Offaly.  Around Ferbane and Banagher bogland is now available for vegetable production.  The Minister should look at the situation in regard to this because I believe a decision will have to be taken about the land which is available after it is finished for turf production, whether or not Bord na Móna should enter into cattle rearing or vegetable production on these disused boglands.  They originally purchased this land from farmers very cheaply.  It could be handed over to the Department of Lands for division among small farmers or Bord na Móna could enter into vegetable production and cattle reating.  A decision should be taken on this very soon.  It is important and the potential is there. In each instance our horticultural instructors and our agricultural instructors have given great help and <Col N="685" /> great service to Bord na Móna and have advised them on how to utilise this land to the best possible extent.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the question of different headquarters for committees of agriculture.  It is pleasant to note that 16 have been provided and seven are under construction.  Unfortunately, one has not been provided in Offaly.  The committee of agriculture in Offaly have an office in the Courthouse in Tullamore.  The chief agricultural officer, the deputy chief agricultural officer, the horticultural instructor, the home advisory service officer, the poultry instructress and approximately three typists all work in the same room.  One can realise the chaos in the mornings when farmers leave in calls for the day.</P>
    <P>There is a smaller office in the town but a suitable building will have to be provided in Offaly as soon as possible.  I hope whatever difficulties there are will be ironed out immediately. Agriculture being the important industry it is, and Offaly being the important agricultural county it is, a suitable building must be provided for the county committee of agriculture in County Offaly.  They will still need the office they have in Birr and in Edenderry.  I hope the Department will co-operate fully with the Offaly County Committee of Agriculture in ensuring that a headquarters is provided as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the decentralisation of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  In Offaly we have not got a departmental local office.  County Offaly and County Laois are in close proximity to Dublin and both are important agricultural counties.  If any further decision is being taken in regard to decentralisation, both counties are in need of a Government Department and we would be very happy if the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries would consider coming down to either county.  There are excellent motorways between Laois and Offaly and Dublin.  The telephone service is adequate. There is a local airport in Birr. We are in close touch with Dublin and we would welcome the Department to Laois or Offaly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I consider it very relevant and very important. I want to say this as a member of a county committee of agriculture for quite a number of years. Since our entry into the EEC, our county committee of agriculture feel a bit remote from what is happening in the EEC.  I am not criticising the different chief agricultural advisers who are making every effort to keep the committees of agriculture in touch.  The Department are also endeavouring to keep members of the committees advised about what is happening in the EEC.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider some scheme under which at least one representative of each county committee of agriculture would be working in conjuction with his Department and would have some communication with Brussels on a six-monthly or 12-monthly basis.  This would enable them to keep abreast with what is happening in Brussels. The Department find it very difficult to keep in touch with all the different aspects of changing legislation.  Knowing the problems they are confronted with they can well realise the problems with which the committees of agriculture are faced.  Each committee of agriculture should be able to send a representative to Brussels. This would prove advisable and worthwhile.  If a proper scheme is devised, the different associations such as the IFA and Macra na Feirme would be pleased to be involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People might ask what would be the benefit of making one visit to Brussels, but the representatives of the committees could learn what is happening in Brussels.  I say this without fear of contradiction.  Our farmers are not as <i>au fait</i> with what is happening in Brussels as they would like to be.  If the representatives of the county committees went to Brussels, on their return they could give first-hand information to the local farmers.  If worked out on a proper basis, this could be an excellent <Col N="687" /> project and it would not cost a great deal of money.  We are a member of the EEC and it is up to us to make very effort to utilise the benefits available to us to the fullest extent.  The county committees of agriculture are the voices of the farmers in each respective county, and the voices of the farmers could be heard in Brussels under such a scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the serious effort he has made to ensure that our committees of agriculture are kept on a workable basis and on a sound financial footing with sound financial backing. I have been a member of the Offaly County Committee of Agriculture for seven years.  At times we wondered whether we would have the necessary finance to continue and whether we would have the necessary capital to carry out schemes and projects.  We have no doubt now that the Minister is fully behind us and that he intends to ensure that each committee of agriculture is fully financed to meet the challenges that lie ahead.  He realises fully the importance of agriculture and he is ensuring that the necessary finances are made available for our farmers.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to say very much on this Bill but I could not let the occasion pass without commenting on it.  I welcome the measure but I share the reservations of other, particularly western, Deputies in connection with the huge increase that could fall on the rates. I admit we have been looking for this for a number of years but I thought we would be saving money on other subsidies from the EEC and that we should give an injection to the educational end of agriculture.  I must pay a glowing tribute to the county committees of agriculture and to the staff of the Department for doing such a tremendous amount of work down through the years with very limited finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was on a committee of agriculture many years ago&mdash;when I just had a vote; I am over 60 years of age now&mdash;<Col N="688" /> and I was off it for a long time after that.  At that time there were two agricultural instructors in County Galway and very few knew where they were.  Unless somebody wanted a bag of seed oats cheap as an experiment, that is all the demands that were made on the agricultural instructor.  I remember going to a man who was reared in County Galway&mdash;I think in the home of the present occupant of the Chair&mdash; a great friend of mine, Doctor Kennedy, who said we used to use grass seeds out of the hay manager at that time in Galway to re-seed the land.</P>
    <P>Shortly after that time certain rural organisations were started with the whole-hearted support of the county committees and their advisory services. The whole face of the west has changed over a number of years.  This was done with the co-operation of the advisory services.  We knew the practical side of the business, but they were the people who knew the theoretical side.  If they did not impart their knowledge to us, we could not get on as well as we did. There are now 26 instructors operating in County Galway.  I have been pressing and pressing for sanction for the appointment of 6 more instructors because with all that has to be done under the farm organisation scheme we have not enough instructors at all. In regard to the amount required under this Bill, it must be remembered the agricultural areas will not be as well populated as they were.  With people going to urban areas and engaging in other walks of life, I do not think we will get the 40 pence sought, even though I believe we would need that amount to provide the service that is needed, particularly in the western counties.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Enright has said.  However, I would like to draw attention to Directive 159 under which the instructor would be expected to tell the farmer what kind of production he should undertake.  I think the job of the instructor is to tell the farmer the best method of doing whatever type of farming he is engaging in but not to tell him to switch over to this, that or the other.  If something goes wrong with it the farmer immediately blames the agricultural adviser for putting him on the wrong <Col N="689" /> track.  There is also, as Deputy Meaney has said, tremendous emphasis on output.</P>
    <P>If your outlay is so big when you increase your output that your net profit is not satisfactory, then increased output is not a good proposition. We all know what happened the experts in the last six or eight months, although I am not blaming anyone. I remember going to a sale in Bradford where wool was supposed to be &ldquo;a great go&rdquo;, according to the experts.  In six months it was down to half.  While I agree there is a specialised type of farming in which the small farmer must engage, I do not agree that the instructor should go in and say to any farmer: &ldquo;You must do this.  If you do not do it on these lines, you will not qualify for the grant.&rdquo;  I think instructors would be very slow, seeing the way things have backfired, to tell people to take up any particular line, and I do not think they should be asked to do that.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the dispute or disagreement in which the advisory officers were involved has been settled. I would not call it a strike, because they were simply not operating one particular scheme.  However, now that the forms are ready to come up, my information is that the Department are not ready to receive them.  I would like the Minister to contradict that if it is not true.  It is a pity the scheme was held up for so long because many farmers are interested to know what category they come into.  The Minister will say that the Department are putting up a substantial amount, 75 per cent, in respect of the western counties.  I would like to remind the Minister that even though we are putting up only 25 per cent&mdash;and I do believe we should put up something&mdash;our rates in the £ are very high because we have not as much valuable land as they have in other counties.  Mayo and then Galway have the highest amount of bad land in the country.  Therefore, while I realise 40 pence is needed, I do not believe we will get it.  I would not like to be looking for it from the county councils, because the vast majority of county <Col N="690" /> councils have various other commitments, which I do not want to go into because it is not relevant, for which they will be looking for money.  We will give 40p to the county committees of agriculture.  I do not think this is a realistic figure and I am disappointed that some other sort of revenue could not be found.  I approve of the educational centres.  These are a great idea but they are moving too slowly.  We have five of them in my county.  I do not want to be parochial, but I think the idea an excellent one.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the restructuring of the advisory services. The general council of county committees of agriculture have been studying this for a number of years and, while there was not outright agreement on everything, the general consensus was that there should be one central building in each county with the CEO as the co-ordinating officer.  Everything connected with agriculture should be housed in that building.  The Minister made no reference to any reorganisation of the advisory services and so on.</P>
    <P>A farmer living in an urban area cannot at the moment avail of the advisory services even though he is paying rates.  I admit the agricultural adviser obliges him.  Farmers like this pay very high rates and they should be able to avail of all the services provided, but help can only be given at the discretion of the agricultural advisory officer.</P>
    <P>We have no objection to this measure.  Our ambition is to be constructive in our approach.  There is no use putting something down on paper if that something cannot be given material effect.  Is there a possibility that money could be got from any of the regional funds?  The demand on the services of the agricultural advisers will become greater as time goes on. In this connection, there should be an interview board for the appointment of these officers.  No one should have to canvass for support from the members of the local authority.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the officials of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Voluntary organisations could never have succeeded as they have <Col N="691" /> done were it not for the support they got from the Department.  Every half-penny of this 40p will be needed to organise the system properly.  The more complicated agriculture becomes the more advisers we will need.  We have not got enough at the moment even. It will be a very big job to process every farmer in the country into one or other of the three categories.  A huge injection of finance will be needed. I doubt if that finance will come from the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will shortly have a complete reorganisation of the advisory services.  I never had anything other than a national school education and anything I have learned over and above that was learned as a result of attending lectures and educating myself.  The young people today are going on to secondary school and, if they are successful in the leaving certificate, they gravitate towards university.  It is then quite impossible to get them back on the land.  If these young people were sent to a vocational school and taught agricultural science, they would be prepared to stay on the land.  With all the aids now available they should become excellent farmers.</P>
    <P>I am not against giving a young man who wants a higher education the opportunity of availing of it but, if he is removed from farming, the danger is he will never return to it. No farmer would think of swapping his present activity even though it is a hard life, but the young man who is removed from it an an early age finds great difficulty in coming back. That is why I say it is imperative to provide proper educational facilities locally for young men.  It is of vital importance to the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief comments on this Bill.  I welcome the increase towards the employment of adequate staff from 50 per cent to 75 per cent, especially in the western and north western areas which embrace my constituency.  The importance of extra funds being made available to the county committees of agriculture cannot be sufficiently <Col N="692" /> stressed.  I was disappointed when I heard that the county council were expected to provide those funds as the Minister did not see fit to have even some of the money made available from the Central Fund.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that each of the 27 county committees of agriculture create a new post of deputy chief agricultural officer with special responsibility for educational matters. Since our entry to the EEC it is important that each committee should have such an officer to give adequate information to farmers.  When one takes into account the cost of production and development in farming, each committee of agriculture should consider creating a post the holder of which would be available to give advice to farmers on building and layout, taking into consideration the massive increases in costs.</P>
      <P>Many farmers in my constituency embarked on very extensive projects for silage layout, cubical sheds with slots and with liquid manure tanks to cater for the store cattle trade. Farmers whose farms were not suitable for milk production in a dairy area might want to diversify in the hope of getting a greater return for their investment.  People whose holdings were not combined or adjacent to each other went into store cattle production or sucklings.  The costs for concreting and steel structuring have doubled in price.  Therefore, it is very important that the committee of agriculture have an officer to advise in advance the amount of money needed and, if possible, the return for that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that over the past decade the number of instructors increased from 354 to 564. I am open to contradiction on this but I think in reply to a parliamentary question I was told that the ratio is one instructor to 500 farmers. With the advent of farm modernisation the number should be doubled if instructors are to cope with the expected number of applications.  The Minister classified farms as development, transitional and commercial. It is a pity that the grant aids were <Col N="693" /> withdrawn from all these categories at once.  They could have been withdrawn from the development farmer and left to the smaller type farmers who found it hard to make up their minds about applying for the grants.</P>
    <P>In my constituency many farmers come to me for advice on whether to build a byre or other structure.  They may then discover that they will not be in a position to take this step until next year because they find it hard to make up their minds to apply for a grant.</P>
    <P>Every committee of agriculture should provide a home advisory service for housewives.  They could give advice, information and instruction to the housewives.  They should be educated in the ways of buying food in bulk and using the deep freeze. This will help them to save money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the conclusion of the dispute.  It is important that persons representing the advisers and the committees of agriculture should have a hard look at working conditions and remuneration.  Commercial firms advertise posts with attractive remuneration. It would be very sad if we were to lose some of our best brains in the advisory service to those commercial firms.</P>
    <P>Appointments to county council posts should be taken out of the rough and tumble of the political arena especially as there will be such an increase in the number of these appointments.  We should provide the best brains and the most highly qualified people for these posts.</P>
    <P>Production and marketing should be considered together.  We have found to our grief during the past year that while we can produce enough it is very important that it should be marketed in the best possible way and the returns should be related to the amount of money involved in the production.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the points in the Bill, but I think the Department should have provided additional money from the Central Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this <Col N="694" /> timely move by the Minister to increase the ceiling in order to provide extra finance and more room for manoeuvre on the part of county councils.  Demands are being made on them in the light of modern agricultural techniques and because of the very fast moving world in which we now live, particularly with regard to know-how.  Gone is the day of regarding the farmer as a hewer of wood and a drawer of water.  He is every bit as much a businessman as any other type of businessman in any section of the economy.  If a farmer makes a mistake, it is made for a minimum period of a year.  Unlike the businessman, he cannot possibly reverse his decisions.  He is tied by the Lord's design of the seasons and whatever decisions he makes he must make them in advance with careful thought.</P>
      <P>We are living in a period where costings on the input side of agriculture are very high.  While I am not detracting from the traditional knowledge of good farmers and the knowledge that present farmers have obtained from previous generations, the general consensus is that further education is required.  Agriculture is moving very rapidly.  We are in the EEC.  We are exporting to a market of 253 million people and we have to complete not just with the British farmer whose climate and circumstances are somewhat like our own but we must also try to get to the market place earlier than our continental counterparts who possibly have more advantages in certain spheres of agriculture because of their different climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If mistakes are made the result can last for a minimum period of a year. Agriculture requires a considerable amount of finance.  Heretofore the average farmer was not educated on financial matters.  In the past farmers borrowed money from the bank or some other financial institutions.  They bought stock or equipment for their farms and they thought things would work out all right providing the weather did not cause any damage. There is far more to it now than that. There are changing interest rates, rapidly changing markets and a high degree of competition in the market <Col N="695" /> place.  To cope with these circumstances, a farmer must have available to him, virtually on his doorstep, highly-skilled technical advice.  We know it is not just a question of sowing seed and reaping the harvest.  The market must be studied and it is necessary that the average farmer be given the proper advice.</P>
    <P>The agricultural advisers attached to the local committees of agriculture and the officers in the county council have the facilities and the <i>entrée</i> to the necessary know-how, backed by institutions such as An Foras Talúntais and others of a like nature.  All this requires money, a constant updating and making available the best advice. One speaker said that at the moment there was one instructor to 500 farmers. I do not know if that is correct but it is not really a guideline.  There may be 500 small farmers, 500 large farmers or farmers with a particularly difficult area to farm.  I instance one outstanding example that is known to everyone in the country, namely, the area known as the Macamores in my own county.  In certain years farmers have a difficult battle to make any success of their year's work.  It is largely an endemic problem and we hope that when the other countries in the EEC get together and see sense we will have a regional policy that will help such areas.</P>
    <P>There is not much point in having money available for improvements in such an area unless there is first-class advice available.  It is not enough to have the advice coming from Dublin or elsewhere.  It must be from the man in the area who knows local conditions and this is where the local agricultural instructor scores above all others.  He is aware of the local thinking, he knows the community, the way they live and farm, and their problems.  Also, he has a pretty good idea of the financial strength and circumstances of each farmer.  So far as the agricultural advisory service has worked in my county, the local advisers have closely identified themselves with the farmers.  It is great to see this spirit.  In many cases, successful co-operative groups have started <Col N="696" /> and are working very well.  This type of activity is very much in the thinking of the EEC.  Co-operation among neighbouring farms can lower costings.</P>
    <P>So far as the family farm is concerned, especially where there are teenagers, such a farmer is in an advantageous position because he has labour available.  However, there are many farmers who have not this help and are not in a position to spend much money in paying agricultural workers.  It is in those circumstances that the local co-operative groups are of tremendous assistance and are necessary.</P>
    <P>My own knowledge of farming dates back to the time I was a member of the local young farmers' group in Gorey.  In those days it was quite a different situation and it was regarded as rather a field day if you could get an agricultural instructor to talk to the young farmers.  The position has greatly improved but from those days good crops have been harvested in the agricultural community in relation to know-how and the will to change and improve the lot of the farmers.</P>
    <P>About 25 years ago there was a reluctance to accept anything new.  It was thought that what was good for the previous generation was good enough for the present generation. It was more or less a universal rule, an attitude of mind.  While one can learn from history and past experience, it is a common opinion in agriculture that one must avail of new knowledge and technique and take lessons from other countries.  Certainly we are seeing it in relation to cattle breeding and other forms of stock breeding.  In that regard I think An Foras Talúntais have done a great deal of good work.  It is evident in my county and for my part as a representative of my constituency, I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to express my appreciation of the contributions made by various Deputies from all sides of the House and, indeed, my appreciation of their <Col N="697" /> interest in this short Bill.  It was indicative from everything that was said, of a very wide appreciation of the value of the work being done by the county committees of agriculture and by their staffs.  It is accepted that the advice to be given by the officers of these committees is indispensable if we are to have progressive and profitable farming in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy G. Collins more or less set the tone of the debate.  This, I think, was a little unfortunate in so far as everybody welcomed what is proposed in this Bill, and that is, to enable county committees of agriculture to increase their rate in the £ from 15p to 40p.  It is enabling legislation.  For some time we were arguing across the House as to whether or not this was mandatory.  If we take a look at section 1 (1) it is explained there:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The council of a county shall, in the local financial year beginning on the 1st day of January, 1975, and every subsequent local financial year, make to the committee of agriculture for the county a contribution under this subsection of not less than the produce of a rate in the preceding local financial year of one new penny in the pound in the area consisting of the county exclusive of every (if any) urban district therein and not more than forty times such produce.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There it is indicated quite clearly that it is mandatory to pay one new penny and that the ceiling is 14 new pence. Therefore, this is beyond dispute.  It is then up to the democratically elected people in the county council to decide what are the limits.  The members of the county council and of the committee of agriculture would know the situation locally and they will decide what is justified by way of expenditure on these valuable services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins stated that he doubted very much if there would not be very serious objection on the part of shopkeepers in towns and villages, and on the part of workers in County Limerick, in relation to the paying of any increase on the present level for agricultural advisory services.  I was amazed to hear him making that <Col N="698" /> statement because it is common knowledge that everybody considers that shopkeepers in rural Ireland depend, in the main, on the amount of money farmers are able to spend in their shops.  As well as that, such an amount of the raw material produced by agriculture at the moment is processed in these towns that many workers in rural Ireland are also dependent on the success of farming. I was amazed to hear Deputy G. Collins express the view that these people would be reluctant to make any contribution towards the cost of the agricultural advisory services.  As Deputy G. Collins knows, County Limerick has not reached the limit of 15p at the moment; they consider that 12.69p is sufficient to spend on agricultural advisory services.  They have not yet reached the present limit and will not do so for some time.  I hope that, when the need arises&mdash;and I am sure it arises now&mdash; to have an improved advisory service in County Limerick, and indeed throughout the country, members of county councils will have no hesitation in providing this extra money for these valuable services.  I must say that if that has been the experience in County Limerick certainly it has not been my experience in County Dublin over many years, and there were many urban members on the county committee of agriculture and indeed on the county council itself. Never once did I hear an objection raised by the members of the committee to whatever was needed to run the agricultural advisory services effectively and efficiently.  Therefore, I do not accept at all that any objection will be raised to the provision of whatever money is necessary at local level for these services which, as everybody who spoke said, are widely appreciated.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins made some play of the fact that I mentioned that, to some extent at least, the extra money required was due to the fact that increased salaries and expenses were paid to the advisory staffs of the county committees of agriculture. That is merely a statement of fact; nothing more and nothing less.  There <Col N="699" /> is nobody more pleased than I that satisfactory levels of salaries are being paid to advisory officers.  If they succeed, through the machinery that they themselves have negotiated&mdash; conciliation and arbitration&mdash;in getting the better salaries, I will like it all the more.  But it is simply a statement of fact because 70 per cent of the expenditure of the committees is on salaries.  Therefore, it is a significant element and had to be mentioned. That was the only reason it was mentioned and Deputy G. Collins should know that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fact that small farmers will make no contribution I did not know whether Deputy G. Collins regretted this or welcomed it but he seemed to regret the fact that small farmers throughout the country were getting this service, free of charge, and that there was something wrong about this.  I wonder did he really mean that because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister gets the Official Report he can read it and will have no problem in deciding what I meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the impression that came over, that these small farmers would not have to pay and it was almost asked: Why?  Was it right that they should be getting these services free or did they deserve this special attention?</P>
      <P>Then Deputy G. Collins says, of course, that the Government should pay any extra cost involved in implementing more extensive advisory services.  All I can say to him is that this is not the first time that a Bill of this kind has come before the House and that his party, when in Government, brought many such Bills before the House but they had no such bright idea, when introducing those Bills, that they had gone far enough in asking the ratepayers to provide this money.  Deputy G. Collins described the Bill as being so unfair and unjust to provide better services for farmers at present.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so unfair and so unjust to ask for an increased contribution when we know there have been substantial increases in farm incomes in the past two years.  To a considerable extent this is as a result of the sound advice and progressive ideas given to farmers by the advisory services.  They have played no small part.  I am quite sure they appreciate this and would have no hesitation whatever in providing the extra money needed.  Neither would the townspeople.  I have never known townspeople begrudge it because they know how dependent they are also on the welfare and spending power of the farming community.</P>
      <P>Deputies who spoke about the system of employing temporary staff for the advisory services deplore the fact that people who spend many years qualifying to become agricultural advisers have to go around to the various members of the committees with their caps in their hand seeking support for employment.  I was never happy about the situation but the county committees of agriculture are free to set up interview boards and make their selections. Some of them have already done this. That system can be changed at the will of the county committees and it is not necessary to have any change in legislation to ensure that appointments are made by selection boards. I do not like this canvassing of members of county committees, county councils and political parties.  I see a serious objection to it because it should never have been the way but that is the system which has existed for quite a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins reminded me that instructors were no longer on their bicycles.  However, it is right to pay a very special tribute to the men who had to use their bicycles, the men who laid the foundations of the advisory service that we have today. These men laid those foundations very well and they did an enormous amount of work against extreme difficulties and quite a lot of exposure. They did a first class job.  Thank God we have passed on from the use of <Col N="701" /> bicycles by instructors and that they are no longer required to get around on their bicycles.  I am glad also that there are many more instructors available now to help the farming community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan, who always makes a valuable contribution to this sort of discussion, told the House that he remembered the time when there were two advisers in Galway.  He went on to tell us that there are now 26 advisers in that county and remarked that this was not sufficient.  He told us that a more intensive advisory service was needed in Galway.  Of course, he is right because this is an on-going thing and the numbers have been increasing all the time.  I am concerned that the service continues to improve and that is why in recent times I have tried to restructure the service and provide more promotional opportunities for the advisers.  I hope that trend will continue.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies who contributed to this debate referred to the value of the farm home advisory service.  The impression seemed to be conveyed to the House that there was some restriction on the employment of farm home advisers or that such advisers were not available.  Farm home advisers are available and it is up to the committees to decide how many of these advisers they wish to employ.  Such advisers are there for employment.  I agree they do extremely valuable work and I agree with the Member who stated that such advisers are needed even more in the cities and towns than they are in many of the rural areas.  I hope this service will be expanded.</P>
    <P>A Deputy regretted the fact that it was not possible for people in urban areas to get any service or any advice from the advisory service.  I know there is a difficulty about this but there is nothing to prevent them from getting whatever services they require on an agency basis.  I know that in Dublin this sort of service is provided in the horticultural sphere.  It is that type of amenity horticultural advice that is required in the city suburbs and that was provided on an agency basis by the Dublin County Committee of Agriculture. I see no reason why it could <Col N="702" /> not be provided throughout the country also.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies said there was something wrong with the advice being given in that the advisers seemed to be concerned only about output and not about profit.  It is generally accepted that one cannot increase profit unless output is increased.  Of course, it must be economic output in the long run but the fertility of the land must be improved and the stocking rate increased before one can get increased profits.  Perhaps this has not been sufficiently emphasised but any adviser worth his salt must all the time have profit in mind.</P>
    <P>I disagreed with Deputy Callanan when he said he thought it was all wrong that it should be anybody's intention that advisers should go out and tell farmers what they are to do if they are to qualify for various grant aids.  They are not telling farmers; they are advising farmers. In the last analysis it is the farmer who must make up his mind whether he is going to take that advice and whether he is going to follow the farm plan he is advised to follow by his instructor.  In my view this is one of the best things that has ever come along.  Advisers for the first time are now being put on their mettle.  The advice they have given is now being tested.  If the farmer fails to carry it out and to reach his target he has a share in the blame.  This is one way that advisers will ensure that they will keep the profit motive very much in mind themselves and that they will be personally concerned about the outcome of the advice they are giving. In my view this is one of the great things about the EEC schemes and I hope it will work extremely well.</P>
    <P>Another statement made by Deputy Callanan with which I must disagree was to the effect that the various forms were ready for submission but that the Department were not ready to accept them.  I should like to state emphatically that this is completely wrong.  The Department are ready to accept forms and are ready to act on them but it is solely the CAO's responsibility <Col N="703" /> to look at the applications that have come in since 1st February and decide what category a particular farmer fits into and whether the farm plan is a realistic one.  That is the CAO's responsibility and he has to do that before he sends it on to the Department.  The Department are ready to receive any applications as fast as they come.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher complained about the fact that when 24 extra advisers were sought in Mayo only 12 were allowed.  Mayo is one of the counties that was running up a pretty heavy deficit.  The committee were allowed to employ six permanent and six temporary instructors until the financial difficulties were solved.  As well as that they got a contribution from the Department of £25,000 to see them out of their trouble even though they are one of the counties who pay only 25 per cent of the total bill.  It is difficult to see how this can be reduced much more without taking local responsibility away altogether.  This 25 per cent is a very small part of the cost and the extra contribution was made by the Department. There is a feeling that the 12 extra instructors met the requirements at the time reasonably well.  If that committee continue to insist that they need extra instructors and are prepared to pay the extra 25 per cent that will be seriously looked at by the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard spoke about the need in the advisory services for advice on building.  He said this was extremely important because the cost of building had increased so much in recent times.  I agree that this is a very important matter.  I do not know how things work in County Monaghan but this service has certainly been available for some years in County Dublin and I know it is available in other counties too, through the vocational education committees.  There were two farm building construction instructors in County Dublin where the need would not be nearly as great as it would be in other counties.  The ideal situation would be if there was close co-operation between the agricultural <Col N="704" /> advisory services and the vocational education committees in providing this type of building advice. The Deputy seemed to say that people were led up the garden path, that they went into the production of store cattle and beef cattle and that the outcome has been very unfortunate. All I can say is that they never got that advice from me.  I have been consistently advising people who are on the type of farm he speaks of if they were in milk to expand and if they were not in it to get into it.  That was not based on any special ability on my part to forecast the future.  It was always obvious to anyone who was close to the scene that unless one had a farm of substantial size and pretty good land there was not an acceptable standard of living to be found in beef production alone and that people who are on farms smaller even than 100 acres would get a very poor living unless they were in something much more intensive than beef production.  I continue to give this advice.  If people in Monaghan have gone into beef production in the hope of getting a reasonable living from it I am quite surprised.  I am sure it only applies to quite a small number of the people in County Monaghan because I know that their farming generally is much more intensive.  Pig and poultry production is certainly one of the activities they go in for to a considerable extent in Monaghan. I am glad indeed that pig production has come back into a profit situation after a period of loss more than profit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment last night I was referring to the general economic situation of the country as I saw it.  Since then I have had the opportunity of reading the comments in the daily papers. Some of these comments I find to be at some variance with the views of the Minister.  The Minister in his brief said:</P>
      <P>Since my budget statement, very useful consultations have been held with the National Economic and Social Council and with representative farming organisations regarding the considerations to be borne in mind in the taxation of farm profits.</P>
      <P>The views of the National Economic and Social Council and of the farming organisations have been taken into account in framing the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Press</i> this morning quoted a member of the executive of the IFA <Col N="706" /> as saying that they are far from happy with this Bill and he speaks of a militant feeling that this Bill should be scrapped and re-written.  I am not suggesting that the Minister should capitulate before pressure groups.  We have seen the effects of capitulation before a certain pressure group in the Six Counties.  Nevertheless it seems strange that the Minister should say that the views of the farming organisations have been taken into account and that a member of their executive who, as such, must be regarded as being an informed person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If he were interested in finding out, he could have informed consultations with the IFA and they would reveal who this person is.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning the writer of &ldquo;In the Dáil&rdquo; stated that the Minister for Finance explained the absence of Government Deputies contributing to this debate as an anxiety to let the House away on holidays.  We in the Fianna Fáil Party deplore such a comment being made.  Is there anything more important in the Dáil than the budget debate and the debate on the Finance Bill which follows it?  We accept our responsibilities in Opposition and we are making what we hope are useful contributions on this Bill.</P>
      <P>What are the Government doing? Last night I was under the impression that they were under Whip not to contribute.  I felt that, perhaps, they were not all at one with regard to the provisions in the Bill.

      <P>I am quoting from John Healy on the front page of this morning's <i>Irish Times</i> who stated that the Government Deputies are not contributing in their anxiety to let the House away on holidays.  The Fianna Fáil Party are anxious to contribute and to see that fair play is obtained for the people.  If the people in Government wish to go on holidays, why was this Bill not introduced earlier? It is fairly shabby treatment of the people that this should be offered by way of excuse.  I wonder how the media will take this?  How will the ordinary man in the street feel about the spending of money collected from him in taxes when he sees that the Government Deputies do not see fit to come in and contribute to the debate on the Finance Bill because they want to go on holidays?  We all want to adjourn for our holidays and we look forward to the Recess but there is very important business in the House <Col N="708" /> at the moment.  It is the clear duty of Government Deputies to come into this House and express their opinions on the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out what I see as omissions in this Bill.  I believe representations were made by various people who were working towards the abolition of ground rents.

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not hold up the House longer than a moment and will then move on to the sections of the Bill.  This Bill must be seen in the light of the high inflation we have at the moment and the inability of people to obtain money.  This is a taxation Bill and the people cannot obtain money.  There is not a shortage of houses at the moment.  There is a plentiful supply but the people cannot raise the necessary finance to move into them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the structure of the new tax and section 6 deals with the increased personal allowances. These allowances have been completely eroded by inflation.  As I pointed out last night, we have an inflationary figure of 20 per cent.  We also see that the value of the £ from February, 1973 <Col N="709" /> to March, 1974 fell by 17 pence. Personal allowances have been completely eroded by this.  Before the framing of the budget negotiations were held with various organisations, such as NITRO.  In the Government's effort to sell the last national wage agreement the Minister promised substantial relief.  His views of substantial relief are at variance with mine.  I believe what the average person would consider substantial relief is not reflected in the table in section 6 of this Bill.  It seems a question of more unfilled promises.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour gave one of the reasons why the national wage agreement was not being accepted at a function at which I was a guest also. It was that the majority of workers were Fianna Fáil supporters and hence they were stalling this Bill.  The Minister said this at a Chamber of Commerce function in Wicklow town.  The public in general, relying on the promises of substantial relief in the budget, accepted the national wage agreement.  We looked forward to these promises being fulfilled but they were not.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with various income tax reliefs given.  We see that under the Income Tax Act, 1967 the amount deducted for 1973-74 in allowances for a married man was £494.  If to that we add the unearned income allowance of one quarter of that we get £618.  The Minister purports to allow £800, an increase of £180 approximately.  That is a miserable sum in these days.  While it might be £180 on that section, in the case of a fairly average married couple with no children, who have the burden of a mortgage of approximately £6,000 at 11¼ per cent, the figure would appear to be £675.  Under the old system they would have been allowed £675 at 35 pence which would allow them £236 approximately.  Under the new rate they are allowed £675 at 25 pence which, in my calculation, works out at £176 approximately.  If I were to balance it up to the nearest pound it would be £177 which would work out at a loss to them of £60. Again, it is trick-of-the-loop and nothing more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> It is estimated that at first glance they should obtain substantial relief, but when we get down to budgeting we find that their loss in the allowance under this heading is approximately £60.  There is an overall meagre saving, perhaps, but we must deduct the new contributions by employees under the pay-related benefit scheme.  This is of benefit to some employees which is a good thing, but we must bear it in mind as an added stoppage from the employee's wage packet.  When that is taken into account, does it show a favourable or an unfavourable balance?</P>
    <P>The dependent relative's allowance is raised in this section from £60 to £80.  Let us try to adjust this figure of £80 in real value terms.  With inflation at 20 per cent and the £ having dropped 17 pence this brings the figure down to £53 which is much less than the value of £60 last year. This shows a net loss over all.  I am sure this calculation could be carried out on each of the substitutions.  I am sure we would work out an interesting calculation of the substitution of £409 for £347.  It is sufficient to work one mathematical problem to see that the substitution of £80 for £60 is negligible.</P>
    <P>Section 28 deals with farming profits and restriction of personal allowances and paragraph (a) refers to the rateable valuation of land which exceeds £20.  This runs contrary to the general idea which we, as a party, wished to introduce and which we thought would be better for the people of rural Ireland, that was, to have farmers engaged in part-time industrial employment. We saw this as a method of enabling the farmer to build up his farm and to improve his living standards, and to increase capital investment. It would also provide an opportunity to the small man to purchase a holding which became vacant nearby. If he were to do that now, his valuation would probably be increased to above £20.  This is a disincentive. There is no incentive for the man who wishes to be progressive and who wishes to develop as a farmer, who wishes to add to his holding and is keen to work in some industrial plant <Col N="711" /> and eventually return to full-time farming.</P>
    <P>Approximately one month ago the National Manpower Service in conjunction with AnCO introduced a scheme to encourage more farmers to participate in off-farm employment. This is the trend in progressive EEC countries.  A pilot scheme was to be introduced in Kerry.  What about the small farmer whose valuation is under £20?  If he wishes to participate in this scheme this could mean a loss of investment by the National Manpower Service and AnCO.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think that man will become involved in this project? Will he be interested in getting some training from AnCO to develop his talents on the industrial side?  It would be a waste of AnCO's money, money which comes from the State.  It would be very interesting to hear the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this issue.  I am sure they are more conversant with it than I am, but I do not suppose they will offer us some way of allaying this man's fears.</P>
    <P>There is a general understanding that this Bill is a forerunner to a more sophisticated Bill which may be introduced next year in which the threshold will be lowered.  I regret the silence of Deputies on the Government benches.  Some of them probably represent more small farmers than I do.  Many of them represent the small farmers on the western seaboard who are directly affected by this measure. I said that the pilot scheme was to be inaugurated in County Kerry.  Will the Kerry Deputies speak on behalf of their constituents?</P>
    <P>We must consider whether this Bill is at all relevant to the needs of the community at present.  Is it related in any way to the problem which people have to face?  I am sure that the poorer sections of the community would like to have seen in this Bill some form of subsidy to help them to provide their basic requirements at reduced rates.  Meeting with my constituents, I discovered that this was <Col N="712" /> one of their problems.  Where are the Labour Party who claim to be more closely aligned to the people than others?  Are they circulating with the people?  The people are not looking for luxuries but basics.  They would have preferred the Government to introduce a system of subsidies which would enable them to obtain cheaper food.  That is not in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The middle income group would prefer to have seen something in this Finance Bill which would ease their mortgage repayments.  There is nothing in it to that effect.  Are their views to be ignored?  They anticipated and hoped that there would be some provision in this Finance Bill which would discontinue the tax on building societies so that rates of interest would drop down to what people in this income bracket would regard as manageable: 9 to 9½ per cent.  Their views are not represented.</P>
    <P>This would appear to be a Bill which looks to the future.  The Minister should bear in mind that the future is built on the present, and the present is not so good.  The reliefs offered in Table VI are miserable. Hope is expressed for the future, but time is running out.</P>
    <P>Last night I asked the Minister if he would estimate what the trade deficit is at present and I paused for a reply.  The Minister was quick to take me up on remarks which I based on comments I read in <i>The Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning.  Perhaps he is in a better mood now to give his estimate of the trade deficit.  His estimate in April last was £140 million.</P>
    <P>There are in the Minister's speech such laudable statements as that the tax burden will be spread more equitably throughout society.  These are grand lofty thoughts, and it is a feature of this Government that some Ministers have shown a great command of English.  Where are the basics?  The thoughts are well dressed up but the content is more important than the dressing.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would suggest that this Bill is not relevant to the present needs of our society.  The best thing the Minister could do is to take the <Col N="713" /> advice of the IFA and other Deputies who have spoken, and withdraw this Bill.  He should then come back here with a Bill which is in some way relevant to our needs, a Bill which would be basic but which at the same time could reform the tax code moderately, if the Minister so desires.  Maybe the Minister is so taken up with the question of reform that he is overlooking the day to day necessities.  One could be carried away and so remote from everything that this could happen. This is not a with-it Bill, and I would call on the Minister to withdraw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear Deputy Murphy advocating that building societies should get profits tax free.  At the moment the Government have got the interest rate down to 10 or 11 per cent, whereas on the money market it is 17 to 19 per cent.  When a person buys a house it is after the first few years he is in trouble.  He gets a few wage increases and the repayments do not seem so much and maybe there is a subsidy on repayments for the first few years just like the ten-year remission on rates.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are looking for extra time to speak here and yet last night a Deputy repeated himself a hundred times and all he could say was: &ldquo;What about the working man?&rdquo;  I commend the Minister and the staff who are bringing in this Bill. The Bill deals mainly with the simplification and reform of income tax and the widening of the tax net to take in the wealthier farmers.  It also counteracts many tax-avoidance measures.  It is not easy to stop tax avoidance. Each new law that is brought in creates another loophole and it takes a while to cope with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on one fantastic thing he has done, simplifying the income tax system.  I have had more people coming to me asking about their liability for tax. Heretofore a married man had an allowance of £494; for a child over 11 years of age the allowance was £170; for a child under 11 years of age the allowance was £155.  Then there was earned income and unearned income.  To work all this out <Col N="714" /> one would have needed an accountant. The new rates of tax are much simpler: 26 per cent on the first £1,550 of taxable income; 35 per cent up to £4,350 and so on up to 80 per cent, which is the top rate of surtax. I understand the 80 per cent will be reduced to 70 per cent when other taxes are introduced.  Now the allowances are also quite simple: £800 for a married man, £200 for each child; there is no difference in earned or unearned income.  The majority of people have got extra allowances. There was an anomaly in a previous budget whereby people in the lower middle class were caught for an extra £10 or £20, but this has been rectified, and now there is a gain.  On top of that they have got a wage increase. Yesterday Deputy Colley mentioned an allowance against tax for a £1,000 premium on an insurance policy.</P>

      <P>I am not quoting. Deputy Colley mentioned the £1,000 premium, and said that this was not fair.  If you take out an assurance or an insurance policy and work out the amount you pay per annum, depending on your age, then when you come to retire or die, this again should apply. I congratulate the Minister on giving quite a bit in the case of those who take out big policies.  They will now get a remission of 80 per cent.  Before that they were getting 66 per cent.  I think that was the figure.  What the law is I do not know, but morally there should be some remission also in the case of a man who marries late in life. A young man of 25 or 30 will get a very good return on his investment and if he dies, the future of his widow and children is more or less secure.</P>

      <P>If a man takes out a policy and gets married at 30 years of age he will get a very fair return. By the time he reaches 50 that £1,000 will give him £30,000, £40,000 or £50,000.  That will secure the future of his wife and children.  I am worried about the man who gets married at 45 or 50 because he will get only £20,000 or if he dies, his family will get only £10,000, or £12,000.  There should be some provision to cover cases like that to ensure that his widow and children will be taken care of should he die.  I certainly do not accept Deputy Colley's figures.</P>
      <P>As a businessman, I do not believe farmers are making too much money. I believe the contrary is the case.  The return on their investment is one of the poorest in existence.  Of course, it is a human failing to think everyone else is making more money than you are. Very often people who talk like this see what is coming in but they have no idea at all of what the outgoings are. A farmer with a valuation of under £100 will not pay tax.  In some areas a valuation of £100 would be approximately 100 acres.  In other parts of the country it would be 200, 300 or 500 acres, depending on the quality of the land.  I think this is a very fair provision.  The farmer can work on a notional figure if he does not want to keep accounts.  If he is not entitled to pay tax, he will not pay it even with a valuation of £100.  If he does not make a profit he does not pay tax.  He is no worse off than anybody else.  He will have a 10 per cent write-off for machinery.  That is something you do not get in other businesses.  In certain circumstances a businessman may get it in one year, but he will not get it every year.  On a dwellinghouse there will be a 33 per cent write-off.  That is something else one does not get in other businesses.  The farmer is being dealt with very fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £100 valuation on a notional basis will not apply to a company or individual where the rateable valuation exceeds £50 or where one or other controls more than 25 per cent of the ordinary share capital.  How does this tie in?  Does it mean a farmer will form a company with <Col N="716" /> acres of land?  Is that how he will become a company?  He may own 98 per cent and his wife may own 2 per cent.  If he wants to transfer his share to his family, does this mean he cannot use the notional figure?  If it does, I think it is wrong.  The transfer will be in the hands of the same family and the transferee should be able to use the notional figure and pay on profits only.</P>
    <P>With regard to the write-up, a great number of people in this city, professional and semi-professional, were using this write-up of interest against the purchase of shares.  If they made anything out of these they would write off what was due and they paid no income tax because they used the interest on their investments against their own particular jobs and that meant a capital profit eventually when they sold out.  This has not happened in the last year or so because shares dropped, but it did happen prior to that.  They bought these shares very cheaply and that helped to inflate the market about two-and-a-half years ago.  Some of these were giving a return of 1 per cent.  Now they are giving a return of 16 and 17 per cent. There is no limiting of interest allowable to a person carrying on his own business.  If one wants to expand and has to borrow money for that purpose it is a straightforward business transaction.</P>
    <P>I am worried about one thing.  The £2,000 limit may be insufficient for a person purchasing his own house.  At the moment building societies are inclined to give loans up to £7,500.  The cost of houses can increase for internal or external reasons.  The cost of materials may increase.  Interest rates have increased.  Anybody who wants to buy a house over £8,000 must go to a merchant banker or a money or insurance broker for the finance.  He will then pay up to 17 per cent for the 15-year period.  A man should be allowed to write off his interest against tax when purchasing his one and only house.</P>
    <P>There are three very important things in business generally&mdash;labour, money and management.  Good management is very important to us.  We <Col N="717" /> have good labour relations although money may be scarce.  We may train our management personnel or import them but I would prefer if we had our own.  A man earning £11,000 in England would be in the same income bracket as a man earning £15,000 here.  We have seen many companies going to the wall.  Suddenly they brought in a company doctor.  Within six months he will have put the company on its feet again and nobody will have lost his job.  We should try to keep these people here or, if necessary, bring in experts from abroad.</P>
    <P>We give grants to industrialists tax-free allowances for exports and grants for training.  We give nothing to those in top management positions.  Many people start factories and give much needed employment in certain areas. Later on, they may want to go elsewhere because they do not have the ability to keep the business going. This is where top management comes in.  If we have not got the people to do these jobs we are in trouble. The limit of £2,000 could be right in 80 to 90 per cent of the cases but, equally, it could be wrong in the 10 to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am sure by this time next year the Minister and his staff will have found even more ways for tax-avoidance. I agree with section 52 which says that tax-relieved dividends may be paid to directors and certain employees qualifying for export sales. The Revenue Commissioners have now reserved the right to count some or even all of that money as income, if necessary.  The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>Section 53 is intended to prevent the avoidance of tax on interest arising from certificates of deposit or other assignable deposits.  Certain depositors have avoided the payment of tax in respect of such interest by selling certificates or assigning deposits shortly before the maturity date...</P>
    <P>Does this cover Government loans? If so, it is unfair.  Over the years Governments have introduced loans from 4 to 10 per cent, as money became scarce.  As the new loans gave a higher <Col N="718" /> interest rate, the old securities dropped to nothing if there was not a capital profit somewhere along the line.  It does not matter if the person who buys the security in the last five years make the profit because he will take into account the number of years still to run when buying.  If the eventual seller does not make a capital profit, the person who was willing to back the country by putting his money into it will never do so again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 54 is aimed at preventing the loss of tax on dividend income where a person exercises an option to accept additional shares in a company instead of dividends.  I agree with this.  Under the law which existed for a number of years the person in the £7,000 or £8,000 bracket has been hammered too much from a tax point of view.  This is one of the main reasons for tax-avoidance. That is why I hope that the person in this income bracket will get a bigger tax allowance than £2,000 when he is buying his house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing in section 55.  Fianna Fáil did nothing about this matter.  I often wonder how many of their friends are <Col N="719" /> using this tax haven.  The net of taxation is being spread; I do not know if all areas are covered but only time will tell.</P>
    <P>Section 60 deals with offices.  Prior to this if a person built an office block he paid 15 per cent to the Government but if he bought premises that were already used as offices and carried out renovation work he was entitled to 15 per cent.  The section closes the loophole that existed previously.  The person in this instance will probably be caught by the capital gains tax but I am not objecting to that.</P>
    <P>Section 79 restricts the increased rate of 15 per cent stamp duty.  Do I take it from this section that only in Dublin is it necessary to pay the tax?  Does it apply throughout the rest of the country?  What is the situation with regard to Dún Laoghaire?  In Bray one is not required to pay the 15 per cent but a short distance away the stamp duty is necessary.  Land in Dublin is more expensive than elsewhere.  I agree there may be too many office blocks but the charge should be applied throughout the country and not only in Dublin.  Office development should be able to carry this expense but it should be general throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The rest of the points deal mainly with small tax changes.  Overall, the measure should be accepted by everyone in the House.  I would make the point to the Minister that a person who is allowed only £2,000 interest against tax may be in an awkward situation.  What happens to the man who was committed to the purchase of a house?  In such a situation he might require a much greater allowance against tax.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to ensure that any person who purchases a house before this measure becomes law should be treated according to the law that existed at the time of purchase. We need to entice those who are in the top management bracket into this country.  Such persons should be allowed to claim the interest payable on their houses against tax. People in this category cannot get <Col N="720" /> money at the cheaper rate because of world scarcity.  I might point out that in the money market in England one can get up to 22 per cent.  The people in the top management bracket who are necessary for this country should be given an allowance in regard to the purchase price of their houses or the interest might be reduced to 10 per cent rather than the rate of 15 or 16 per cent now obtaining.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we will put Deputy Belton's speech under both headings.  In the course of this rather strange parliamentary procedure, the most important annual Bill to come before the House is being discussed. This Bill gives legislative effect, so far as that is necessary, to the Government's economic and fiscal policy.  We had a speech yesterday from the Minister for Finance which ran into 19 pages.  One page and five lines were devoted to what one might call general economic topics or the general background to the Bill; the other 18 pages were devoted to a gloss on the explanatory memorandum and gave some detailed explanations of some of the sections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The page and five lines which were devoted to the general background contained some choice phrases of which we have had a lot in the last 15 months, one of them being: there will be one law for all, not one for the rich and another for the poor.  The people, even the most unsophisticated of us, are beginning to get a little tired of that kind of terminology.  We are beginning to realise that that type of high-sounding phrase, with nothing to back it up in this Bill or in other legislation, is of little meaning and value. I wonder what those who had hoped that there would be one law for the poor and one law for the rich thought when the Minister for Finance came out six or eight weeks after he introduced his ill-fated new system of capital taxation and, as a result of various pressures on him, changed radically many of those proposals, particularly in relation to wealth tax. I suppose it is not unusual that pressures should be brought to bear on a Minister for Finance in relation to any proposal he makes in regard to taxation.  However, I think I would be correct in saying that for the first time in the history of this State, since <Col N="722" /> independence, we had a member of the Cabinet coming out publicly, in this House&mdash;and he could not do it any more publicly than that&mdash;to attack the proposals of his colleague at the same table with whom he is collectively responsible.  We had the extraordinary statements at the time by the Minister for Finance to the effect that in spite of Fianna Fáil's efforts to pin this White Paper on us, we will not have any of it; this is a thing that was concocted by civil servants; it has nothing to do with the Coalition or Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>Apparently in response to that particular, unique pressure, we had the Minister for Finance saying some weeks later that he was making very radical changes in the wealth tax in spite of the fact that he had gone around the country shortly before that defending everything that was in the original White Paper and saying how necessary and how just a form of proposed taxation it was.</P>

It was as a result of a public attack in this House by one of his own colleagues with whom he is collectively responsible for that White Paper that that White Paper was changed radically.  I welcome the changes in so far as they go with regard to the wealth tax.  I would welcome it more if the whole thing was dropped altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the budget debate there were a number of references to the Minister's proposals as published in the budget, with regard to the imposition of taxation on farmers for the first time this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke on the budget I remember that sitting opposite me was Deputy Michael Pat Murphy, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and a distinguished member of Cork County Council.  At the time I said that the Minister proposed in his budget to take away half the personal allowances from anybody who had &ldquo;off farm&rdquo; employment no matter how small that person's farm might be.  Deputy M.P. Murphy told me that this was wrong and that it was not in the budget.  I delayed the House for a moment or two while I got a copy of the Minister's speech and read out the relevant extract from it.  Then I asked Deputy M.P. Murphy had the Minister said this or not.  He agreed with me then that the Minister had said it and he said: &ldquo;I bet you that will not be in the Finance Bill,&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;I bet you, too, Deputy, it will not be in the Finance Bill.&rdquo;  Lo and behold, we have had the Finance Bill since last Tuesday. One of the first things I went to look <Col N="724" /> for was this but it is not in it, or at least it is not in it in the form the Minister had proposed.  Of course, the Minister had back-tracked somewhat earlier, before the Bill was even published, and he had limited&mdash;as he does now in section 28&mdash;the application of the taking away of half a person's personal allowances to those whose valuation exceeded £20.  That, in itself, was&mdash;as I had forecast would happen &mdash;a major change on the announcement that was made in the budget.</P>
    <P>But this is the type of thing we tend to expect because we had an example of it in last year's budget and Finance Bill and we had the very example that I forecast in the budget debate we would have again this year.  Even with that change incorporated in section 28 here, as opposed to what the Minister said originally, there are still very many people with valuations of £20 but with small quantities of land who have no hope of supporting themselves and their families out of those small pieces of land.  Indeed, in my county of Limerick there are certain areas&mdash; and they are not by any means necessarily the areas of best land&mdash;where the poor law valuation is £2 per statute acre.  Therefore, somebody with a £20 valuation could be, and in many instances is, a man with ten statute acres of land, equivalent to about six-and-a-half or seven Irish acres.  If such a man takes employment outside of his farm&mdash;and it is almost inevitable that he will have to do so&mdash;he loses half the personal allowances to which he was entitled hitherto and to which the man working next to him in the factory, shop, creamery or wherever, is entitled.</P>
    <P>Even before the publication of this Bill the Minister tried rather frantically to mend his hand in this respect.  Even though he has done so up to a point and taken from the effect of his budget proposals many of the people who would have been affected, he has not done so by any means in relation to all of them.  Unfortunately, there are a great many of them who are not yet aware that this treat lies in store for them as soon as this Bill is passed, as passed presumably it must be, even <Col N="725" /> though there is nobody in here, apart from Deputy P. Belton, to speak in support of it.</P>

I think the Deputy's dedication to duty should be marked in some way.  The only aspect that worries me is that poor Deputy Belton may get into trouble with his Whip as we understand there was a severe whip out that nobody, front bench or back bench, was to speak in support of this Bill.  It must be the first time for a long time that we did not have a Government Minister in to try to support his colleague.  For example, we have had no appearance from the Minister for Industry and Commerce. One would have expected he would be here to lend weight to the words of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I postponed this question from last week because I was anxious to ask the Minister some questions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there has been no reduction in the incidence of foot patrolling.

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That would apply to every part of the country but the amount of policing available in that area is the amount decided on by the professional authorities, the gardaí, as being adequate to meet the needs of the area.  The proof that their judgment has been correct is to be seen in the improving crime statistics.

      <P>As I said in reply to a similar question by the Deputy in July, 1973, a draft directive on this subject is at present before the EEC Council.  The implications for that directive, and for other proposals before the Council, of the recent decision by the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the case of <i>Reyners v. Belgium</i> are at present under consideration by the EEC Council and Commission.  A further case, the decision in which may be relevant to the draft directive on lawyers, is at present before the court.</P>

There has been progress in so far as there has been a judicial decision by the European Court which has clarified areas that were the subject of discussions in connection with the draft directive. While they clarified the discussions they also introduced new considerations which have to be taken into account in further discussions.  As I indicated, the matter is now further complicated by the fact that there is another case on the same subject pending before the European Court and until that case is decided one cannot anticipate finality in the directive.</P>

    <P>To allow such an arrangement, however worthy the motives of the observer and however responsible he might be, would involve an unacceptable intrusion on the rights of those citizens with whom the gardaí in the patrol car have occasion to deal, <Col N="729" /> rights which include the right to be afforded such privacy in their dealings with the Garda as the circumstances permit.</P>

      <P>For various reasons, including a continuing increase in the volume of business, there have for several years been substantial arrears of work in the Land Registry which have resulted in considerable delays in registration of title.</P>
      <P>Many remedial measures, including the reorganisation of both the legal/ clerical structure and the mapping branch, have been taken in recent years in order to provide a more efficient service.  As a result of these measures, the arrears of work were reduced by 12 per cent in 1973 and by a further 9 per cent in the first five months of this year.</P>
      <P>While this is a significant improvement I am extremely concerned about the hardship which is being caused by the delays which still exist and I have initiated other measures designed to accelerate the rate of the reduction of the arrears.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, in rural areas, uncontrolled dogs cause much anxiety to sheep farmers and the Garda will, of course, continue to prosecute for offences under the Dogs Acts wherever they have evidence to warrant prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Dogs Act, 1906, the Garda are empowered to seize stray dogs.  In the Dublin Metropolitan Area, however, stray dogs are dealt with by the Dublin Branch of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals who receive an annual grant from the Garda Vote for relieving the Garda of the task. The society has been in receipt of this <Col N="733" /> grant since about 1909 and last year I succeeded in having the amount of the grant increased from £1,000 to £2,000.  In so far as the rest of the country is concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that the Garda are not in a position to undertake the seizure of stray dogs on an extended or intensive scale.</P>
    <P>The problem of stray dogs is one which has been considered in my Department and in other Departments and it has been suggested that local authorities might be empowered to exercise functions in relation to stray dogs should the occasion for so empowering them present itself in the context of future legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the scarcity of text books on Irish law and, indeed, in an effort to remedy that situation my Department have, for some years past, been operating a scheme of financial assistance towards the publication of such books.  The scheme is operated through the Incorporated Council of Law and Reporting for Ireland, who have undertaken the publication of text books on legal subjects.</P>
      <P>In point of fact, the real problem appears to be that there are not enough people in this country who are able and willing to undertake the authorship of text books of this kind.</P>
      <P>I would, of course, welcome any fresh initiatives which the universities or the professional legal bodies might be in a position to suggest in the matter with a view to remedying the present state of affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect the way the publication of books is financed involves giving a grant to the authors.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>Eligibility for health services, and in particular full eligibility, is related to the ability of the person concerned to pay for these services.  It would be contrary to this principle and to the legislation governing eligibility to disregard one or more sources of income in assessing eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> I should add that persons who are in receipt of special allowances arising from the War of Independence have passed a qualifying means test and probably have full eligibility for health services.  Military Service Pensions, on the other hand, are given without a means test and the fact that a person is in receipt of such a pension is no indication of whether or not he is eligible for health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were to talk about a minority of people who might be allowed into the general eligibility scheme, there are quite a number of these sections.  There are 15,200 who are in receipt of special allowances and military service pensions.  There are 10,400 who have special allowances. They have undergone a means test through the Department of Defence and there is no reason why I should not assume that this 10,400 people are eligible at present for medical service cards.  In regard to pensions, the maximum pension is about £2,000 which would be beyond the limit of eligibility for a medical service card.</P>

Again, as I have said, as far as special allowances are concerned, the vast majority of them have them in any case.  I do not think the Deputy would suggest, in accordance with the guidelines, no matter what he might think of them, that a single person with £2,000 a year, should be entitled to a medical service card.</P>

      <P>The decision on whether or not this applicant is entitled to a medical card is one for the chief executive officer of the North Western Health Board.

      <P>In view of the Minister's stated policy regarding the recipients of unemployment assistance, where there is a very low means test, could he ensure that not alone in respect of the North Western Health Board but in respect of all the others, these applications would automatically be granted?  Would the Minister not agree that this is ridiculous. Over a year ago this man, in the circumstances in which he is in today, applied for a medical card, was refused, and had to go to the trouble of asking for a review which has not taken place yet.  He is over a year waiting for a medical card.  The Minister in the House stated that all those who were in receipt of benefits such as this man has were entitled to automatically get medical cards.</P>

I think the same person is referred to, though not by name, in the next question.  I invite the Deputy to talk to me personally about this.

      <P>I answered a similar question from the Deputy on 5th July, <Col N="741" /> 1973.  Since then, health boards, with my approval, have introduced a scheme of sponsoring physiotherapy students on condition that, on successful completion of training, the persons sponsored undertake to take up employment with health boards for at least two years.  So far, 32 students have accepted sponsorship.  Moreover, the places available in the two physiotherapy schools in this country were increased from 46 to 54 places last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not answer the second part of the Deputy's question.  In the case where the doctor <Col N="744" /> who is the choice of the patient is not available, he is bound to provide a <i>locum</i> before he disappears from the district.  There may be other circumstances where it is not possible to visit the doctor of one's choice. For example one might be on holiday, or the medical card holder might be away from his own area.  There is provision whereby another doctor could examine and prescribe and give a prescription to be given to a chemist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many patients who have had a doctor for many years find that their doctor has not opted to join the scheme and they have to pick a doctor who is not their choice? Therefore, they still remain with the doctor who is not in the scheme. In fact, they are saving the health scheme some money.  All they are asking is that their prescriptions should be honoured.  I do not see why this should be objected to.  I would ask the Minister to look into this very seriously.  It arises particularly in respect of old people who have been used to one doctor for years.  In those special circumstances I would appeal to the Minister to make a special order about this and save money for the health services.</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation an old age, non-contributory, pension is not payable to a person who takes up residence outside the State except in the case of a person who takes up residence in Northern Ireland.  In that case the non-contributory pension may be paid for a period of five years or until the person concerned becomes entitled to receive supplementary benefit in Northern Ireland whichever first occurs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there are people in the west of Ireland who find it necessary to go to live with married sons and daughters in England and that these regulations deprive them of benefiting from the old age pension?

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the non-contributory old age pension is granted as a result of a means test.  If a person is residing outside the State in the circumstances which the Deputy describes, it is possible that the means have changed. There is provision that, if a person goes outside the State, on returning he can receive retrospectively up to a period of three months the non-contributory old age pension.  In certain circumstances that can be extended to six months.</P>

Where a single person, a widow or widower is in receipt of a non-contributory old age <Col N="750" /> pension of £7.30 per week, only 5p a week is assessed as income.  Where one of a married couple is in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension of £10.95 per week, the pension is disregarded completely.  Where a married couple are in receipt of a combined old age non-contributory pension of £14.60 per week, only 97½p per week is assessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he proposes to take any action to improve the demand for private houses in view of the statement by the Construction Industry Federation that up to 4,000 houses are now vacant; and if he has taken any decision to increase the limit on local authority loans to assist further the building societies to meet the demands for homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 to 30, inclusive, and 32 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a parliamentary question, No. 4 of the 27th June, the Government have taken steps to ensure financial support for a high level of activity under the public capital programme by providing £281.6 million in the programme for the nine months period ending 31st December, 1974.</P>
      <P>Approximately £179 million of the provision for the period to 31st December next will generate work for the construction industry.  This would represent an investment of £240 million in a full year and compares with expenditure on corresponding work of £205 million last year and £161 million in 1972-73.  I am satisfied that the substantial financial support for the building industry in the programme has contributed to the continuing high level of employment in the private sector of the building and construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme includes £60.6 million for housing in the current nine months period which is equivalent to £78.8 million for a full year&mdash;an increase of £10.6 million over last year and £32.6 million over that provided in 1972-73.  Furthermore, the subsidy introduced last year to encourage a <Col N="754" /> higher level of investment in building societies is being continued.</P>
    <P>In so far as the local authorities house purchase loans scheme is concerned, while I have no immediate proposals to increase the limits, I am keeping the matter under continuous review in the light of increases in house prices and changes in wages and salaries of persons for whom the scheme is intended.</P>
    <P>The Government's target figure for housing output for the 12 months period ending 31st March, 1975 is 25,000 dwellings.  I expect local authority housing output in that period to be of the order of 7,250 dwellings, the balance to be provided by the private sector.</P>
    <P>At a meeting which I had recently with representatives of the Construction Industry Federation, they outlined their views on the present situation regarding house purchase finance.  I noted the federation's representations and I am keeping the matter under constant review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that statements are being issued by the federation spokesman that there is a threat to employment in the construction industry, particularly in the private housebuilding sector, that there are great fears that after the summer holiday period is concluded there will be many thousands of building employees made redundant?  If the Minister is aware of that, is he saying that he does not agree that there is a possibility of unemployment on any scale in the building industry in the next few months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that, while I am aware that there are people, who should know better, making statements similar to the statements they made last year to the effect there was going to be widespread unemployment in the building construction industry, arrangements will be made, if necessary, to provide additional finance. This was done last year when the occasion arose and I can assure the Deputy and the House there will be no question of the building industry not getting the necessary finances.  It is <Col N="755" /> a matter of interest that there are more employed in the building industry now than there were last year and, not alone more, but considerably more than last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to try to emerge from the forest of statistics and his grandlose promise about money being available and apply himself to the realities of the situation, as indicated by one of those involved in the construction industry, and may I refer, in particular, to a statement he made on the radio today between 1.30 p.m. and 2 p.m. &mdash;he is the director general of the Construction Industry Federation&mdash; that between now and the summer holidays there is a likelihood of up to 5,000 workers in the building industry being laid off unless there is an immediate injection of adequate capital into the building industry?  I have no axe to grind.  I was listening to a man whose interpretation of the situation I am entitled to take into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the former Taoiseach to take into consideration the fact that someone who is Minister for Local Government is in a responsible position and should be believed far more quickly than someone who, this time last year, went on the radio and said almost the same thing.  I have pointed out to Deputy Lynch that there were 7,000 more houses built last year than were ever built under his Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Ceann Comhairle will allow me, I think it is only fair that I should now say something that should not have to be said because there are at least two people over there on the Opposition benches who should know the answer.  Obviously, they do not want it to come out. Deputy Lynch's query shows that he either does not know or does not want to know.  Every year the average was 3,500 to 4,000 houses.  Deputy Lynch knows this well.  In 1973, because <Col N="758" /> of the very good arrangement by his Government, that there would have to be a certificate of value for any house above a certain figure, there were 10,000 starts in the first month of the year.  Deputy Lynch knows that and he also knows that people, including the Central Bank, stated there was a 60 per cent drop in the number of starts.  They know this was so.  Six thousand of these were by people who were jumping the gun.  Deputy Molloy knows that because he was Minister for Local Government at the time.  These Opposition tactics are just so much propaganda.</P>

I should like to remind Deputy Molloy&mdash;apparently he has not <Col N="759" /> read things correctly&mdash;that he should be aware of the fact that building societies were lending so much money last year there was a switch over to local authority loans because of arrangements this Government made and there were twice as many local authority loans given as in the previous year.

      <P>My arguments when the Bill was introduced were dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence and on Second and Committee Stages by the Attorney General.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on one's political prejudice.  I understand that the Attorney General cannot be present today.  I am sure the Minister has read and studied in detail my Second Stage speech and, indeed, the whole record of the debate in addition to the prolonged contributions on the various amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We had the benefit of a former practising barrister, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and of a former senior council, the Attorney General.  Now we have the other spectrum of the profession, the Minister for Justice, who was a respected solicitor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we have this spectrum of the legal profession lined up against the Opposition's very reasonable proposition that the Director of Public Prosecutions should not be a civil servant.  My amendments on Committee Stage were rejected with one exception in a very civilised fashion. One amendment was accepted much to my surprise and pleasure.  Since then I have conducted a poll of my own throughout the legal profession.  With one exception from a non-practising member of the legal profession who holds a position in the local authority, I received nothing but support for the views I put before the House in relation to the type of experience a <Col N="770" /> Director of Public Prosecutions should have.</P>
      <P>Again, I make the point that effectively the Attorney General is handing over the functions of the criminal law with which he deals to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Effectively, the Director will take on the administration of the office and practice of the Attorney General.  Section 2 of the Bill sets out clearly the type of person needed to fill this office.  We expressed our disagreement on the grounds that the person appointed should be a senior counsel of not less than five years' standing or a practising barrister of not less than 15 years' standing.</P>
      <P>This is not a line up against the Civil Service or the person who will be taken from the Civil Service to hold the office.  We are expressing our point of view on the grounds of principle.  The Attorney General said the Director of Public Prosecutions would have absolute independence in the exercise of his functions.  We agree with that principle, but we do not accept that it will be so if the person taken from the Civil Service becomes the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Civil Service by definition is dependent on the Government Minister for decisions on policy-making matters.  This is right and proper.  This is not meant as a criticism of the Civil Service because they have never been found wanting in the service of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have the Director of Public Prosecutions taking over the functions of the Attorney General who is a constitutional person and he is to be a civil servant.  A civil servant is a dependent person within the structure of politics and the whole front of Governmental endeavour.  It is in the nature of things that he backs up the Government of the day for, by definition, the Government leads.  I do not necessarily accept that the Director of Public Prosecutions will be absolutely independent in the exercise of this function if he is a civil servant. As I said, this is in no way meant to criticise the person who will hold the office.  It is a fact that throughout <Col N="771" /> history the Civil Service have been dependent in the final analysis on the thinking of the Government of the day.  Consequently, I do not think the Attorney General realised what he said when he stated that the Director of Public Prosecutions would be independent in the exercise of his functions. If the Director of Public Prosecutions were the person we suggested there could be no doubt that he would be absolutely independent in the discharge of his duties.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General said that a solicitor, barrister or servant of a local authority could become a Director of Public Prosecutions and I pointed out that here was the making of my case. The Director of Public Prosecutions so appointed from a local authority would not have the necessary practice from the Supreme Court to the High Court and the various courts under its jurisdiction, to the Circuit Court and the District Courts.  That was the distinction I was drawing.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General made the point that in some way we must have an advocate as Director of Public Prosecutions.  I can only say it is quite the contrary.  When a person is appointed Director of Public Prosecutions I imagine he would cease to engage in the profession of advocacy but he would have the experience of practising in the profession, more particularly in the practice of criminal law.</P>
    <P>There is very little we can do at this stage to change the Government's mind on the matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary quite clearly set the ground-work, the Attorney General dealt with the various amendments and now we have the Minister for Justice to give the Bill the kiss of death from the point of view of the Opposition.  We do not have the personnel to challenge a division that would be successful, to beat back the Government's views on the Bill.  Nevertheless, it will be interesting to hear the views of the Minister for Justice and I am sure they will be consistent with those expressed by his two colleagues.</P>
    <P>We have been consistent in our <Col N="772" /> attitudes to the Bill.  We have said that the person to be Director of Public prosecutions should have the knowledge of a practising lawyer, preferably a senior counsel or a practising junior counsel.  As we understand it, the director will be taking over the whole area of administration of the criminal law from the Attorney General, in addition to election and referendum petitions.  That being so, our case is made even stronger.  The person appointed may not have been practising at the Irish Bar for more than ten years or he may not have been practising as a solicitor for more than ten years.  This seems extraordinary to this side of the House and I am sure the Minister will agree that it is unusual that a person who has not practised in the criminal law and who has not a comprehensive knowledge of that law should be appointed to this post.</P>
    <P>These observations are pessimistic but they must be so.  We have put forward a clear, concise case, one that is supported, with one or two exceptions, by people outside this House who are more competent in the law than myself.  People have come to me and expressed support. At the same time, I wonder if those people went to the Attorney General expressing their views on the Bill before it was dealt with on Committee Stage?  I placed my amendments and there was a wide acceptance of them.  Before a Bill is introduced into the House members of the public who are interested in the subject are entitled to give their views to the Minister concerned or to the Opposition spokesman.  If the Minister and the Opposition spokesman agree, amendments may be placed and this is the way it should be dealt with.  I do not know how many people went to the Minister for Justice or the Attorney General but, in view of the response after my amendments were dealt with on Committee Stage, it surprises me that somebody did not put forward their views to the Government.</P>
    <P>Apart from the expressions of support for my proposals after Committee Stage and even before these <Col N="773" /> views were expressed to me, I had made up my mind and I have no reason to change my views on the matter.  There should be a clear division between the Executive, the Legislature and the judiciary.  In a fashion, the concept expressed in this Bill is in some way eroding that important distinction.  There should be fresh air between each of those levels.  When the air becomes somewhat polluted, when the Executive and the Legislature come together and merge in some indefinable fashion, we are in trouble.</P>

      <P>The argument advanced by Deputy Andrews to support this case at this stage was based mainly on the fact that people had come to him and said how right he was when he proposed this by way of amendment on Committee Stage. Having regard to the legal circles within which Deputy Andrews moves, the rather rare and precious atmosphere of the Bar Library&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very surprised if he got any advice other than that which he said he had received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest that only people who are at practice at the Bar know what the criminal law is about is to take a very narrow view of the whole idea of knowledge.  There can be most skilled and eminent criminal lawyers who do not practice law for a living but whose knowledge of the law and practice could far exceed that of those who do practice law for a living.  I do not for a moment accept that the quality of the person holding this post would be in any way diminished by reason of the fact that he might not have been, for some time before his appointment, a practising lawyer.  I think there are numerous cases of academic or non-practising lawyers whose knowledge of a particular branch of the law in which they would be specialists would far exceed the <Col N="775" /> knowledge which a practitioner&mdash;who, by and large, would be a general practitioner&mdash;would have accumulated in the course of his practical experience. Certainly, I would have no doubt but that what is proposed in the Bill is correct and is not going to lead to a person of inferior knowledge being appointed to this post.</P>
    <P>Also, it will not take from the independence of the post that the person in question might have been in the public service because the post itself is going to be a very high status one in the area of the public service. As we know from experience, such posts put the occupants of them in a position where they are completely protected from interference and where the <i>modus operandi</i> is such that they are operating in an area where there are very strong conventions controlling and prescribing the standards of conduct which are, invariably, of the highest.  Such a person holding this post will be in that general area of public service which has given so much satisfaction and satisfactory service in the history of this State.  I do not think that this will in any way take from the principle of the separation of powers because it is not a post that is of the Executive completely; neither is it part of the judicial arm completely; nor has it anything to do with the Legislature at all.  It has a rather unusual standing as between the Judiciary and the Executive.</P>

      <P>Again, the Deputy should have welcomed this Bill with open arms because it will rectify the unjust position which was perpetuated for the past 16 years.  We have had that. We shall leave that alone.  An injustice has been removed.  I was talking about the standing of this person constitutionally. I think it is desirable that he be apart from the Executive. <Col N="776" /> This is one of the main objectives of the Bill so that this quasi-judicial function of initiating criminal proceedings would be totally divorced from the Executive or from any influence by the Executive, and this is what is intended.  It cannot be totally divorced from the Executive because the initiation of these things is part of the State in action and this, essentially, is the Executive working.  Likewise, it is not part of the judicial function but, nevertheless, the initiation of proceedings does impinge into the judicial area of the State.  I think the fact that the person who is now going to perform these important functions will be an independent civil servant of the highest rank is an excellent thing and a most desirable reform.  I think the qualifications of that person will be enhanced by the fact that his experience in law and his general experience will not be confined to the narrow world of the Bar Library&mdash;a mixture of the Bar Library plus some experience of administration, or either or both, depending on the wisdom of the people who will advise on the selection of that person. It would be wrong to confine it to people in practice at the Bar.</P>
      <P>I think the Bill is right.  It leaves it open to the appointment to be made of a person exclusively with that experience, or with a mixture of that experience and administrative experience. I think the Bill is correct in permitting both disciplines to be represented in this person.  I think the Bill is right in its general objective in taking the initiation of criminal proceedings out of the political arena and is correct also in endeavouring to be seen to do this because this is what justice is all about.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking <Col N="777" /> before Question Time, I was referring to the proposal of the Minister in this Bill to impose taxation on farmers this year for the first time ever. Like many other people, I think it regrettable that the year the Minister should choose to impose taxation for the first time ever should be one of the worst years for farmers in decades, certainly since the 1930's and in every part of the country to which one goes one hears the same type of story about the problems farmers are encountering at the moment and have been for the past six or nine months.  Only yesterday I heard of men being forced to sell cattle, aged about 15 months, for £50, when 12 months ago those young cattle were worth £60 to £70 as calves.  In the meantime, the farmers concerned have had the trouble and expense of feeding those cattle.  The losses being incurred by farmers this year are enormous.  I think the only consolation they can draw from the situation is that, even with the larger farmers with over £100 valuation being involved this year as a start, very few of them will make any profit this year which would make them liable to income tax.</P>
      <P>As far as the notional basis of assessment is concerned, this has been put across by the Minister as some big concession on his part.  I cannot see any concession in it.  It is proposed to assume, in the absence of accounts, that each farmer in the country made £40 clear profit for every £1 valuation which his land bears.  It appears from my reading of the explanatory memorandum on the section that the only deductions from that will be rates, wages and depreciation of machinery and plant. I am now asking the Minister to tell us whether it is proposed to allow farmers who are assessed on this notional basis their ordinary personal allowances.  On my reading of the section it appears they will not be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad it is not so.  The explanatory memorandum leads one to believe that it is so. <Col N="778" /> It is very specific and indeed I think the Minister's speech was specific on that point&mdash;that the only deductions which he thought would be fair in the circumstances were the three things I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a calculation that has to be made in the computation of farmers' profits.  When you have done that you take off certain allowances.  Many people who opt for this system will pay little or no tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>Under the notional basis for 1974-75, profits were arrived at by multiplying the rateable valuation of the farm land by 40.  From that figure rates on land, depreciation of farm plant and machinery and the wages paid to farm labour can be deducted. I should point out that only these three types of deductions will be admitted in cases of assessment on the notional basis, since this notional basis of assessment by reference to a valuation-multiplier of 40 represents, as matters stand, a very favourable arrangement for farmers and there is no case for making it even more so by allowing further items to be deducted.</P>
      <P>What possible meaning can I or anybody else take from that other than what it states?  Is this another example of the Minister saying a thing apparently off the top of his head even though it is in writing, and then having to go back on it later?  What the Minister tells me now is certainly going back on what he stated in his speech yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  In computing the profits of the Deputy's law practice there are certain deductions made.  We do not deduct the Deputy's personal allowance, his marriage allowance or his children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  We shall only have to wait and see what the Revenue Commissioners do about it. When I spoke on the budget on the suggestion that men who had a few acres of land would, under the terms <Col N="779" /> of the budget, have half their personal allowances in their non-farm activities disallowed, I was told that was not so. I was sneered at and laughed at, as were a number of other Deputies on this side of the House who said the same thing.  We were told that that was wrong.  But before the Finance Bill was even published the Minister for Finance came out and said he was amending his budget proposals and that this would apply to people with valuations of more than £20 only. Perhaps when the Revenue Commissioners explain to the Minister what is involved in this Bill he will amend this in the same way as he amended that. If so, I shall be very happy to see it because I cannot see any farmer, certainly in present circumstances, opting for this notional basis of assessment. It would be far above the profits that any farmer could reasonably be expected to make in this year.</P>
      <P>From my reading of the explanatory memorandum, the last paragraph on page 2 refers to this notional basis of assessment without any limitation as to time, and one is led to believe that this is something which would be a permanent feature of the law on the taxation of farmers.  However, if one goes to the Bill itself, to the index, one will find the heading for section 21 is: &ldquo;Notional basis of assessment for 1974-75.&rdquo;  It appears that this notional basis of assessment is for this current financial year only and that it will be dropped in future.  It is a pity the explanatory memorandum is so misleading on this point.  It is misleading on other points and I do not think it is good enough that an explanatory memorandum should be produced which would mislead the public and Members of this House in the way which this does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, we have had a major change since the budget in relation to the disallowance of half the allowances of somebody who is engaged in off-farm employment.  We have had another change in this Bill in so far as the taxation of farmers is concerned, to which we saw no reference in the budget, but which I regard as a very significant one.  It is <Col N="780" /> not realised or appreciated by a lot of people.  It is the reference to the £50 valuation limit in respect of people who have occupations outside farms. The proposal in regard to the £50 limit, as I understand it, does not make any reference to the disallowance of half the personal allowance. What it does is to make the total farm profits assessable and aggregable with the total non-farm activities of both partners in a marriage.</P>
    <P>In other words, this is the first of many chinks in the original figure of £100 PLV which we on this side of the House forecast would come about. We thought it would come about in the first instance by the fixing of a limit of £100, reducing it to £80 next year and to £60, and so on, in following years, but straightaway in this very Bill, before the thing is put into practice at all, we have a situation that will affect a large number of farmers, all of whom are unaware of it so far, that any one who has a trade or profession or a 25 per cent holding in a company outside of his or her farm will have all of his or her farm profits added to his or her income or to the total income of both spouses and income tax will be chargeable accordingly on the total profits or income from both the farm and other employment.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of people who have farms with £50 valuation and who either themselves or their wives are engaged in another job or profession of one kind or another.  They do not at the moment realise what is in store for them but they will realise it soon enough when they get an exorbitant bill from the inspector of taxes for the current year.</P>
    <P>I will go on to deal with the question of reliefs for various expenses and payments which are allowable under the general income tax code and examine these in the context of the changes proposed in this Bill.  It was pointed out by me and several other Deputies on this side during the budget debate that the Minister's proposals to have this graduated, or &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; as he called it, system of taxation, beginning at 26 per cent and going up to 80 per <Col N="781" /> cent at the top, would cause unfair discrimination against the less well-off taxpayer with corresponding benefits to the better-off.  The examples I gave at the time were the usual sort of payments on which relief can be claimed at the moment&mdash;life assurance premiums, the interest element in mortgage repayments and interest to banks on overdrafts.  There are a number of other lesser matters as well on which claims can be made, but they are the main three.  I was told, and so were the others who raised this point, that we were talking nonsense, that it was not correct.  The Minister for Finance told us this.</P>
    <P>The Minister now acknowledges in section 9 that what we said was right in so far as life assurance was concerned. The Minister referred in his speech to it and said that section 9 is necessary.  He said:</P>
    <P>Under the old tax code, relief from surtax was not given in respect of life assurance premiums but under the new system it is not possible to retain this exclusion.  Accordingly relief may now arise at rates up to 80 per cent on the appropriate fraction of premium payments in the case of individuals with high incomes. It is reasonable, therefore, to take some offsetting measure to limit the effect of this change, and it has been decided to restrict to a maximum of £1,000 the amount of qualifying premiums.  This limit should not adversely affect the vast majority of taxpayers who are saving through the medium of life assurance.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, those who were paying more than £1,000 before budget day will be allowed to continue to pay it.  That is an admission that what a number of us on this side of the House said on the budget debate is correct.  In other words those who are paying higher rates of tax will gain correspondingly higher benefit from this change in the rates.  Therefore, the more life assurance they have the cheaper they will get it.  If they are paying tax at the top rate the net effective cost to them is only 20p in the £.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> Previously everyone, irrespective of income, was entitled to claim at the standard rate of 35 per cent.  We now have the situation that the standard rate is only one of four or five rates. A great many people who will not have more than £1,550 taxable income after their personal allowances and so on have been deducted will find that they can deduct all right in relation to a certain proportion of their life assurance premiums but they can deduct only at 26p in the £ whereas the wealthy man can deduct at 60, 70 or 80p in the £ depending on his particular total rate of taxation.</P>
    <P>I regard it as totally unfair that it should be much more beneficial to a well-off man with an income of approximately £10,000 per year to have life assurance and to get these reliefs and at the same time for a man who is not well off and who pays tax only at the rate of 26p in the £ to save only 26p in the £.  I thought on first reading that what the Minister said was that he proposed to rectify this by equalising the amount which might be deducted by anybody.  It would be the fair way to deal with it.  The Minister recognises the problem and says that the rich will benefit much more than the less well-off but in order to stop the rich benefiting he is putting a limit of £1,000 on the amount of premiums which will qualify.  That is no consolation to the man who pays tax at 26p in the £ and therefore, gets relief at that rate.  The man who pays 80p in the £ will get relief at 80p in the £ but he will be limited to £1,000 in doing so.</P>
    <P>This is simply a gesture by the Minister.  It does nothing to equalise the system of deductions or bring it back to what it was&mdash;a standard rate for everyone irrespective of how well or badly off he may be.  So far as this is concerned it is a very simple matter for many people.  I would like to refer to a leaflet which was sent recently to PAYE payers.  It is headed &ldquo;Budget, 1974&rdquo;. I refer particularly to paragraphs 4 and 5 therein because I believe they are misleading.  One gets the impression that this leaflet was put out as a Coalition public relations exercise rather than anything else.  The information it <Col N="783" /> gives is misleading.  It says that earned income relief is gone.  It does not give the effect of the abolition of the earned income relief.  It gives people the impression that the personal allowances are being raised.  In paragraph 4 there is a heading &ldquo;Unchanged Allowances and Deductions.&rdquo;  It says that the following allowances remain in force&mdash; allowances for life insurance premiums, superannuation contributions and so on.  This is a misleading statement.  It is literally true.  While the allowances in a literal sence remain in force they are not unchanged.  The man who does not have more than £1,550 taxable income is at a disadvantage.  The proof of that is in the next paragraph which says that for 1974-75 each allowance is deductible in arriving at tax payable. The effect of this is to give relief to those paying the highest rates of income tax which are chargeable.</P>
    <P>That is the point we made in the budget debate.  I am glad to see it confirmed in an official publication of the Revenue Commissioners even though the Minister denied it at the time.  This is a very important statement. That is why they have section 9 in the Bill which makes a gesture towards meeting the point we made the last time.  It does nothing towards meeting the principle of the objection we hold towards the favouring of the well-off at the expense of the less well-off. Now that that principle has been accepted by the Minister, in my view the same principle applies precisely to the other matter that is referred to by the Revenue Commissioners and to which we referred in the budget debate, namely, the question of allowances for interest paid in full.</P>
    <P>What affects most people is the question of allowances for the interest element in mortgage repayments on a dwelling house.  The situation exists in which if a man has a taxable income of £10,000 a year his marginal rate of tax is 80p in the £ and the relief, therefore, which he can claim for the interest element in his mortgage repayments is worth 80p in the £ to him.  A man who is endeavouring to buy his own house on a much smaller income and whose taxable income <Col N="784" /> is less than £1,550 after allowances, instead of being allowed to deduct at the standard rate of 35 per cent as heretofore, will be obliged if this Bill is passed to deduct only 26p in the £.</P>
    <P>That is clear discrimination against the less well-off man who is finding it difficult.  It is a clear encouragement to the better-off man to borrow more.  The more he borrows the cheaper it becomes for him.  When he gets himself to the top tax bracket every £ he pays in interest is only really 20p.  The less well-off man who had the right to deduct tax and claim relief at 35 per cent is now entitled to do so at 26 per cent.  This presumably is part of the Just Society which is gradually being foisted on us.  This is practical socialism.  I cannot see any justice in it.  I cannot see any semblance of equity in it.  I now say to the Minister: &ldquo;We were right in what we told you about life assurance. I believe we are right in what we are telling you about mortgage repayments and bank interest on overdrafts. You should take steps immediately to equalise the amount of relief everyone can get, irrespective of what his top tax is.  Not to do it is to be seen to favour the rich at the expense of those who are struggling&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a very sinister section in this Bill, section 57, which proposes to impose for the first time ever in the history of this State, as far as I know, an obligation on solicitors to give information to the Revenue Commissioners about their clients.  I am shocked to see such a section in any Bill introduced here but particularly shocked that the person introducing it is himself a solicitor.  Does he think our colleagues will meekly accept this?  I fervently hope they will not and I, for one&mdash; speaking for myself only&mdash;can assure my fellow solicitors opposite that this sinister, wrong and bad provision will be resisted all the way and that resistance to it will not end if and when this section is passed by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I can tell the Minister that, as a partially practising solicitor at least, if this section is enacted and put into force and if the Revenue Commissioners come to me and ask me for information about a transaction which a client of mine carried out I shall refuse to give that information.  I think the same would apply to 99 per cent of solicitors in <Col N="786" /> the country.  I do not know what the sanctions are for the Revenue Commissioners to force this information from solicitors but if there are sanctions I am prepared to resist them and to put up with the sanctions if I have to.  I certainly would not like to be in the Minister's shoes today in introducing that contemptible provision&mdash;or attempting to do so&mdash;into our law.  I hope, since we have not sufficient Members on this side of the House to prevent such an insidious thing being introduced into our law, that at least a handful of those sitting mutely behind the Minister will not act as so often backbenchers behind the present Government act, like zombies walking through the division lobbies to vote into law things they themselves know are totally abhorrent and wrong.</P>
      <P>I have not heard any Government backbencher seeking to defend section 57 of the Bill.  I challenge any of them now to do so.  There are doctors and lawyers over there who should be aware of the importance of a confidential relationship between a professional man and his client or patient. Now, in the interest of trying to gather more tax the Minister, Deputy Richie Ryan, solicitor, seeks to destroy that.  On his head be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to talk about housing and housing problems because they are not directly relevant but let me observe in passing that we have a most serious housing problem today.  Private builders, as is well known, are closing down all over the country and letting men go.  They are all doing this for one reason&mdash;not that there is no demand for houses but because there are hundreds of houses all over the country which are completed and in which people want to live but which people cannot get money to buy.  Therefore, as a matter of normal prudence in a budget or Finance Bill one would have expected that in these circumstances the Government would have taken some reasonable steps to make money available to building societies, one of the principal sources of finance for those who wish to build or buy their own houses.  There is an obvious and easy <Col N="787" /> way in which the Government could do that&mdash;by removing the income tax obligations from building societies on the interest they pay to their investors. This Bill contains a section continuing the very long standing exemption of building societies from corporation profits tax; it is an annual exemption which apparently has to be renewed but it has been there for many years.</P>
    <P>If ever there was a time when the Government should take some steps in relation to income tax so as to increase the dwindling and almost negligible flow of money into the building societies it is now, in this Bill, that they should do so and introduce a section exempting the funds of investors in building societies from income tax.  This would enable a higher rate of interest to be paid by the societies to potential investors; it would considerably increase building society funds and enable the societies to lend that money to those who need funds to build or buy houses and it would enable them to do it at, not a higher rate of interest but, if anything probably at a lower rate.</P>
    <P>The cost of this, we are told, is about £3 million a year and yet the Government adamantly refuse to do it and allow building firms all over the country to wind down as they are doing now.  Within the past couple of weeks I personally met two major builders of private housing who have told me that D-Day as far as they are concerned is the August week-end; the beginning of the builders' holidays and that if they have not by then seen some indication from the Government of a willingness to tackle this problem they will have to lay off men wholesale.  This happened once before in the memory of most of us, in 1956.  The coincidence is pretty obvious.  There was a lack of confidence then on the part of the building industry and there is a similar lack of confidence now.  It is easy to see why that was so then and why it is so now.  The Minister has an easy solution of much of the problem within his grasp but he arrogantly refuses to do anything about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer now to a matter that is not of very great importance to many people.  This is the provision in section 81 &mdash;a provision which was not in the budget&mdash; to double stamp duty on share transfers and transfers of security other than Irish securities.  This is slipped in nice and quietly although last year's budget would have led us to believe that the Minister wished to abolish all stamp duty and that that budget was the first instalment in that direction. I do not think there are many people who realise yet that stamp duty has doubled on all non-Irish securities, a great many of which are held in this country.  No apology has been made for this.  It is something that is contrary to all that we heard last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as stamp duties generally are concerned, there was a reduction last year on the smaller houses and land transactions but one of the anomalies that I pointed out to the Minister at that <Col N="789" /> time was that, while small sales of houses or land, up to, I think, £1,000, were to be free of duty from last year &mdash;the duty on other small sales of up to £6,000, was reduced&mdash;leases or even ordinary weekly tenancy agreements which involved small rents continued to be subject to stamp duty. Last year the Minister agreed with me that there was no reason in principle why this should be so and he reminded me that there would be another Finance Bill this year and that this would be the time to consider the matter.  However, the matter is not being attended to and, consequently, this anomaly continues with the result that small amounts of money are being taken from people on a basis that is unjustifiable.</P>
      <P>There is no mention in this Bill of death duties.  I presume the excuse for this is that it is proposed to abolish death duties from April of next year.  Certain limits were set last year. These limits have not been increased this year.  In the meantime our rate of inflation has been of the order of 16 to 17 per cent so that in effect one can say there is a corresponding increase in the net impact of death duties in the 12 months from April of this year to April of next year. The Minister makes no reference to this problem either in the Bill or in his speech.</P>
      <P>During the past six months there has been incredibly heavy foreign borrowing by this Government.  There was one loan of £83 million, payable in seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxation that is being raised as a result of this Bill goes in increasing amounts to repay this sort of panic foreign borrowing, borrowing carried out in an effort to keep this country afloat.  The whole inflationary situation has now become such that the Government have a vested interest in its continuing in this way because inflation at this sort of rate keeps them away from day-to-day problems, keeps them going from month to month and from year to year.  Some months ago in this House, <Col N="790" /> shortly after there had been one of the numerous increases in the cost of petrol, beer and cigarettes, Deputy Brennan asked&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I must remind the Deputy that what he is saying bears no relevance to the Finance Bill.  I would ask him to limit his remarks to the contents of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Deputy Brennan asked what was the amount of VAT which would accrue to the Exchequer as a result of these increases.  The increase on petrol was 1p per gallon and there was 1p also on spirits.  The Minister for Finance informed the Deputy that the additional amount of VAT that these two increases would bring into the Exchequer in the current year&mdash;they were minor increases in the context of price increases recently&mdash;would be £850,000.  Every time there is an increase in the price of any commodity other than food the Government get a vast additional amount of taxation. They do not appear to be collecting this extra amount because it is subsumed into the whole price increase of the commodity in question.  It is this sort of additional revenue which is being acquired in this way&mdash;directly as a result of rampant inflation&mdash;that is keeping the Government and, accordingly, the country afloat.  However, it is keeping the country and the Government afloat on a basis that cannot last and one which can only head us towards disaster.</P>
      <P>One of the criteria used to define a banana republic in economic or monetary terms is the achievement of an annual inflation rate of 20 per cent.  Unhappily for this country, we are set fair in this year to achieving that distinction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this Bill will not be very lengthy.  I have merely a few observations to make for the attention of the <Col N="791" /> Minister and also, of course, for the records of the House.  The Finance Bill gives an opportunity to all Deputies to review the financial structure of the country particularly in relation to the budget since the Finance Bill is the instrument by which the budget is implemented.</P>
      <P>From listening to the speeches of Fianna Fáil Deputies one would think that the Minister for Finance had no achievements with which to present us. In this context let us take the question of employment.  It is worthy of note that in 1973 total employment increased by 9,000 jobs compared with a decrease of 7,000 jobs in 1972.  In May, 1974, employment was 5,000 jobs more than for the same period in 1972.  The fact that there are more people at work, that jobs are being created and, above all, that very serious steps were taken in the Finance Bill of 1973 and continued in this Finance Bill to assist the weaker and poorer section of the community is most meritorious.</P>
      <P>This Bill will give effect to the budgetary provisions.  The efforts made by the Minister for Finance to improve the lot of the weaker sections in the community are appreciated throughout the country.  The improvement in old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, children's allowance, the provision for widows and deserted wives, the scheme announced by the Minister for Finance in regard to single women aged 58 years or over who will now be eligible for a pension, represent a considerable contribution to the elimination of loneliness and poverty. The provisions of the Bill will not eliminate completely the vast amount of concealed poverty that still exists but it should be the aim and ambition of every Member of the House to play his part in helping towards the elimination of poverty, distress and loneliness which, regrettably still exist and which we all have a duty to alleviate.</P>
      <P>Unemployment benefits have been again increased.  I am sure it is the policy of the Government to reduce unemployment and to create employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> I would direct the attention of Fianna Fáil to the fact that they and the farmers' organisations speak with one voice in regard to the tax provisions of this Bill and the fact that a number of farmers will be liable to pay income tax.  The income tax system must be overhauled so as to provide a fair system which would include everybody.  It is most regrettable that to date the tax system has been such that some persons were obliged to pay while others got off scot free and in many instances those least able to pay were obliged to contribute generously while the law enabled certain sections of the community to be completely tax free.  The farmers' organisations include the IFA, the Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the Land League and other organisations that represent persons engaged in activities on the land.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record a recommendation which needs to be made and which I make in all sincerity.  I represent a constituency which could be described as a good agricultural area in which there are some of the most progressive, hardest working and best type of farmers, some engaged in tillage, some in milk production and some in beef production.  I do not think it is right in present circumstances, having regard to the necessity to increase exports in order to rectify balance of payments deficiencies, that there should be double taxation in respect of those engaged in agriculture.  A fair system of taxation should include every citizen. There is no justification for double taxation of any section.  Farmers who are landowners will be obliged under this Bill to pay income tax.  The amount of rates which they will have to pay can be included in their income tax returns and there will be an allowance in respect of it.  Nevertheless, the rates must be paid out of profits.  The Government must seriously examine this because double taxation or, in some cases, treble taxation, could not be described as fair and just.  A system whereby every citizen whose income so warrants would pay income tax would be fair and just.  The question of persons <Col N="793" /> being liable to double or treble taxation must be looked at again.</P>
    <P>I want to express my views as a rural Deputy with very close connections with the farming community because of the profession in which I am engaged.  I have been a Member of this House for very close on 32 years and I think I have always been noted for expressing what I believe to be a fair and honest opinion.  I do not think that in all those 32 years I have experienced such a serious depression amongst the farming community as I have experienced in the past 12 months.  What I am anxious about is whether there will be any danger of the Government not having their ear sufficiently to the ground. That is why I feel it part of my job as a Deputy supporting this Government to make it known clearly and without doubt that the depression and gloom hanging over the small, the medium and the large farmer is something which has caused extreme anxiety to all of us and particularly those of us who live amongst them because they are our neighbours and our friends.  We share their delights and pleasures but also share their sorrows and depressions.  I want to assure the Minister that no farmer in this country need have any worries or doubts about the income tax inspectors because their incomes will be so extremely limited in relation to this financial year that they will not present any difficulty.  I am quite satisfied that the income of the farmers in my constituency has dropped dramatically and things have not been made easier for them.</P>
    <P>I lament the hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil in pointing the finger at this Government and saying that they have in any way contributed to this most depressing and disastrous situation. Nobody knows better than Fianna Fáil that that is not the position. The Fianna Fáil Party know quite well and I may say that nobody knows better than the IFA, that on 19th September last a European gentleman called Hafarkamp, who I understand was in charge of European finances, a gentleman whose acquaintance I have not made and about <Col N="794" /> whom I know nothing beyond reading his recommendation to the Irish Government, reported that it was absolutely essential for the Irish Government to tax Irish farmers and he criticised previous Governments for not having done so.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that in addition to the Irish farmers being taxed, there should be a serious curb on wages and that banks as lending agencies should be advised by the Government to restrict their lending activities.  In cases where loans had been issued and were being issued, according to Mr. Hafarkamp and his colleagues in Europe, rates of interest should be increased to such an extent that it would be prohibitive for borrowers to seek loans.  Fianna Fáil know that this report was submitted to the Irish Government, and to the Irish public and Irish farmers' organisations. They read it and all protested against it.  They questioned it and resented the intrusion of this gentleman or anybody else in the domestic affairs of this country in relation to who should, or should not, be taxed.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister and to put it on record that whatever the officers of his Department say, and I have no doubt that there is no Irish civil servant who would deliberately mislead his Minister, there is a very serious shortage of money for agricultural development, that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is bound up in large knots of red tape and that the farm modernisation scheme has added a serious tightening to these knots and from my knowledge both as an auctioneer and a Deputy, the Agricultural Credit Corporation is of little use to any of them.  I also want to say that if we are obliged to introduce new forms of taxation on people already suffering from starvation of credit to assist them to produce more and to give them some encouragement to work harder, the situation calls for special examination by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to our competing with the rest of Europe, unless our farmers are to trot after the rest&mdash; we will have an opportunity of going <Col N="795" /> into the whole concept of the Common Market in September or October&mdash;there is an extremely bleak future, not alone for Irish farmers but for French, Italian and all other European farmers because of the serious bungling which is clearly evident in relation to the whole structure of European agricultural policy.  The Minister should dig his heels in the ground and when attending meetings of the Council of Ministers, should resist vigorously and determinedly any intrusion by European politicians, or semi-trade unionists, be they socialist, communist or conservative and should tell them to keep their noses out of the domestic affairs of the member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the anxiety of the Chair to keep Members within the limits of the Bill but this Bill imposes a taxation on farmers and brings them within the scope of income tax.  As the Ceann Comhairle arrived, I was pointing out that the Government and the Irish public, viewed with concern and alarm the report from a European gentleman, Mr. Hafarkamp, in which he made certain observations as to who should and who should not pay tax here.  I should like to record my resentment at any European politician imposing a tax on the farmers of this country or advocating the imposition of such a tax.  The Government, elected by the people, and this Parliament can look after the domestic and internal affairs of this country without the intrusion of people who have advocated the imposition of these taxes.  On the other hand, I have very little sympathy, if one can describe it as sympathy, for people who get themselves into trouble.  The farmers of this country thought they would never get themselves quickly enough under the umbrella of people <Col N="796" /> like the European gentleman I referred to.  Perhaps they see the results of that now.</P>
      <P>Within the next 12 months the whole question of taxation in relation to those engaged in agriculture will have to be examined.  The question of the double taxation, or the treble taxation, by way of the continuance of the payment of rates will have to be examined and this examination will have to be carried out before the next budget.  I genuinely feel that the farming community who have put forward proposals in relation to this double taxation system have a case and, in my view, it is one of reasonable merit which should be examined by the Government.  I also feel that the Minister for Finance would be well advised to seriously consider some form of generous subsidisation in relation to the farming community so that they may in some way be compensated for the appalling, serious and disastrous losses they have experienced in recent times.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that not since the days of the economic war has there been such a drop in the income of those landowners who are engaged in livestock.  Banks are putting on pressure, and let there be no doubt about it but that the banks are putting on pressure on certain landowners.  Landowners have been notified by the banks that they cannot get a penny piece of additional overdraft from now until they lodge what is described as the annual harvest cheques.  It is an appalling thing to have people without money.  It is very fine for us to speak as Members of this House but we have not had the experience of the embarrassment of such circumstances.</P>

      <P>That is another question.  Those of us who are accustomed to communicating with the income tax offices know that the inspector of taxes will not be as generously disposed towards the taxpayer as the Minister would be were he an inspector.</P>
      <P>From my close connection with the farming community I have seen the very serious loss of income they have experienced.  The Minister for Finance should keep this matter under review, particularly the question of the payment of rates.</P>

      <P>It should be kept under constant review but it may <Col N="798" /> be possible for the Minister, after his discussions with the representatives of the farming community, to take the necessary steps in relation to rates. A substantial subsidy should be paid to farmers where it is established that serious losses in income have occurred and there is no trouble in establishing that beyond any shadow of doubt.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister consider an amendment to this Bill at a later stage whereby rates will be removed from all community and parochial halls?  We are advocating greater facilities, recreational and otherwise, in rural Ireland.  These halls have been seriously handicapped by having to pay rates.  All parochial and community halls in rural Ireland should be derated.</P>

      <P>It is very necessary that this should be done. I had to appeal in the Circuit Court and elsewhere on behalf of a number of parishes in the midlands in an effort to have the valuation of different country halls reduced.  There are voluntary committees running those halls in order to keep some form of activity alive in rural Ireland and it is very wrong that they should have heavy rates imposed on them.</P>
      <P>I want to give the Minister an assurance, and he may accept my word for it if he has any doubts about the opinions expressed by members of the Opposition, that there is a serious problem in relation to money for housing.  Let there be no doubt whatever about that.</P>

      <P>Whatever the views of the Chair are I will accept them but I want to assure the Minister that so far as housing is concerned and the amount of money that <Col N="799" /> is being spent on housing and in so far as building societies are concerned there is a very serious hold-up on money to people for whom it should be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I want to let the Minister know that there is at least one Deputy on this side of the House who feels aggrieved about this situation.  It can have serious consequences if it is allowed to develop.  I will leave it at that.  The position in relation to housing is not as happy as many would like to believe.</P>
      <P>I also want to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that we have, perhaps, the most expensive motoring in the world.  When will there be some relief from tax for the motorist?  The motorist must be very near the point of revolt.  The motor car has become a necessity of life.  A worker needs it to get to and from his work.  It is high time there was a complete review of motoring costs.  The cost of petrol is becoming prohibitive.</P>
      <P>I was rather disappointed that the Minister when preparing his Finance Bill and his budget did not view more seriously the alarming amount of money that is being spent on drink.  If people are prepared to spend all their leisure time in lounge bars and to spend lavishly, the Minister has a duty, if this is surplus money which they are spending and if there is no other way in which they can dispose of it, to see that Revenue get some of it.  Figures recently released show that there has been an extraordinary increase in the amount of spending on alcoholic drink in Ireland.  This has caused concern.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind that it would be better if widows and orphans, old age pensioners and the less well-to-do sections of the community who cannot afford to spend any of their time in such places, got a share of this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised the question of solicitors giving information to the Revenue Commissioners under <Col N="800" /> the provisions of this Bill.  I believe there must have been talks between the Department of Finance and the Incorporated Law Society.  If there have been, perhaps the Minister would indicate this to the House.  I think it would be extremely wrong of any solicitor, auctioneer, surveyor or engineer who has the confidence of his client to disclose to the Revenue Commissioners or to anybody else details of his transactions with his client.  I want to say, as an auctioneer, that if the Revenue Commissioners ever seek information from me professionally about any of my customers I will never reveal it.  I think it would be wrong and I hope that before these provisions which apparently are in operation in Britain and other European countries appear on our Statute Book there will be suitable talks with the Incorporated Law Society and, if other professions are to be involved, with the professional bodies involved.  It may be that certain guarantees may have to be given.  Some steps should be taken to ensure the continued privacy of the client and to reinforce the confidence between client and solicitor and whatever other professional interests may be involved.  If confidence is broken it may lead to a high degree of disrespect for the profession. A provision of this kind, however desirable, can also be dangerous.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Finance to arrange with the banking interests to take suitable action in regard to the rates of interest which they are charging to borrowers.  It is both unfair and unjust.  The Minister is well aware that under the existing banking system every bank loan creates a deposit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy.  This does not seem relevant to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree again but this is an opportunity of making it known to the Minister that there is uneasiness among existing and prospective taxpayers who are unable to meet the present rates of bank interest.  If he <Col N="801" /> cannot have that conveyed to the banks then he should come into this House with suitable legislation so that we may be able to do something to assist people who cannot assist themselves.</P>
      <P>There are many practical provisions in the Finance Bill.  Any criticism which I have offered has not been to create embarrassment for the Minister but to make it known that there is at the moment, particularly in rural Ireland, despair and depression and it is essential that Members of the Government be made aware of these facts.  This can be done by the expression of views by Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister every success and good luck.  Every Minister for Finance has an extremely difficult job to do.  It is not a pleasant one.  It is one in which one can find oneself in a fool's paradise.  One should always be eager to learn from politicians all over the country.  If Parliament is to function effectively and properly it is essential, that every Member, no matter what his party affiliations are, should rise to make known the feelings of his constituents.  I have done so in relation to the feelings of the farmers in my constituency, who have left me in no doubt whatever about the drastic reduction in their incomes. I have seen the records and I have consulted the agricultural advisers.  I know the circumstances in which the small farmers have worked over the past 18 months.  I want the Minister to bear this in mind as a guide for the coming 12 months which I hope will be more favourable for these people than the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little use in the Opposition pointing the finger across at the Government because they are equally responsible for the circumstances in which these people find themselves. I advise the politicians in the Opposition party not to play politics with regard to the plight of those people who are the victims of their work while they were in Government. Many of these people find that they cannot sell their young livestock because they carried out the advice <Col N="802" /> Fianna Fáil gave them.  They regret that today.</P>

In 32 years I have not seen the agricultural community in such a depressed state as <Col N="803" /> they are in today.  This calls for very serious action and the sooner it is taken either here or in Europe the better.  Those people have had a bad time during the past 12 months and their prospects for the coming year are not too good.  It calls for courage and organisation.  It may call for subsidies. It may call for the Minister for Finance to come to their aid.  One thing is certain.  Unless someone comes to their aid, their plight will not only be serious but very unfortunate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard Deputy Flanagan's very open condemnation of the Labour-Fine Gael Administration, I should like to say to the Minister for Finance that it would appear to me that this will probably be the last time he will have the pleasure of introducing a Finance Bill into this House.</P>
      <P>Much of what Deputy Flanagan said, particularly in relation to the agricultural industry, is very true. I should like to say, not for the record as Deputy Flanagan seems to say many things, but to him before he leaves, that if he is sincere in what he says he can table whatever amendments he feels should be tabled for Committee Stage.  If he feels as strongly as he would like us to believe he feels&mdash;and particularly if at a later stage, we are referred back to the record&mdash;that something should be done and must be done now to prevent, in his own words, the double and treble taxation of the farming community, I respectfully suggest that he should do something positive about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He warned us that none of us should play politics with this situation.  If anybody knows how to play politics with any situation, I would give full marks to Deputy Flanagan because, having spent 32 years here, as he said, I have no doubt whatsoever that, when it comes to us all being out of step except the one Johnny, Deputy Flanagan, from what he said here today, is trying to have 1/- each way.  He has accused his <Col N="804" /> Minister&mdash;not that I accept the accusation&mdash;of being in a fool's paradise.  I do not altogether go along with that accusation. I would change it somewhat and say that the Minister is not in a fool's paradise but in a paradise of fools in relation to what is happening throughout the country at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan is on record here this evening as saying that he has a great fear that the Government have not got their ear to the ground.  Deputy Flanagan can rest assured that his fear is more than just a fear.  It is a positive fact that the Government have not got their ear to the ground.  His condemnation of his Government, composed of Labour and Fine Gael, is a welcome sign that, for some reason or another, Deputy Flanagan sees the writing on the wall and wants to be prepared for the time when the Taoiseach will take that little trip to Aras an Uachtaráin and throw in the towel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

      <P>That is what the Deputy would like but that will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>He will then say: &ldquo;I was right.  I advised my own that they were wrong.  I spoke on behalf of the people of my constituency and I warned those fellows up there that A, B, C, D.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What he said about the housing crisis is in direct conflict with what was said here this afternoon by the Labour Minister for Local Government.  That Minister boldly said here this afternoon that this crisis does not exist.  To help my friend and colleague, Deputy Callanan let me refer to the gentleman to whom Deputy Flanagan attributed the new taxation system on certain members of our farming community, Mr. Hafarkamp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose Deputy Flanagan would like us to believe that it was this gentleman and nobody else who forced the Minister to introduce tax on farmers. It is not as simple as all that, I can assure Deputy Callanan, because the people who put the pressure on the Minister to do what he did are the people who should be sitting in that centre bench.  These are the people Deputy Flanagan is trying for some reason or another to keep from taking <Col N="805" /> their share of the blame by saying that this Mr. Hafarkamp, who visited this country on 19th September last, was the man who proposed what Deputy Flanagan is sorry is now involved in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me that there was little or no consultation even within the Fine Gael Party as to what would be in this Bill.  It was not explained to them at party level. If the Minister did not do that at his own party level, it would be difficult to expect that he did it for the Labour Party.  I gather, as a matter of passing interest, that party meetings either of Fine Gael as a party or Labour as a party or, more important still, as a joint party since they formed the Coalition Government, are becoming a rarity and I gather that they will be no longer happening in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no desire to go beyond the terms of reference of this Bill but, having listened to Deputy Flanagan over the past hour or so trying to have 1/- each way, and trying to sit on a political fence, so that whatever way the ball might hop he might jump and say: &ldquo;Did I not tell you that this would happen?  Did I not urge that something should be done about it?&rdquo;  I was tempted to comment for a few minutes on some of the things he said.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that, in my contribution to this Bill, I would deal mainly with it as it affects the farming community. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>This Bill is the instrument by which the Government hope to achieve one of the main aims of this year's budget, namely tax reform, with the object of ensuring greater equity in the distribution and sharing of the tax burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the Minister's words.  Unfortunately, he has failed miserably to achieve what he hoped he might achieve.  It will be considered, particularly by the farming community, that this effort by the Minister for Finance in the Labour-Fine Gael <Col N="806" /> Government is another failure.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>In the interests of fair play the Bill contains a number of significant provisions to counteract tax-avoidance and evasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about fair play. If he is to be taken as seriously as his party colleague who spoke before me, I would not mind what appears in this document, but the Minister for Finance in our country is meant to be a responsible person.  If he feels that what he purports to do in this Bill is to be regarded as fair play, on this score as well the Minister has failed.  He said:</P>
    <P>There will be one law for all, not one for the rich and another for the poor.</P>
    <P>As I proceed during my contribution to this debate, which I hope will not be long, I will prove conclusively that what the Minister said about one law for all is something which he has failed, and failed miserably, to achieve.  For the first time in the history of the State farmers are coming into the income tax net.  It is understandable that as a result of this operation, it being the first time, many complex problems will arise and many difficulties will have to be faced up to if they are to be accommodated within the tax net in an equitable way.  The Minister says that while perfection cannot be achieved in one move, that is no reason why we should not make an effort to make some advance in the right direction. He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The Bill is not a panacea for all taxation imperfections but it is a real and significant step on the road to an equitable, acceptable and reformed code of taxation.</P>
    <P>These are grandiose sentences.  They read very well on the records of the House and sound well when spoken in the House.  They read well in our national newspapers, but let us be honest with one another.  If the Minister wants us to believe that he will achieve what he sets out to achieve, to believe it is a real and significant step on the road to an equitable, acceptable and reformed <Col N="807" /> code of taxation, then I would like to tell him, as did his party colleague, Deputy Oliver Flanagan, that he has failed miserably.</P>
    <P>The Labour-Fine Gael Government have been in office for the last 15 months or so, and there has been a great deal of talk about open government, government by consultation: &ldquo;We, the members of the Government, are always available to meet the people.  We are there to discuss their problems with their representatives.&rdquo; The Minister says in page 4 of his brief:</P>
    <P>I promised that full cognisance would be taken of the particular problems of farmers who were now being brought into income taxation for the first time...</P>
    <P>Further down in the same page he says:</P>
    <P>Since my budget statement, very useful consultations have been held with the National Economic and Social Council and with representative farming organisations regarding the considerations to be borne in mind in the taxation of farm profits.</P>
    <P>It is only natural that consultations would take place.  I commend the Minister for it and if what he has produced here today in the form of the Finance Bill before us were a product of consultations with the interested people, the farm organisations, then I would be pleased.  But the Minister knows and the farming organisations know, and, far more important than the farmers and the farming organisations or the Minister, the people of the country know full well the limit of the consultations that have taken place.  In the front of today's papers there is one article that says: &ldquo;Why Ryan did not meet the farm bodies&rdquo;.  Then there is another report: &ldquo;The Irish Farmers' Association are very upset that Mr. Ryan is not available to meet them&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would sit down and if the debate could be wound up, I could meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Ryan, was not unavailable to <Col N="808" /> meet the farming organisations prior to the Presidential election in May of last year, and I understand that since then the Minister has met the farming organisations once or twice. I believe, even this week, but only at the insistence of the Taoiseach, the Minister made himself available to meet the farming organisations to discuss the many problems they have as a result of what the Minister has unwisely provided in this Finance Bill in regard to the imposition of income tax on the farmers.</P>
      <P>If we are to have government by consultation, then let us have it.  I suppose I should say, in fairness to the Minister, we realise he is a very busy person.  There are many calls on his time because of the office he holds, but in a matter of such great importance he should make time; he should avail of the opportunity being given to him to meet these people.  If he were to do that, there would not be such headlines as are in today's newspapers where militant action is being hinted at by the farming organisations: &ldquo;unless Mr. Ryan is pre pared to drop certain sections of the Finance Bill&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is an implication carried by all the newspapers today that the farm organisations are angry with the Minister; indeed, that they are more than angry with the Minister, and that they would hope to do business with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Clinton, instead. They would hope that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would be in a strong enough position to talk farming sense to the Minister for Finance and point out to him the error of his ways, and that if he persists with the proposals in this Bill it will lead to many problems for himself and his government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that the amount of background work that was put into this Bill was inadequate.  If proper research and study of the situation as it now is were done by the Minister and his officials, then they would realise that, in the words of Deputy Flanagan, his own party colleague, some people are being doubly and trebly taxed for the first time.  I would agree wholeheartedly <Col N="809" /> with Deputy Flanagan that throughout the agricultural industry there is a feeling of grave anxiety, deep depression and gloom.  It is no secret that the beef industry is tottering on the verge of disaster and not, as Deputy Flanagan might want us to think, because of our entry into Europe but, to my mind and to the minds of many people throughout the country, because of the poor quality people who are working in Europe on our behalf, namely, the members of the Labour-Fine Gael Government. It is known at large that we are not powerful enough or determined enough at the European Ministers' table to get what we are entitled to get, what is laid down in the Treaty of Rome, that is, preference for our markets.  We are guaranteed preference for our markets.  We are not getting it, and no satisfactory explanation has been forthcoming from the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or the Government as a body.</P>
    <P>Let us look now at the tillage farmer. He, too, has clearly demonstrated that he has no confidence in the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and, in proof of his lack of confidence, he has completely ignored the recommendations and advice of the Minister that more tillage should be cultivated this year.  It is a fact that there is a 20 per cent decrease in tillage and that shows the lack of credibility in tillage farmers where the Minister is concerned.</P>

      <P>So I would think and I would not have entered into this area but for the fact that Deputy O.J. Flanagan had a field day, if I may use that expression, in this area. The pigs and poultry side of agriculture have suffered disastrously because of certain actions&mdash;perhaps inaction&mdash; on the part of the Government.  Anyone who knows anything about the dairy industry knows only too well that one of the most profitable spin-offs in that particular sector is the income derived from calves.  This year <Col N="810" /> one could buy for £5 a calf that would have cost £80 12 months ago.  I am trying to help Deputy O.J. Flanagan to get the ear of his Minister so that the Minister may be made aware of the fact that there is this deep gloom in the agricultural sector.  Unlike Deputy O.J. Flanagan, we know why it exists.  It exists because of Government action and inaction, because of what they did in some areas and failed to do in other areas.</P>
      <P>There is grave disquiet within farming organisations because of the provisions in this Bill.  This is not a time at which to engender further disquiet on the agricultural front.  The confidence of those in the industry has been sadly shattered in the last 12 months and it is doubtful if they can take much more without very, very significant consequences.  That is why I urge the Minister to meet the farming organisations immediately.  I hope this meeting will take place promptly so that, on Committee Stage, certain major changes can be made in this proposed legislation.  If these changes are not made chaos is inevitable. Nobody disagrees with the wealthier farmers contributing their fair share to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I would have heard about it if the Minister had been there.  I know what is happening in my area better than the Minister knows what is happening in his.  I would like the Minister to keep a constant examination going as to the <Col N="811" /> methods by which he hopes to bring the wealthier farmers into the tax net.  There are many difficulties.  I quite understand it is not easy to develop a system in a short time, certainly not in the short time the Minister is trying to put his systems into operation in order to catch certain sectors of the farming community in the tax net.  Are we satisfied that the valuation system is the fairest system or the best system?  There are many who believe that it is not the fairest and not the best.  I know land in Limerick valued at £1 per acre and I know land as good, if not better, valued as low as 10p, 15p and 20p an acre.  I do not believe the PLV system is the fairest.  If taxation is to be collected, then let it be collected in the fairest way possible.  The Minister said he wants one law for all. With all the expertise he has available to him I sincerely hope he will not now sit back and say we have the fairest system, the money is coming in, and leave it at that.  That would be quite wrong.  The Minister should put down an amendment on Committee Stage allowing farmers to write off loans against income tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  As I said, the Minister can twist his words to suit the occasion.  My colleague from Limerick pointed out how the Minister changes to suit the occasion. Like all good legal men, I suppose the Minister cannot admit he was wrong and did say something.  I doubt if the Minister really wants to do something which will be inevitable if this Bill goes through in its present form, namely, wipe out farmhouse holidays.  I am sure it is not necessary for me to go into detail about the campaign which was launched by Bord Fáilte a number of years ago urging many of our farming housewives to get involved in this industry <Col N="812" /> for obvious reasons&mdash;to supplement their incomes and provide a service for our tourist industry.  This industry is in danger as a result of the Minister's proposals in this Bill.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister must bring in an amendment to provide that rates on agricultural land will be written off against farmers' income tax payments if we are to have fair play all round.  If he does not bring in a number of amendments I hope he will accept them when we put them down.  The figure of £20 PLV for exemption of tax free allowances is too small.  A figure of £30 or £40 would be more reasonable and acceptable.  Section 22 provides 10 per cent allowance for the maintenance of farm buildings.  This too is very small.  Perhaps the Minister might be good enough to have another look at these figures.</P>
      <P>If he feels that in further crucifying the small farmer, the man who must get another job to supplement his income in order to keep his wife and family, he is being fair and having one law for all, that shows how right Deputy Flanagan was when he said that the Minister had not got his ear to the ground and was living in a fool's paradise.  If this Bill goes through without amendment the part-time farmer will have his tax allowance halved if his valuation exceeds £20.  If this is the Minister's interpretation of fair play, it is not mine.</P>
      <P>Sections 16 and 21 appear to discriminate against the farmer who has another trade compared with one who is a director of a company.  In the first case he may be earning only £100 a year but he still must pay tax if his valuation is over £50 and he cannot use the notional basis of assessment. On the other hand, the director could hold up to 25 per cent of the shares of a large company and still benefit from the £100 limit and the notional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respectfully suggest that an amendment should be proposed which would allow farmers to benefit from those concessions, provided they did not earn more than 50 per cent of their total income from an outside <Col N="813" /> source.  Unless there is a change in that section, the farm holiday industry, which the Minister and his colleagues must never have enjoyed, will be badly damaged.  If a farmer's wife takes on a part time job it is unfair that her husband should lose the concession to use the notional tax basis. Farmers who are not allowed use the notional tax basis for this or any other reason will be in the same position as the ordinary businessman and should receive some allowance because a large proportion of their output is exported.</P>
    <P>The most serious omission in the Bill is that rates on agricultural land cannot be offset completely against a farmer's tax bill.  It is not enough to allow rates as an expense since they form such a large part of a farmer's costs.  Many people are hoping that, even at this late stage and after proper consultations, the Minister will have a change of mind in this respect. I made my suggestions in good faith and every one of them is important.</P>
    <P>The Minister may rest assured that the industry about which I have been talking is in serious difficulty on all fronts.  He should not do anything which would aggravate these problems further.  He should meet these people, talk to them and be reasonable. I hope he will not think it remiss of me when I say that I sincerely hope for the sake of our major industry, agriculture, on which many of us are so dependent, that he will be far more reasonable with their representatives than he was with Members of this House when he first brought legislation before us shortly after he became Minister for Finance.  Let him be man enough to find the time to meet these people, hear their practical difficulties and do something about them rather than undermine the confidence of the farming industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The protracted delay in the production of the Finance Bill this year has very serious implications. It seems to me to be quite inexplicable. The budget was introduced reasonably early and, accordingly, we could have expected that the <Col N="814" /> Finance Bill would come before us long before now.  We could also have expected that we would have plenty of time to discuss it in detail before the summer Recess.  In my view such a discussion would have been eminently desirable.</P>
      <P>In any year the Finance Bill, from the economic and social point of view, is by far the most important piece of legislation to come before the House.  It affects in a vital way, individuals, companies and organisations. It influences the entire economic climate.  The taxation of the private citizen is one of the fundamentals of Government.  We, as a Legislature, have a solemn duty to carry out a detailed and critical examination of every taxation measure which comes before us.  We are the watchdogs of the private citizen in this regard.  It might seem unnecessary to have to say that but I think it is no harm to remind ourselves from time to time of our duty in this regard.  We should keep before our minds what that duty is.  If we are to be a real Legislature, taxation is one area in which we must never neglect to carry out scrupulously and diligently our full parliamentary functions.</P>
      <P>The tax gathering machine, as it exists in this and other countries, can be cold and ruthless.  It is often very harsh in its operation where the private citizen is concerned.  All of us have had experience of that.  Once a piece of tax legislation leaves this House it grinds on inexorably under its own momentum.  There is no scope in its operation for any concession on humanitarian grounds, no flexible interpretation is possible.  We have seen measures that were brought in here with liberal intentions but in their detailed application turn into something completely different.  Therefore, we have a solemn duty as a Legislature before a taxation measure leaves the House to try to foresee any problems or difficulties that might arise, and any hardships or injustices it might cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is particularly so this year when a major change is being made in the taxation structure of the community <Col N="815" /> as a whole.  The largest single sector of our community are this year having imposed on them income taxation for the first time.  It is in this year, above any other year, that we should be particularly vigilant in what we are passing and in the powers we are giving to the Minister and, through him, to the Revenue Commissioners.  I have always had a personal belief that income tax is not a suitable vehicle for taxing farming as a vocation.  I think the way things have gone during last winter and in the spring of this year proves I am right in that regard. I was glad to hear our spokesman on Agriculture speak of the contribution farmers should make to the community. That is the way we should be thinking about this matter.</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts that the farming community, as any other section, should make a contribution to the common good through the common exchequer, but it is the way in which that contribution is made that is open for debate and discussion.  To assess farming profits is a complicated and difficult matter.  It is difficult from the technical point of view apart altogether from the social considerations that are involved.</P>
    <P>During my contribution to this debate I shall mention some aspects of what the Minister proposes that, at first glance, appear to me to give rise to difficulties.  If these difficulties can be seen at first glance, who knows what hardships and injustices may, and will, arise when these proposals are implemented.</P>
    <P>This Bill needs careful study, particularly that section dealing with the farming community.  A number of amendments will be needed but I do not think that in the time which the Government are allowing for this Bill it will get the scrupulous detailed examination and careful amendment it should get and which the farming community are entitled to expect.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why the Bill was delayed for so long.  When we had an early budget, why did we not have the Finance Bill in plenty of time to have the kind of full discussion about <Col N="816" /> which I have been speaking?  Was the delay political?  Was the Minister simply not getting on with his work, or was he having political difficulties with his Government colleagues or his party?  There is another possibility that I hope is not true, namely, that the Revenue Commissioners are not able to cope with everything they are being asked to undertake at this time.</P>
    <P>On several occasions I have made known my admiration for the Revenue Commissioners as an organisation and as an institution.  It is a heavy responsibility on any Minister or Government to make sure that this very fine organisation is preserved intact and maintained at the highest possible level of efficiency.  The Minister has asked them in a very short space of time to do an enormous amount.  He has asked them to produce White Papers and then to produce alterations to the White Papers.  It is perfectly obvious also that they must have an enormous workload arising out of our membership of the EEC.  If that is the reason for the delay in producing the Finance Bill, the Minister should tell us.  He owes us some explanation and I hope he will give it in his reply.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the unsatisfactory timetable which faces us in connection with this Bill, I want to question whether we must pass this legislation before the summer recess.  The House will recall that there were no resolutions of the normal type in this year's budget.  I will leave aside for a moment the fact that I believe there should have been a resolution dealing with the imposition of taxation on farmers.  The Minister, with considerable cunning, avoided bringing in that resolution so as not to have a discussion on the subject before the local elections.  I have already made that point and I will not deal with it agian. That resolution was not put before the House and there were none of the usual budgetary resolutions.</P>
    <P>Standing Order No. 120 states:</P>
    <P>On the completion by the Dáil of the consideration of any Resolution, or series of Resolutions, voting money for public services, or imposing <Col N="817" /> taxation, a Bill shall be prepared and introduced by the member of the Government in charge of the Department of Finance, or another member of the Government acting on his behalf.</P>
    <P>Arising out of that, we have always had a situation where the Finance Bill had to be passed before 6th August in accordance with section 4 of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act.  In other words, these resolutions had to be enshrined in legislation within four months.  As I see it, that situation does not apply this year.  I suggest to the Minister that technically there is no reason why a full discussion on this legislation could not be left over until after the summer Recess if we are&mdash;as we appear to be &mdash;very pressed for time between now and the time the House rises.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill before us has four principal parts.  There is the first part incorporated in Chapter I which substitutes the new rates of tax for income tax and surtax.  There is the section which deals with the taxation of farming profits.  There is the section which deals with the anti-evasion and anti-avoidance measures and finally there is the part which deals with the restriction of relief in respect of interest.</P>
    <P>The first part of the Bill, the part included in Chapter I, lays down the new system of income taxation, the new rates, for future years.  The Minister has placed this before us as something to be welcomed, as a great reform; something which represents a simplification of the taxation code.  I think that that is complete nonsense. I do not think the Minister should be going through this futile exercise of congratulating himself on simplifying our taxation structure.  I think the evidence is there that, far from simplifying it in the short time in which he has been in office, he has complicated it to as great a degree as did any of his predecessors.  If I may mention just one point, the Income Tax Act of 1967 codified the income tax law.  It did a magnificent job in bringing all the law in regard to income tax together into one composite statute.  To some extent, that was a <Col N="818" /> step towards simplification of our income tax law, as a body of law, by putting it all together in one composite statute.  But, in this Bill before us, the Minister has a sheaf of pages repealing enactments and amending the 1967 Act.  Therefore it seems to me that, once this Finance Bill becomes law, the 1967 Income Tax Act, as a piece of codification, will be relatively useless.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in this Bill, the Minister is introducing a restriction on relief in respect of interest and to this effect is introducing a whole series of new, complicated provisions.  I think it is foolish of him to go on with this pretence that he is simplifying our taxation code.  I am not sure either that, if he were wise, he would lay too much stress on the desirability of simplifying the taxation structure because the fairer a taxation system is the more complicated it has to be and, if one wants to have a really just and fair system, it has to be very sophisticated and, therefore, necessarily very complex.  Any time one wants to make exclusions or special provisions, one complicates the structure and, if there are special cases that have to be met, one complicates it further still.  Therefore, a sophisticated, fair system of taxation is necessarily complicated.</P>
    <P>In these days of computers&mdash;and the Revenue Commissioners have been very progressive in their adaptation to the computer world&mdash;I do not think the Minister should sacrifice the refinements which fair play and justice demand in a taxation structure for simplicity.  In fact, I suppose, the ultimate in fairness in a taxation system would be a separate and distinct assessment for every individual in the community.  Perhaps some day computers will make that possible.  In fact, I understand that there is a relatively recent concept of negative taxation which, in effect, means that every citizen has a running account with the State.  All his debits are totted up; all the credits due to him are likewise totted up and he either receives the difference from the State or pays it into the Exchequer.  I suppose <Col N="819" /> that is a very sophisticated and advanced concept.  Certainly it is going completely in the opposite direction from which the Minister, in theory at least, is endeavouring to go.</P>
    <P>If this new, unified rate of tax which the Minister has brought in has no other virtue than the one the Minister is claiming for it, namely, that it is simpler than the one he is discarding, then that is not sufficient reason for bringing it in.  His primary consideration should be fairness, equity and the gearing of the taxation burden exactly to the individual's capacity to pay.  I do not think what he is bringing in here, in Chapter I, is an improvement in that regard and some of my colleagues have already pointed out various ways in which this attempted simplification by the Minister in fact will lead to discrepancies and injustices of one type or another.</P>
    <P>Whatever about that aspect of these new rates, the one important thing about them is that they go to a very high level indeed.  If the Minister's ideas&mdash;as put forward in this Bill&mdash;are implemented, so far as personal income is concerned, we are going to be one of the very highly taxed countries of the world.  I believe that is fundamentally wrong in our circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a direct relationship between excessively high rates of taxation in any area and evasion: if customs duties are too high there is smuggling; if income tax rates are too high there are all sorts <Col N="820" /> of devices to evade them.  For a country in our circumstances I believe the tax rates on personal incomes are much too high.  I should like to make this point&mdash;I was about to make it anyway&mdash;on the Minister's interjection.  We now have VAT bringing in vastly increased revenues to our Exchequer, revenues from a totally new source, revenues which are on a scale that some years ago we never even visualised.  I would say that a decade ago if a Minister for Finance in this country had visualised automatic monthly revenues of the order which VAT is bringing in today he could easily have contemplated abolishing taxation on personal incomes altogether.</P>
      <P>We now have this new form of indirect taxation, VAT, bringing in greatly expanded resources regularly to the Exchequer, but at the same time we are to have these very high rates of personal taxation.  I believe that there is something wrong with that equation.  If ten years ago a Minister for Finance could have visualised revenue on this scale from an indirect source&mdash;many Deputies will recall the trauma there was when we were bringing in the turnover tax &mdash;he could certainly have contemplated abolishing personal income tax and even surtax.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this.  The Minister interjected about broadening the base.  It is quite clear that it is only a matter of time until the natural resources which up to recently we did not suspect we had but which now, fortunately, have been discovered, will provide a considerably increased new source of revenue.  Does the Minister think at this stage, with the produce of VAT readily available to him, with the prospect of vastly increased revenues coming in in some shape or form&mdash; whether through taxation or in royalties&mdash;from our mineral and other natural resources, that this is the time to be pushing through these new Draconian personal taxation measures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should the Minister not be looking now, in the light of this situation, to a very considerable reduction in <Col N="821" /> taxation on personal incomes as a direct incentive to the development of the economy?  I think the Minister's whole approach in this area of taxation is wrong.  We are still a developing country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And we need money to develop.  The demand on the State is growing as fast as the revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We made steady progress in the past couple of decades but we still have a long way to go. Those of us who took an interest in the proposed European regional policy became very acutely and directly aware of the fact that by European standards we have a long way to go. <i>En passant</i> I might mention that it was very interesting for us to discover that what we always regarded as our rich neighbour, Great Britain, had herself in many respects a long way to go to come up to European standards also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that sort of situation we should be encouraging enterprise and initiative, whether in farming, business, tourism, or whichever area of economic activity is involved.  We should be trying to give incentives, to encourage enterprise.  But in the provisions in this Bill and in his package of capital taxation, the Minister is going in the opposite direction.  In regard to personal taxation, I do not think the Minister is aware of or understands the modern technological world in which we are living.  The people whom we need and whom we were getting in considerable numbers, people who have knowledge and expertise, in this modern world are free to go anywhere they like.  They tend to move where taxation climates are favourable.  They are very mobile people.  I think our taxation structures should be devoted to creating a climate here which would attract these people and encourage them to stay here.  An attractive taxation structure is one of the elements involved in attracting and harnessing the initiative and the enterprise that <Col N="822" /> a developing nation like ours needs. I do not think any one taxation measure is all that important in this respect.  It is the climate, the approach, and it is in this respect that I think the Minister's philosophy is wrong and the rates of taxation on personal incomes enshrined in this Bill are wrong.</P>
    <P>I keep repeating the fundamental axiom that it is only by economic development we can get the social progress that we want and need. Those who go around preaching about social progress and social development without adverting to the fact that you can only get the resources to provide that social progress from economic development are simply putting the cart before the horse.</P>
    <P>The next important section of the Bill is that devoted to anti-avoidance and evasion measures.  Nobody will quarrel with this in principle.  This game goes on from year to year. Deputies who have been in the House for any length of time fully understand the process by now.  Those who devote their minds to these matters develop new ways, new systems of either avoiding or evading tax and it is the duty of the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners to keep a watchful eye on these developments and if they expand to any considerable extent to take action in the interests of fair play.  But it is always a question of judgement and I want to advert to some statements the Minister made in this connection recently when he implied or inferred that some Fianna Fáil Ministers had not been as assiduous in taking measures to oppose evasion or avoidance as they should have been.  That is not so. From time to time the question arises as to whether action should be taken in regard to a particular device or system that has developed.  A decision must be taken as to whether the evasion or avoidance is on a sufficient scale or whether the practice is growing sufficiently to merit all that is involved in the provision of countervailing measures.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to this aspect of the matter as it is very relevant to this Bill and particularly to <Col N="823" /> section 57.  In my view the Minister for Finance in the first instance, and this House in the second, have a very important custodial part to play in this regard.  The Department of Finance, perhaps, to some extent, but more often the Revenue Commissioners in pursuing their bounden duty seek powers to deal with certain situations which come to their notice and it is here that political judgment must come into play.  The Minister is the first line of defence and this House the second line of defence in ensuring that the taxation authorities in wishing to do their job properly and comprehensively do not get excessive powers.  It is perfectly legitimate for them to seek these powers, to put forward the case, but it is our job to ensure that the powers they get do not represent an unwarranted intrusion on the rights of the private citizens.</P>
    <P>I have seen in my time in this House a number of occasions when this issue has been fought out and when the Revenue Commissioners have been refused powers which they sought because in the opinion of the Minister, or the Government or the House, the powers they were seeking were excessive and could not be justified by the extent or the seriousness of the evasion or avoidance taking place.  If the Minister believes that the measures he has put before us in regard to tax havens abroad are necessary, then he has the full support of every Deputy in taking whatever measures are legitimate to deal with that situation.  None of us likes to think that somebody else, because he is cleverer or has access to better professional expertise than we have can, by using foreign tax havens, avoid paying those taxes the rest of us have to pay.  We support the Minister in the measures he wishes to take in this regard with the exception of section 57.  I fully support Deputy O'Malley in this connection.  I would go further than Deputy O'Malley went in his criticism of this particular provision.  It seems to be a clear case where the Minister is affording to the tax-gathering machine powers far in <Col N="824" /> excess of what it is entitled to or really needs.  Deputy O'Malley dealt very logically and succinctly with the situation of the solicitor.  I strongly urge the Minister to drop that provision in regard to solicitors.</P>

It is a codification measure which, as the Minister knows, goes through a certain process in this House and is not the responsibility of the Minister for Finance of the day.

      <P>The Minister attributed it to me as a proposal.  He said I brought it in and I am quite certain that I did not because one of the things about which I was always anxious as a Minister for Finance was to try to keep a careful balance between the needs of the situation as seen by the Revenue Commissioners and the rights of the private citizen and the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about that, the Minister is now putting section 57 before us and I wish, as part of my duty as a Member of this House, to draw his attention to certain aspects of it, to ask him to reconsider it and to consider carefully whether these powers are really necessary to combat the tax evasion about which he is worried.  On reflection, the Minister might consider abandoning the bulk, if not all, of section 57.  In his discussion across the House with Deputy O'Malley the Minister did not seem to think there was anything particularly wrong in asking a solicitor to disclose information about his clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall draw an analogy for the Minister in this regard.  He said that a solicitor should not be used as a vehicle whereby a taxpayer could avoid paying taxation for which he was responsible.  If, however, a person commits a crime and goes to his solicitor asking that the solicitor take up the case, if the Minister is right in his approach in this instance there would be nothing to prevent the Minister for Justice bringing in legislation that would compel the solicitor to go to the Garda and disclose that <Col N="826" /> his client had committed a crime.  The Minister is dealing here with something that is fundamental to our whole system of law and jurisprudence which recognises the privilege that extends to the relationship between a solicitor and his client.  For the sake of this one piece of tax evasion it is not worth even tinkering with the confidential relationship between solicitor and client.  If the Minister considers this situation from a broader point of view, I think he will agree with me.  If we should tamper, even for this limited purpose, with the confidential relationship between solicitor and client we would be starting something that could be very injurious in the long run in other situations.</P>
    <P>At this stage I do not wish to go into the details of the section except to say that it is cast very widely.  We can deal with that in detail on Committee Stage but I would draw the Minister's attention now to some of the wording.  For example, subsection (1)  of section 57 states that the Revenue Commissioners</P>
    <P>.... may by notice in writing require any person to furnish them within such time as they may direct (not being less than twenty-eight days) with such particulars as they think necessary for the purposes of sections 55, 56 and 58.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of that section reads:</P>
    <P>The particulars which a person must furnish under this section, if he is required by such a notice so to do, include particulars...</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention in particular to the word &ldquo;include&rdquo; there It seems to me that in this regard the Revenue Commissioners can direct the taxpayer involved to give them any sort of information about anything, provided it is related to the sections in question.  We shall have an opportunity of dealing in a more substantial and detailed way with the section on Committee Stage but I would urge the Minister to have another look at the section to see whether the game is worth the candle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> Another aspect of this matter that I wish to put to the Minister is the question of whether at this stage, in view of the proposed enactment of the anti-avoidance provisions set out in Chapter IV, there will be a need for Chapter III.  I have a particular reason for this suggestion because these interest rate restriction provisions are causing a great deal of concern and disquiet.  It seems to me that they were introduced to meet a very short-term situation.  During last year there was a sudden spate of company financial manipulations.  There were all sorts of take-overs, amalgamations and flotations.  People were borrowing either to speculate on the Stock Exchange or to finance these sort of transactions.  However, the Minister must know that circumstances have changed radically since then and that most of the paper profits that were made then have disappeared. We are now reaching a situation where we will have to try to persuade people to go back into the Stock Exchange.  Many of these people have taken such a beating that it will be a long time before they can be persuaded to invest in anything ever again.  The much publicised and spectacular-type profits which seemed to be made at that time by different groups and organisations have largely disappeared since.  Therefore, our problem in the future will be to persuade people to invest in stocks and shares for genuine development purposes.</P>
    <P>The change which has come about in the market and on the Stock Exchange leads me to believe that the sort of situation with which the Minister was endeavouring to deal by way of these proposed interest rate restriction provisions no longer exists.  It seems to me that his tax haven provisions deal with the other type of situation, namely, the situation whereby people were borrowing money here and placing it abroad in tax havens while using the interest on the money borrowed here to offset income arising in this country.  That situation will be dealt with now by the Minister's proposals in Chapter IV. <Col N="828" /> So, I am putting forward for consideration whether or not it is still necessary for the Minister to proceed with these restrictions of relief in respect of interest provisions, because the reason for them seems to have largely disappeared and they are undoubtedly causing very considerable concern and disquiet among the business and the commercial community.  The Minister has already introduced some easing of his original proposals and I think he might in view of what I have said consider whether the whole of Chapter III might be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>Many of my colleagues on this side of the House have spoken about the difficult situation in which the farming community finds itself at the present time and we should all admit this as a fact of life.  Farmers have incurred very severe losses, indeed, and the whole atmosphere in the farming community is one of doubt and uncertainty. The Minister should seriously consider whether at this time and in these circumstances he should proceed at all with his proposals to tax farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy George Colley yesterday made the suggestion that these particular proposals should be postponed and I would very strongly support that suggestion.  If the Minister were at this stage to say: &ldquo;I will delete Chapter II entirely from this year's Finance Bill and I will just put it in cold storage until I am preparing next year's Finance Bill&rdquo;, his decision would have a tremendous effect on the farming community.  At the moment their confidence is shattered.  They geared themselves for expansion; they incurred very considerable capital expenditure; they borrowed heavily and suddenly their markets have collapsed in every direction.  Psychologically, this is the worst possible time for the Minister to be coming along with this new proposal of his to bring them into the income tax net.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting thing about the approach in this Finance Bill in regard to the taxing of farmers and it is something which reinforces me in my belief that a decision has been taken that all farmers are going to be brought by this Government inside the <Col N="829" /> provisions of the income tax code and that this is only a start.  The proposal is being put across in this way for political reasons to begin with but it is only the first step.  What persuades me that that is so is the approach in this Finance Bill.  The approach is comprehensive. All farming activities are brought in and then various exclusions are made by the different sections.  The approach is a comprehensive one and all farming profits are being made liable to tax in an overall comprehensive way and then by particular provisions various exclusions, as I have said, are made.  It seems to me that approach sets the scene for ultimately widening the net to cover the entire farming community.  The way the Bill is framed and the way the provisions are put forward, if farmers ever again have a few prosperous years and if it seems a popular thing to do it would be quite a simple matter just to wipe out the exclusions and make every farmer in the country liable.</P>
    <P>As I think Deputy O'Malley pointed out the £100 valuation limit has already been breached by the very unjust and iniquitous provision in regard to liability if a husband, wife or a partner engage in other business activity.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of these proposals in regard to the taxation of farmers on which I would like to comment but I propose to make these comments in much greater detail on Committee Stage.  There are however, some aspects which I would like to mention even at this stage on the broader aspects of the provisions.</P>
    <P>First of all, there is, as has already been adverted to, and the Minister should clear it up immediately&mdash;the discrepancy which exists between the explanatory memorandum and the terms of the Finance Bill itself on this question of the notional basis of assessment. The explanatory memorandum would lead one to believe that the provision in regard to the notional income equivalent to forty times the poor law valuation is something which will prevail as a permanent feature of this new system, but the wording of the Finance Bill itself is quite specific, quite clear and quite definite that this provision only applies for the year 1974-75.  This <Col N="830" /> is a matter of such fundamental importance that the Minister should deal with it and let us know at once what exactly is the position.  Is the provision only as it appears in the Bill itself or is what appears to be the implication of the explanatory memorandum correct?</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this question is the option which the Bill provides for farmers.  For 1974-75 they will in the normal course of events be taxed on their profits for the previous year, that is, 1973-74 but they may, if they wish, opt to be taxed on their actual profits for 1974-75.  But, if they wish to exercise that option, as I read the Bill, they must give notice within six months.  In other words, they must give notice by October of this year.  I suggest that that is much too soon. The Minister knows enough about farming to know that the outcome of a farmer's operations for 1974-75 will not be known to him with any sort of certainty until well after October of this year.  That is something which the Minister should consider seriously.</P>
    <P>Also, on this whole question of treatment of losses, the farming community are being set aside and treated in a way which is completely different from other taxpayers.  The Bill provides that a farmer has the option to be taxed on his figures for 1973-74 or 1974-75 in regard to the year 1974-75 but what about losses which have been incurred in previous years?  Farming being the unpredictable sort of vocation it is, it is quite possible that many farmers have had, for one reason or another, serious losses in 1971-72 and 1972-73, and surely if they can establish these losses, they should be able to carry them forward until such time as they are used up, as any other business can do.</P>
    <P>The same principle, I think, should be accepted in the case of capital allowances.  The Bill provides differently for capital expenditure on buildings and capital expenditure on machinery.  In effect, a farmer who will now be brought within the tax net will in regard to any particular piece of machinery bought before April 1974, be treated reasonably <Col N="831" /> fairly because the written-down value as at April, 1974, of that particular piece of machinery will be taken into account for capital allowance purposes but that does not apply to expenditure on buildings.  There is a serious question involved here because in the years immediately preceding April, 1974, farmers did incur considerable capital expenditure on buildings.  The Minister proposes that in so far as there is any expenditure after April, 1974, that expenditure will be allowed over a ten-year period. I will come back to that in a moment because I think the ten years is inadequate but it is grossly unfair that farmers who have incurred expenditure on buildings in 1971, '72-'73 in preparation for the Common Market, because they were encouraged to do so, will not be allowed to charge any of that capital expenditure against their profits from 1974 onwards.  That is something which certainly should be revised.  I should also like to ask the Minister to look again at the provision to allow the expenditure to be written off over a ten-year period.  In the case of some farm buildings, that ten-year period might be quite adequate but in the case of other buildings, it might be far too long.  I think a much shorter period on average would be fairer and much more appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister also makes provision whereby the cost of farm machinery can be written off over a period and here, unlike the farm buildings, he is allowing expenditure incurred before April, 1974 to come in for the purposes of this allowance.  I should like to underline the fact again that farming is a very hazardous and uncertain occupation and the provision for wear and tear allowed for factory machinery or machinery in other trades or businesses is completely inadequate and inappropriate where farm machinery is concerned.  I hope the Minister will examine again his proposals in this regard and consider shortening very considerably the period over which both farm buildings and farm machinery can be written off in the accounts.  Farming, as I say, <Col N="832" /> is a very hazardous vocation and in particular, I should like to emphasise the unfairness of the proposal in regard to capital expenditure on buildings which was incurred before April, 1974 and which farmers were encouraged by the Government and all the institutions and organisations concerned to undertake.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of discussion about the proposals in regard to disallowing the personal allowances to which a farmer would otherwise be entitled where off-farm income arises.  I strongly and sincerely urge the Minister to drop that proposal in its entirety.  I think I know the sort of argument that was put to the Minister and which persuaded him to bring in this provision. We have all heard it in discussion from time to time but it is really only a publichouse type of argument.  It does not stand up.  The repercussions of what the Minister is proposing to do are so serious that I urge him to have a further look at it with a view to discarding it completely. I doubt if there is anybody who is concerned about the development of this country who did not support and favour the idea of farmers being encouraged to stay on their farms and seek to augment their limited farm income with off-farm employment.  This is something which is socially desirable and was widely supported by everybody concerned with the problem of rural depopulation.  It seemed to be one of the main basis on which the prosperity of rural Ireland could be promoted. Many farms were of such a nature that with the best endeavour, with the best will in the world, they could never provide a farm family with the standard of living to which they were entitled and the obvious answer was for the farmer himself, his wife or some member of the family, to seek off-farm employment to augment the farm income.</P>
    <P>I think there may have been some criticism of the sort of situation in which a farmer's wife was employed in some reasonably remunerative occupation and the combined married allowances were available against <Col N="833" /> the wife's income.  That may have been the sort of argument which caused the Minister to bring forward these provisions but unless there is something else involved he should discard it because it is going to have disastrous repercussions on this very desirable process of adding off-farm income to the farm income and enabling farmers in this way to provide a reasonable standard of living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in regard to larger farmers, may, or may not, use the argument that large farmers should make a contribution through the income tax code to the Exchequer the same as everybody else.  Some people feel he is entitled to use that argument but I do not agree.  Whatever about the validity of that argument, and I think it is something that has not been finally established, nothing of that sort applies with regard to the particular provisions I am talking about.  It is unique and a total departure in the income tax code that persons who would otherwise be entitled to income tax allowances should have them disallowed in this way.  In my view it is morally indefensible and represents a completely new concept being introduced into the income tax code.  Anybody who is entitled to an allowance should get that allowance and all taxpayers, whether they are in farming, or any other industry, should get their allowances impartially and equally across the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that we treat people equally if, for example, in the case of two women in similar employment earning the same income with the one who is single but supporting elderly relatives subject to tax while the other who is married to a farmer who can set off all the family allowances against the wife's income paying less tax although the income is far greater and the dependants may, in fact, be less?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the intricacies of the Minister's question but I maintain that it is a radical and fundamental departure to create a <Col N="834" /> situation where any one taxpayer is not allowed the same full allowances as any other taxpayer.  Allowances should be equally and impartially given to all taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, because a particular type of taxpayer is engaged in a certain type of activity, namely farming, is going to disallow that person allowances which if he were in any other occupation he would be allowed.  If a man is a carpenter and he has a wife working as a nurse nobody suggests that his allowances should be cut in half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is whether or not personal allowances should be equally and objectively given to every taxpayer.  I maintain it is morally wrong, but apart from that moral aspect of it, it is socially disastrous.  The Minister will regret doing this because it is going to put the clock back.  It is going to discourage these people from trying to stay on their farms and seek for either themselves or their wives off-farm employment.</P>
      <P>From my own knowledge of rural Ireland I know I am right in making this appeal to the Minister.  Some of my colleagues have mentioned the farmhouse holiday scheme.  It is an excellent example of what is involved here.  Why will people bother to supplement their farm incomes in future if we are going to have this penal provision brought into operation whereby if they do so their personal allowances will be reduced by half?  They should in fact be encouraged and given extra allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I have to elaborate for the Minister the struggle it is for those living even on fair sized farms to provide a reasonable decent standard of living for the family, to educate them and so on.  Far from their being penalised in this way for <Col N="835" /> adding to the farm income they should be actively encouraged to do so.  This proposal is ill-timed to say the least.  This is not the time to be imposing any further burden on the farming community.  It is all very well and easy to point to some farmers who do well or are prosperous but here we are legislating for the bulk of farmers and not for the odd exception or the small minority.  These proposals are going to have a serious disincentive effect on farming in general.</P>
    <P>There are exclusions and special provisions in the Bill for a number of things but the whole atmosphere is going to be one of disincentive.  This is a time when farmers need encouragement. The process of adjusting to EEC conditions has been much more difficult than we anticipated and farmers who were encouraged to make investments now find themselves in serious difficulty.  To postpone these particular proposals would, in my view, have a very encouraging effect throughout the rural community.</P>
    <P>In general I should like to criticise the Bill because there are no incentives in it.  The whole approach is a penal one.  Nowhere in the Bill is there the slightest suggestion of encouragement to anybody in any sector of the economy.  That is the greatest single criticism that can be made of the Bill apart from the particular provisions which are comprised in it.</P>
    <P>The whole atmosphere created by the Bill is one of restriction and discouragement. This is a time, and the Minister should not blind himself to this reality, when there is a crisis of confidence in the community.  There is uncertainty and doubt not only among the farming community but in the business world.  Investment decisions are either being deferred or cancelled altogether, and looming over the whole situation like a sword of Damocles is the Minister's package on capital taxation.  The whole atmosphere is one of doubt and uncertainty. The Minister was inclined to reject <Col N="836" /> suggestions made by some of my colleagues that there is a crisis in the building industry.  I want to assure him, from my information, that that is the position.  If there is a crisis in the building industry, if there is a shortage of finance in the building industry, together with a crisis in the farming community, ultimately the whole economy must be seriously affected.</P>
    <P>I raised here last week the question of the directive on credit which the Central Bank issued.  I think that was seriously ill-timed.  There is a crisis of confidence already and it was a serious error of judgement for the Central Bank to come out as it did at that time with these further restrictive proposals.  I regret the fact that there is no way in which we, as a House, can now have a full discussion on that directive of the Central Bank because it is, in its own way, as fundamentally important as some of the things which the Minister is proposing in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot be unaware of the very depressed conditions of the stock market at this time.  I suggest that he should direct his attention to the whole situation prevailing in that regard.  I believe that many Irish businesses at this moment are in serious danger of foreign take-over and, indeed, I would not put some of our major financial institutions outside the realm of that possibility because of the very difficult situation which obtains in the money market and in the financial institutions.  The Minister should take positive action to ensure that vital financial institutions cannot be taken over from the outside because of the present difficult financial situation here.</P>
    <P>I conclude by coming back to my general criticism of the Bill, that it does not provide any single incentive for promotion, for development, in any single sector of the economy.  All its provisions are penal and cannot be regarded as in any way contributing to the progress or the development of the economy.  I also want to reiterate my complaint that it is not good enough for the Minister to bring forward this Finance Bill at such a late <Col N="837" /> stage and ask us to deal with it, to bundle it through the House, in the annual end-of-session stampede which takes place here every year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall begin where my colleague left off on the question of the Bill being so late coming before the House.  Never before has a Finance Bill been so late.  Normally, within a month of the budget everything that was in the budget is in the form of a Finance Bill.  There must be serious disagreement within the Cabinet on many financial matters when the Finance Bill, even coming at this late stage, does not carry all the provisions that were mentioned in the budget.  That leads me to believe that things are not right within the Cabinet.  We heard Deputy Oliver Flanagan today openly criticising the Minister for Finance.  Such things are usually the smoke signals of dissension, of possible break-up.  As well as that, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at present seems to be the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Everybody seems to be going his own way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the worst possible years to bring in a tax on farmers.  For 10 years farmers have not had as bad a year as this one with cattle prices dropping dramatically. In January, 1973 fat cattle were making £20 per cwt.  At present fat cattle are being sold at around £14 to £16 per cwt.  On a 10 cwt beast that is a drop of £40.  On fat cattle of 12 cwt the drop would be £48 to £50 a head.  At least there is some support for the price in that bracket but for store cattle there is no support at all and the prices there have dropped even further.  This is the year, <Col N="838" /> when the farmers are crucified with losses, that the Government, who claimed throughout the length and breadth of Ireland that they represented the farmers particularly when they were on this side of the House, are bringing in taxation to crucify the farmers even further.  Naturally, they brought it in for farmers of over £100 valuation but that is just the thin end of the wedge.  Every Minister for Finance knows that when he is imposing new taxes he must bring in the wealthier sections first.  It leaves a better gloss on it and it is more acceptable.  In succeeding years we can bring it down.  We can take it that he has set the headline in this Finance Bill that he is bringing it down very soon.  In this Bill a farmer who is working and whose wife is working, if his farm has a £50 valuation, or more, has to return books as well as pay tax on his job.  When farmers of £100 valuation have the choice of returning books of 40 times the valuation why was the choice not given to the people of £50 valuation who have a job?  Those people are not given the alternative.</P>
      <P>The people I am really concerned about are the uneconomic farmers about whom the Land Commission are always talking, those with £20 valuation.  Those people have to go out and look for other jobs and it is usually when the farms get run down that they do so.  Those people lose half the allowance and nothing is taken into regard about what income they get.  This allowance is cut in half, irrespective of whether the man is a single man or a man with up to 14 children, with large allowances.  When a small farmer goes out to work we usually find it helps the farm because he has money to invest in it and production of the farm increases.  This is also found to be the case in Bavaria, Western Germany, and other places in Europe where there are small farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party always believed we should try to help the small farmers.  Over the years we set up different small industries and gave incentives to industry so that these people could go out to work if their <Col N="839" /> farms were uneconomic and the Land Commission had not got enough land to bring them up to an economic level.  Many of those small farmers are working with the Board of Works on the Boyne.  They will now lose their allowances and this Bill will hit them very hard.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced his budget he mentioned the increases he was giving in dependants' allowances to bring them up from £60 to £80. That is the real conjuring trick which I am afraid we expect from this particular Minister.  He has taken away the earned income relief so if a man had £60 tax free under the old system and you put on the earned income relief of one-third it brought it up to £80.  The Minister said he increased the dependent relatives allowance from £60 to £80 but in actual fact he has left it the same.  If the person is earning more than £30 a week not alone has he lost the earned income allowance but he will be paying 35p in the £ as well.</P>
    <P>This morning I came across one of the new tax free allowance forms where an individual is allowed under this Bill, £500 tax free.  On this particular tax free allowance form he was only allowed £400 and no explanation was given why it was only that amount.  I did not have time to look into this matter fully but I know that in this case for two dependent relative allowances of £80 each a figure of £160 was given and underneath it was written this figure of £400.  This must be a mistake because the Finance Bill says the allowance this year is £500.  Perhaps this is because we are working on nine months this year, although the figure would not be correct for that length of time.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out when speaking on both budgets introduced by this Government that each of them was inflationary.  We were told they were not and we would see the effect of those budgets.  We are certainly seeing the effect of them.  Inflation is rampant at the present time.  The <Col N="840" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce last week, in answer to a supplementary question spoke about the necessity for increasing prices.  When he was on this side of the House he criticised the lack of activity on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government to curb prices.  I can assure him that the price rises that took place at that time were nothing compared with what is happening at present.</P>
    <P>We have inflation running at over 20 per cent.  Those are the figures for the past 12 months.  The £ we had in our pockets when the National Coalition Government came into office is worth 17p less today.  It will be worth a good deal less before the end of the year at the present rate of going.  This has been caused purely and simply by the Government not taking advice and not heeding what we have been telling them, by introducing schemes and spending money frivolously, and not taking into account that they must meet their commitments.  A typical example in the budget was budgeting for a deficit of £66 million.  Last year it was £55 million.</P>
    <P>This year VAT will not bring in the money the Minister expects it to bring in, as can be seen by the official returns for the first three months of this financial year.  VAT is up by less than £1 million.  Taking into account the high prices in the previous 12 months, we would be expecting that VAT would bring in another £8 million to £10 million.  The simple fact is that with inflation people have not got the money to spend.  Our taxation is absorbing the purchasing power of the individual.  This has been brought home forcibly to the Minister in the past week by the Chamber of Commerce in Navan.  In their petition they pointed out that people have not got the purchasing power they had 12 months ago.  The cold hard fact is that they just have not got the money.</P>
    <P>We are seeing the signs of inflation. The unemployment figure has risen by 3,000 in the past 12 months.  In tonight's <i>Evening Herald</i> we read that 5,000 people may be laid off before the summer holidays in the building industry.  In a joinery firm, a subsidiary <Col N="841" /> of a big builder, 100 people were laid off last week.</P>

      <P>I have allowed the Deputy quite a lot of latitude.  I find that he is straying from the subject matter of the Bill which is essentially a taxation Bill.

      <P>I was pointing out the Government's policy on financial matters.  I accept your ruling.  There is a provision in this Bill under which people who invest money abroad must declare it and, where firms or individuals are taking money out of the country, they must show a reason for it.  This section comes six months too late.  It is like the old story of closing the stable door when the horse has bolted.</P>
      <P>The Government introduced their White Paper on capital taxation and within two months money literally flowed out of the country.  This section admits what has happened.  The result has been the unemployment figures, the borrowing of £83 million within the past few weeks from Brussels, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation having to borrow money from America.  That money would have been here if the Government had been thinking of the consequences of their actions.  There would be no need for this section.  Most Irish people prefer to invest their money in their own country.  They used to have confidence in their own Government instead of going to tax havens where the situation could change overnight.</P>
      <P>When you see certain proposals in a White Paper, emphasised in the budget speech, naturally you run to wherever you think is safe.  This has a detrimental effect on the economy. Anything that was to go is gone and the Minister will not get it back unless he can recover the people's confidence that the Government are capable of running the country.  I suppose the question of the curtailment of credit might be outside the provisions of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>We want VAT on furniture reduced.  The Minister could not even see this problem and now he has it on his lap when he could have taken some action at that time.  With regard to income tax for farmers, they should get the same facilities and the same benefits as industrialists get.  There is no taxation on profits derived from exports.  A large part of the cattle industry is exported in one form or another. Profits derived from the export of cattle by farmers should be tax-free. This industry is of tremendous advantage to the country and it has a big bearing on our balance of payments. We have the raw materials here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing taxation for farmers in a particularly bad year like this, the Government should give agriculture the same benefits industry receives in respect of exports.  For other industries a large amount of raw materials are imported and the finished products are exported, but in the farming industry most of the raw materials are based here in Ireland. <Col N="843" /> We do not import very much for farming except proteins and machinery and that would be a very small proportion of the value of the exports.  Therefore, recognising the advantage to the balance of payments which agriculture provides, it should be afforded the same concessions as industry.</P>
    <P>There has been great disagreement in the Cabinet regarding what provisions should be included in the Finance Bill, and they are trying to rush it through before it can be given any real consideration.  I notice that the Committee Stage has been ordered for Tuesday week and the Government will expect to have the Bill passed in that week because it is coming up to 1st August.  That is a very short time to go through the Committee Stage of a Finance Bill which may not be the most controversial measure to go through the House but it is certainly the most important one and must be brought in.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in Government, the Finance Bill was always introduced in plenty of time, allowing about two months for discussion, and then it was passed with plenty of amendments in it.  It speaks badly for any government coming in so late with a Finance Bill which has provision for taxing farmers in a year when farmers are losing large sums of money, particularly in the cattle trade, and then rushing it through without adequate consideration.  However, I hope the Minister will introduce some amendments when the Bill reaches committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard throughout the last couple of days rather confused and conflicting statements from the members of the Opposition.  I recognise they were caught on the horns of a dilemma.  They know that the principle which we are applying to the whole code of taxation is a fair one, that is, that people with similar incomes should pay a comparable amount of tax.  They know that it is the application of that principle, <Col N="844" /> certainly in part, which has caused us to bring within the ambit of income tax wealthier farmers.  We need to recognise that the possibility of releasing the smaller man from the bottom of the income tax scale is directly dependent upon the number of wealthier people we can bring in at the top of the scale.</P>
      <P>There is no use in ranting and raving about the injustices and the imperfections of the Irish taxation code and at the same time taking no action to correct these injustices, these imperfections and inequities. Similarly, there is no point in protesting about the unfairness of the code and then opposing any improvements in that code.  A considerable amount of time spent by the Opposition on this Bill was to produce one extraordinary case after another to indicate certain anomalous positions that could be created by the application of the new provisions in this Bill. I did not, however, hear any of those Deputies dwell on the anomalies and intolerable situations which exist under the present code of taxation under which a man with an income of say £10,000 a year out of a large property need not pay tax, while he deducts week in and week out income tax from the pay packets of his workers.  To me, that is a situation which cries out for remedy and it would be intolerable if we had to suffer the continuation of a system exempting the comparatively well-to-do while crucifying those with small means.  One would think that we were taking a broad sweep at all farmers, whereas the provisions we are introducing this year, if they deserve criticism at all, can be criticised only on the ground of their timidity because they will touch no more than 9,000 who have holdings above £100 rateable valuation and an uncertain number who may have holdings above £50 valuation and some other source of income from a business or profession. If the general body of taxpayers knew the scandals we are bringing to an end they would not hesitate to approve our proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot give names or particulars which would identify people who have <Col N="845" /> been involved in avoidance and evasion practices but it is as well that people should know what we are endeavouring to do.  A veterinary surgeon, for instance, has claimed that his income from his veterinary practice was no more than £1,500 while his income from an 80 acre farm exceeded £45,000.  There are cases of people claiming from an obviously profitable retail business in a town profits of about £2,000 and claiming to earn from a farm of comparatively small acreage profits of £35,000.  That is what has been happening where people were able to transfer profits from their legitimate business or their legitimate profession to their tax-free farm income so as to produce accounts which allowed them to escape paying taxation, or a proper share of taxation, on incomes which netted £20,000, £30,000, £40,000 and £50,000.  This has been going on for several years past and it appals me that is should have been tolerated for so long.</P>
    <P>One must be, I think, wary when pursuing equity and absolute equality of treatment that one does not provide disincentives.  We have taken great care in this Finance Bill not to create any disincentives.  There is nothing punitive in any provision in this Finance Bill.  We are not applying new or higher rates of tax on anybody.  All we are doing is bringing into the net people who should be in a position to pay a fair contribution to the revenue. We accept that the farming community are going through a difficult time and we are doing everything within our power to overcome their difficulties.  Several speakers on the opposite benches, including Deputy Callanan, were generous enough to acknowledge that the creation of most of the difficulties was not the responsibility of the Government.</P>
    <P>We accept, of course, that in a democratic society there will always be criticism of action or inaction to remedy such difficulties.  There are difficulties and I will repeat now what I said to the farming organisations when I met them: if there are difficulties this year, and farmers are making losses, there is no reason <Col N="846" /> whatever to complain about the introduction of income tax because income tax cannot be charged on a loss-making situation.  Income tax arises only when profits are made and, if farmers are making losses this year &mdash;unfortunately, some of them are, but it is only some&mdash;they will be entitled to set off those losses against profits in the years to come.  If taxation of farming profits is to be introduced, the best year to introduce it from a farmer's point of view is in a year of loss because you do not pay tax on losses now and the losses can be set off <i>in futuro</i> against profits. That is very important and, perhaps, now some of the critics who have been rather unfair in their criticism might bear that in mind if the losses are as genuine as they are claiming.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley claimed that the increases in the personal allowances announced in the budget were inadequate having regard to the rate of inflation.  He suggested there should be a built-in provision to ensure that personal allowances would automatically increase to keep pace with the rate of inflation.  That reminds me of similar remarks made from the Opposition benches in 1968 when the then Minister, Deputy Haughey, was most indignant that that suggestion should be made.  He said it was irresponsible of the Opposition to make a criticism of that kind unless the Opposition provided an alternative source of revenue.  I shall leave it at that.  If those words were valid in 1968, they are just as valid today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not different. Everything is relevant.  If the cost of living is rising&mdash;as, indeed, it is primarily due to factors outside our control&mdash;incomes are rising faster than the cost of living and one cannot look at one side of the equation without looking at the other side.  I am not saying income tax allowances should not be regularly revised.  As a Government, we have already given a very specific and public undertaking that we will revise the allowances from <Col N="847" /> time to time to take into account the cost of living and we will certainly honour that promise.  I am not averse to the idea of providing statutory indicators which would control allowances of all kinds.  I have given an undertaking that I will be providing an indicator in the new package of capital taxation, but it is not an easy matter to either define or refine a suitable indicator which will do justice in all cases because different factors exist in relation to the incomes of different people.  But this is something we are continuing to examine very carefully and, if a fair system can be devised, I shall be the first to introduce it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick queried the mortgage interest in the new scheme of taxation.  He quoted some figures and he asked me to provide an example to show the position of a taxpayer paying mortgage interest in 1973-74 and in 1974-75.  I am very glad to take the case of the man he used for purposes of illustration, the man with an income of £3,000.  He is not, however, typical of a large number of people.  If we take the man with £3,000, married with 3 children, and he is paying mortgage interest of £550, the position is as follows: in 1973-74, gross income £3,000, mortgage interest £550, total net income £2,450.  Against that he would be entitled to set off his marriage allowance, earned income relief and child allowances amounting to £1,421.  That leaves a taxable income of £1,029 and, taxed at 35p, the tax liability amounts to £360.15p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the reformed package of this year's budget let us take the same man with the same income&mdash;assuming there is no variation in income in the meantime.  Again his gross income would be £3,000, his mortgage interest £550 and his total net income £2,450. His allowances deducted from that would be £1,400 which would leave him with a taxable income of £1,050. The taxable income is marginally higher than the old taxable income&mdash; the old taxable income was £1,029 and the new taxable income is £1,050. <Col N="848" /> But watch where the reduction comes in.  Under the old system he was taxed at 35p in the £ but under the new system he is taxed at only 26p in the £, with the result that his tax liability is £273 with a gain of £87.15p.  That clearly indicates the very significant reductions given under this year's budget and Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>In relation to mortgage interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Mortgage interest has to be deducted from the gross income in order to get the net income.  Against that income you set off the personal allowances to get the taxable income and then you calculate the appropriate tax.  As the appropriate tax this year is 9p less than it was last year, the taxpayer pays substantially less in tax this year than he did last year.</P>
      <P>I am not pretending that this is easy to understand.  The truth is it took many months of very hard work in the Department of Finance and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to make the necessary adjustments in a whole mixture of tax provisions in order to produce a formula which could literally be printed on the back of a demand notice.  That is what we have done.  We have condensed a whole mixture of variations, qualifications and reliefs into a clearly understood system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, one of the reasons why the income tax law is so complex is because it is full of qualifications and reliefs.  Many of the requests made to me in the course of this debate, if accepted, would make this year's Finance Bill, which is no easy thing to understand, even more incomprehensible and about four times its present length.  Deputy Colley, as a former Minister for Finance, will appreciate the truth of what I am saying in this regard.  The more one tries to tailor a system to deal with all particularly difficult cases, the more complex, lengthy and incomprehensible <Col N="849" /> becomes the law.  We have produced a comprehensible and fair system, and one which also provides very substantial reliefs for the overwhelming majority and some relief for everyone.</P>
    <P>The lower paid workers are getting the highest percentage of relief.  This relief varies from 14 per cent to 1 or 1½ per cent for those in the top bracket.  A significant relief was given where it was most needed.  We are happy to have removed 60,000 people from the tax net.  I recall that Deputy Colley was pleased when he removed thousands of people from the tax net in 1972.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers, particularly those in the PAYE system: I have been looking carefully at their weekly wage sheets to see these reductions in taxation reflected in their pay dockets.  So far they have not appeared.  I explained in the course of the budget that it would take some months before these reductions could be reflected in actual income tax certificates.  I would like to remind everybody of this because there has been a certain amount of understandable grumbling in recent times.  The actual reductions cannot be made and the alterations in the tax allowance certificates cannot be made until the Finance Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey asked if it was absolutely essential to pass this Bill before the recess of the Dáil and Seanad.  For a variety of reasons it is, but I can think of no better reason for passing it than the necessity to ensure that all income taxpayers are given the reliefs at the earliest possible date.  As the reductions will not actually appear in their wage packets for some months, I want to emphasise to them that they will get, for the remainder of the financial year, reductions in their income tax calculated on a 12-month basis.  In other words, whether it takes two, three or four months actually to start this process of refunding these very substantial allowances to income taxpayers, they will get them in the 12-month period up to April next.  If there is an outstanding balance at that time it will not take long to clear it off.  Towards the autumn and winter of this year income taxpayers will see significant <Col N="850" /> reductions in the amount of income tax deducted under the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley raised a number of points about farming profits.  Like many points raised by other speakers, many of his can be more suitably dealt with on Committee Stage.  In so far as I can provide to Members a better understanding of the Bill before the Committee Stage, I will try to deal with the points raised.  Deputy Colley wanted to know whether the notional income would apply for one year only or in future years.  He will recall that I said in the budget debate, and when introducing this Bill, that it would apply for a transitional period. I am not in a position at this stage to say how long the transitional period will be.  It will be recalled that the Commission on Income Tax recommended whenever income taxation was introduced for farmers&mdash;in order to cope with the difficulties which would arise because they were not accustomed to keeping accounts&mdash;that a notional basis should be provided for a transitional period until all necessary details of a scheme were drawn up with appropriate precision and until such time as farmers had an opportunity to prepare and keep accounts.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile recalling that that advice was given as far back as 1960 and repeated in 1961 together with a recommendation that farming profits should be subject to tax.  Unfortunately, instead of taking the advice of that commission, the previous Government exempted all farming profits in 1969.  However, that is all water under the bridge.</P>
    <P>This matter has been raised by the farming organisations who came to see me.  I explained that once we have studied all their recommendations and the farming community has become accustomed to keeping accounts, we will consider whether the time has come to terminate the transitional period.  Frankly, I do not think it will happen this year.  We will need a few years before we see any variation.</P>
    <P>If the farming situation is as pessimistic <Col N="851" /> as people indicated in this House today, they need not opt for the notional system but may go for their actual accounts.  If they are able to establish losses, no liability arises. If they are able to establish very small profits below the 40 multiplier, then their liability will be correspondingly less.</P>
    <P>A number of Members queried why we have chosen a multiplier of 40 and why we allow only those deductions against that notional income, that is, in respect of rates, wages and depreciation of farm machinery.  If one were to take the calculation of notional farm income on the basis on which it has been calculated in previous years, it would have been at 53 before last year and for this year, prior to the slump in beef, it would be somewhat higher.  Even on the basis of current estimates, the figure is certainly higher than 40.</P>
    <P>We have chosen a figure that is lower than what has been generally accepted by the farming community as the notional income.  Because of the peculiar situation of rates we are allowing deduction of rates; in order not to provide any disincentive in relation to farm employment we are allowing deduction of wages; and, as I emphasised in my introductory speech on Second Stage, we are also allowing payments to contractors who do work which the farmer, in days when labour was available, might have had done by a regularly employed person.  We are allowing depreciation in respect of farm machinery because it is a very important and costly element in modern farming.</P>
    <P>If a farmer goes for actual profits or losses, he will be entitled to deduct other items such as interest payments, depreciation in respect of farm buildings and so on.  We are providing that a farmer must opt within six months of the introduction of the budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Argument has been advanced that it is too short a <Col N="852" /> period and that we should extend it. I think the 9,000 farmers who may be involved and some others are well aware by now that income tax may affect them.  It is not as though they will be taken by surprise next September or October.  So far as the Revenue Comissioners can identify such people they will notify them of their potential liability.  I would be very surprised if there is anyone who will be affected by this legislation who will not be aware of it long in advance of six months.  I do not think there is any necessity to extend the period but I am prepared to look into it.  If an extension is absolutely necessary, I will certainly consider it.</P>
      <P>Deputies Colley, Haughey and others raised the question of farm holiday income which a family might derive from providing farmhouse accommodation for people during the summer season.  I would be very loath to do anything to discourage the farming community from taking in guests. From personal experience, I can strongly recommend to people the excellence of farmhouse holidays in Ireland.  It is the kind of a holiday I invariably choose for my family and myself and I think it has a great deal to commend it.  However, income from farmhouse holidays is already liable to tax; we are not bringing in any new provision in respect of such income.  I cannot see how any element of disincentive is going to arise.  Most of the farmhouse holidays are operated in farms that have a land valuation of less than £50.  Those in excess of that who have substantial incomes cannot reasonably complain about being subjected to income tax like anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been amazed at the vehemence of the protestations from the Opposition about applying income taxation to the farming community. By and large I have found that most of the people who are about to be affected accept the reasonableness of income tax.  Several of them have told me that they always found it very awkward to deduct income tax from the pay packets of their employees while they themselves were exempt. They knew if that situation was permitted <Col N="853" /> to continue it would develop antagonisms and resentment that would be difficult to mollify.  We would be doing a grave disservice to the farming community if we did not contradict the vehemence of the Opposition argument in the last few days&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think there was any vehemence on this side.  If urban dwellers thought that the remarks of the Opposition, with a few honourable exceptions, really reflected the mind of the farming community, I feel it would be a very evil contribution of antagonism between urban dwellers and the rural community. We do not want this as it would be extremely injurious to the social fabric and the traditions of our country.  It is only a minority of urban dwellers who are more than a generation or two removed from the rural community.  We want to remain a united community.  We are comparatively united, which is more than can be said for other countries where there is a great clash between city and country.  We do not want that here. On behalf of the farming community whom I have had the pleasure of meeting, both personally and in a ministerial capacity, I would point out that the attacks made on our proposals do not reflect the overwhelming mass of the farming community who accept our proposals as reasonable. This is not surprising as about only 5 per cent of farmers are affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will affect only a fraction of full-time farmers and a minority who are not full-time farmers.  There will be less than 15,000 or 20,000 in the whole country who are potentially within the net.  Of course, like other potential taxes one cannot say with certainty beforehand the precise number who will be affected.  If the figure is greater than the one I have quoted, it will be because there has been more avoidance and evasion than we know about.  I am not talking about avoidance and evasion by the genuine farmer but by people who are not genuine farmers, <Col N="854" /> who get most of their income from other sources but have gone into farming in order to set off profits from their other occupations &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that. When I met the farming organisations and put this issue to them, almost to a man they were of the view that the Government would be doing the right thing to suppress that kind of activity which is of little benefit to the genuine farming community.  In many cases it meant that land was bought by people who were merely hobby farmers.  Such land was not used properly, while people who wanted to make a better livelihood for themselves and their families, as genuine farmers were unable to compete against the very high prices which these fly-by-night people were able to pay.  We are closing that gap and I believe it will benefit the farming industry as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was criticised last night in a rather sweeping and inaccurate statement by a spokesman for the Irish Farmers' Association because I said that, because of pressure of parliamentary duties in these coming weeks in relation primarily to the Finance Bill, I would not be easily available to them and, as they were looking for an immediate meeting, I suggested that they might see some senior officials of my Department.  Incidentally, that was an invitation which I first extended to them when I met them last April and May.  I suggested that matters of detail might well be very usefully thrashed out&mdash;for as long as they wanted to thrash them out&mdash;with the experts in my Department and in the Revenue Commissioners and if necessary with myself if there were any outstanding issues.  I am sorry to say that in the interval we did not have an approach from the Irish Farmers' Association to tease out these problems although both my officials and myself were more than anxious to be available to them if they had approached us.  But, when I received a request on Monday morning looking for an instant meeting, when my calendar of appointments was already full for the next month. when I had the obligation to be in this House <Col N="855" /> and in Seanad Éireann, I did not think it was at all unreasonable that they might see some officials of my Department and of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley, I am sure, will join with me in saying that we have every reason to have confidence in our officials&mdash;at all levels.  When they meet delegations they keep a very full note of what is said and report in due course to the Minister.  I was not at all ruling out the possibility of being able to meet, and certainly I was not saying that I was, on any occasion in the future, unwilling to meet the Irish Farmers' Association or any other farming organisation.  I was more than willing to meet them and I think I have shown them that for several months past.  Indeed, I have seen no fewer than nine different farming organisations in relation to the taxation of farming profits and as many farming organisations in relation to the capital taxation proposals in so far as they might affect farming. I have received innumerable submissions from them and this is the first occasion on which there has been any criticism of my lack of availability, a criticism which, on the record, I can show not to be justified.  Therefore, I must have some suspicions about the genuineness of these allegations made last night.  The truth is, and I want to put this on the record, that while I was in this House today representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association met officials of my Department to discuss whatever problems they had in relation to this Bill. That is the proper way to do it and it is unfortunate that some people resorted to propaganda, in order, as it were, to have &ldquo;a go&rdquo;.  I believe in constructive and meaningful consultations and I think they can best be conducted when there is mutual respect.  It becomes difficult to accept the genuineness of people when they use an offer in order to endeavour to embarrass the person who made it.  I have just been handed a note to say that apparently the arrangement with the IFA to meet with representatives of my Department has now been postponed until tomorrow.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> In relation to section 16 of the Bill which, in general, provides that where a person who is carrying on farming also has a trade or profession, or a controlling interest in a company will be chargeable to tax on his farming profits, on an accounts basis, it has been suggested that this should apply only where 50 per cent of the income came from a non-farming source.  But, if this suggestion were followed, the section would lose a great deal of its impact, if not its entire point.  This section is primarily an anti-evasion measure designed to prevent a person in these circumstances attributing what are obviously business profits to his farming activities so as to escape the tax charge.</P>
    <P>In all of these cases, the amount of profits being attributed to farming income is in excess of that shown for their business activities so that if the 50 per cent criterion were to apply these people could continue to evade tax on their business profits.  For the same reason the notional basis is not being extended to them since, if this were done, it would facilitate them in avoiding the tax charge on their business profits.  I do not know if Deputy Colley was here when I quoted some figures earlier to indicate the extent of avoidance by attributing to farming activity profits made from another business or profession.  The actual figures are scandalous and could not be justified for a day longer because, as I revealed, we have cases in which people with net incomes of £20,000, £30,000, £40,000 or more have been avoiding income tax by attributing profits from non-farming activities to farming ones.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley queried why section 25 should deny depreciation allowances for years prior to 1974-75 whereas the new farm buildings' allowances provided for under section 22 would not cover expenditure incurred prior to the current year.  The position is that, under the general law, wear and tear allowances have always been available in relation to plant and machinery.  But, as is the normal practice when exempt activities are being brought into charge, allowances which were properly due for years during which the profits were <Col N="857" /> not chargeable to tax, are not allowed to be carried forward and set off against profits coming into charge.  I am sure Deputy Colley will recall that when we were debating this point recently in relation to the taxation of mines it was explained that what happens is that the balance of any such wear and tear allowances available&mdash;at the point at which the profits are being brought into charge&mdash;will be allowable and that is what section 25 achieves.</P>
    <P>In relation to the new allowance in respect of farm buildings, it is also customary to provide that, when a new allowance is being brought in, it is made applicable to expenditure incurred as from a current date.  A look through the various provisions in relation to all new capital allowances brought in over the last 20 years will confirm this point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley also asked how the marginal relief provision would operate in relation to restriction of allowances where the farmer had other income.  That section provides that personal allowances are to be reduced by one-half or by an amount arrived at by multiplying the excess of rateable valuation over £20 by 80.  In other words, if we take a married man with a farm valuation of £21, whose wife is working&mdash;perhaps she is a teacher or a nurse&mdash;the reduction, <i>prima facie,</i> would be £500 but this reduction would be limited to 80 times the excess over £20; that is, a reduction of £80.  Therefore, in such a case, a farmer would be able to set off £920 of his allowances against his wife's earnings.  If the farm was of a valuation of £22, the reduction in allowances would be limited to £160, so that £840 of the personal allowances would be available for set off against the wife's earnings.  I think it will be very obvious, therefore, that the restriction on the allowances of farms of just over £20 valuation is very modest indeed.</P>

      <P>£119.  I am saying that the limit on the valuation would be £119.  I am sorry&mdash;I have just got a note to remind me, we are dealing with reducing allowances&mdash;if we take it on the basis of the allowances, it would be about £30 in practice.  There are so many different variations now to avoid hardship I am getting confused by the complexities of the code which we are trying to make comparatively simple.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, the more you attempt to refine income tax so as not to do an injustice to anybody, the more complex you make the code.  The basic income tax code now is a lot simpler than it was.  We have eliminated a vast number of refinements, calculations and variations which had become archaic and which could no longer be justified.</P>
      <P>On the question of the £2,000 limit of interest on borrowings which could be set off against tax liability, I realise that a special problem could arise for a person who is selling one house and buying another, particularly when the first house might be subject to a mortgage or where a man would be buying a new house before selling the old one. In such circumstances he might have to resort to a bridging loan or to borrowing far beyond what would be normal.  I will be introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with that comparatively temporary difficulty so as to avoid difficulties which I would not intend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley suggested that the interest restrictions might be got around by use of shell companies and other devices and that it would be necessary to close loopholes.  Needless to say, I am very anxious that nothing should be done to impede the development of commercial enterprises whether by people or by corporate bodies or which would facilitate the take-over of domestic businesses by foreign interests.  Accordingly, the <Col N="859" /> legislation in relation to companies extending their business by acquiring propriety interests directly or indirectly in the companies has been drafted in very wide terms.  I think that if any criticism can be offered it is that the terms are too wide.  I am giving fair warning that if in the light of experience it is found that the terms are over generous, they will be modified.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of our proposals from people who have made a packet out of tax avoidance and evasion and who complain at the suddenness of change which may create difficulties for them.  If people knowingly engage in tax avoidance or evasion, if they fly in the face of what they know the legislature would do or would want to do, they have no right to complain if some temporary difficulty is created for them by stopping an abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have personal sympathy with somebody who assumed the legislature would not take corrective action, but such people are usually resourceful enough to find some way of cushioning themselves. They are far more resourceful in means and in experience and in access to advisers than ordinary taxpayers who from time to time as a result of budgets or financial resolutions have found themselves disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not quite follow the suggestion of Deputy Colley that some of the provisions might encourage British residents to purchase houses and office blocks here.  He seems to think that the restriction of £2,000 on interest would mean that British residents would move in here to purchase property which otherwise might be purchased by Irish people.  It is important to remember that in Britain relief on interest on money borrowed is not available in respect of money borrowed on a principal private residence. If a British resident came rushing in here he would find that if he borrowed money he would not be able to set off the interest on the money <Col N="860" /> so borrowed against tax liability in Britain, and if he tried to overcome that disability by moving to Ireland, he would become an Irish resident and therefore liable to tax here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves that topic would he comment on the complaint made about the sudden change in respect of people who were buying their own houses as distinct from speculators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again we must look at the practical effects of what we are doing.  If we take the case Deputy Colley has in mind of a man buying a £20,000 house who has made a very substantial borrowing to purchase that house, what would be the position? He will still get complete exemption for about the first £14,000 in borrowing, roughly equivalent to £2,000 interest, and it is only the excess over that £14,000 which he has borrowed which would no longer enjoy the income tax set-off.  Presumably he has put down a deposit of 20 or 25 per cent.  So the actual amount which will now be no longer available to him is no more than £1,000 or £2,000 of his total borrowing or £300 interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister is dealing with that point, but the question is in regard to the sudden change for people who had entered into these commitments and who are not speculators&mdash;the absence of notice to such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every budget except this year's budget, which is unique in that respect, contained new tax impositions which were sudden, presented without notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unique as well&mdash;we are two unique gentlemen.  It is not as though a terrible disservice is being done by the new interest limits.  The margin which will no longer be entitled to the exemption is comparatively small.  In the case of the £20,000 house, the £14,000 is set-off, the man has put down a deposit of <Col N="861" /> £4,000 or £5,000 leaving only about £1,000 or so which will no longer enjoy the set-off.  I pose this question: is it right that the general body of taxpayers should provide a subsidy to a person who has ambitions for a comfortable home of his own which he would not attempt to purchase if he could not set-off a substantial part of the cost against the Exchequer? The Exchequer is not some distant mythical enemy of the people.  It is all the people, and I have never been able to understand why a person should be able to buy a home worth say £50,000 because he has sufficient wealth to be able to command sufficient respect from his bank manager to get a substantial advance and then be able to set-off 50 per cent or 60 per cent or 80 per cent of the cost against the remainder of the taxpayers.  That is what has happened.  If somebody is subject to an income tax rate of 80 per cent and buys a magnificent home on a mortgage, he sets off 80 per cent of the cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, of the interest, but the House is increasing in value.  That has been the trend for a long time.  At a time when we are proposing to grant total exemption from all capital taxation for a principal private residence, a situation which did not exist heretofore because it could be caught ultimately for estate duty, there is no further justification for continuing a system under which people of substantial wealth and substantial means can acquire homes with borrowings enjoying tax exemption, homes which would ultimately become tax free assets.  I think we have been more than fair. The provision which we have made would certainly cover the homes and the house owning ambitions of 98 per cent of our people without doing any serious disservice to people who might have operated under the old system and thought, I think unreasonably, that it might continue forever.  It is more than six years since in Britain limitation was put on the amount of interest which could be set off against income tax liability.  In France, often quoted here as a country with fair tax, <Col N="862" /> the maximum amount of interest which can be set off against income tax liability is £500.  We are making it £2,000.  In Australia they do not go by the amount of interest but rather by the income of the taxpayer and there the maximum income allowed is £9,000 to qualify for the interest set off.  With us the loan being permitted is between £13,000 and £14,000 on the present very high rates of interest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In common with Deputies on the opposite side I accept that the valuation system is not a very good way to assess the capacity of a person to pay income tax but it is the best available.  This is acknowledged in the reports of the commissions and inter-Departmental committees that have been reviewing this question for many years.  When they tried to pick a suitable system, the view expressed was that the best system would be actual profits and losses.  All these reports or any advice I received&mdash;this is going over a period of 14 or 15 years&mdash;were all to the effect that there should be for farmers a transitional period during which the system of valuation should be taken as a basis.  There will be some people who, if the property were to be revalued in relation to current values of a neighbour's property, might be below £100 rateable valuation and <i>vice versa</i>.  We did not pretend we were achieving perfection.  If anybody does not like the rateable valuation he can produce actual accounts <Col N="863" /> and if the rateable valuation is high but the actual profit from a farm is low, then the actual accounts will give that person an opportunity to prove the faulty multiplier of his rateable valuation is not suitable.</P>
      <P>The real answer to Deputy Callanan's criticism or that of anybody who speaks against the valuation system is not to take the valuation system at all, not use it as a rule of thumb at all, but to bring in all farmers and look at their actual accounts.  I do not think the Deputy or anybody else is suggesting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the classification under Directive 159, commercial development and transitional, and said that the lower two should be excluded and top ones included because they have reached an economic income according to this directive.  That is the case I was making. I was not excluding the top fellows.  I thought it was fairer and something that the Minister should think of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I have a very open mind on this. One of the reasons for the transitional period I referred to earlier is that there are difficulties in relation to farm income and taxation of farming profits.  Deputy Haughey also referred to them but I think he was wrong to do what he did in the past, run away from these problems altogether and do nothing about them.  It is better to tease them out and in this transitional period we shall be teasing them out.  I hope it will be possible to find a better way of assessing the ability of people to pay income tax on their farming profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley argued that the figure of £1,000 which I am providing for in the Bill as the maximum of insurance premiums which would qualify annually for tax relief, should be at least £2,000.  Ireland is exceptional&mdash;I am not saying we should not be&mdash;in the preferential treatment given to insurance.  There are other forms of saving which are as commendable and which make as many <Col N="864" /> demands on man's thrifty nature as insurance but, accepting that insurance deserves some special consideration because people should be encouraged to insure against risks, let us look at what a premium of £1,000 would buy by way of capital sum. This premium of £1,000 on an insurance policy with profits which would mature at age 65, if taken out by a man of 30 years of age would provide a sum of £100,000; if taken out at 40 years of age, a sum of £55,000 and at 50 years of age, £25,000.</P>
    <P>Those are very substantial sums and I would find it very difficult to ask the general body of taxpayers to absorb the cost of providing any further benefits.  Deputy Colley suggests a ceiling of £2,000 but a premium of £2,000 would buy, at 30 years of age, £200,000; at 40, £110,000 and at 50, £50,000.  I am not saying that people should not be encouraged, if they have the means, to take out insurance policies of that kind if they want to provide for their families or provide liquid resources in the event of death or at a time of advancing years but it is wrong that the general body of taxpayers, the vast majority of whom have no possibility of setting aside £1,000 a year for any purpose should be called upon to pay the cost.  We have tried to mix the conflicting needs of the community and I think we have done it comparatively fairly.</P>
    <P>To turn again for a moment to the middle income group, Deputy Gallagher suggested that married men with a number of children in the middle income group were worse off now than ever they were.  I would like to produce actual figures to refute this.  A married man with four children earning £2,700, assuming he has no other allowances in respect of mortgage repayments or anything else would pay in 1973-74 £460.25.  As a consequence of this year's Finance Bill the tax payable by him will be £286.  This typical man in the middle income group has a saving in taxation of £174.25 which I think is a very dramatic saving for people who last year were complaining that they were being asked to bear the full brunt of the Government's social policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="865" /> This saving arises from two causes. One is a saving of £94.10 because of the improvement in the income tax code and the other is because we are no longer obtaining a refund of the increases which were made in social welfare, children's allowances under last year's budget and this year's budget.  Altogether that typical man in the middle income group has a saving of £174.25 this year.</P>
    <P>Many of the comments in the debate were directed to section 57 which proposes to require solicitors and bankers to give certain minimal information to the Revenue Commissioners. I would remind the House that the Income Tax Act, 1967, which was a consolidation Act repeated a provision from legislation of 1918, of 1958 and of 1963 which required&mdash;I quote from section 176 of the 1967 Act:</P>
    <P>(1)  Every person who, in whatever capacity, is in receipt of any money or value, or of profits or gains arising from any of the sources mentioned in this Act, of or belonging to any other person who is chargeable in respect thereof, or who would be so chargeable if he were resident in the State...</P>
    <P>to</P>
    <P>... prepare and deliver, within the period mentioned in such notice, a list in the prescribed form, signed by him, containing&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a statement of all such money, value, profits or gains;</P>
    <P>(b)  the name and address of every person to whom the same shall belong;</P>
    <P>(c)  a declaration whether every such person is of full age, or a married woman or is resident in the State or is an incapacitated person.</P>
    <P>(2)  If any person above described is acting jointly with any other person, he shall, in like manner, deliver a list of the names and addresses of all persons joined with him at the time of delivery of the list mentioned in subsection (1).</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>(a)  a statement of all such money, value profits or gains;</P>
      <P>(b)  the name and address of every person to whom the same shall belong.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>We are not seeking to do anything more radical in this legislation.  I find it very difficult to accept the sincerity of the protestations of the Opposition. Some of them have said they are opposed to tax evasion and avoidance. If one is opposed to tax evasion and avcidance it is logical that one must ensure that the Revenue Commissioners are given the means to combat evasion and avoidance but if a person by resorting to a professional person or to a bank were able to conceal his activities from the scrutiny of the Revenue Commissioners he would have open to him a very convenient way of engaging in evasion and avoidance.  I am sure Deputy Colley will not challenge me when I say, as a solicitor, that the rights of a solicitor are no greater or no less than those of his client.  A solicitor has no right to say that his rights are greater than those of his client.  His client is not entitled to engage in tax evasion and avoidance.  A solicitor is not entitled to provide a cloak to shield a client engaged in such activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not asking that a solicitor should reveal all intricacies and information regarding his clients affairs. The Revenue Commissioners will seek sufficient information to enable them to go after the person from whom they wish to get further information. It may well be that on pursuit of the person in question no liability to tax will arise.  I would be loath, in view of my professional training and experience as a solicitor and the code which was drilled into us from the <Col N="867" /> time we became law students, to permit of any breach of confidentiality between client and solicitor or for that matter between banker and client.  We are not seeking to breach that area of confidence which must exist if a client is to obtain objective advice from his legal adviser or from his banker.  All we are saying is that the people who are consulted in this way must, if called upon identify the person on whose behalf they have been acting.  The Revenue Commissioners would pursue the matter thereafter.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to <Col N="869" /> taking the odd question but it would be unfair to the other Members of the House if I were to engage in speech at this stage with one Deputy.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the picture he has painted of a horde of inspectors decending on innocent people, demanding that they produce figures and accounts of other people's affairs, is not justified and that it will not happen.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of building societies.  This is a matter that is not relevant particularly to this Bill but I do not mind dealing with it since it has within it an element of taxation.  I assure the House that the Government are well aware of the true situation of building societies and the building industry in general.  I would emphasise that in the first six months of this year more houses have been built than were built at any time in the history of the State.  That is established by the figures which anyone can obtain from the Central Statistics Office. Therefore, the gloom which some people tried to cast over the proceedings here in relation to the building industry is totally without foundation.</P>
      <P>We are as aware as anybody else of the difficuly of getting sufficient money to finance such a magnificent building programme because, not only have we built more houses in the first six months of this year, but we have had to build them at a higher cost than ever before.</P>

If only I could lay my hands on them now I would give them to Deputy Colley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be only too glad to embarrass the Deputies opposite. <Col N="870" /> Let us come to the situation affecting building societies.  Since 22nd June the interest rate on deposits with the Associated Banks has been reduced by 1½ per cent.  It is too early yet to say what the significance of this will be for building societies but the time of greatest growth for building societies here was a time when building societies had an advantage of 3 to 3½ per cent over the banks.  For reasons far beyond the control of anybody in this country or for that matter in most individual countries, interest rates have risen by 4 per cent and more in many cases over the last 12 months.  If the bank rate in Ireland had not risen by an equivalent amount there would have been a massive out-flow of funds from this country.  That is an absolute reality from which nobody can escape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt the Opposition would be only too glad to try to plead that the present difficulties of funds in the building societies are attributable to the Government.  The truth is, of course, that they are due to international factors far beyond our control but they are factors which are being rectified and very significantly have been rectified by the action taken by the Central Bank last month. This action I notice was criticised by Deputy Haughey last month and again today.  He apparently thinks that it is wrong that action should be taken which would cause money to go into the building societies; he would prefer our banks to act in an undisciplined way without any guidance from the Central Bank so that money could be freely available for speculators. That is not in accordance with the Government's policy and the Central Bank in what it did last month was faithfully reflecting the views which I expressed in this year's budget about the use of credit.  It is worthwhile recalling that when I recommended people to be prudent in the use of credit and when I said that it was necessary to ensure that credit be used for productive purposes and not for the purpose of speculation, Deputy Haughey sneered at my comments. He said they befitted the editor of some small country newspaper.  I <Col N="871" /> regarded that as the highest commendation. I did not regard it as an insult.  Deputy Haughey apparently thought it was.  Sometimes from rural Ireland you get words of wisdom which Deputy Haughey might reflect upon.</P>
    <P>It is now probable that funds will start flowing into building societies but I want to deal with a particular issue that was raised here, namely, the request that building societies would be exempt from income tax.  I want to say with the clearest words possible that building societies are not liable to income tax in respect of the moneys which they receive from people who invest money with them. They are agents for the people who deposit money with them and because they are agents for the people who deposit money with them the depositors with building societies pay only 70 per cent of the income tax which they otherwise would pay on those deposits if they deposited them elsewhere.  That is very important to remember because when building societies and others on their behalf are clamouring for the abolition of income tax on building societies what they are asking for is abolition of income tax liability on people who put money with building societies.  The effect of that would be to give the biggest exemption, the biggest profitability, to the richest people.  Those who placed more money with building societies would get the highest exemption.  I do not think that would be in accord with our objective to produce an equitable system of taxation which would be related to the capacity of people to pay.</P>
    <P>Building societies are also exempt from corporation profits tax on their annual surplus since 1920.  That is another and very significant advantage to building societies.  They get interest free of income tax in the hands of shareholders and depositors.  The composite rate of income tax payable by societies in respect of interest paid to their investors is only 70 per cent of what should be the standard rate. Although this in theory applies only on investments up to £15,000&mdash;and it <Col N="872" /> would be quite a comfortable person who would invest £15,000 and by so doing get this concessionary rate of income tax&mdash;in fact, a large number of people and institutions deposit sums far in excess of £15,000 and enjoy from building societies a similar reduction in their income tax liability. The effect of that is a saving in interest of 1.7 per cent to the building societies and it lowers the charge to borrowers by 1½ per cent.  For the purpose of surtax assessment, interest paid to shareholders and depositors is based on the tax-free amounts received by investors and not, as in other cases, on the gross amount including income tax.  For example, an interest payment of £65 free of tax would normally be treated for surtax purposes as the equivalent of £100 but if paid by a building society it is treated as only £65.</P>
    <P>In addition to that&mdash;and these are very substantial reliefs given to building societies, to the investors in and the borrowers from them&mdash;they are also getting an unprecedented direct Government subsidy of 1¼ per cent which enables the societies to pay an additional 1 per cent to their shareholders. Borrowers from building societies today are borrowing at 11¼ per cent and if it were not for this Government subsidy it would be 12½ per cent, a figure which would still be well below the rate at which anybody can borrow money for any purpose from anybody else in this or in almost any other country at the present time.</P>
    <P>So that when certain people are clamouring about the very high rate of interest on loans from building societies they should recall that they are paying the lowest rate of interest for any purpose.  I am not saying that it is not a burden on them.  I am not saying that it should not be less.  I wish it were less.  But the realities must be faced and there is no way of getting money in this world of ours other than by paying the going rate for it or else by printing it and this Government are certainly not going to print it.</P>
    <P>Also last year we obtained for the building societies a special borrowing <Col N="873" /> of £6 million from the associated banks and that borrowing is at a preferential rate and the State is taking up the difference in cost of it.</P>
    <P>I am saying these things because there has been a great deal of propaganda and confusion in relation to the building societies and a great deal of emotive comment which is unhelpful and is, I am sorry to say, being voiced by people who have scant regard for the welfare of the many homeless people who are seeking to get homes of their own, who are willing to pay a fair price for the money if the money were available. To those who have been endeavouring to persuade people to withhold repayments of interest and principal from building societies I should like to say this: borrowers are not entitled under the law to any set-off against income tax liability unless and until they pay the interest on their mortgage loans. So, if people are foolish enough to withhold repayments from building societies they do it at their own peril because the income tax concession cannot be given to them unless and until the interest on the money is paid.</P>
    <P>Somewhat outside the scope of this debate, a number of Deputies opposite spoke about the rate of inflation at the present time and suggested that this Finance Bill, of all things, should have provided the all-time cure for inflation.  No Finance Bill could provide a cure for inflation, in particular the kind of inflation we have at present.</P>
    <P>The interesting aspect of this year's debate is that while we were told that there was no cure for inflation in this year's Finance Bill, most of the Deputies did not at least have the temerity to suggest that we should promote inflation by increasing prices, although a few of them did and, indeed, Deputy Flanagan joined in suggesting that what are called the old reliables, cigarettes, whiskey and tobacco&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;might have had additional taxation attached to them. If this year's budget had increased the <Col N="874" /> prices of these commodities, the Members opposite would have been saying what they said last year, that we were adding fuel to the fires of inflation by increasing the prices of such commodities.  That was said last year and I am prepared to admit, said with some truth, because when any commodities are increased in price, even by taxation, they come into the Consumer Price Index.  If the index had been increased as a result of indirect taxation imposed by this year's budget, it would have been doubly inflationary because it would in itself have increased the consumer price index and by virtue of the national wage agreement there would have been a further injection of inflation later in the year when compensatory amounts would have to be paid in pay packets in respect of such increases. It would appear that the people opposite do not really understand sufficient about inflation or the consumer price index, or they would not have been arguing as they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is learning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the 16.2 per cent inflation which we, unfortunately, had over the past 12 months, over 8 per cent came from outside our shores. If we did not have to import inflation over the past 12 months and if taxation had not been imposed in last year's budget for the purpose of redistributing money from the better off to the less well off, the actual rate of inflation would have been only 6½ per cent, which on the performance of the world at present would be a very small percentage indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to a point which I think we as a community will have to consider very seriously.  It is : is it right that taxation which is imposed for the purpose of transferring wealth from the better off to the less well off should be taken into account in the consumer price index and as a consequence, taken into account in calculating further increases in wages based on the consumer price index? To do that is, in fact, to compensate <Col N="875" /> the wealthy for money taken from the wealthy for redistribution to the poor and only leaves the poor poorer at the end of the day.  A number of other countries have seen the fallacy of so doing and now eliminate from the calculation of the base for future wage increases any taxation which is in the nature of a redistribution of wealth from the better off to the less well off.  If we are to do something to stop the merry-go-round under which the better off do better and the less well off do worse, we will have to reflect seriously upon that consideration. I trust that we would be able to do it objectively and irrespective of partisan advantage we might seek to gain from the argument.  It is a very pertinent matter which we will have to take very seriously in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I hope I have addressed myself to the main points raised in the course of the debate and if I have not, I feel certain that we will get an opportunity in the course of Committee Stage to tease them out in greater detail, but I would like to finish with another fact.  There were complaints about the cost of energy, and particularly of petrol, and I said that petrol in Ireland was the cheapest in Europe.  A number of Members opposite laughed and sniggered at that.  I do not know whether they really disbelieved it or were merely trying to pass the time, but the following are the prices of petrol, premium petrol, per gallon in Europe today: Italy, 90p; Portugal, 85p; Belgium, 73p; Spain, 70 to 72p varying by region; Germany, 71p; Denmark, 70p; France, 68 to 70p, also varying by region; Switzerland, 62p; Netherlands, 60p; Britain, 65p; and poor little Ireland, sniggered at by the Opposition, 50.8p.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a clear indication of the grasp which the Government have on prices and of the refusal of the Government to add to the burdens of people by unnecessarily increasing taxation.  It is clear evidence that we have things under control. <Col N="876" /> It is only one case, but it is a very useful case at a time when the rest of Europe are paying prices 50 per cent and almost 100 per cent dearer than here, that we have kept the price of petrol here to the lowest in all Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to it again.  You were accusing the Government of inflating prices and I have shown that in relation to what is regarded as a critical commodity which many of you waxed indignant, we have the lowest price in Europe and you are embarrassed to discover it at the end of the day.  The wage structure here is higher than in several of the countries I have quoted.</P>

You wanted to hurry on inflation so that it would burst through the 20 barrier and I only wish that we had television here so that people could have seen the evil glee on your faces as you hoped that unfortunate situation might descend upon us.  I am not saying it will not, because when we are importing inflation at a rate greater than you had to deal with and importing inflation which accounts for more than 50 per cent of the inflation we have, it is no wonder we are in these difficulties.  We are now at the average of inflation rates in the OECD countries.  You had us at the top of the league of OECD countries for about seven years but we are now well down, and that is a <Col N="877" /> fair indication that this Government &mdash;with an economy which is now more open than you had, because we are increasing our trade both ways, which leaves us, as it were more vulnerable &mdash;are helping to keep the level of inflation here below what the pressure from elsewhere might otherwise generate.  That is clear evidence of the Government's success which you do not like, and there is nothing in the Finance Bill, good, bad or indifferent which adds in the least to the pressure of inflation.  It has had quite the reverse affect and that is your great disappointment.</P>

In the event of this tax, God forbid, being imposed on farmers who will make the valuations of farmers' incomes or of stock on land or of farmers' chattels?  Who is in a position to make that valuation or who is to be appointed to do so?</P>

      <P>Deputy Denis Gallagher has given me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 19 on the Order Paper of 3rd July last&mdash;to ask the Minister for Education the plans his Department have for post-primary education in Achill, County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé buíoch díot féin agus don Aire deis a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a lua anseo.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to you for giving me an opportunity to raise this matter, which is of great urgency and, indeed, great concern to the people of Achill and a large catchment area where two schools, a vocational school and a secondary school are in operation at the moment.  It is necessary to give a résumé of the situation with regard to the development of secondary and vocational education in this area since 1948.  The manager of the secondary school, who was a past pupil of Scoil Eanna, after 16 years as a secondary teacher in another part of the country, came back to Achill in 1948 and tried to establish a secondary school for the benefit of the people of the area.</P>
      <P>He was successful.  Indeed, all credit is due to the man because at that time he was afforded very little help from the State and from the then Archbishop of Tuam who was at the time opposed to co-education.  However, the man in question, Mr. Sweeney, did a tremendous job.  He managed to bring secondary education to the people of Achill for the first time.  The position in that area at the time was that we had a high rate of emigration, when people emigrated at a very early age.  Then, because they were encouraged and were in a position to receive higher education very cheaply and at their own doorstep they were glad to take advantage of this opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first school, if one might call it <Col N="883" /> a school, which Mr. Sweeney had was in a disused railway store.  As a result of local help, help from emigrants and a very generous grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta he succeeded in having a new premises set up and built a new secondary school.  As I have stated, this school did tremendous work for the parish and the surrounding areas. There are many brilliant pupils of Mr. Sweeney who have got employment throughout the country.  You have priests, people in professions and other employment throughout the country and this is entirely due to his work.  Seven members of my own family attended this school.  I am in a position to judge Mr. Sweeney's work and I am delighted to be able to pay a tribute to him here.</P>
    <P>At the same time as this expansion took place we had a vocational school in the parish.  It was built in the early 1930s and was up to the end of the 1940s more or less a white elephant because it was used just for night classes.  When people saw the secondary school making such progress they asked why the vocational school which was lying idle was not used.  The vocational education committee, at the request of the parents, was staffed and it began to do its job.  We then had a position in the 1970s where the vocational school and the secondary school worked side by side in the interests of the people of Achill.</P>
    <P>A position then arose where the existing vocational school, because of free education and so on, was not suitable to cater for the number of pupils attending.  At this stage the Mayo Vocational Education Committee decided it was necessary to build a new vocational school and a decision to this effect was taken by them.  At the request of Mr. Sweeney, the principal of the secondary school, a site was purchased adjacent to the secondary school where the new vocational school could be erected, the idea being that if the two schools were side by side it would be possible to have rationalisation of teachers and transport and it would also be possible for the pupils to avail of a greater range of subjects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> The vocational education committee bought this site in 1968 and plans were drawn up for the building of the new vocational school.  Before plans were completed a new concept was introduced when the Department of Education began to talk about having a community school built.  With this in view for Achill the Department met the people from the vocational school, the vocational education committee and Mr. Sweeney in March, 1972.  No progress was made as a result of the Department's visit to Achill.  Apparently the principal of the secondary school was not prepared at that stage to accept the terms which were offered by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In early 1973, the end of January or early February, the Minister for Education, while in Mayo, met the vocational education committee and discussed the Achill situation as well as the whole situation with regard to vocational education in the county. Public representatives, who were not members of the vocational education committee, were invited to attend this particular meeting with the Minister.  As one of the people present on that occasion, I was certainly under the impression that the Minister had made up his mind that he was going to take some positive action with regard to setting up a community school in Achill.  He gave a date to the committee&mdash;I think it was 7th February or 15th February&mdash;on which he said they would hear from him and that he would certainly take positive action.</P>
    <P>The next news we got from the Department was on 23rd March.  The Minister, through his Department, decided that the vocational committee were being authorised to build a new vocational school at Achill Sound, but that the vocational school would have permission to have the junior cycle and the secondary school would have the senior cycle.  This was objected to, of course, by the vocational committee and, to my mind, rightly so.  The numbers were increasing in the vocational school and for the past three years they had been running a senior cycle and were quite successful. <Col N="885" /> This year they had 14 pupils sitting for the leaving certificate and it is envisaged that next year they will have 20, given permission to do so.</P>
    <P>The experience is that pupils will not transfer from a vocational school to a secondary school.  We have an example of this in Charlestown where, in the past number of years, 75 pupils sat for the intermediate certificate in Charlestown vocational school and only four of the 75 have gone across to do their leaving certificate in the secondary school.  That figure speaks for itself.  We believe that the same pupils will not transfer from the vocational school to the secondary school.</P>
    <P>This decision is certainly a downgrading of the vocational school.  As I have said, they have been doing quite well.  The fact that their numbers are increasing is an indication that the people in the locality are satisfied with their work.  This decision would certainly mean a downgrading of the vocational school.  The parents who asked to meet the Minister in connection with this are greatly annoyed that he has not met them on the issue, and that he has taken this decision without any consultation whatever with the parents.  That is rather high-handed and unfair.  The parents requested him to meet them on a few occasions and he has refused to meet them.</P>
    <P>They found it necessary last October to take strike action because of the conditions prevailing in the existing school.  I have a copy of the letter which was sent to the Minister on 30th October, 1973, which gives a detailed account of the conditions in the vocational school and the conditions in which the teachers and the pupils have to work.  One paragraph states that the most serious aspect of the whole school is the fact that there are only two toilets for 160 pupils.  That is for the whole school, for teachers and pupils.  People are very patient to put up with this kind of treatment in this day and age.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the matter which prompted me to put down a question to the Minister.  His reply was anything but satisfactory.  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> Discussions are still proceeding with the authorities concerned in regard to the appropriate provision to be made at both junior and senior cycle level for the pupils of the area.  A final decision has not, so far been reached in the matter.</P>
    <P>In other words, we are at a stage where there is no progress, where nothing is being done.  It appears to me that, if one side decides to object, the whole matter will be left in abeyance. A precedent is being established here not only for Achill but for the whole country.  There is a similar situation in Belmullet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Dá bhrí, sin d'iarfainn ar an Aire a dhícheall a dhéanamh go mbeadh toradh éigin ar a chuid oibre agus go mbeadh dearbhú éigin ag na tuismitheoirí agus ag na páistí go gcuirfear scoil ar bun in Acaill, scoil a bhéas sásúil agus tá súil againn nach beidh muid a fanacht ró-fhada leis an scoil sin.  Má chuimhníonn an príomhoide, an tUasal MacSuibhne, ar an bprionsabal a bhí ina cheann nuair a tháinig sé ar ais agus nuair a bhunaigh sé scoil in Achaill agus má choinníonn sé leis an bprionsabal sin glacfaidh sé anois gur scoil chuimsitheach an scoil is fearr agus an rud ceart le cur ar bun in Acaill.

    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by the Deputy in the last part of his contribution where he asked Mr. Sweeney, the principal of Scoil Damhnait, to remember his thoughts on coming back there in 1948 and to have what the Deputy called a comprehensive <Col N="887" /> school in Achill.  The first thing that needs to be said here is that the Achill community have at present a total of 289 second level pupils divided between the two secondary schools in the area, one a lay secondary school, Scoil Damhnait, and the other a secondary school managed by the County Mayo VEC.</P>
      <P>A survey of the enrolments in the primary school would indicate that the number of pupils requiring secondary education will fall rather than increase in the next five or six years.  Therefore, the obvious future development should be on the basis of a single school, if that is at all possible, in order to secure and ensure that the pupils will have available to them the widest possible range of subjects and best possible facilities to cater adequately for their varying aptitudes and interests.</P>
      <P>It was for these reasons, and also because Achill vocational school is in need of replacement, that my Department proposed in May, 1972 that the second level educational requirements of the area would be best served by the creation of a community school. The County Mayo Vocational Education Committee agreed in principle to this proposal, but the owner of the lay secondary school would agree to a community school only on terms which would be unacceptable to the Department of Education.  In the light of these circumstances my Department decided to authorise the vocational education committee to proceed to plan for a junior cycle vocational school.  This plan envisaged the provision of senior cycle classes for all pupils in the area at the lay secondary school, and it was hoped that in such a situation there would be close co-operation between the two schools and that facilities would be shared where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal was, however, unacceptable to the vocational education committee, who rejected it at their meeting on 9th April, 1974.  The vocational education committee expressed resentment at the fact that their school was now to lose its senior cycle classes in favour of a school which has at present a smaller enrolment.  They were in touch with the principal of the <Col N="888" /> lay school and invited him to meet representatives of the VEC in order to discuss co-operation between the two schools, but in a recent letter to my Department the VEC have stated that the aspired-for co-operation has not been forthcoming, if I may put it that way.  My Department has fully explained to the Mayo VEC its views on the future educational development of the area and its desire to ensure that adequate provision is made without having a wasteful expenditure of public funds on a type of provision which would not be educationally adequate.  The VEC is endeavouring, as I have mentioned already, to negotiate with the lay secondary school to provide an agreed plan, and my Department is hopefully awaiting the outcome of the discussions.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the demands of school building on financial resources are so great that it is necessary to ensure that the provision of new school places in any area is adequate but not excessive.  Deputy Gallagher mentioned my visit to the VEC in Mayo where I explained that the requirements of the vocational education scheme in Mayo would take up the total annual provision for vocational education available to me by votes of this House.  He will, therefore, realise, on reflection, that if one of 38 schemes will eat up practically all the resources available to me, I must be careful not to duplicate facilities if I can avoid it.  In the case of Achill it is estimated that a potential number of pupils requiring second level education will not exceed 330 at the maximum, and I do not consider that two separate schools could, each by itself, provide an adequate curriculum for the pupils.</P>
    <P>My primary aim must be to ensure that the best possible educational opportunities are available to the pupils, and I honestly feel that this can best be achieved by the creation of a community school in Achill.  It is, accordingly, my earnest wish that the two local authorities will see their way towards jointly agreeing on this development on a basis acceptable to my Department.  If the community school is not acceptable to the authorities <Col N="889" /> there, then I would plead with them to come together and by the provision of a junior cycle in one, with co-operation between that school and the other, to make available the best possible facilities for all the pupils in the area.</P>
    <P>If the VEC were given permission to provide a senior cycle, it would mean building for at least four senior classes.  Achill would then have two separate senior cycles for about 90 senior pupils at a total of about 400 school places, for a total enrolment that will exceed only by a small amount 300 in the foreseeable future. My aim, therefore, is not in any sense to downgrade the people of Achill but simply to take cognisance of the realities of the situation as I find them.</P>
    <P>If some reasonable co-operative proposal can come from the people of Achill&mdash;parents, VEC, teachers, the lay management of Scoil Damhnait&mdash; I shall do my best to meet them.  But I want to assure the House that I shall not be persuaded into the expenditure of unnecessary money for facilities <Col N="890" /> which will provide too many school places for the area.  I am anxious to meet the people in reasonable proposals.  I am not prepared to waste the money of this House on unnecessary and unreasonable proposals.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  This is a larger catchment area than Achill.  It takes in Ballycroy and Mulrany.  I submit that with a suitable community school it would be possible to have a much larger enrolment than there is at present in the vocational and secondary schools.</P>
