      <P>Before proceeding with Questions, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that Standing Orders provide that Questions on a Thursday should conclude at 3.30 p.m.  In view of the changed times of sitting today perhaps the House will agree to an hour for Questions, if necessary, and that the other times specifically mentioned in Standing Orders as relating to a Thursday sitting should also be changed to correspond with those for a Tuesday or Wednesday sitting.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has yet received the report of the independent committee set up to examine the problems of thalidomide children; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) (for the Minister for Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> I have received the report of the Irish Thalidomide Medical Board and have recently issued the appropriate parts of it.  I have accepted in principle the recommendations of the board and I am considering how best these recommendations can be implemented. The Government are considering the question of augmenting the German compensation and I hope to make an announcement on this at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that notification has been received by the parents to the effect that the offer is conditional on their foregoing any claim which they might have against the German company as is implied in the letter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is factually correct.  A letter was sent asking whether proceedings were to go ahead against the German company. To interpret that as saying it was conditional would be misinterpreting the letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that this will not inhibit the parents pursuing their legal action against the German company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health has requested the parents' association to state whether they intend to proceed with legal action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can they pursue legal action?  Will it affect any claim they may take against the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no suggestion in the letter that it would be conditional on withdrawing their claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will revise the conditions in respect of eligibility for medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory requirement for eligibility is that it would be an undue hardship on a person to arrange general practitioner services for himself and his dependants.  The determination of a <Col N="1195" /> particular applicant's eligibility is a function of the appropriate chief executive officer.  By agreement between the chief executive officers common guidelines were introduced last January when income levels were last revised.  These revisions by the chief executive officers normally take place annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that conditions for eligibility are unrealistic having regard to the cost of living at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply, this is a function for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health authority.  When common guidelines were adopted it was also decided that annual reviews of the realistic situation would take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware, although the Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries directed differently, that they are still picking up the warble fly certificates of small farmers in the Western Health Board to test whether they should get a health card?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that despite the fact that I had a question put to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who said he was unaware of this, the Minister for Health in reply to a similar question said he was aware of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware the question of eligibility is one for the CEO of each health board and for the boards themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister give a direction?  At the moment the figure for a man and wife is £20, which is unrealistic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been considering a national measles vaccination programme but have not yet taken a final decision on it.  The incidence of measles last year was relatively light and, while this may be a transient phenomenon, I would like to see some more up-to-date figures on this year's experience before deciding on a programme of vaccination.  There are also some practical issues involved in the organisation of a measles vaccination programme because of the relatively high incidence of complications from vaccination against this disease as against immunisation for some other diseases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Approval to the provision of a 40-bed welfare home at Newcastle, Galway, was given in 1973 and tenders for the project were received by the Western Health Board in March, 1974.  Tendering prices, however, were far in excess of the aproved cost plan for the project and also in excess of tender prices being received for some similar homes in other areas.  The scheme is at present being reviewed by the health board's professional advisers with a view to reducing the cost.  It is expected that the matter will be resolved very shortly and that work on the project will then commence.</P>

The last payment in respect of injury benefit was made on 30th May, 1974 and the claimant then became eligible for disability benefit.  I regret that there was at that stage some delay in transferring the claimant to disability benefit owing to the injury benefit claim papers being temporarily mislaid.

I am hoping that it will be possible to help the really needy to whom Deputy Tunney refers to meet the exorbitant demands which it appears are being served on them.

      <P>So far as merchandise trade is concerned, Irish exports to EEC countries, including the UK, increased by £162.7 million or 32.7 per cent between 1972 and 1973.  Imports increased by £235.6 million or 40.6 per cent.  Exports to EEC countries, excluding the UK, rose by £81.4 million or 78.4 per cent while imports rose by £85.6 million or 56 per cent indicating a significant increase in trade with Continental member countries.</P>
      <P>On the invisibles side of the account, Ireland benefited in 1973 from net receipts from EEC funds of approximately £31 million.  Furthermore, it is expected that tourist revenue from Continental Europe will have shown an appreciable increase.</P>
      <P>In addition to the movements on current account, EEC membership has contributed to the substantial capital inflows into this country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the growing international monetary and financial crisis arising from the deficit with the oil producing countries and of the flood of depreciating paper currency in the world, he will state why he considers that the role of gold in the monetary system should be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in the course of my reply on 28th May last to a previous question, there is general agreement in the international community that the role of gold in the international monetary system should be reduced.  This is the conclusion of the Committee of 20 on International Monetary Reform, which has just concluded an intensive study of monetary problems, including the gold problem.  That committee has had available to it the services of experts from the International Monetary Fund and from all the member countries of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supply of gold available for monetary use is variable and uncertain, depending on the level of world production and the demand for gold for industrial, commercial, hoarding and other purposes.  It is now accepted that this does not provide a firm basis for the creation or management of international liquidity in modern economies.  Instead, the Committee of 20, with whose report I fully agree in this respect, has opted for the adoption of the special drawing right &mdash;popularly known as the SDR&mdash;as the primary international reserve asset.  In this way the volume of <Col N="1209" /> liquidity can be brought under the control of the International Monetary Fund and can be regulated by that body in relation to international need and in the interest of the world community.</P>
    <P>What I have said relates to the longterm position of gold.  It does not mean that the substantial existing stocks of monetary gold cannot be drawn on to meet deficits resulting from the higher oil prices or other reasons.  This, however, is a complex question which is still under consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proportion of the official external reserves held in gold declined between 1969 and 1973 because of gold sales valued at £5.1 million in 1970 to the United States Treasury at the then official price of US $35 an ounce, an increase in the Irish subscription to the International Monetary Fund of £4.3 million paid in gold in the same year and because total reserves increased subsequently while the volume of gold holdings remained constant.  I may add that:</P>
      <P>(i)  the free market price of gold did not begin to rise significantly until the second quarter of 1972;</P>
      <P>(ii)  in official external reserves gold is valued at the official price, currently $42.22 per ounce.  The Central Bank's transactions in gold in 1970 were carried out in accordance with an agreement of March, 1968 between central banks to conduct gold transactions only among themselves at the official price;</P>

      <P>As was stated in reply to a question by the Deputy on 28th May, 1974, the general condition of the deer herd in the Phoenix Park is good.  The normal practice in the case of an injured deer is to observe the progress of the injury and to put down the deer if the injury becomes sufficiently serious.  As deer discard their antlers early in the summer, no action was considered necessary in regard to the animal which had objects entangled in its antlers; the objects did not cause pain or inconvenience to the animal.  By this time of the year the deer would have discarded both the antlers and the entanglements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The EEC egg marketing regulations provide that all eggs sold in retail shops must be graded for quality and weight by packing centres authorised to carry out this work.  Thus, producers, who are not authorised as packing centres may not sell their eggs to shops unless, of course, the shops are so authorised. An exemption from the regulations allows such producers to sell their eggs ungraded direct to consumers at farm gate, in a local public market or by door to door selling.</P>
      <P>The regulations were made in 1968 and were implemented here on this country's accession to the EEC.  The purpose of the regulations is to improve quality, thereby facilitating sale and to protect the consumer. These aims are achieved by fixing standards which relate to grading by quality and weight, packing, labelling, marking, etc.  In the negotiations leading to accession it was considered undesirable to seek exemption to allow sales by producers direct to shops as this would tend to defeat the purpose of the regulations.  Instead I am doing everything possible to allow producers, regardless of size, to sell their eggs in conformity with the regulations.  Indeed, many small producers, unable to avail of the exemption open to them, who live remote from packing centres or who wish to sell direct to shops are considered for authorisation even when their throughput is small.  The expense of becoming authorised as a packing centre is relatively insignificant. In addition, in many areas shops are being authorised as packing centres.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that allowing for normal cyclic fluctuations, EEC regulations are not significantly affecting egg production in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>You can sell your eggs to an ordinary shopkeeper if that shopkeeper agrees to become a packing and grading centre which involves him in extremely little expense.  No fewer than something like 650 such centres have already been agreed.</P>

      <P>I have a further note which might help the Deputy.  A preferential rate of grant for slurry tanks as compared with other agricultural buildings and structures would appear to be incompatible with the EEC action programme on the environment. This programme envisages that in principle the cost of environmental protection should be borne in full by the polluter and not through grants provided by the public purse.  We put on some pressure to get permission to include slurry tanks in this grant aid from the EEC and we secured this.</P>

      <P>I recently received a deputation from the Society of Teachers of Speech, Drama and Oral Communication in Ireland to whom I explained the position in relation to the requirements for admission to the register of secondary school teachers and for the award of the qualification of national school teachers.  A qualification in speech and drama only would not be sufficient for such purposes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Speech and drama are regarded as an integral part of language teaching and the syllabus for English and the rules and programmes make reference to such aspects of the teaching of languages as articulation, precision, coherency and powers of expression, exercises in debates and discussions, improvised drama, and so on.  The modern movement is towards the rationalisation of subjects rather than the fragmentation and in the light of this I am not persuaded that it is necessary at this stage to have this subject on the curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state that all these points related to speech education which he has mentioned in his reply can be covered adequately by the teacher of English, in the light of his own experience, when he has a largish class and is following a fairly exhaustive course?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that teachers can do and are doing this. To say otherwise would be to suggest that the teachers of Ireland are not carrying out the programme for secondary schools as outlined in the regulations for secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a ridiculous insinuation of course and the Minister knows it is ridiculous.  Would the Minister not agree, seeing that through the development of the media there is greater emphasis on oral expression, some help should be given to these teachers by way of a proper professional in the school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were to assume that speech and drama were to be regarded as an approved subject the teacher of such a subject would require to hold a qualification for recognition as a national teacher or for registration as a secondary teacher, and in order to be acceptable for registration the qualification would have to be obtained following a full-time three-year course at advanced level in a specialist college to which the minimum entrance standard would be the leaving certificate. The course would need to include subjects appropriate to teacher training including the history, philosophy <Col N="1225" /> and psychology of education, general and special teaching methods for secondary level, together with appropriate supervised teaching practice of about 100 hours.  So far as the Department are aware, there is no institution in this country offering such a course in speech and drama. Traditionally the registration council, in relation to the registration of teachers of specific subjects, accept only the advanced level qualification of a specialist training college in Britain and do not accept main level qualifications obtainable in that country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Mrs. M. Aherne, Housewife; Thomas Allen, Train Driver; Tom Butler, Businessman; Joseph Hogan, Industrial First Aid Officer; Mrs. E.

Mullins, Housewife; John O'Shaughnessy, Factory Worker; Michael Punch, Engineer; John Shannon, Businessman.</P>
    <P>(2)  The members were appointed on 30th April, 1974, with the exception of Mr. Joyce who was appointed on 27th May, 1974.</P>
    <P>(3)  The first meeting of the committee was held on 6th May, 1974.</P>
    <P>(4)  No member has served previously on a prison visiting committee.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the terms of the question, I would like to place on record that in appointing visiting committees to other prisons and institutions such as St. Patrick's I reappointed a substantial proportion of those former members whose terms of office had expired and who, of course, had been originally appointed by one of my predecessors.  There were special reasons why I considered that there ought to be an entirely new committee in Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regard it as satisfactory that there was no meeting of the visiting committee until the 6th May, which is more than four months after the beginning of the year, and would he take into account the fact that prisoners may have had complaints or other inquiries which they have a statutory right to bring before a visiting committee but which they were unable to do during that period of four and a quarter months?</P>

      <P>I hesitate to say that any prisoner was prejudiced by the absence of the old visiting committee for the period mentioned by the Deputy because the reason why I felt it necessary to appoint a totally new committee was the fact that the previous committee in a report to me showed such a basic misconception of their position as holding the ring, so to speak, on behalf of the prisoner that I was compelled to appoint a new committee.  It was something I wanted to give some considerable <Col N="1228" /> thought to in order to ensure that the same situation would not happen again in Limerick jail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Japan) Order, 1974</P>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid on the table of Dáil Éireann on the 31st day of May, 1974.</P>
    <P>Copies of the draft orders relating to the conventions with Japan and Pakistan for the avoidance of double taxation on income generally were laid before Dáil Éireann on 31st May, 1974.</P>
    <P>The conventions have been signed on behalf of the respective Governments. Subsequent to the signing of the conventions two White Papers setting out the terms of the conventions were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>In this country the law provides that an arrangement entered into with a foreign Government to afford relief from double taxation in respect of income tax, sur-tax, corporation profits tax and any taxes of a similar nature, shall have the force of law here if the Irish Government makes an order accordingly.  Prior to the making of such an order however a draft of the order must be laid before Dáil Éireann and a resolution passed approving it.</P>
    <P>Deputies will find the text of the conventions scheduled to the draft orders now before the House.  For the convenience of Deputies a separate memorandum has also been circulated with each draft order explaining the effect of the articles in each convention.</P>
    <P>The main object of conventions such as these is the avoidance of double taxation on income flowing from one country to a resident of the other country.  To this end their provisions secure that such income will be taxable in one only of the two countries, or that if it is taxable in both, the aggregate of tax payable will be appropriately reduced.</P>
    <P>The convention with Japan provides that as regards certain classes of income arising to a person resident in one country and not resident in the other double taxation is avoided by confining the right to tax to the country in which the person is resident. This treatment applies as <Col N="1231" /> respects trading profits not arising through a &ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo;, shipping and air transport profits, professional profits not attributable to a &ldquo;fixed base&rdquo;, pensions other than Government pensions and certain earnings and receipts of temporary residents, for example, teachers, researchers and apprentices.</P>
    <P>Where none of the exemptions referred to applies income arising in one country to a resident of the other will continue to be taxable in both.  The latter country will however relieve the double taxation by reducing the tax which would otherwise be payable to it in respect of the income by means of a &ldquo;credit system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>An important provision in the convention is that, where an Irish company pays a dividend to a Japanese company which has a stake of not less than 25 per cent in the Irish company, the Japanese Revenue will give credit against the Japanese liability for the Irish tax paid by the company on the profits out of which the dividend is paid.  In a case where the Irish company has been wholly or partly relieved from tax under the incentive measures designed to promote industrial development in Ireland, the credit given will be the amount of Irish tax which would have been payable if the Irish tax had been charged in full.  Thus full &ldquo;matching credit&rdquo; is provided on these investments by Japanese companies.  Interest and royalty payments arising in one country and payable to a resident of the other country may be taxed in the country of source up to a rate of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The convention will enter into force on the thirtieth day after exchange of instruments of ratification and have effect as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  in Ireland:</P>
    <P>(i)  as respects income tax (including sur-tax) for any year of assessment beginning on or after the 6th April of the calandar year in which the convention enters into force;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> (ii)  as respects corporation profits tax for any accounting period beginning on or after the 1st April of the calendar year in which the convention enters into force and for the unexpired portion of any accounting period current at that date.</P>
    <P>(b)  in Japan:</P>
    <P>as respects income for any taxable year beginning on or after the 1st January of the calendar year in which the convention enters into force.</P>
    <P>The convention with Pakistan will enter into force upon the exchange of instruments of ratification.  It will have effect in Ireland, as respects income tax (including sur-tax), for the year of assessment beginning on 6th April, 1968, and subsequent years of assessment and, as respects corporation profits tax, for any accounting period beginning on or after 1st April, 1968 and for the unexpired portion of any accounting period current at that date.  It will be effective in Pakistan as regards income tax and super-tax for any one year of assessment beginning on or after 1st July, 1968.</P>
    <P>Each of the conventions will continue in force indefinitely but may be terminated by either this country or the other partner country giving the appropriate notice of termination prescribed by the respective convention.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the conventions with Japan and Pakistan are broadly similar to those contained in the conventions which this country has concluded with other countries.  In this respect I might mention that conventions are at present in force with Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States of America and Zambia.  The main benefit which this country derives from the conclusion of such arrangements is the removal of a disincentive to the investment of foreign capital in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I recommend that Dáil Éireann approve these draft orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of course very important that we should have conlands <Col N="1233" /> ventions such as these with as many countries as possible with whom we do any substantial degree of trade.  It is particularly important that we should have them with countries from whom we can expect industrial investment.  I know from personal experience that the existence or non-existence of a convention on double taxation can be of vital importance in negotiations by the IDA to bring about investment in this country because the consequences of having a convention in force can in many cases make all the difference to the decision of the proposed promoting company whether or not it is economically feasible for them to invest in this country.  For that reason I welcome these two conventions and the motion before the House by the Minister at present.</P>
      <P>I had the pleasure in 1972 of bringing before this House motions in respect of similar conventions with Belgium, Italy and Luxembourg, thereby ensuring that we had such conventions in force with all the present EEC countries.  The Minister has indicated the countries with which we have such conventions.  I wonder if he could indicate, when replying, the countries with whom we are in negotiation for the establishment of further conventions and perhaps he could indicate to some degree the stage that such negotiations have reached and whether we are likely to have such conventions concluded quickly or in the longer term.  I know that the negotiations for these conventions can be very difficult and tedious and certainly can take a good deal of time.  I would particularly welcome information, if the Minister has it, of the position concerning a convention with Australia.</P>
      <P>In regard to the convention with Japan I should like to refer the Minister to Article 14, which appears to deal with a capital gains tax situation. In the light of that I should like to refer him to Article 2, paragraph 1, which says:</P>
      <P>The taxes which are the subject of this convention are:</P>
      <P>(a)  in Ireland:</P>
      <P>(i)  the income tax (including sur-tax) and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the corporation profits tax</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> I should like to know, since Article 2 seems to define the taxes which are the subject of the convention, how Article 14 can purport to deal with capital gains tax which does not appear to come under the heading either of income tax, including surtax, or corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>I presume the introduction of the corporation tax as distinct from the corporation profits tax will be covered under Article 2, which provides for the inclusion of taxes identical or substantially similar to those specifically dealt with in the convention, those introduced in addition to or in place of existing taxes.  It does appear from Article 14 that a capital gains tax here would be applied on a much narrower basis to a Japanese citizen than it would to an Irish citizen.  I am not sure if my interpretation is correct, but it would appear that that is so.  If it is so perhaps the Minister would confirm that it is so.  May I take it also that a similar narrow base would apply to an Irish citizen in Japan&mdash;in other words, that the Japanese resident in Ireland or the Irish resident in Japan would be taxed less and on an easier basis in regard to capital gains tax than would the native of the particular country?</P>
    <P>I should also like to know, if the proposed wealth tax, gift tax and inheritance tax are introduced, whether all or any of them will in any way be affected by the terms of this convention. On the face of it the answer would appear to be &ldquo;No&rdquo; because of the definition in Article 2, paragraph 1, that the taxes in question apply only in the case of Ireland to income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax but, in view of the term of Article 14, apparently bringing in the capital gains tax, I am not so sure these other taxes would not, in fact, be subject to the terms of this convention and I would be glad if the Minister would clarify that point.</P>
    <P>With regard to the convention with Pakistan, I would refer the Minister to Article 22, paragraph 5, which says: &ldquo;The term taxation as used in this Article means the taxes which are mentioned in Article 1&rdquo;.  The taxes mentioned in Article 1, so far <Col N="1235" /> as Ireland is concerned, are income tax, including surtax and corporation profits tax.  Therefore, looking at the convention with Pakistan on its face, and ignoring for the moment the terms of the convention with Japan, one would take it that capital gains tax, wealth tax, gift tax and inheritance tax would be excluded from the operation of this convention with Pakistan.  Is this, I wonder, correct? It is not clear to me, having regard to what appears to be happening in Article 14 of the Japanese convention, whether Article 1 in the convention with Pakistan means what it says.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know in relation to Article 22, which is the nondiscrimination Article and which sets out the particular Acts of the Oireachtas which are intended to operate as incentives and are specified here so that they will not be deemed to be in breach of the nondiscrimination Article 22, whether corporation profits tax on profits from trading within Shannon Airport are excluded from, if I may put it this way, the &ldquo;exclusion&rdquo; in Article 22 in the convention with Pakistan while, on the other hand, there is provision in the convention with Japan to cover that particular provision, which is the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1958. That is specifically dealt with in a letter exchange between the Irish and Japanese authorities and which, in effect, forms part of the convention with Japan.  Among the list of Irish statutes specifically dealt with there is, as I say, the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1958, but there is no reference to that in the convention with Pakistan and I would like the Minister to explain why that is so.  On the fact of it, it would appear that trading within Shannon Airport can benefit under the convention with Japan but not under the convention with Pakistan.  Perhaps the Minister would explain why that is so.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer the Minister to the explanatory memorandum in regard to the convention with <Col N="1236" /> Pakistan which says, in relation to Article 22: &ldquo;The following reliefs, however, are specifically excluded from the scope of this Article&rdquo;&mdash; this Article being the non-discrimination Article&mdash;&ldquo;the tax reliefs allowed by Ireland to Irish companies engaged in the mining of coal and certain nonbedded minerals&rdquo;.  There is no reference in the convention with Japan or, I think, in the explanatory memorandum to coal and I would like to know under what provision is the reference to coal brought in in the explanatory memorandum on the convention with Pakistan.  Could the Minister indicate also what relief is, in fact, available at present in respect of coal mining?</P>
    <P>Subject to clarification of the points I have raised, I welcome the concluding of these two conventions and I believe they will be to the advantage both of our trading relationships with Japan and Pakistan and also to the industrial development programme of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must compliment Deputy Colley on his detailed examination and analysis of these conventions.  He realises, I think, that there have been occasions in the past when these have not been so carefully scrutinised.  He has raised a number of matters in detail which, quite frankly, I would not be in a position to reply to immediately.  I will certainly have them examined and I will communicate with him later.  He will appreciate that these matters are very specifically and directly negotiated between the two countries and the Revenue Commissioners of the two countries.  They are very technical and on some of the specific points I would not be able to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole question as to whether or not there are other double taxation agreements in the pipeline I would hope that there are, but at present there are no negotiations sufficiently formal or advanced to anticipate what other country or countries might next be coming before the Dáil.  The Deputy mentioned Australia.  We have mentioned to the Australians the possibility and the desirability from <Col N="1237" /> our point of view of having such an agreement with them and we are hopeful that this will materialise.</P>
    <P>The forms of the conventions are basically as recommended by the OECD, subject to whatever specific amendments are thought desirable having regard to the tax laws of the individual countries.  As the Deputy will appreciate, all taxation is in a state of flux in all countries at all times, and double taxation agreements will relate only to such tax laws as are in operation at the time of the signing of the conventions.  That is why some of the potential taxes in Ireland have not been spelled out in these agreements. When the new capital taxation proposals are formalised in our legislation, negotiations will take place not only with Japan and Pakistan but with all of the countries which have double taxation agreements with us.</P>
    <P>If we look at these two documents themselves we see several differences which have been identified by Deputy Colley, which is an indication of how very directly connected with the tax regimes of all these countries all these conventions are.  It is not possible or, indeed, desirable, to draw up a convention now which would be forever binding in future.  We could not have a situation in which we were unable to amend our own domestic law because we were tied to conventions which had already taken place.  The practice is to have discussions with countries with whom Ireland already has double taxation agreements when amendments are made to our domestic law or to the law of the countries with whom we have conventions so that any matters of difficulty can be identified.  Of course, the reliefs can be retrospective if necessary so that the residents in the respective countries do not suffer by reason of any delay in the completion of the conventions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley mentioned the question of tax relief on coal mining.  The taxation relief which is referred to there is in respect of marginal mines. The Minister for Industry and Commerce may certify that a mine is in a situation which requires that it should be given relief from taxes in <Col N="1238" /> order that it would be kept operative. Off-hand I cannot think of any other tax relief on coal mining&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is existing law which enabled relief to be given in respect of coal mines.  The other relief is on similar lines to what already exists in relation to coal.  Why this should be written into the agreement with Pakistan I do not know.  I assume that this was some matter which was identified in the course of the negotiations and that our Pakistani colleagues decided that this matter should be specifically referred to.</P>
      <P>I will pursue the other points and I will communicate with Deputy Colley if he will be good enough to endorse the approval of these conventions now.</P>

      <P>The programme which is administered by the EEC is based on the realisation that the scale of research and development required to deal with many current problems is increasingly beyond the resources of single European countries and that these problems can best be dealt with by pooling the efforts of individual countries in joint research and development projects which transcend national boundaries.</P>
      <P>After an initial period of investigation and discussion by working groups, projects have been undertaken in several areas and Ireland is participating in seven of these projects.</P>
      <P>At a ministerial meeting on science and technology held in Brussels in November, 1971, which formally launched the programme, a resolution was supported indicating our willingness to participate in the particular project concerning the establishment of a European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts.</P>
      <P>This project has now reached the agreement stage and at a meeting held in Brussels on 11th October, 1973, the convention for which the approval of the House is now sought was signed, so signifying formally Ireland's participation in the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the project is to equip a European centre, which will be located in Bracknell near Reading in the United Kingdom, with a very large capacity computer which can be developed for the purpose of providing medium range weather forecasts, that is, forecasts covering five to ten days.  Studies have shown that substantial <Col N="1240" /> economic benefit would be derived from such forecasts.  This would apply particularly in the areas of agriculture, the construction industry, energy, transport and water supply.</P>
    <P>The main tasks of the centre can be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash; in the field of research and development it will be responsible for producing and constantly perfecting mathematical models for medium range weather forecasting.</P>
    <P>&mdash; operationally, it will regularly prepare medium range weather forecasts, using these mathematical models and will transmit these forecasts to the national meteorological offices, whose task will be to use them in the framework of their own forecasting services.</P>
    <P>&mdash; in the field of services, it will assist in the further training of research staff working on numerical weather forecasting in Europe and will make available to the national meterological offices which so desire, in addition to a data bank, certain computing capacities which they are at present lacking.</P>
    <P>An interim organisation has been set up pending the entry into force of the convention, which will follow its ratification by not less than two-thirds of the signatory States.  An initial setting-up phase estimated to last about three years will be followed by a transitional phase estimated to last two years during which the centre will be gradually geared up to full operational capacity.</P>
    <P>A copy of the convention establishing the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts has been laid before the House.  I recommend this convention to the House for approval.</P>
    <P>As I anticipate that Members will be anxious to know the cost immediately of this to Ireland, I may add that participation by Ireland in the meterological project will involve a charge on public funds of approximately £2,000 during the twoyear <Col N="1241" /> interim period; £5,000 per annum during the initial setting-up phase which is estimated to last three years; and £15,000 per annum during the transitional phase which is estimated to last two years; and thereafter about £20,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>I believe Dáil Éireann should approve of this convention for a number of reasons.  While I would naturally hope that one of the consequences of the establishment of this centre and its operations would be more accurate weather forecasting, I cannot say that I am entirely optimistic that that is what will eventuate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of data may be accumulated which will be of great interest to scientists and technologists but, whether we will get more accurate weather forecasts, remains to be seen.  However, it is quite clear that if we are ever to reach the stage of being able to have reasonably accurate weather forecasting more and more scientific research and international co-ordination is necessary.  Even if this venture does not produce more accurate weather forecasting it will be a step along the road to that goal, if that goal is attainable, a fact which I sometimes doubt.</P>
      <P>I am generally aware of considerable scientific progress in this field particularly in the United States of America but I am not aware that it has resulted in what would generally be accepted as reasonably accurate weather forecasting over any period longer than 24 hours except in areas where one can get an accurate weather forecast for a three-month period.  However, in those areas one does not need science and technology to know that.  Even if this centre does not achieve the goal of accurate weather forecasting it will be a step along that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of cost is important and the Minister anticipated that question when he added into his script the information which he gave, something which I appreciate.  Apart <Col N="1242" /> from the figures he gave is there any other contingent liability on foot of this convention either during the periods of time he indicated or thereafter beyond the normal growth in expenditure because of increased activity of this centre?  Does the Minister know whether it is proposed that this centre when fully established will be using either its own or other satellites for the purpose of improving the data available in regard to weather forecasting?  Has the Minister any information which would suggest the participation of Irish personnel in the headquarters of the centre to be established in Bracknell in Britain?</P>
    <P>I should like to know if there will be any Irish participation in the staff employed at the centre or whether there will be, as seems to be indicated in the convention, what in effect will be training courses for existing members of our meteorological service in the centre?  There is a reference in paragraph 3 of article 3 of the convention to the centre's computing capacity being made available only to public agencies of member states.  Has the Minister any information as to the extent of the computing capacity envisaged in the centre and the extent to which this country may avail itself of that computing capacity?  Can the Minister indicate if such facilities will be available to our meteorological service and if they will be of any immediate value or relief to this service?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether our service has computing capacity available to it and I would be surprised if it did not have some.  Is it expected that our service will have available to it computer capacity in the centre and thereby be in a position to improve substantially the information available to it and, consequently, the forecasts which it makes available to the public?</P>
    <P>I take it from what the Minister said that we signed this convention before 11th April, 1974.  Article 22 provides that the convention should be open for signature by the European States mentioned in the annex until 11th April, 1974 and I assume we signed the convention before that date.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate the progress <Col N="1243" /> that has been made, or is expected to be made shortly, in regard to ratification of the convention and the actual operation in full of the convention on foot of that ratification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Deputy's reservations about total confidence in the absolute ability of this project accurately to forecast weather in our very changeable climate.  No matter how much man comes to use computers and world-wide telecommunications there will be many of us who will still rely first hand upon our corns or the condition of our rheumatism to adjudicate what is likely to happen.  Often, by studying wild life, we can anticipate long before we hear anything on radio or television what the weather is likely to be in a matter of 24 or 48 hours or even for a longer period.</P>
      <P>It will be a long time before man with the aid of technology will be able to anticipate weather with that degree of miraculous forecasting that nature is able to display in some forms.  The ideal in the long run would be for man to be able to control weather and in my view that day may yet come.  When one considers the advances that have been made in the last 100 years where man has reached miracles of science and technology which at one time were considered only to be the conceptions of a mad man it is not improbable that in future years man will be able to effect control over weather and be able to discipline it in the same way as he has disciplined other forms of nature.</P>
      <P>Man's capacity to do that, however, will depend to a great degree upon the use of computers and world-wide telecommunications.  It is because weather does not recognise political and national boundaries that it is wise to join the most effective pool of scientific information in Europe.  The reason why the 19 countries involved in this project chose Bracknell, near Reading, was because they were satisfied that the most powerful computer in this field is there.  There is also a very widely connected system of world telecommunications as well as the largest staff of highly trained scientific people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> So far as Ireland is concerned it is fortunate for us that we are so near the centre.  This will leave it cheaper for us to have our own connections with the computer in Reading and we shall be able, more conveniently, to post staff temporarily to the installation there.  Also, we shall not have any language problem and the hire of lines for special access to the computer will cost a lot less than if the computer were located further away from us.  We have always had the very closest and happiest collaboration between the Irish and the British meteorological services so that on all grounds we were very pleased that Reading was chosen as the centre.</P>
    <P>Irish participation in the project will be the same as that of any other country and will most likely take the form of a secondment of staff from our meteorological office to the centre at Reading.  The cash contributions to which I referred in my opening statement are the contributions which Ireland will make towards the project. Of course, if we have people located there, they will not be merely contributing their services while there but will also have the advantage of working alongside some of the most highly skilled and experienced people in this sphere in Europe, all of which is bound to reflect great benefit to our own meteorological service.</P>
    <P>The convention was signed on 11th October, 1973.  I am not certain as to what progress has been made by other countries in the ratification of it but what happens here now is that we notify the authorities concerned that we have ratified the convention and whenever the necessary two-thirds of the countries will have ratified it, the project will come into operation but we are not awaiting the formal ratification in order to play our part.  We realise that other countries have the same legislative and administrative delays as we have, some more, some less, but this project is one which, obviously, will receive general approval and we are going ahead on that basis.</P>
    <P>There is no contingent liability that we know of other than the figures I have spelled out already.  In so far as <Col N="1245" /> staff from our meteorological office are concerned, any cost that might be involved for us in this way would be more than compensated for by the benefits that we shall receive from the project.  Overall, we should have a greater pool of information available to us on which to base our forecasts. Forecasts are made not merely on the basis of anticipation but on the basis of knowledge and past experience and the more experience we have of the behaviour of weather now over a wider area, or in the past over a similar or a wider area, the greater probability there is that our assessment of future movements of weather may be accurate.  All of this is bound to lead to greater efficiency.  If, for instance, the housewife can anticipate rain she will take the washing from the line before the rain starts.  Likewise, agriculturists, fishermen and others can make their arrangements in anticipation of the weather if they have information that is accurate.  We hope that that will be one of the consequences of this very significant and useful co-operation between the nations concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 9, to delete &ldquo;seven&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (2) of the Bill provides relief for persons commencing to carry out mining operations after April 6th, 1974, in respect of abortive exploration expenditure incurred within seven years prior to the commencement of mining operations.  During the debate on the Second Stage Deputy Colley suggested that exploration might go on for five to seven years, that appraisal might take another two years and development a further five years, giving a total of 14 years.  Therefore, the Deputy claimed that the seven-year period as provided in the Bill was too short. The Irish Mining Association of the Confederation of Irish Industries have suggested also that the seven-year period as provided in the Bill was too short.  The Irish Mining Association of the Confederation of Irish Industries have suggested also that the seven-year period is too short and they asked that the time limit be abolished but if this were not acceptable, they suggested that the period should be extended for a number of years at least.</P>
      <P>During Committee Stage Deputy Colley moved an amendment for the purpose of removing the limit altogether but following my undertaking to consider the matter and as a result of discussions I have had I consider that this amendment&mdash;which goes a long way to meeting the point put forward by Deputy Colley&mdash;is one which is worthwhile and will meet the difficulties which some people contemplated. Therefore, I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that in these amendments the Minister has made an effort to meet the points put <Col N="1247" /> forward.  However, I was disappointed to note that while he said he thought that ten years in substitution for the proposed seven was reasonable, he did not go on to explain why he thought so or why there should be a limit.  The more I have thought about this matter, the more convinced I have become that there should be no limit and it is for that reason that I tabled my amendment.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Minister of the discussion on this point which took place during Committee Stage.  At one stage he made the point that he wanted to ensure that people could not go around buying up holes in the ground, thereby being enabled to charge expenses against profits.  We disposed of that in the course of the discussions because the Minister agreed that this allowance was claimable only by people who had incurred the expenditure.  It seems to me that the granting of an allowance of this kind, when it is confined to the person who incurred the expenditure, cannot cost the Exchequer a penny unless the person or company concerned actually makes a profit. What we are dealing with here is an allowance in respect of development and exploration expenditure.  In fact, we are taking the various amendments of the Minister together.  We are also dealing with expenditure on abortive exploration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact, particularly in relation to abortive exploration, that the position is that a great deal of money can be spent on abortive exploration and on what is described in the Bill as development expenditure and exploration expenditure with no return at all.  As there is no return for a company or person concerned then they have suffered that expense but they cannot claim it as an item of relief against tax liability unless they make a profit.  Therefore no question of any cost to the Exchequer arises unless a company makes a profit, in which case it endeavours to set off the various items of expenditure against tax liability. The consequences of allowing it to be <Col N="1248" /> charged without limitation as to time would be that a company which is reasonably optimistic about making a strike and therefore making a profit, effectively could double its exploration activity because it would be liable to corporation tax at 50 per cent under the new regulations which are now coming in.  Consequently if it can set off this expenditure against the profit it makes it can afford to double its activity for the same expenditure. Whereas on the other hand if it is not successful the Exchequer will lose nothing.  There is no profit and therefore nothing against which these allowances can be claimed.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister has indicated that what he wants to do is to encourage future exploration and effectively he is enabling companies to double their exploration activity for the same amount of money without any cost to him unless they make a profit.  It seems to me on consideration that the Minister ought to agree that, while he is going some of the way here in substituting ten years for seven years, effectively there should not be a limitation in time having regard to the fact that these items can be claimed as relief against tax only by the persons or companies actually incurring the expenditure thereon.  There is not therefore a danger of its being used to avoid taxation liability by people who did not incur such expenditure at all.</P>
    <P>I would hope that on reconsideration of this matter the Minister would see the force of the argument I have been putting forward and consequently would find himself agreeable to accepting the amendment which is standing in my name and which we are not discussing at the moment.  If the Minister cannot see his way to do so I would hope he would explain precisely why he feels it necessary that there should be a time limit set, whether it be seven or ten years, and the ill-consequences which he sees stemming from there being no time limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being quite frank.  I would have difficulty in justifying the loss of revenue which might arise if the liberal attitude of Deputy <Col N="1249" /> Colley was to be translated into this legislation.  There would be a situation in which a company might have spent £100,000 on exploration, say, in Kerry in 1957.  The exploration might have proved abortive.  The company might not have engaged in any other activity in Ireland since then.  Twenty years after 1957 they might have a strike in some place like Donegal or Cavan.  The question arises of whether it would be justifiable to give that company the concession of setting off the abortive expenditure which occurred in the distant past and which had no connection whatever with the operation in Cavan.</P>
      <P>In fact, I do not think that the presence or absence of this concession will determine whether a company would engage in further exploration. It is only when there is a prospect of a strike that exploration will be made at all.  It is only when the exploration proves successful that this concession could cost money to the Exchequer. Having regard to the liberal allowances which we have already granted in this Bill to the mining industry this further concession should not be justified. Abortive expenditure has not at any time been available for set off against the profits of a successful mine.  Under the 1946 legislation relating to allowances for exploration and development, each mine was looked at separately.  Only the exploration in respect of that particular mine could be taken into account.  We are now going to allow exploration, including abortive exploration on mines other than the particular mine which will enjoy a profit, to be set off in future against profits.  We are going a long way towards meeting the argument that seven years was too short a period for setting off having regard to the fact that exploration took some time and that there had to be an evaluation in connection with the mine and so forth.  We have gone to ten years, which by any measure is a long and generous period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be argued that this is to be an incentive to future exploration and that we should not provide this benefit for any period before, say, April, 1974.  I take the view that there has been exploration in this country since <Col N="1250" /> 1967 in anticipation of the benefit of the tax concession available in the event of profits resulting and that it would be reasonable that such people should enjoy this very special concession of setting off abortive exploration expenditure.  We are taking 1967 as a starting point and in all future years ten years to set off abortive exploration expenditure.  This will mean that any company which starts in 1977 and onwards will have the full ten years period of abortive exploration available as a set off against profits.  Having regard to the other generous allowances which have been given, this is as much as could reasonably be expected in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 33, to delete &ldquo;on or after the 6th day of April, 1967, but&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, as has been pointed out, has a certain similarity to the one with which we have just dealt.  I acknowledge again that the Minister has gone some way to meet the case I made.  He pointed out that if there was no time limit, which is the effect of the amendment I am now moving, there could be a company making an expenditure of, say, £100,000 in one part of the country and say, in 20 years later having a strike in another part and able to set off the earlier expenditure against the later profits. This is true in theory.  In practice, as the Minister knows, it does not work like that.  A company which spent £100,000 on abortive exploration is most unlikely to come back 20 years later, having done nothing in the meantime, to start in another part of the country and be successful, although this is theoretically possible. It is also theoretically possible that the same thing could happen after an interval of ten years, as proposed by the Minister.  I do not know how he distinguishes between the undesirability of such a thing happening after 11 years and not after ten years.  As I pointed out, no question of cost to <Col N="1251" /> the Exchequer can arise unless the company concerned is successful.</P>
    <P>I have here some details of the costs of exploration.  When one takes them into account one can see why there is a case for doing what I am urging and thereby, as I tried to indicate earlier, effectively doubling the amount of exploration.  I understand that, based on world-wide experience, in any given 1,000 exploration tries, with an average expenditure of £12,000 per try, approximately 200 of these prospects will reach the drilling stage with less than 50 in the extensive drilling category.  Of those, ten will involve mineral discoveries requiring evaluation at a cost approaching £200,000 on average.  Of these, three will reach the development stage with expenditure in excess of £600,000 in each case.  Of these one prospect will become a viable profitable mine. For these reasons the costs of finding a mine is estimated in Canada at $32 million Canadian, and in Australia at $12½ million Australian.</P>
    <P>In this country, based on experience, approximately 2,300 prospecting licences were issued.  Exploration expenditure between 1966 and 1972 was about £14.8 million.  The number of mineral discoveries was 19.  All of these 19 mineral discoveries were the subject of extensive exploration activity with considerable expense, principally in the field of diamond drilling.  Eleven of those 19 prospects proved to be abortive during the drilling stage, with expenditure ranging from £700,000 in one case to £40,000 in another.  Of the remainder, eight reached the development stage.  At that stage two proved to be abortive. In the abortive cases the expenditures were, respectively, £1.2 million and £1.5 million.  At the moment we have five producing mines and the potential production in Navan.  Two of the existing five mines are regarded as marginal, Avoca and Gortdrum.  They may repay capital invested.  The other three have, in fact, repaid the capital costs and returned dividends to their investors.</P>
    <P>Navan, which is not an existing mine, is clearly a bonanza-type mine. <Col N="1252" /> More than £7 million have been expended on it in the continuing development stage and a further £32 million, which is likely to be increased, is estimated as the capital cost of the proposed production facilities there. That is a very exceptional situation.</P>
    <P>We started off with 2,300 exploration licences and a great deal of expenditure along the way.  Leaving aside Navan, which has not yet started, we end up with five existing mines, two of which are marginal.  In the light of these figures I suggest the Minister should accept that the vast majority of the total exploratory expenditures are abortive.  Under the provisions in the Bill they would not qualify for tax relief because the relief provided in the Bill is for existing mines, less than 10 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>If you consider this kind of expenditure and the results achieved, I would suggest that the Minister has nothing to lose by agreeing to this amendment which places no time limit on the period during which this kind of expenditure can be claimed. He has nothing to lose because, as I have indicated, unless it is successful there is no cost to the Exchequer.  If it is successful there is a cost to the Exchequer in setting off this expenditure, but the effect of allowing it to be done is to make exploration work on mines more attractive.  Indeed, it would double the attractiveness of it to a company if they are successful because to the extent that they can claim relief for expenditure it is a saving of tax at the rate of 50 per cent.  Of course, if a company do not succeed there is no cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister would be well advised to consider this very seriously as a method by which further development and further exploration can be induced to take place more quickly and more effectively without cost to the Exchequer, except on the basis of success.  Certainly, I think it is fair to say that the risk of loss to the Exchequer, if the Minister were to do this, would be as slim as the chance of finding a successful, viable mine for somebody <Col N="1253" /> starting from scratch to do so, and that it would be sound business for the Minister to accept this, thereby increasing the amount of exploration and the amount of investment in it beyond its present level.  It would encourage the full exploration of our mineral resources.  We are all agreed that it is almost certain that nothing like the full extent of our resources has been discovered.</P>

      <P>There may be successes. Success will occur irrespective of this proposal of Deputy Colley.  As far as can be calculated&mdash;after all, these calculations can be no better than information, and some of them are historically based&mdash;about £7½ million was spent on exploration prior to 1967.  In the event of success by one, or a number, or by all, it could cost £3¾ million to concede what Deputy Colley has been saying.  It would cost that amount in tax loss if this concession were to be given&mdash;if all the people concerned with exploration since 1967 were to make successful strikes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may say that on the balance of probability that will not occur.  When he and I went to school we were told there was no mineral wealth in Ireland but a considerable amount has been discovered since.  A great deal of the exploration that occurred prior to 1967 was, by modern standards, inefficient and certainly not as sensitive as current exploration.  Therefore, it is not at all improbable that we could yet discover something which would entitle the people making the explorations to get this not insignificant sum as far as the revenue is concerned.  If they are going ahead with these explorations, they will do so realising that a general scheme of concessions that we have is generous by international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> In relation to existing companies, I do not think we can overlook the fact that they have enjoyed a tax holiday during the past seven years.  It could be argued that because they have, they should not get any exploration set off from 1974.  I think there is a great deal in that argument.  However, I am by nature generous.  I am prepared to be generous to a degree even where I think it is not required to promote further exploration. Accepting that it takes 10 years or thereabouts, sometimes less, occasionally more, to bring a mine on stream, I think that in fairness the mining industry would appreciate that this is by no way of a bonanza and not a restriction.  Therefore, I find myself unable to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I thought the Minister was doing what he has done in this section as amended today because he was generous, I would be totally opposed to it.  That is no reason for a Minister for Finance to do anything. His approach should, of course, be based on whether it is good for the economy or not.  If it is good for the economy to do something he should do it.  If it is not, he should not do it. The whole basis of my argument to him was that it would be good for him, in the interests of the economy of this country, to concede the non-limitation which I have been urging in this amendment.  I think the Minister will agree it is ridiculous to suggest that one should take a figure like that which he mentioned&mdash;I think it was £3½ million &mdash; based on the assumption that every one of the exploration efforts would be successful in producing a viable mine.  I have already given him figures to show that of the approximately 2,300 prospecting licences issued, what emerged eventually were five mines two of which were marginal, plus Navan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest figures based on an assumption that all efforts at exploration would be successful is so far removed from reality that it is merely confusing the issue.  The issue involved in this amendment, and generally in our approach to this Bill, should be as far as possible based on <Col N="1255" /> known facts, on reliable calculations and on the principle of what is good for the economy and what is not.  I am rather perturbed when I hear the Minister put forward a figure of that kind based on a totally unrealistic assumption that all exploration efforts will be successful.</P>
    <P>It reminds me, unfortunately, of the figure that the Minister put forward here when we were dealing with the Bill on the last day, when he said repeatedly that the estimated yield to the Exchequer from existing mines was £125 million.  We have had to drag out of him today and out of his Parliamentary Secretary answering for him last week, that that is simply not true. We have been unable to get a correct figure from the Minister.  I would have preferred if the Minister had tried to confine himself to reasonable assumptions in his approach to this, if he had tried to confine himself to estimates of figures as accurate as they could be made and to the general principle as to what is good for the economy.  I am certain the approach the Minister is making on this occasion is misguided in the sense that he has been saying that exploration will go on anyway.  If he believes that to be true, he should not be giving allowances and concessions that he is proposing to give.  It is totally inconsistent of him to give them if he believes the efforts will go on at exploration whether they are given or not.  Indeed, he is totally unjustified from the point of view of the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>If the Minister's theory is correct these people, with no inducements at all, will go on exploring and discover all our mineral wealth.  If that is so, it does not seem to me that equity enters into this.  The Minister's approach should be based on what is good for the economy and he does not seem to have yet grasped the fact that a Minister for Finance on occasions can give concessions which can be costed sometimes by the Revenue Commissioners but concessions which can effectively produce a far greater <Col N="1256" /> return for the Exchequer and, therefore, for the citizens of this country if he approaches it in a businesslike way. Unfortunately, the Minister is not approaching this problem in a businesslike way, considering that he thinks that concessions are not necessary in order to bring about extra remuneration and that, on the other hand, he thinks there should be a ten-year limitation but cannot see the importance of being able to say: &ldquo;there is no limitation.  It is not going to cost me anything unless you are successful, and if you are successful, then, of course, while you get these concessions I am going to get a considerable yield for the Exchequer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I regret that the effectiveness of this approach seems to have escaped the Minister.  I have endeavoured to draw his attention to it, and if he cannot see his way to accepting it I have done my best and in due course I am sure the Minister will see the error of his ways.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 51, to delete &ldquo;all&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;seventy-five per cent&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall that I referred to this matter on the previous discussion on this Bill.  What I am endeavouring to achieve by this amendment is to provide that the allowance of exploration expenditure of section 4 will be available to a body <Col N="1257" /> corporate a subsidiary of which have incurred the expenditure concerned provided that the holding of the parent company was not less than 75 per cent in the subsidiary company, whereas the provision in the Bill is that it must be 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since I dealt with this matter on the last occasion I have made some further inquiries and it now appears to me that, in fact, even my own amendment is much too rigorous and that there are many examples of companies at the moment operating exploration activities in mining where there is a considerable diffusion of shareholding, although substantially mining companies are the parent companies. The Minister presumably is aware that very often mining companies themselves do not engage in exploration.  It is very seldom that they do; it is usually subsidiaries of the mining companies who do this. The whole structure of this industry is very high risk and, therefore, the requirement of high risk capital is such that one gets a sharing of the expenditure involved in exploration between different companies and different syndicates.  This is understandable. It is a question really of sharing the risks and, I suppose, consequently and ultimately sharing the profits if there are any.</P>
    <P>Since it is such a high risk expenditure business it is understandable that it should be a considerable diffusion of investment in the exploration companies, and the actual pattern of what is happening seems to conform to what one would expect when one considers the nature of this business.  I have a number of details of various exploratory ventures in this country and the make-up of investment in them and it would appear that, as I have said, that the amendment that I am proposing is too rigid, not to mention the provision in the Bill, and that there is a strong case for accepting as a minimum the 50.1 per cent shareholding as being sufficient for the purposes of the section we are dealing with here.  However, I am only entitled to advocate 75 per cent which is in my amendment.</P>
    <P>I would hope the Minister would <Col N="1258" /> find it possible to accept this amendment. He did not indicate, as far as I recall when I mentioned this matter before, that he anticipated any great dangers of tax avoidance by relaxing this figure, and I think I indicated to him that my understanding was that 75 per cent is what operates in Britain. Apparently it can be satisfactorily policed and controlled.  There is a strong case, I believe, for relaxing the 100 per cent requirement of the Bill if one is to gear this legislation in any way to the actual position as it operates on the ground, and I would hope the Minister would be anxious to do that as far as he could.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that is not mentioned in my amendment but that I want to put to the Minister. Whether he accepts this amendment or not, I think there is a great deal to be said in regard to the provision we are discussing here in subsection (2) of section 4, for the proposition that in the event of any State investment in mining as holding part of the equity, say, in exploration and so on, any State investment should be excluded totally from the consideration involved here, whether it is to be 100 per cent or 75 per cent.  State participation is certainly desirable, and if the State were participating in this it might be much clearer to the Minister what the actual structure of this business is and why it is that you would get sharing of the cost of exploration and I would hope that the participation of the State in a joint venture with mining companies, in the way of exploration, would come about and that the State participation would not operate&mdash;as it would under the Bill as it stands&mdash;to prevent the company, or companies, in the joint venture with the State from getting the benefit of the reliefs provided for in this Bill. Therefore, I am urging the Minister to accept the 75 per cent, I would urge this amendment.  Indeed, if he accepts the principle, he might think of going further.  But whether or not he accepts the 75 per cent, I would urge him to ensure that, in the event of State participation, the State equity or share should be excluded totally for the purpose of this provision in subsection (2).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We made it clear that we were not going to permit people to go round buying up holes in the ground to set off the cost of digging&mdash;the abortive digging, if you like &mdash; against the profits of successful mines in the future.  What Deputy Colley is suggesting here is that interests other than those who dug the hole should be able to buy a quarter of the hole and get the benefit of the tax concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not confined to the people who actually incur the expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  But, as I understand Deputy Colley, he is suggesting that as long as they do not dispose of more than a quarter interest to somebody else, they can enjoy the full benefit.  That would be selling a quarter of the hole, selling something that is impossible.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Bill allows exploration expenditure incurred by one company in a group of wholly-owned subsidiaries to be set off against mining profits earned by the parent company in that group.  That is a very significant concession and a new development in our mining code.  In such cases the exploration company may elect to have its exploration expenditure, whether successful or abortive, attributed to any other subsidiary in the group, or to the parent company, so that the exploration expenditure may be set off against mining profits wherever they arise within the wholly-owned group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the section in the Bill is to treat the wholly-owned group as if it were a single company, in which event, all its exploration expenditure would be set off against its profits.  The purpose of the amendment is to enable this treatment to be given to companies where one company holds only 75 per <Col N="1260" /> cent of the capital of another company. Any watering down of the 100 per cent principle would be contrary to the provision which, as I have indicated already is to put the wholly-owned group in precisely the same position as if it were one company.  Where there are outside interests to the extent of 25 per cent, it cannot be said that it is tantamount to one company since a 25 per cent holding in any company by an outside interest fragments the very unity which is essential if we are not to have tax avoidance.  Indeed, it is our intention that only the person who incurs the exploration expenditure is to get the allowance in respect of that expenditure.  There must be absolute adherence to this principle&mdash;that the wholly-owned group only will be treated as if it were a single company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to British law where a 75 per cent holding is sufficient to entitle groups of companies to relief in respect of losses sustained by and, indeed, capital allowances due to one of the companies in the group.  But the position is not quite the same as the one visualised in the Deputy's amendment.  In Britain there is relief available under existing law, to a particular company incurring expenditure or losses but which may not itself have sufficient profits to benefit from the relief.  But there is no provision, under the law, for abortive exploration either by individual companies or any companies within a group.  What we are doing now is making special provision to enable the abortive expenditure incurred by an individual company to be set off against its mining profits whenever it discovers a successful mine. While this relief is being provided as an incentive towards exploration, it is necessary to safeguard it by ensuring that abortive exploration expenditure incurred by other companies&mdash;even where there is a substantial relationship &mdash; should not be set off against the profits of the successful mine.</P>

      <P>If this were to be permitted there could be a significant loss of revenue from successful mines, the amount of which would depend <Col N="1261" /> upon the extent to which we gave relaxation from the 100 per cent principle which we feel convinced it is necessary to preserve.  We are giving this very substantial concession.  To open it in the way Deputy Colley has in mind, I think, would lead to the buying up of the impossible and, that is, shares in holes in the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is somewhat unfortunate that the Minister should approach this matter in the way he has done.  I have the greatest respect for the Revenue Commissioners, their staffs and the Department of Finance. But their job&mdash;particularly in the case of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;is to protect the revenue and, of necessity, that job produces a certain cast of mind.  That cast of mind was very clear in some of the things the Minister was saying which I know he was taking from his brief.  I have the greatest respect for the people who prepare that kind of brief but their job is one thing.  The Minister's job is another.  The Minister's job is to listen to what they have to say, to weigh it up, but also to apply to what is being said to him and the advice being tendered to him and the general knowledge that he has of the operation of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried to point out to the Minister something I think he is aware of already, that is, the general pattern of investment in exploration for minerals in this country, something that would be obvious if one thinks about it&mdash;because of the high risk involved &mdash; and something that is obvious if one examines what is actually happening on the ground. Companies, of necessity, share the cost of expenditure for exploration, so much of which is abortive, so much of which will never be recovered because a successful mine, yielding profits, does not ever emerge.  That being the pattern which one would expect in theory and which one finds in practice, it simply is not good enough for the Minister to describe that as having a share in a hole in the ground.  What we are talking about is expenditure on exploration and development of mineral resources in this country.  I have previously given some details of <Col N="1262" /> the kind of thing that has happened in this country, the amount of expenditure that has been involved, 2,300 prospecting licences and a relatively very small number of mines which have emerged.  Because the pattern is as it is&mdash;that people share the expenditure involved&mdash;the provision in the Bill that this relief is available only in the case of a subsidiary company, to a wholly-owned subsidiary only, is virtually useless as far as the mining industry is concerned for the reasons I have mentioned.  Industry is not built in that way and does not operate in that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a point regarding what happened in Britain when I cited that as an example of where they operated a 75 per cent provision as urged in this amendment.  With the greatest respect to the mentality behind that comment it is not a mentality that is geared to trying to make a tax system work in conformity with life as it is lived, in this case with mining exploration as it happens; it is concerned with a theoretical possibility.  The Minister ended by saying that we could not have people going around buying up fractions of holdings of land in order to achieve relief under these provisions. We dealt with this situation a long time ago.  The Minister has conceded that it is not possible under these provisions for people to get relief unless they actually incur the expenditure. If you had a 75 per cent provision as is urged in this it still would not be possible for them subsequently to buy up a 25 per cent interest in a company in order to get this relief.</P>
    <P>If that is what the Minister fears, I wonder has he examined how the British operate their provision.  It is true that they do not have precisely the kind of relief being offered here regarding abortive expenditure but the principle of policing this is one that arises in Britain in slightly different circumstances; the principle is the same.  They can manage it; I do not see why we could not.  It is unfortunate that the Minister's approach should be conditioned as it is and so far removed from what is actually happening on the ground and that he should think of it <Col N="1263" /> as buying up a share in a hole in the ground instead of thinking of it in terms of expenditure on exploration to find mineral wealth.  If he thinks of it in that way I suppose there is nothing I can do to disabuse him but it is regrettable that he does not find it possible to accept this very reasonable and very limited amendment.</P>
    <P>He did not refer to something I mentioned and I want to urge him again to consider it: it could be very important in the future.  It is that if there should be State participation in exploration activities, that amount of the equity should be totally excluded for the purpose of this section.  There will be a built-in inducement against the joint venture with the State unless that is done in this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall that on the Committee Stage I introduced an amendment and in the course of the discussion on it I asked the Minister some questions on it and told him I thought we were not <i>ad idem</i> but that I would look at the matter further.  I had not very much opportunity to see it then; I think it came in somewhat <Col N="1264" /> late.  When I looked at the matter further I found as I suspected that we were not <i>ad idem</i>.  It boils down to this: I have been informed by a number of people that they attended a meeting with the Minister on, I think, 11th January last and that the matter which, in effect, is the subject matter of this amendment was discussed: the question of when the application of tax under this Bill would operate.  I am told that at that meeting the Minister was asked three times about this and three times gave the same answer. That answer, as understood by his hearers, was that the tax would not be applied to profits earned prior to 6th April this year.  What the Minister is doing is applying tax from 6th April this year but he is in practice applying it to the profits earned in the year prior to that.  Whatever the effect of the amendment he brought in may be, that is the practical result.  Consequently, the amendment I have put down is designed to put the operation of this tax on to the subsequent year's profits.  I did it that way because any other approach seems to be extremely complicated in dealing with this section. Whatever one may argue &mdash; some people might allege retrospection and the Minister would certainly argue that there was no retrospection in this and I am not sure that I would disagree with him if he said that&mdash;I am concerned that if a number of people believe that the Minister conveyed one thing to them, some different provision should be made in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would say that is not what he told these people and was not what he intended to convey. If he says so I would certainly accept it but I would ask him to accept from me that, inadvertently or otherwise, that is what he did convey to them. At least, that is what they understood from what he said and I suppose it is accurate to say that is what he did convey to them in those circumstance. If that is so, I would ask the Minister very seriously to consider the implications of that and if he is satisfied that the people to whom he was talking <i>bona fide</i> understood this, to <Col N="1265" /> accept that he has an obligation, both personal and arising out of his office, to see that such persons are not left in the position that under this Bill what was conveyed to them by the Minister is not honoured.  I know the Minister would not wish to create that situation but I would ask him to consider seriously the implications of a situation where the people concerned believe he conveyed to them something different from what is in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there is a consequential effect of what I am proposing here and I touched on this on Committee Stage.  The Minister's amendment on Committee Stage provided for a right of election and I drew his attention to the fact that there was considerable difficulty there because that right was to operate before 1st August.  When this Bill goes through both Houses of the Oireachtas and is published and when it is in the hands of the people concerned, we will not be far away from 1st August.  I suggest that he should consider putting back the date until 1st October, thus giving people some chance to know what is in the Bill and to operate their right of election.  The substantial point I would urge on him is that profits earned from existing mines prior to 6th April, 1974, should not be subject to tax because he gave the impression to the people with whom he was dealing that that was what he intended to bring about in this Bill.  That is not what is in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say what naive or expert people took out of what I said.  I am satisfied in my own mind that I made it clear to any group I met that the Government's decision to end tax exemption with effect from 6th April, 1974, stood and that the tax charge would come into effect as and from that date, not before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Colley will appreciate &mdash; as I am sure the advisers to any of the people I met understood&mdash;that in calculating profits one uses as the basis of the measure of those profits the accounts of the previous year.  It was in order to remove any grounds for alleging or suspecting that there was any element of retrospection that I <Col N="1266" /> brought in the amendment on Committee Stage&mdash;it is now section 16&mdash;to give to companies the right of election, to choose instead of the previous year's profit as a measure the actual profits for the current year.</P>
    <P>That concession is being given, not in order that people may decide their liability to tax or whether their taxes should be higher or lower depending on whether they are making more or less profit this year than last year, but rather that they would have an opportunity to elect to pay on the amount of the profits of 1974-1975.  This would obviate the necessity to comply with what some people call accountancy practice, of writing into the accounts for the previous year the succeeding year's tax liability.  It was for that purpose that the concession was given. There is no element of retrospection, good, bad or indifferent in the Bill and I am satisfied that what I intended to convey to the people in question is being honoured in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley's amendment goes a great deal further.  He seeks to have a continuation of the tax-free holiday for yet another year so that liability would not arise until April, 1975.  I do not think that is justified.  It would be contrary to the clearly indicated decision of the Government, announced last autumn, which the mining industry has accepted as the operative date and is an argument against uncertainty in taxation.  There is an argument in favour of having finality.  If we were to postpone this matter for another year, we would only encourage people to argue for further change and relaxation; we would also have people protesting that the mines were not being charged early enough.  There has been enough public frustration over the tax holiday.  There has been some public disappointment that the allowances now being given will not bring in any income from the mines for a few years yet, but clearly there would be a great deal of public indignation if the holiday were extended for a further year so that we would have to wait longer to obtain any contribution towards the revenue of this country from mines being worked here, and from the wealth of this island which is being exported.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> I could not entertain any further delay in the commencement of this tax liability.  I am quite sincere when I say I am satisfied that, irrespective of whatever understanding people may say they took from what I said, there could not be any justification for this extension.  Certainly there could not be any justification on the part of those who understand tax laws, who understand that using the profits of a year as a measure for calculating the profits for assessment of the succeeding year is not in any way exposing the base year to a liability for tax. Of course, people may continue to argue that as a debating point but there is no reason why Parliament should be asked to make a concession of a year's tax exemption to an industry that, on all the evidence available and on the admission of both sides of this House, is well in a position to pay the liability we are asking them to undertake.  On that account I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>If the position were that the Minister had told these people he was not going to apply tax prior to 6th April, 1974, and that because they were unfamiliar with our taxation system they misunderstood him, then I would agree entirely with him that there would be no case for this House putting back the imposition of tax for one year.  However, that does not appear to me to be the case.  In fact, it was the first thing that occurred to me when I heard the arguments being made about this provision, namely, that there were involved in some meetings with the Minister people from outside this country who would not be familiar with our taxation system and could well make the mistake to which the Minister and I have referred.  It occurred to me immediately that that was the explanation for what had happened.  I inquired further and I found there were Irish people present who are expert in our tax laws and that they knew precisely what was involved in a statement made by the Minister.  I was further informed, as I indicated earlier, that at the meeting <Col N="1268" /> of the 11th January the Minister was asked three times, and confirmed three times, that profits earned prior to April this year would not be subject to tax.  It is for that reason that I urged the Minister to accept this because I am a very firm believer in the idea that if a Minister, and in particular a Minister for Finance, makes a commitment or conveys he is making a commitment to people who <i>bona fide</i> misunderstand him or if he <i>bona fide</i> makes a mistake himself in what he says to them, it is in the long term in the interests of the Exchequer that what he has conveyed should be honoured.  There is nothing more damaging to the economic prospects of this country than the suggestion getting abroad that a deal made with an Irish Government or any member of an Irish Government cannot be relied on.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that the Minister misled those people or that he is going back on his word. What I am suggesting is that he very clearly conveyed to those people that tax would not be applied to profits earned prior to 6th April of this year and that that being so, whether he intended to do it or not, it is a commitment which should be honoured.  I believe, on this side of the House, that whatever might be involved in it, taking the long-term view there is nothing more important to the economy of this country than the reputation of this country, the reputation of any Irish Government or any member of an Irish Government, that if he makes a commitment then it is honoured.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister heard what I said a moment ago but I will repeat it in case he did not.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the Minister misled those people or intends to do so.  What I am saying is that for whatever reason the impression conveyed to them was the one I have indicated.  Whether it was a mistake on their part or on the Minister's part it seems unfortunate to me, when this is <i>bona fide</i> the belief of the people who dealt with the Minister, that what was conveyed to them should not be embodied in legislation brought in by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> The Minister should be able to accept that in putting this case I am not in any way trying to impugn his integrity and that he could accept the argument without impugning his own integrity and that really whether people would be indignant, as he put it, at the extension of the tax free holiday for another year is really irrelevant taking the long-term view of this country's interests if, in fact, the Minister conveyed to those people, as he puts it now, that the tax holiday would be continued for another year.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, in fact, some people are indignant at the fact that various allowances and so on are being provided in this Bill and that we will not be taking enough from the mines. I think he is right.  I think many people do not realise just what is happening. The Minister on the last occasion estimated the tax yield at £125 million, total, over 20 years.  He conveyed it as being the estimate for what was coming from existing mines.  It now transpires, of course, that that was not what he meant, that he was including Tara in it. If that is so, from the information I have been able to glean as to the amount of tax that the Minister can expect under these provisions from existing mines then the tax he is expecting from Tara is far too small.  I am saying that because the Minister brought in the question of people's indignation or otherwise at the amount of tax being collected.</P>
    <P>I think people would be justified in feeling indignant at the relative smallness of tax to be obtained from Tara. Even if the acceptance of this amendment were to mean a reduction in receipts by the Exchequer, the point I am making to the Minister is that even if it were to mean that it is more important in the long term for the Exchequer that it should be known, particularly abroad, that if a commitment is given by an Irish Government or a member of it it will be honoured no matter what the consequences. If people <i>bona fide</i> believe that such a commitment was given it is virtually the same position.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister cannot see his way, as apparently he cannot, to accept these amendments.  I think it is <Col N="1270" /> important, if he did convey this, that it should be honoured and I, on this side of the House, would not want to tax him with a loss to the Exchequer for the reason I have indicated, that I think that whatever the reason for misunderstanding, the long-term interests of this country require that any undertaking or any understanding of an undertaking given by a member of an Irish Government should be honoured without question.  The Minister, unfortunately, does not seem to see it that way.  If he does not, I hope that in the course of time he will see how important this kind of stance and this kind of argument is.  It touches on matters that we dealt with earlier about the taking away of the statutory relief from existing companies. I do not think he has grasped the importance of the good name of this country to put it in simple terms. I am putting it in simple terms but it means much more than that.  He, unfortunately, has not grasped it and that is illustrated by his unwillingness to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>On the first defination of &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; the subsection gives the definition as the person who, in a reciprocating jurisdiction, has the function corresponding to that of the Master of the High Court under section 18 (3).  On the Second Stage the Minister several times in his speech and in his reply referred to the reciprocating authority in Britain as the Secretary of State.  He did not specify which Secretary of State.  Presumably it would be the Home Secretary, whose official title is the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, and presumably in relation to Northern Ireland it would be the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and in <Col N="1272" /> relation to Scotland it would be the Secretary of State for Scotland.  It strikes me that the functions of each of these three gentlemen are very different from the functions of the Master of our High Court and in no sense could they be stated to have a function corresponding to that of the Master of the High Court in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is, I understand, a Master of the English High Court and of the Northern Ireland Court.  Presumably there is some corresponding official in Scotland but I do not know what his title is.  Would it not seem logical, therefore, that the appropriate Masters of these courts should be the appropriate authority within the meaning of this definition rather than the three Secretaries of State, who are non-judicial figures?  They do not purport, presumably, to exercise any judicial or quasi-judicial functions as the Master of the High Court here would. In fact, the nearest equivalent here to the Home Secretary in Britain would be the Minister for Justice. Would the Minister, therefore, clear up what does on the face of it appear to be an anomaly if it is the intention to have the Secretary of State for Home Affairs as the appropriate authority in Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The confusion arises in that the functions are not the semi-judicial functions of the Master of the High Court under section 6 of this Bill but the very limited function of the Master under section 18 (3).  That function is specifically the sending out of the documents in question.  The &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; means the authority in the other jurisdiction who is the appropriate authority within that jurisdiction to send out the documents corresponding to those which will be sent out of this jurisdiction by the Master.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why the words &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; were used rather than naming the official or the person in the other jurisdiction is to cover the eventuality of the other jurisdiction, possibly, making a change in the person exercising this transmitting function.  We might, for example, <Col N="1273" /> say the Secretary of State.  There might be a change in Britain and certain functions might be transferred from that office to some other office. We would have unnecessarily limited ourselves if we were to name him here, so I think the general term &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; is the apt term to use.</P>
    <P>It is not intended to say that the appropriate authority in the other jurisdiction is a quasi-judicial person. He is not.  He is the person who exercises in the other jurisdiction the function of sending out documents and it is up to that jurisdiction to decide who that person is to be.  We have decided that the person to do it here is the Master of the High Court.</P>

      <P>Section 18 (3) refers to documents being sent by the registrar or clerk to the Master of the High Court.  It is the sending of documents to him.  The Minister referred to the functions of the Secretary of State as the appropriate authority as being simply the function of sending out documents and not in any way quasi-judicial.  Section 18 (3) (ii) envisages them being sent to the Master of the High Court who shall transmit them to the appropriate authority in that jurisdiction if it appears to him that the statement referred to in paragraph (b) (v) gives sufficient information to justify that being done. That is a quasi-judicial function.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that difficulties can arise here by virtue of the fact that the Master is envisaged in other sections as having a quasi-judicial function, particularly in section 6, and it may not be appreciated that the definition of proper authority is limited to the extent to which it apparently is.  If one puts the process into reverse who in Britain will exercise the functions to be exercised here by the Master of the High Court under section 6?</P>

      <P>If the Minister reads sections 6 and 7 together he will see there is an appeal in section 7; indeed, in the following section, section 8 there is a different type of appeal to the High Court from the decision of the Master.  Is there any appeal in the reciprocating jurisdiction to the High Court from the decision of the Secretary of State for Home Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say offhand if there is, but I presume there is.  Any decision which is illegal or any administrative act which is illegal can be the subject of an appeal.  What we have to do is to provide for what happens in our jurisdiction and we are providing within our jurisdiction that the Master of the High Court will be the person who will receive and transmit the documents to the appropriate District Court for enforcement. As the Deputy says, an appeal can be taken against the Master's enforcement order.  In Britain when orders from this jurisdiction under this particular piece of legislation are sought to be enforced, the maintenance debtor will have precisely the same rights as any other citizen in that jurisdiction.  We could <Col N="1275" /> not attempt in our jurisdiction to ensure that the rights of a person before the law of another jurisdiction should be on all fours with what we provide. Both jurisdictions are common law jurisdictions and the same basic legal principles apply so that exactly the same rights will accrue to a maintenance debtor in the other jurisdiction as obtain here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate&mdash;this is something he acknowledged on Second Stage&mdash;that 95 per cent, or more, of the applications and proceedings under this legislation and the corresponding reciprocating legislation in Britain will be from Ireland to Britain and there will be comparatively few cases of husbands or putative fathers deserting to Ireland from Britain.  It is important, therefore, that we should establish that Irish citizens, who will have to have resort to the procedures that will be open to them in Britain, will have rights that will be not less favourable than the corresponding rights British residents would have in making these applications here.  It is unusual, for example, for an appeal to lie to the High Court here against a decision of, say, the Minister for Justice and, since he is the nearest corresponding office holder here to the Secretary of State for Home Affairs in Britain, I would have thought that under the British jurisdiction an appeal in a matter of this kind would be normally provided for unless it was by way of a writ of <i>certiorari</i> or some similar writ to have the Secretary of State's decision set aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The position will be as follows: Mrs. X obtains here an order for maintenance against her husband who lives in England.  The merits of the case are decided in the court here and an order for maintenance is made in the court here and that is a final order as far as Mr. X is concerned unless he chooses to appeal it.  If he decides not to appeal it, it is a judgment like any other judgment and it is final and absolute. What is involved thereafter does not go to the merits of the order or to the merits of the procedures leading <Col N="1276" /> up to the order because it is now final and conclusive.  All that is involved thereafter are the mechanics of enforcing that order and this Bill provides for sending the order to the appropriate authority in the other jurisdiction.  The appropriate authority is, at the moment, the Secretary of State for Home Affairs.  All he does is pass the order to the appropriate court, the court having jurisdiction where Mr. X resides in England, and the order is then enforced in that court.  That court cannot inquire into the merits of the case.  The merits are purely a matter for this jurisdiction and they have been decided by the making of the maintenance order.</P>
      <P>The only grounds on which the court in Britain can refuse to implement an order of the Irish court will be set out in the British legislation, as amended by Order in Council, and are exactly the same grounds as are set out in section 9 of our legislation, namely, enforcement would be contrary to public policy, or the debtor was not aware of the institution of the proceedings so that he could defend them, or the order is irreconcilable with a judgment given here between the same parties.  The grounds for setting the order aside have nothing whatever to do with the merits of the case.  These have been decided upon in the home jurisdiction. An absconding husband from Britain would be in the very same position here unless he could plead public policy or one of the other two grounds set out in section 9.  If the question of an appeal arises there is, therefore, no prejudice to an Irishman in England or to an Englishman in Ireland because each has exactly the same rights in the other country as he would have in his own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two stages.  There is first the making of the maintenance order. That takes place entirely in the home jurisdiction and, if the absconding husband decides not to defend, he takes the consequences of the order made against him being made final and absolute.  After that it is a question of the mechanics of enforcement in the other jurisdiction.  There is no question of an Irish citizen being prejudiced <Col N="1277" /> in England through not having the right of appeal.  The role of the Master here, or the Secretary of State in Britain, in this transmission procedure is administrative rather than judicial.  It so happened that the Master of the High Court was the person picked.  It could just as easily have been the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister misunderstands the point I am making. I do not want to labour it at any length because I can come back to it on a later section.  I was not making any point in relation to the merits of the actual order for maintenance, or whether the amount was correct, or whether it was properly awardable.  I was simply talking about the question of recognition and enforcement as contained in sections 6 to 10 inclusive. It is not a court in Britain in the normal way that will enforce the order made here.  It will be the appropriate authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <P>In subsection (2) (a) the words &ldquo;such an order which is <Col N="1278" /> incidental to a decision as to the status of natural persons&rdquo; occur. What exactly does that mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to follow the phraseology of the EEC convention which provides that the convention shall not apply to the status or legal capacity of natural persons.  Decisions as to status include decisions in divorce or guardianship proceedings. This Bill is not concerned with divorce or guardianship as such, but certain orders which may be sought to be enforced here may arise from divorce proceedings in another jurisdiction. As I indicated on Second Stage, this is a delicate area for me to comment on in detail because essentially it is a matter for our courts, having regard to the dictates of the Constitution, to lay down rules concerning enforcement here of maintenance orders consequent on divorce proceedings.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is a case which, on the surface, appears to conflict with a later case indicating that in certain circumstances a divorce in England could be recognised. To cover that eventuality the definition of maintenance order includes &ldquo;such an order which is incidental to a decision as to the status of natural persons&rdquo;, that decision being, in effect, a decision in divorce proceedings.  We do not want to exclude maintenance orders consequential on divorce proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are later sections on which we might more profitably go into this in more detail. What the Minister says raises a very broad field, indeed, which is relevant not only to this Bill but to a lot of other matters, not the least important of which are various social welfare problems which have arisen in recent years particularly as a result of some decisions taken by the Department of Social Welfare in relation to allowances for deserted wives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into that in any great detail but the situation is not satisfactory to this extent.  As the Minister says, there appear to be two judicial decisions which are in conflict. <Col N="1279" /> The one which seemed to stand for a long time was the Mayo-Perrott case which seemed to be quite clear. There was a subsequent one to which the Minister referred and there is also one the name of which I cannot remember, and I do not know whether it is reported, which was a decision by Mr. Justice Kenny in a case under the Succession Act.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach will fill us in on it if I go wrong.  I understand that within the limitations of what he was asked to decide in that case, and within the limitations of the facts of that case, Mr. Justice Kenny recognised for the purposes of the Succession Act, 1965, the validity of a divorce in Britain between two people whose circumstances were particular.  It does not necessarily follow from that, for the purposes of the Succession Act or any other purpose, other divorces would be recognised.  Nevertheless, within those limitations that decision appears to conflict with Mayo-Perrott. Arising out of that are the non-judicial decisions, the administrative decisions of the Department of Social Welfare. The result is that there is a great deal of confusion amongst the people who are affected by British divorces, and who happen to be living here, as to what exactly their rights and their status are.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister is not anxious to spell it out clearly.  He said in replying to the debate on Second Stage that he did not want to purport to make judicial pronouncements, as it were, that these were matters for the courts, and that not much should be said about them in the debate on this Bill or similar Bills.  I honestly do not think that is the right or appropriate attitude to take because the courts have shown that, to some limited extent at least, they are, on the face of it, in conflict on this point.  It seems to me that this House and the Oireachtas generally should come to grips with a problem which will be a growing problem and should lay down precisely what the law should be on this point.  It should not be left in the vague way it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> This may not be the appropriate Bill on which to make very wide decisions in relation to the whole question of foreign divorce, but it is the appropriate Bill in which to lay down as the law of the Oireachtas what the situation is to be in regard to the obtaining and subsequent enforcement of maintenance orders where the deserting husband has gone to Britain and obtained a divorce, and where the wife here is either unaware of the divorce or is certainly not a consenting party to the divorce.  She is in a very difficult position not just in relation to a maintenance order but in relation to allowances from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the rather vague phraseology used in this Bill and the reluctance &mdash; although it is understandable, of course, up to a point&mdash; of the Minister to seek to put into the Bill the definitive expression of the views of the Oireachtas on this problem will continue the agony for many people.  Quite a number are affected at present and one would envisage that with recent changes in divorce laws in Britain, and they are fairly drastic changes, the number of deserted wives who will be affected in the future will be quite considerable. We should seek in a Bill such as this to solve their problems.  Why should somebody have to go to the Supreme Court, as it will have to be now, because on the face of it two decisions on different aspects of this problem appear to conflict, and possibly spend several thousand pounds, to have this matter clarified? In my view this matter is in doubt and it is the duty of the Oireachtas rather than the duty of the courts to clarify the doubt and lay down what the position is to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing two situations.  The example he gave was of the husband who deserts his wife in Ireland, goes to England and subsequently obtains a divorce from the British courts.  If the wife in Ireland obtains a maintenance order in the Irish courts before the divorce, that order will be enforced in the United Kingdom.  There is no question of any difficulty arising <Col N="1281" /> and there is no need to clarify anything there because that position is quite clear and straightforward.  There will be no constitutional impediment in the way of that order being obtained here and enforced in England. The difficulty arises where the reverse happens and a husband comes to this country having been divorced in England.  If in those divorce proceedings an order was made for maintenance, which he failed to pay, and the divorced wife in England sought to enforce that maintenance order here the question of public policy would arise.  That might give rise to a refusal to enforce that order here on the grounds that it is contrary to public policy as laid down in our Constitution.  That is something that will have to be decided.</P>
      <P>I do not think a subject as deep, involved and complicated as reform of our marriage laws&mdash;essentially that is what the Deputy is proposing &mdash;would be appropriate for inclusion in this Bill, which is designed to deal with a particular situation.  It would be wrong to attempt to widen this debate to deal with an area of immense legal complexity.  All we can do is provide in the Bill that an order incidental to such proceedings in England is not necessarily excluded from the enforcement powers given by this Bill to the courts here.  It is for the courts then to decide whether they can apply those powers in each case that comes before them.  There are a number of varying situations that can arise in regard to foreign divorces, such as where the marriage took place and where the parties were domiciled at the time of the divorce.  These are factors that have to be taken into account by the courts and on which I would not attempt to give an opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong, as I said during the debate on the Second Stage, for this House to attempt to deal with the problem in that way.  It will have to be dealt with by way of far-reaching and complex reform of our Irish laws.  It would be wrong to attempt to do it in this Bill.  All we can do is not to exclude orders consequent on such proceedings in England.  It is up to the courts then to decide <Col N="1282" /> whether a particular order is or is not contrary to public policy.</P>

      <P>The discussion on subsection (2), paragraph (a), has been useful because it has clarified the meaning of it.  From what the Minister has said what obviously must be intended there is an order for alimony or maintenance consequential on or arising out of a decision as to the status of natural persons, that is presumably as to their marriage status, and that will be as a result of the hearing of a divorce action.</P>

      <P>The Minister will, therefore, be immediately faced with the problem that was faced in the Mayo-Perrott case that an order will come from England for enforcement here, not necessarily a magistrate's court maintenance order, as a result of desertion, but an order for the payment of alimony as a result of a divorce action in which a divorce was granted.  As our law stands, as I understand it and as the Minister has explained, consequential on Mayo-Perrott we cannot, notwithstanding our obligations under the European Convention, under our own Constitution enforce that order.  There was an effort in the Mayo-Perrott case to enforce the payment of costs awarded in a divorce action against one of the parties who had come to reside in this jurisdiction and the High Court refused to reseal the decree for costs which had been given in the British courts although in the normal way that would be done automatically here.  The grounds on which the court refused in Mayo-Perrott were that it was at least a partial recognition of divorce to seek to enforce any part of a divorce action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mayo-Perrott related to the legal costs of the divorce action itself.  Subsection (2) (a) refers to consequential or incidental orders for the payment of alimony to the successful or innocent party in the divorce action and these are very common.  I believe that unless some form of lump sum settlement is not come to at the time of the making of the divorce order that the usual provision is for a monthly <Col N="1283" /> or a half-yearly payment of what is commonly called alimony.  It is only right that I should point out to the House that we seem, under our law as it stands, to be prevented from doing something which we would hope to do in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is better that we know this before we go into it.  I am not to be taken as necessarily suggesting that the position as it arises out of Mayo-Perrott should be changed because the only way it can be changed is by an amendment of the Constitution.  It is not my proposal that that particular Article of the Constitution should be amended but nonetheless, short of an amendment of it the law as it stands in Mayo-Perrott is perfectly clear.  It would seem that the principle established there in relation to costs is equally valid in relation to alimony.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take issue with the Deputy when he says that the law as laid down in Mayo-Perrott is perfectly clear.  It may be in regard to the question of the costs of a divorce, but we are getting into an area into which, as I said on the Second Stage, it would be inappropriate for me to go.  Nevertheless, I feel I should say, in fairness to the Bill and the help it will give to the people we are talking about, that Mayo-Perrott excluded the enforcement in this country of the divorce costs and the Deputy is aware that a subsequent case, Bank of Ireland v. Caffin, refined the findings in the Mayo-Perrott case.  It seems to me not unlikely that a court could make a distinction between enforcing here the cost of a divorce action and enforcing here an order for the maintenance of a man's wife and children.  If, for example, the court were to find that they could not enforce maintenance orders consequent on divorce proceedings in England, this country could become a haven for divorced husbands. The court might consider that that situation was not what was envisaged by the Constitution.  Therefore, it is not by any means definite that the decision in the Mayo-Perrott case would mean&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister answered his own point when he told us earlier that the Bank of Ireland-Caffin case was decided in relation to a divorce which took place in Britain when both parties were domiciled in Britain?  There can be no question of both parties being domiciled in Britain in the case of a situation that would arise under subsection (2) (a) of this section.</P>

In the Bank of Ireland case both parties were resident and domiciled in Britain at the time they were divorced.  If I might be so bold as to pass comment on the judgment of Mr. Justice Kenny in that case, I do not think he could have decided otherwise because should he have decided otherwise, the result would have been that people who had never set foot in Ireland but who had married and divorced lawfully elsewhere while domiciled elsewhere could not have their divorce recognised here. That would be an untenable situation.</P>

      <P>That is why I say <Col N="1285" /> that Mr. Justice Kenny could not have decided otherwise, but that case is not relevant to that situation.  What is relevant, though, is the Mayo-Perrott case because the principle was exactly the same and the Minister seeks now to distinguish Mayo-Perrott from this situation only by saying that the Mayo-Perrott case related to costs when what we are concerned with relates to alimony or weekly maintenance. I know that there is that distinction but there is no distinction in principle.  What we are doing now is purporting to pass a Bill which we know cannot be enforceable in this country because of the findings in the Mayo-Perrott case.</P>

      <P>We should not enact legislation when we know that there is a strong possibility that the High Court or the Supreme Court will be unable to distinguish this case in principle from the Mayo-Perrott case. If that is so what we are now purporting to do will be unenforceable.  On that basis I suggest that it is our duty not to propose to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not proposing to do any such thing and it is erroneous for the Deputy to say that this arises under this Bill.  All we can do is to provide for the enforcement in this country of maintenance orders made in another jurisdiction.  Subsequently it would be a matter for the courts to decide whether the enforcement of those maintenance orders would be contrary to public policy. It is wrong for us here to try to take over the courts' job and to speculate because we are only engaging in idle speculation.  It is for the courts to make the definitive judgment as to whether, for how long and in what circumstances maintenance orders made in another jurisdiction on divorce proceedings will be enforced here.  It is not necessarily right to suggest that they will not be enforced here.  That does not appear to be an accurate statement of the present legal position, particularly as the Deputy is basing his statement on his interpretation of one case which has <Col N="1286" /> been refined in a subsequent case. Should we proceed on those lines we would be attempting to carry out what is in essence a judicial function&mdash;the interpretation of the Constitution as it applies to this piece of legislation. All we can do is to provide the legislation. It is a matter for the courts then, to decide whether the enforcement of particular maintenance orders is in accordance with public policy.</P>
      <P>I should hope that, in the event of an issue arising, we would have a system of legal aid which would avoid the imposition of undue legal expenses on the parties involved. However, if any case should come before the courts in advance of the introduction of a scheme of legal aid, I would imagine that the present informal arrangement between the Attorney General and the Minister for Finance which covers important constitutional cases would be available in this instance too.  That is beside the point though.  I refute the Deputy's suggestion that we are passing a Bill which contains a provision that is unenforceable. That is not so.  We are passing a Bill which provides for the enforcement here of maintenance orders made in another jurisdiction provided their enforcement is in accord with public policy here.  It is the exclusive function of the courts to decide whether enforcement of any particular maintenance order is in accord with public policy.  It is wrong for us to speculate as to what the courts might decide.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could reply to the Minister regarding the interpretation of the term &ldquo;maintenance order&rdquo;, which is what is under discussion here.  The Minister has <Col N="1287" /> said that I sought to give the impression that maintenance orders coming here from Britain might be unenforceable. I was not talking of maintenance orders in the ordinary popular sense of something coming to us from a Magistrate's Court.  I was talking of what are declared here to be maintenance orders for the purpose of this Bill, in other words, orders incidental to a divorce action or orders for the payment of alimony.</P>

      <P>The discussion for the last ten or 15 minutes was not about maintenance orders at all.  There is no doubt about them.  It was about alimony orders incidental to or consequential on divorce actions.  It is my suggestion and my view that there must at least be doubt as to their enforceability.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot interpret the Constitution.  The only way in which the doubt could be resolved would be by a complete overhaul of our laws of marriage.  I agree with the Deputy that that is something desirable and something which I am anxious to see done in the near rather than the far distant future.  That is something for a separate piece of legislation. It would not be at all appropriate to try to do it within the scope of this Bill.  Until we can get our marriage laws revamped this cannot be done.  It may even involve an amendment of the Constitution. When the whole subject has been examined <Col N="1288" /> and when there has been a full and informed public debate on it, large issues of policy will have to be decided.  If doubts arise in a particular case so far as this Bill is concerned they can only be removed by the judicial arm of the State.  We cannot do it here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people will feel aggrieved that arrears which have and will have been approved before the commencement of this Bill or Act, as it will be, should not be recoverable. There must be vast sums of money which are not alone legally but morally due to people who are in very bad circumstances as a result of desertion over a period of years.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should regard the statute of limitations as being the appropriate limiting factor here rather than have the statement &ldquo;but shall not have effect in relation to arrears accrued before such commencement&rdquo;.  It may be quite unfair to people who are owed quite a lot of money by someone who is quite well able to pay but who will seek the protection of this section in order to avoid paying what is morally and legally due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the point made by the Deputy, but there are a number of reasons why arrears have been excluded.  The first is that there would be an element of retrospective legislation in the Bill if we were to allow all arrears to be included from the time the order was first made in the other jurisdiction until such time as it was sought to be enforced.  There would be an element of retrospection in that.  It would be contrary to the well-settled legal principle that laws should not be retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person, even an absconding husband, is entitled to know what the law is at any particular time and to know that with certainty.  If enforcement of arrears were to be allowed it might be <Col N="1289" /> possible that a person would be unable to pay them and could find himself imprisoned having assumed that there was no liability on him to pay the arrears.  He might suddenly find himself years afterwards with such a liability.  That would be unjust and possibly in breach of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>If arrears were to be brought into it, the question of variation might also have to be provided for whereby the debtor would be entitled to seek a variation of arrears.  It could happen that the original order granted might be unreal as regards his subsequent income. If he had known that it would later become enforceable against him he might have sought to vary it at an earlier date.</P>
    <P>The question of arrears gave rise to some difficulty because by excluding them one is letting some people away with one of the effects of their desertion. A starting date had to be arrived at.  Taking all sides of the case into consideration, I felt that the fairest thing was to exclude arrears accruing before the scheme comes into operation.  As the Deputy is aware, there is reciprocal legislation in the UK.  This decision had to be a joint one between the two sides.  If we were to attempt to change our decision at this stage it would involve reopening the discussions.  There would be serious practical difficulties.  If arrears were allowed in, there would be complications and huge amounts of arrears.  Enforcement in these cases could be oppressive.  There would be numerous applications for variations and the possibility of many cases of imprisonment for non-payment, which could be counter-productive.</P>
    <P>The simplest way to deal with this problem is to allow enforcement to commence from the date of coming into operation of the Act and to exclude earlier arrears.  I sympathise with the Deputy's point of view.  It is a humane point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, if I paraphrase correctly what he has said, feels that it would be unfair, even to as unworthy a person as an absconding husband, to make him liable for arrears that would impose on him a <Col N="1290" /> liability for something which he did not previously have.  I suggest that that is not correct.  He was always liable to support his wife.  He was morally liable and he was legally liable for as long as a maintenance order was in existence against him.  The problem that arose was that the wife could not enforce the order because the husband had absconded out of the jurisdiction.  That did not remove his moral or legal liability.  He cannot therefore complain if this section were changed to enable his wife to recover what is both morally and legally due.</P>
      <P>There would be no element of retrospection in collecting what was always morally and legally due.  The question of liability never arose. There was never any doubt as to liability.  The problem was confined solely to enforceability.  This Bill gets over some at least of the problems of enforceability.  It does not enter into the question of liability.  The legal and moral liability was always there.  The question of collecting arrears would only arise where an order had been made in, say, 1970, 1971, 1972 or some other time in the past.  In that respect the Minister should bear in mind that up to the passing of the Courts Act, 1971, the maximum amount which could have been awarded to any wife, no matter how many children she had, was £4 a week.  Therefore, the amount could never be more than £208 a year.  It was only since early 1972 that the courts had jurisdiction to award any more.</P>
      <P>Since there is no question in my proposal of creating a new liability that an absconding husband could not have been affected by, I suggest that there is nothing improper and, above all, there is nothing retrospective, in the worst sense of that word, about forcing him, where he can now be caught under the provisions of this Bill, to pay up what he was always morally and legally liable to pay.  This would only apply where orders had been made.  As I said up to the end of 1971 they could not pay more than £4 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the <Col N="1291" /> Deputy's point of view when he says that these men should be made pay. We are looking at this in the context of the Irishman who has absconded to the United Kingdom which is where the bulk of the traffic goes. The Deputy is saying that we should renegotiate so that provision for the collection of arrears will be introduced into the reciprocating legislation. From the point of view of this jurisdiction, the implementation of such an arrangement would not be a difficult task because the number of deserting Englishmen in this country is small.  They might belong to a more affluent section than the equivalent Irishman going east.  From the point of view of the United Kingdom authorities, this could be a serious problem.</P>
      <P>While we sympathise with the desire to catch these men and make them pay their arrears, we do not have the power to do so.  It is the other jurisdiction who would have the burden of doing that.  This is a matter which was discussed at some length in the negotiations.  The matter was thrashed out very fully and as a result we have the provision as it appears in the Bill. There is a further argument to reinforce the position as it appears in the Bill and that is that there is a precedent&mdash;in an argument like this. The Deputy will appreciate the weight of a precedent being thrown into the ring&mdash;from The Hague Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions relating to Maintenance Obligations.  This states that:</P>
      <P>Where a decision has been rendered prior to the entry into force of the Convention between the State of origin and the State addressed, it shall be enforced in the latter State only for payments falling due after such entry into force.</P>
      <P>That precedent carries considerable weight.  That precedent, plus the practical difficulties advanced by the other party to the negotiations, compelled us to introduce the legislation in its present form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Hague Convention is not necessarily relevant to or <Col N="1292" /> binding on this particular situation. This legislation relates to a bilateral agreement.  It is temporary pending the acceptance by Britain and ourselves of the EEC Convention which may or may not contain similar provisions. Assuming it does not, there is no bar on what is now proposed. However, I will not push the matter any further other than to suggest that the Minister might raise with the British authorities the question of the possible inclusion of arrears in this and get their reaction.  They may not be unfavourably disposed.  It would be only fair to thousands of potential beneficiaries in this country that an effort would be made to collect what is legally and morally due from people who have absconded.</P>

It removes any doubts about how it should be served by making it clear that it will be served either personally or in any manner in which service of a superior court document within the meaning of section 23 of the Courts Act, 1971, may be effected, that is, by leaving it at his home or place of business, by registered post or through a solicitor.</P>

Amendment No. 4 refers <Col N="1293" /> to any manner in which service of a District Court document within the meaning of section 7 of the Courts Act, 1964, may be effected.

It apparently conforms with the provisions of the EEC convention on the enforcement of civil and commercial judgments.</P>
      <P>The only point I want to make about it is that we have no guarantee that a similar sort of procedure will be followed in the reciprocating jurisdiction in regard to Irish citizens or Irish residents who make corresponding applications in the other jurisdiction. This comes back to the point I made on section 3 in relation to the distinction between the Master of the High Court being the appropriate authority here, sending the applications or orders, and the Secretary of State for Home Affairs being the appropriate authority in Britain.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  All we can do here is to legislate for our jurisdiction. This is reciprocating legislation and the broad procedures are similar in each jurisdiction.  The reciprocity is provided by an Order in Council which brings into effect in relation to maintenance orders made in this jurisdiction a British statute.  That statute is broadly similar to ours from the point of view of the mechanics of enforcing our orders and for the protection of the rights of both creditor and debtor&mdash;the two measures are on all fours.</P>

      <P>A question that we have already discussed at some length arises again here.  It is in relation to public policy.  It involves the divorce problem and the consequential difficulties for us that arise out of that.  I can see a different but perhaps corresponding difficulty arising in Britain in so far as public policy is concerned: where one of their residents, somebody domiciled in Britain, has got a divorce in the British courts and has remarried locally as he is entitled to do in Britain, would it be in accordance with public policy in Britain to enforce an Irish maintenance order which would disregard his lawful divorce and remarriage in Britain?  In other words, we would be asking them, as it were, to recognise that for the purposes of this particular operation, that divorce and remarriage were not valid.  The Minister <Col N="1295" /> may reply that as long as the maintenance order is valid according to Irish law that is enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>The net result of that would be that a wife here who has been deserted would not run into the problem that she would be unable to enforce her order because it would be contrary to public policy in Britain, but she would run into the problem that the British courts would refuse to enforce her Irish maintenance order because it was not reconcilable with the judgment given in her deserting husband's divorce action in Britain.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be.  I cannot go farther than that because again we are entering into what is a judicial area. It almost certainly would be if the maintenance order were got after the divorce in England, because at that stage it would be clearly irreconcilable with the judgment of the English court. The position would be different if the maintenance order were obtained before the divorce action in England.  It would be a matter for the courts to decide.  I do not think that in this matter we can attempt to deal with hypothetical situations.  There would be no point in trying to think up situations with a view to putting them into the Act.  It would be better to leave it to the courts.</P>

      <P>Under section 13 (1) (d) it seems to be envisaged that the maintenance creditor in the reciprocating jurisdiction would, at times at least, have legal aid.  If there is to be true reciprocation it should be available on equal terms for somebody in this country.

      <P>The Deputy, with his experience, knows very well I could not make any such statement.  For a longer time than the period between now and the date on which this Bill comes into force, legal aid did not appear on the Irish scene.  We hope to have civil legal aid here, having set up a committee to advise on the scope and format of it.  Until such time as we have it, there is no doubt that the debtor here will be in an inferior position to a debtor in the other jurisdiction, in that if he wants to contest the enforcement of the order here he will have to do it out of his own pocket.  Why subsection (1) (d) is in the Bill is in anticipation of a system of civil legal aid coming in here; the court here will know that this was a legal aid case in the other jurisdiction and will, therefore, have a guide as to whether legal aid should be granted in the proceedings here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but let us assume the judgment debtor is caught, as it were.  It is ascertained that he is at such-and-such an address within the jurisdiction and the various papers and orders are served on him and he makes payment in accordance with the order to the District Court clerk. He decides after a few weeks that he has enough of this and goes elsewhere. It is properly provided in section 14 that that would be an offence, but as the money involved could be pretty large, surely the proposed maximum fine of £20 would be inadequate to seek to ensure that he would give an address.</P>

      <P>This seems to me to introduce the concept of prosecuting someone who is resident outside the jurisdiction, perhaps not prosecuting in the most technical sense but at least taking proceedings and making an application against someone outside the jurisdiction.  While my concern would be entirely with the applicant or prosecutrix, in this case, I think that the defendant, however unworthy he might be otherwise, has certain rights too.  Is the Minister satisfied that in the other jurisdictions there would be adequate and proper service of the documents on the defendant and that he would get adequate notice?  This and subsequent sections do not lay down any time limits or anything of that kind.  Indeed there are a great many other matters which should properly be covered by rules of court.  I should like to ask the Minister if it is proposed to make rules of court; if so, by what committee&mdash;whether the Superior Courts Committee or the District Courts Committee, or both, and whether this sort of application, which is an unusual one, will be covered by those rules of court.  The defendant, however unworthy he may be, is at a tremendous disadvantage in that he is resident all the time in another jurisdiction and the period of notice he would need, if he <i>bona fide</i> wanted to contest the case, would be considerably more than a period of notice that might be adequate for somebody living in this jurisdiction. Is it proposed to have any provision that there would be a period of, say, not earlier than 21 days after service, or some such period?  Ideally the place to provide that would be in the Bill in case an inadequate time was suggested in the rules.</P>

      <P>Of course, new rules are being drafted.  The court mainly involved will be the District Court because it will be the enforcing court as well as the court making the bulk of the maintenance orders.  I am hopeful that the rules and the coming into operation of the Bill will be simultaneous or that there will be very little gap between them.  I know that the work is proceeding on them as a <Col N="1301" /> matter of urgency.  Indeed, the President of the District Court has been most helpful and these few words are an inadequate way of expressing gratitude for the work he is doing in this particular area.  It is his and my hope that we will have District Court Rules to enable the Act be operated from the commencement date.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that people who are outside the jurisdiction will receive adequate notice, in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which he resides.  The Deputy will have noticed that, throughout the Bill, one of the defences&mdash;and there are very few defences open to a maintenance debtor&mdash;is that he was not given notice of the proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to defend them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only part of section 21 about which I want to say anything, is subsection (1) (e), which allowed a whole series of strange things as evidence.  I know there is a general proviso in subsection (4) that gives the court discretion as to what weight, if any, should be attached to the matters that are allowed at 1 (e) and also at 1 (c) and 1 (d), but I (c) and 1 (d) are straightforward enough because, for the most part, they involve court documents. Those mentioned at paragraph (e) are very different and one in particular <Col N="1304" /> that strikes me as very doubtful is the question of the admissibility of a statement contained in a document which purports to be a letter written to a party to maintenance proceedings who is residing in a reciprocating jurisdiction. I am sure the Minister can see clearly and quickly the dangers in that sort of thing.  That is hearsay to the ninth degree and particularly so where the other party resides in another jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>In fact what would happen there under 1 (e) (vi) is that a wife who was not <i>bona fide</i> in these matters could write a letter to her husband or purport to write it, and send it to an address at which she knew he was not. He never got the letter and she knew that but still she could produce a copy of that letter and have it used in evidence in some degree against him.  That runs contrary to everything we ever held dear in regard to the law of evidence.  Indeed, a letter written by a party would normally be admissible against him only when it was proved that he did write it.  Here you could have alleged copy letters produced which perhaps were never even sent.  To allow that, even in the rather limited and cut-down form which subsection (4) suggests, seems to be very unwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disturbed also by subsection 1 (e) (i) because it could imply the obtaining of information from the Revenue Commissioners or their British equivalents.  The statement at (iv) that a statement or certificate that a person was employed or unemployed for a specified period is very vague.  There is no indication by whom it should be made.  The really disturbing provision is that of a letter being written to a party.  I think there can be no suggestion that a letter written to someone would be admissible unless it was admitted that the letter was received.  It could be relevant then, if it were admitted that it was received and statements made in it were not denied or if the letter was acknowledged and certain statements were not denied.  Simply to produce a copy letter allegedly sent to someone without proof of its receipt would not, in my view, be fair particularly as in the vast <Col N="1305" /> majority of cases the defendant will not be present even though he has the opportunity of denying it.</P>

      <P>A number of safeguards have been written into the section to avoid the situation the Deputy envisages.  I do not know whose side he is on because what we want here is informality and effectiveness. In an attempt to get this the provisions of this section, which I must concede are in some respects novel, include a number of safeguards. The overriding one is that the court must see good reason for the documents being admitted or not admitted.  If the court see documents which are doubtful on their face, no doubt that would be good reason to exclude them.  The court, of its own motion or at the instance of either party, may decide to exclude documents. If a document is a letter of the type mentioned by the Deputy it would not take a very strong case to have it excluded.  These documents will be admissible only to the same extent as oral evidence of the same content.  There will be no inadmissible evidence included in that sense.  The evidence contained in any document introduced can be rebutted and the court has the overriding power not to admit it.  As with any evidence produced in a court, the court will decide what weight should be given to it in the context of all the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is sufficient protection in the section to ensure that no party will be prejudiced.  The ordinary laws of evidence will still apply.  What is intended here is to introduce a certain informality into the proofs, not to have the burden of strict proof in this type of proceedings which will be as informal as possible and as acceptable as possible to the parties to them.  It would be contrary to the spirit of the whole idea of mutual enforcement if we were to have rules of evidence applied in the same way as they might be applied in some of the superior courts or if we were to have the particular technicalities of that code introduced into these proceedings.  The protections I have outlined, with the overriding requirement for the court <Col N="1306" /> to see good reason, the fact that the court is not compelled to accept any of the documents, that the court will give them the normal weight to be attached to them and can refuse to accept them and that it can only allow written evidence of what would be permissible orally&mdash;I think these will ensure that no injustice will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1: Before section 2 to insert a new section as follows:  &ldquo;(1)  Subject to subsection (2) of this section, where pursuant to an order of the High Court the custody of a child has been given to any person, the consent of any other person to the making of an order for the adoption of the child by that person or by that person and his spouse shall not be necessary.  (2)  The consent of a ward of court shall not be dispensed with except with the sanction of the court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section proposes that the consent of the child's mother or guardian or any person having charge or control over the child, to the making of the order shall not be necessary where custody of the child has been awarded to any person by the High Court.  This was to meet the difficulty of the procrastinating mother or the mother who withdraws consent and refuses to do one thing or the other.  The intention is that if the High Court makes an order for custody the Adoption Board may make an adoption order on foot of that. From the point of view of drafting, it has been necessary to introduce the amendment to ensure that if the person whose consent is needed is a ward of court, the consent of the court on behalf of that ward will not be dispensed with.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Before section 3 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An adoption order shall not be made in any case where the applicants, the child and his parents, or, if the child is illegitimate, his mother, are not all of the same religion, unless every person whose consent to the making of the order is required by section 14 of the Principal Act or by section 2 of the Adoption Act, 1964, knows the religion (if any) of each of the applicants when he gives his consent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section, as drafted, provides that an adoption order shall not be made unless every person whose consent is necessary to the making of the order knows the religion, if any, of each of the applicants when he gives his consent.  During the Second Stage I proposed to amend the section on Committee Stage to make it clear that it is only in cases where the adoptive parents, the child and the mother are not all of the same religion that the mother must be informed of the religion of each of the adoptive parents at the time she gives consent.</P>
      <P>The substance of the change is not very great; it is more a change of emphasis than of substance.  In all adoption cases the question of the religion of the adoptive parents is brought into issue under the section as it stands.  I intend that it be brought into issue only in cases where the adopting parents and the child are not all of the same religion.  As a matter of practice, the question of the religion of the adopting parents will always come into issue because most children are placed by adoption societies and in this country most of them are organised by the churches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> The various churches will continue to endeavour to ensure that children of their religion are placed with parents of that religion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the amendment which is necessary. The wording of section 3 as it stood originally was not desirable because it brought up the question of religion every time an order was made, on the assumption that the board would be precluded from making an order, as things stood, if there was a difference of religion.</P>
      <P>The section should go slightly beyond what is proposed in this amendment.  I know that in practice what I am going to talk about would rarely, if ever, happen particularly as the great majority of adoptions are arranged by societies, as the Minister has pointed out.  However, there are occasions when they are not so arranged, and in particular the mother, who has to give her consent, is not precluded from arranging it if she so desires.  She cannot be precluded.  In order to safeguard the situation, I suggest to the Minister that in no case, even if the mother consented, should a child be adopted by a couple unless at least one of the prospective adoptive parents is of the same religion as the child.</P>
      <P>Under the section as amended, in theory at least, provided the mother did not disagree, a child of a particular religion could be adopted lawfully by a couple neither of whom professed the same religion as the child.  I do not think we should allow that to happen.  It would only arise where the mother was not very caring about these matters, but there have always been safeguards in relation to religion in our adoption legislation and I think the religion of the child should be safeguarded, and continue to be safeguarded, even if the mother were of such a kind that she did not greatly care about religion, or in particular, her child's religion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was originally discussing with officials the drafting of the kind of amendment to the 1952 and 1964 Acts that would allow adoption by a couple in what is called a mixed marriage&mdash;I <Col N="1310" /> referred to this in my speech in the Seanad on Senator Robinson's Bill in 1972&mdash;the form of amendment I had decided on was to provide that the board could make an order where the religion of the child was the same as the religion of one of the prospective adoptors assuming they were a couple, or the same as the religion of the prospective adoptor where a couple were not involved.</P>
    <P>There is a slight loophole in the way the Minister has expressed it here and I think the way I had in mind originally would be preferable. It would ensure that in no case could there be a situation in which a couple would adopt a child but neither of the adoptors would be of the same religion. Under the section as amended and, provided the mother did not disagree, a child of a particular religion could be adopted by a couple each of whose religions was different from that of the child.  It could only arise where the mother does not take the normal sort of care or interest one would expect a natural mother to take, but we must realise that the natural mother in a situation like this is frequently less intelligent than average, is frequently in considerable distress and under a far higher degree of emotional strain than a married mother would be after the birth of the child.  Frequently the decision has to be made within a matter of days after the birth; sometimes the decision is made before the birth, often quite properly so.  One of the reasons for that is that the natural mother never sees her child and that may be for the benefit of all concerned. Because the decision is made at a time of great stress the question of the child's religion should be safeguarded lest in the rather traumatic time that she is going through, the mother were to consent to the child's adoption by a couple, neither of whom professed the same religion as the child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point but in a situation like this all we can do is provide that the mother &mdash;the person whose rights are in question at this stage, along with the rights of the child&mdash;be informed if the <Col N="1311" /> adoptive parents are not of the same religion as herself.  The Deputy envisages a situation where the mother is careless or not concerned about the child's religious upbringing.  Of course a child cannot have any religion apart from the religion of its mother and if its mother has no religion or cares so little about her nominal religion that she is prepared to allow her child to be adopted by people both professing a religion different from that which he nominally accedes to, then I think it would be an interference for anyone to come in and say to that mother: &ldquo;You cannot give your child to those two good people, you must give your child to a couple one of whom is of the same religion as you nominally profess&rdquo;.  I do not know whether that would be proper. I think it would be an interference with the mother's right at that stage to ensure that her child was placed to its best advantage.  This presumably can only happen in the case where the child is being placed by the mother personally because one would imagine that if the child is given to a society for placement, most of the societies are organised by the churches they will take steps to ensure that it is only their co-religionists who will be given the child for adoption.  It would be only in a situation where the mother herself places the child for adoption and I think we fulfil our obligations to the child if we make it obligatory that the mother be made aware of the religion of the parties if the religion differs from her own and that of her child.  Of course, a child cannot have any religion other than the mother's religion.  I believe that is sufficient safeguard in the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy made the point that the mother is in such a situation after a traumatic experience that her judgment might possibly be impaired.  I concede that that may be so but nevertheless as a matter of adoption practice the Adoption Board generally allow a period of six months to elapse from the placement to the making of the adoption order and during that six months a mother can at any time withdraw her consent if she decides <Col N="1312" /> that the religious requirements for her child's future are in jeopardy. There is a safeguard there.  I think we can only go as far as drawing the mother's attention to the fact that the proposed adoptive parents are not both of the same religion as herself when such is the case.  I do not think we can go further and have a provision whereby the State says to a mother: &ldquo;You can only place your child with parents one of whom is of a certain religion&rdquo; on the basis that that religion appears to be the religion professed by the mother.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is implying that a mother who might act in this way is necessarily deficient in her duties and obligations.  I tried when I spoke earlier to point out that the period before and after the birth of an illegitimate child can be very distressing indeed for the mother of that child, much more so than for a married woman, for a variety of reasons that are quite obvious.  It must be recognised that not infrequently the mother of such a child at and around the time of the birth can have her judgment impaired.  She is not necessarily deficient in her duties to her own religion or to general morality in acting in such a way.  Perhaps she might not do it if she were in a different place and at a different time.</P>
      <P>The reality of this section, as amended, is allowing couples in a mixed marriage to adopt because that is the net difference between what was the law and what is the law so far as religion and so on is concerned.  I am fully in agreement with that.  I announced it in 1972 but I announced at the time the way that I proposed to word the section which would allow that and that would have got over the problem that I have been talking about.  The way I proposed to word it was that the board would have jurisdiction to make an order where the religion of at least one of the prospective adoptors was the same as the religion of the child.  That would get over this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see the possibility of this arising and I can see people who may not realise the potential difficulty <Col N="1313" /> here becoming very agitated perhaps in a year's time or so when a thing like this happens.  It would be preferable that we would get over the problem now.  I think we might get over it by simply adding a proviso at the end on the lines that I have indicated which would clarify the matter and prevent something which I think we are all agreed would be undesirable, in other words, that a child of a particular religion would, even with the consent of the mother, be adopted into a household in which that religion was not professed and presumably would, therefore, be brought up in a religion other than that into which it was born.  There is, of course, a perfect right on the part of natural parents or of adoptive parents, after they get an adoption order to change their religion and correspondingly the religion of their child but that is only after the order has been made in the case of adoptive parents.  I do not think that the child should be put immediately into the position that before he is legally adopted his religion has to be changed. I am not making this point on behalf of any religion.  I am just pointing it out as a difficulty that I think exists that may not have been foreseen and that could cause some difficulty afterwards for some people in certain circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to the case made by Deputy O'Malley.  I do not think there is any great difference between us on either side of the House about this possibility. We are not legislating for the present time and we are certainly not legislating for the past.  We are legislating for the future.  We know how things have changed very rapidly in the recent past and they will change probably more rapidly in the future.  If this is some safeguard for the sake of doing the right thing now rather than bringing in amending legislation later we should do the little bit asked for, if there is any possibility whatever of it happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding the religious clauses has been <Col N="1314" /> changed completely by the recent High Court decision.  I am not prepared to say now whether what the Deputies opposite asked is possible, having regard to the findings of the High Court.  It may be that the findings of the High Court are an obstacle in that regard.  I will consider sympathetically what the Deputies have to say.  I am still strongly of the original view I expressed here that all the State should do is to draw the mother's attention to the fact that the religion of both the adopting parents is not the same as her own. I think the State's obligation is ended there.</P>
      <P>We are talking about the mother placing the child herself.  If denominational adoption societies place the child they place it with their co-religionists.  All the State can say to the mother who is placing the child herself is: &ldquo;Look these two people are not of the same religion as your child.&rdquo;  That is the end of the State's obligation.  If the mother decides she wants to place her child with two people, neither of whom professes the same religion as herself, and if she in her judgment considers that her child's future is best served with these people, notwithstanding the differing religions, then it raises the point whether the State is entitled to prevent that mother doing what she thinks best in conscience for her child.  In other words, are we entitled to say that a mother must insist that her child be reared in the religion she professes whether nominally or really?  If she really professes it the situation will not arise.  We are dealing with the situation where she nominally professes it or, as Deputy O'Malley said, her judgment is impaired.  If she only nominally professes it and she decides her child's best future is with those people, why should we interfere with her judgment?  Is Big Brother entitled to say: &ldquo;You are wrong, madam, your child's future is in jeopardy&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if it is a question that her judgment is impaired, due to the proximity of the birth, there is a waiting period of six months during which she can withdraw her consent if on reflection she feels she made <Col N="1315" /> a mistake.  These are the arguments why I would be very slow to accept what is said on the other side of the House.  There is the further complication of the High Court decision.  I appreciate the weight of the point and I appreciate it is one which will cause considerable concern.  For these considerations I will consider the matter between now and the next Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something I spoke about at some length in the <Col N="1316" /> Seanad when I discussed the Adoption Bill, 1971, there.  My proposal was to fix a period of either two or three months subsequent to the birth as being the earliest time after which a consent could be given.  I know the Minister spoke about six weeks and I have no objection to that.  However, I would point out to him that he has only in the last few minutes spoken about a waiting period of six months within which consent could be withdrawn.  I do not think that is so, unless you take into account what is suggested in section 7 (1) that the board could prescribe a period of care, but that of course it would not be an immutable period.</P>
      <P>A lot of people will be very disappointed if the Board prescribe a period as long as six months because many adopting parents to whom I have spoken about this matter spoke with horror of this terribly long waiting period.  At the moment most of them wait a little over six months and they find that terribly long.  Many of them were under the impression that when these amendments to the legislation were proposed the final order would be made after the child had attained six or seven weeks.  I know in many cases it would be undesirable to do that because the prospective adoptors might prove to be utterly unsuitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm to point out that if a six month period is likely to be prescribed by the board what we are proposing to do in section 6 will not matter very much in practice anyway because the waiting period will be at least six months.  It will not make in practice much difference to the present situation. If the mother gives her consent after six weeks but can withdraw it any time up to six, seven or eight months and if the board feel that the probationary period has been long enough and has been satisfactorily complied with by the applicants, then they are really back in the position in which they are at the moment.  It has been a cause of great distress and worry to people who have grown extremely attached to particular children and who have seen these children they had come to regard as their own snatched away from them by what they regard <Col N="1317" /> as almost unnatural mothers.  Happily, that has only happened in rare cases. The board appear to be given considerable discretion about fixing the period.  I would suggest that they might well consider not having any set period but should judge each case on its merits and one of the merits would be the well-being of the new family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section introduces quite a radical change.  Up to now the board could not make an order until the child was six months old.  Now they can make an order when the child is six weeks old if the mother gives her consent.  The board can literally make the order for adoption when the child is six weeks and one day old.  Under the previous position the child could not be adopted at under six months of age.  The board will have discretion to shorten the period.  There are two advantages in this.  By shortening the period the board can remove the anxiety of parents in a situation where the board for a variety of reasons waives the normal probationary period. The second advantage is that, if the mother wants to get over this emotional experience of parting with her child, she can now give her consent to the adoption of the child when the child is six weeks old and go back to normal life again.  From the mother's point of view that is an advantage.</P>
      <P>I should not like to see the board reduce the six months probationary period as a general rule because it is well accepted adoption practice, and not only in this country but internationally, that a period of six months probation is usually required to ensure that a proper assessment of the adopting parents as to suitability and so on can be made.  Likewise the child can be assessed to ensure that it is settling in well in its new home. Any shorter period would be a bit unreal and I anticipate that in future the vast majority of adoptions will still be subject to this six months delay before the final order is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this period is right.  It is unfortunate that the adopting parents will have to go through this rather agonising period during which there is still a slight question mark in that the mother may withdraw her consent, <Col N="1318" /> but this is a risk that has to be taken.  This agonising period has to be faced for the greater good of ensuring that the adopting parents are properly assessed and that the child is settling in in its new home.  This is what we must aim at.  In practice therefore while the law will permit earlier adoption the vast majority of adoptions will not take place until six months have elapsed.  If there should be a situation in which in the judgment of the board the order could be made after six weeks, the mother having given her consent as she will be able to do under this legislation, the board can then and there make the adoption order.  I rather imagine that will be a rare case.  The change is not designed to obviate the agonising waiting period.  That is not the purpose of the change.  The idea is to allow the mother to consent at an earlier stage if she wants to place her baby finally and allow the board, where discretion permits it and where it thinks proper, to make an earlier order than the probationary period of six months.</P>

      <P>I welcome this section. There is a case to be made for the family not adopting for the first time. In such a case the board is aware of the suitability of the family and there should be no need to have a waiting period of six months.</P>

      <P>I want to make a suggestion not in relation to the entry made in the register of adoptions but rather in relation to the entry made in the register of births arising from the entry in the register of adoptions. I am sure the Minister appreciates that problems arise from time to time in <Col N="1319" /> relation to some birth certificates and I wonder if those problems could be overcome in consultation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this argument and I sympathise with it.  It is only in the long form of the birth certificate that the fact that the child is adopted appears.  There is no mention of this fact on the short form. The latter is acceptable, of course, for nearly all purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two reasons why I would be against changing the present system.  I am advised very strongly, and the advice is unanimous, by people working in this field that the adopted children should be told as early as possible of their status so that they can adjust to it and grow up with it as part of their normal existence. Usually, if this is done, there are no emotional complications where the child is concerned.  These arise only where the child is reared in the belief that it is the natural child of the parents and then learns the truth in mid-teens or later.  The knowledge can then cause quite an emotional upset. Adopting parents are encouraged to tell the children as soon as possible what their status is.  If that practice is followed the presence of the word &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; on the long form of the birth certificate on the rare occasions on which it has to be produced will not cause any embarrassment to or difficulty for the child.  If adopting parents neglect to carry out this advice there can be hardship and emotional upset if the long form of the certificate becomes the cause of the child's learning its true status. Again we have to balance this against <Col N="1320" /> the fact that birth certificates are official documents, part of State records, and they must mean precisely what they say, so that if any question of ancestry or record-searching or anything like that arises those relying on State records must be able to rely on them implicitly, and they must therefore be accurate.</P>
    <P>If the long form of birth certificate of an adopted child were not to have the word &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; on it, that certificate would not be an accurate record, and it would throw the entire public records of the State into some disrepute in an area where they can be of considerable importance where a question of ancestry for genealogical or succession purposes may be involved.  I sympathise with the point of view put forward by the Deputy, which I have heard before, asking that the word &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; be removed from the full form but I think that for those two reasons it could not be adopted.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was thinking about this problem of the age limit of seven years when I was considering amendments to the existing Acts, the argument was very strongly put to me by some societies and others that to remove altogether a pretty low age limit, such as seven years, would lead in their view, and had apparently led in the past prior to 1964, to the undue postponement of adoption orders or, more accurately, to the undue postponement of the making of application for orders. The board suggested that an amendment should be made to the 1964 Act which, while giving the board certain discretion, also limited them in some way.  There is a danger that, if people feel they can adopt a child at any age, some of them at least will tend to put off the adoption until an age that is too late to benefit the child as adoption should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point, although it is, if you like, the very opposite of this <Col N="1321" /> argument, is that there are still many people who are now old and who were informally adopted in the sense that when they were young and when they were actually adopted there was no procedure or legislation under which they could be formally adopted.  A great many of those people for one reason or another have no birth certificates and are unable to obtain them.  I know of at least one person who is now of pensionable age but has been unable to get a pension to which he is otherwise entitled because he has not got a birth certificate because he was informally adopted.  Naturally enough, he does not know who his mother was, or where or when he was adopted, or where or when he was born.</P>
    <P>I am making two separate and distinct points, one being not necessarily my own opinion but an opinion which was expressed pretty forcibly to me at the time, which was that there are certain undesirable consequences about raising the age.  At the other extreme end of the scale I am referring to the problem of people of middle age and old age who did not have the advantages of this system and who are running into a lot of difficulty as a result.  I want to inquire whether the Adoption Board would be able to do anything for people in these circumstances.  Both their adoptive parents now being dead, presumably they could not.  This is a serious difficulty which is very hard to resolve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that good adoption practice demands that babies be adopted at the earliest stage possible.  Any research which has been done shows that those adopted earliest integrate best and turn out best in later life.  Those who come later to the new home very often are children who experience emotional and other upsets in their 'teens and early adulthood.  It is good practice and it is universally accepted that adoption should take place at the earliest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power in this section was requested by the board.  I had discussions <Col N="1322" /> with them on it and I raised this argument with them: would it lead to postponement of adoption?  It is their collective judgment that it will not lead to any postponement of applications for adoptions.  They feel that the balance requires that they should have this discretion to make an order where the child is more than seven years of age.</P>
    <P>The other point mentioned by Deputy O'Malley with regard to older people has raised a question for me because, as drafted, the section merely deals with an adoption order in respect of a child who is more than seven years of age.  That is not openended after seven years because the parent Act, the 1952 Act, defines a child as meaning, save where the context otherwise requires, any person under 21 years.  In effect, what we are doing is giving the board power to make adoption orders up to a maximum of 21 years of age.  Consideration now has to be given to whether we should change the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; to &ldquo;person&rdquo; to deal with the type of case mentioned by the Deputy.  We will look at that between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister or his officials might inquire from the board whether, even if that change were made from &ldquo;child&rdquo; to &ldquo;person&rdquo;, they could do anything for a person who is so old that both his adoptive parents are long since dead.</P>
