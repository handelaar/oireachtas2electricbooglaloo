    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to change to a calendar year basis the Exchequer financial year and the local financial year, both of which years end on 31st March under existing legislation.  The Bill provides that 1975 will be the first calender financial year and the 9-months' period from 1st April, 1974, to 31st December, 1974, will be a transitional financial period for both Exchequer and local authority purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> As I mentioned in the course of my budget speech on 16th May last, the Government have also decided in principle on a similar change in the case of the income tax year.  That change is not, however, being provided for in the present Bill as it will require more lengthy preparations, but it will follow the other two changes as soon as possible.  Accordingly, for the present the income tax year will continue to end on 5th April each year.</P>
    <P>The proposed switch of the Exchequer and local years will be in our best interests in the context of EEC membership.  The calendar year is the financial year of the six original member States, and a switch by this country will facilitate the co-ordination of economic and budgetary policies which is a declared aim of the Community and is an essential aspect of the move towards economic and monetary union.  Apart from the EEC aspects, the changeover will facilitate our own budgetary preparations because much of the economic statistics and forecasts of trends which are taken into account in settling budgetary policies is already on a calendar year basis.</P>
    <P>As regard the local financial year, the proposal to change it in conjunction with the change of Exchequer year reflects the inter-relationship of local and central finances in this country. Over half of the moneys spent by local authorities and health boards is derived from State grants and the proportion may be expected to increase. It is the Government's policy to relieve the rates of liability in respect of health charges and local authority housing and the first instalment of easement towards this end was provided for by the Exchequer in the present financial year 1973-74.  The close connection between central and local finances obviously makes it desirable that the local financial year should continue to be the same as the Exchequer year.</P>
    <P>Having indicated the basic reasons for the changes proposed.  I would like to refer to the direct effects of the switch.  It is intended that the new calendar financial year will commence <Col N="191" /> to operate from 1st January, 1975. This will mean that special arrangements will need to be made to cover the nine-months' period from the close of the present financial year on 31st March next to 31st December, 1974. It is the intention to constitute this nine-months' period into a separate financial period with its own budget and accounts.  It is envisaged that the budget for this nine-months' period will be introduced into the House at about the same time of the year as budgets in the past and, similarly, the Estimates for the public services framed on a nine-months' basis will be presented to the House shortly before the budget as usual.  Also in the transitional period local authorities will strike a rate based on nine months' requirements as a necessary step towards adoption of a calendar year basis from 1975 onwards.</P>
    <P>Government Departments and local authorities will, as from 1st January, 1975, revert to 12 months accounting but will prepare their estimates of expenditure and receipts, strike the rates, in the case of local authorities, and keep their accounts on a calendar year basis.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, no doubt, have a special interest in the implications of the proposed changeover for the timing of parliamentary business.  No change will be necessary in 1974 except that all Estimates for the public services covering the nine months' period to 31st December, 1974, will need to be passed by the House before the end of December.  It will not be possible to postpone debate on Estimates until after Christmas as in recent years, as the financial period to which they relate will have closed.  As regards the period beginning on 1st January, 1975, the change of Exchequer year will necessitate revised timing for the presentation of the annual Estimates volume, the presentation of the budget, the consideration of Estimates in the House, and the taking of the annual Finance and Appropriation Bills.  Following the enactment of this Bill, I propose to arrange to have these aspects of the change of financial year referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> As regards the budget, it has been the normal practice for the Minister for Finance to present his financial statement within the first two months of the opening of the financial year. If this pattern were continued, the budget would be introduced in January or February each year from 1975 onwards.  Where there were Financial Resolutions involved it would be necessary to have the Finance Bill enacted within four months of budget day. This should not cause any difficulty despite the usual recess of the House at Easter.  The original six members of the EEC present their budgets to their parliaments in the autumn prior to the opening of the year to which they relate.  The merit in our circumstances of adopting this practice will be explored, but it may be assumed, I think, that any such further change in our financial timetable would be unlikely in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>As regards the Estimates volume, Deputies may recall that last year's report of the Informal Committee on Dáil Procedure anticipated the likelihood of a change of financial year and recommended a change in Standing Order No. 121 designed to facilitate alteration of the timing of circulation of the Estimates volume.  If their recommendation were adopted, the latest date for the presentation of the volume to the House would be altered from 30th April to the 30th day of the financial year.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill is accompanied by an explanatory memorandum I think it will suffice if I limit my description of its provisions to the general features. The principal sections are sections 2 and 3.  These sections adapt all references to financial year and local financial year contained in statutes and statutory instruments so that, as from the 1st January, 1975, they shall be taken to be references to periods coinciding with the calendar year.  The definition of the expressions &ldquo;financial year&rdquo; and &ldquo;local financial year&rdquo; contained in the Interpretation Acts will cease to have effect as from the same date.  The transitional nine-month period beginning on 1st April, 1974 and ending on 31st December, 1974, is provided for in section 4 of <Col N="193" /> the Bill.  Section 5 provides for the making of ministerial orders to effect such adaptations of provisions in various statutes and statutory instruments as may be necessary as a consequence of the change of the Exchequer and local years.  The orders will cover such matters as the adjustment of amounts or financial limits arising out of the transitional nine-month period and the modification of dates or periods for the preparation or submission of accounts, estimates or demands.  It will also be necessary to provide for revised procedures for the striking of local rates.  Section 6 provides that an order under the Bill may contain such consequential, supplementary and transitional provisions as the Minister making the order thinks fit.  Section 7 provides for the publication of such orders in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i>.  Section 8 contains two savers.  The first declares that nothing in the Bill is to be taken as enabling the rates of any tax to be altered or a new tax to be introduced. The second provides for the validation of any action that had to be taken by an official person or body before and in anticipation of the coming into force of any provision of the Bill or of the making of an order under section 5.  It is provided that such actions will have the same validity as they would have had if the relevant provision had been in force at the time of the action.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reasons indicated by the Minister in the earlier part of his speech, the previous Government had decided in principle on making this change and had arranged for consideration of the implications involved under the various headings, which clearly are widespread and complex. That examination had not been completed when we left office, but the Minister may take it on that basis that, as far as this side of the House is concerned, we are certainly in agreement in principle with this Bill, as I said, for the reasons outlined by him, that is, that, first, there are advantages to us in an EEC context in making the change, and, secondly, that many of the financial statistics with which we <Col N="194" /> work are compiled on a calendar year basis.</P>
      <P>There are, however, a number of matters on which we would like to get clarification from the Minister, and, perhaps, before I deal with those matters I might mention one or two points which are directly concerned with the text of the Bill and with which the Minister might deal when replying so that we can consider the position in relation to the next Stage.  It is a matter of drafting.  Perhaps it is perfectly in order, but to me it seems rather strange.  It appears in a few places in the Bill but I would refer the Minister to section 2 (2), lines 34 and 35 where it says:</P>
      <P>the reference shall, in relation to after the 31st day of December, 1974,</P>
      <P>That form of drafting appears in a number of places in the Bill.  I do not know whether it seems odd to the Minister but it does to me, to word it in that way: &ldquo;in relation to after&rdquo;. It seems to me that it should contain something like &ldquo;in relation to any period commencing after&rdquo;, or some such words.  It is purely a question of English I am talking about now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be, yes.  Section 6 (1) provides:</P>
      <P>an order under this Act may include such consequential, supplementary and transitional provisions as the Minister of State making the order thinks fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might well be advisable to add to that some such provision as: &ldquo;and as are necessary to apply the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;  It seems rather wide without such an addition.  In relation to orders provided for being made under this Bill, I recognise, of course, that there must be fairly widespread power to make such orders in the particular circumstances that the Minister is faced with in a <Col N="195" /> Bill such as this.  Undoubtedly problems will arise which the Minister has not yet anticipated and has not been able to, and consequently he and other Ministers need to be in a position to have fairly widespread powers to make the necessary orders.  Nevertheless, I would appreciate it if the Minister would spell out for us what he envisages in regard to section 5 (7) which provides:</P>
    <P>Subject to section 8 (1) of this Act, an order made under this section may have retrospective effect.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could explain the reason for this and, perhaps, give a few examples of the kind of thing he would have in mind it might be easier for us to accept this kind of provision which, as I say, I recognise may well be necessary.  In addition to that, in relation to the orders which may be made, as the Minister has pointed out, there are two savers in the Bill. The first which is only right and proper, is that nothing in the Bill is to be taken as enabling the rate of any tax to be altered or a new tax to be introduced.  It is correct that there should be such a restriction.  The second saver is that actions taken by an official person or body before and in anticipation of the coming into force of any provision in the Bill or the making of an order shall have the same validity as they would have had if the relevant provision had been enforced at the time of the action.</P>
    <P>I could visualise a situation in which this power might be necessary but it would be helpful if the Minister would spell it out because, on the face of it, it is an unusual provision and one we should not accept lightly because it appears to be giving power to officials of public bodies to make lawful things which at the time they do them are unlawful.  That is all very well if what they do is something formal in preparation for the changeover of the financial year but we want to satisfy ourselves that the power being given will be confined to such formal matters and will not allow anybody, under cover of this provision, to take action to which strong <Col N="196" /> objection could be taken and which might not be necessary, strictly speaking, in pursuance of this Bill but which would obtain validity under this provision which it would not otherwise have.</P>
    <P>So much for the actual provisions on the face of the Bill at the moment, but there are some other matters that I want to mention and which we would like the Minister to clarify for us.  First, I believe it is very important that special efforts should be made to inform the public of what is happening in relation to the transitional period of nine months.  There is a grave danger that, on the one hand, people might think, for instance in regard to local rates, when they get a bill it is for a year's rates when, in fact, it is only for nine months. They might be very much misled and in the following year might feel there was an enormous jump in the rates. On the other hand, there is a danger &mdash;to be realistic we must recognise this&mdash;that some local authorities might be tempted in these circumstances to increase rates in a way they would be slow to do if a full year were involved but there is only a nine months period and the increase might not, therefore, be obvious to the ratepayers. Perhaps this would not happen &mdash;I hope it would not&mdash;but it would be unrealistic to think some local authorities would not be tempted to make it happen and we should do what we can to ensure, particularly by publicising what is involved in the transitional period, that this temptation is resisted.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is well aware, legally rates are payable in two moieties and I am sure he is equally well aware that in many cases people pay the second moiety although it is legally due on 1st October, very often in February or March, the last month of the local authority's financial year.  In such cases, and in particular in relation to certain types of ratepayers, farmers and others whose income pattern is geared to this type of payment, the demand for payment of the second moiety prior to the 31st December&mdash; which will be involved in the transitional period&mdash;may present hardship. There is also the problem that people <Col N="197" /> who have traditionally paid their second moiety in March will, under the transitional nine months from 1st April to the end of the calendar year, be called on to pay three moieties in a period of approximately ten months, that is the second moiety of the second year's rates in March, the first moiety of the transitional nine months in April, May or June and then the second moiety of the transitional period any time from 1st October even to December.  This means the three moieties of rates being paid in a period of approximately 10 months which could create hardship.</P>
    <P>I know it is very difficult to deal with this situation; it is one of the inherent difficulties in the changeover. It is difficult certainly on a legal basis but I think it is possible for the Minister or his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to take special steps to direct local authorities and rate collectors to exercise the discretion they are entitled to exercise in regard to insisting on payment of rates at a particular time.  It would be appropriate in relation to this transitional period that any discretion that can be exercised in the case of ratepayers who are suffering genuine hardship as a result of the changeover, should be exercised on a much wider and, perhaps, more sympathetic scale than is normally possible for local authorities and rate collectors.  There is a special problem here for ratepayers and there is no use in trying to blind ourselves to the fact that it does create special problems.</P>
    <P>One could argue on the strict legality of the matter and imagine there is not a problem but there is, in practice, a problem and there will be for a number of ratepayers.  That being so, it behoves the Minister or his colleague the Minister for Local Government in so far as they can do so, to ensure that ratepayers who suffer hardship as a result of this are not harried and hounded by local authorities or rate collectors in the special circumstances which will arise.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister referred to the reduction of the charge on the rates for health services.  I am trying to find the reference but what I have <Col N="198" /> in mind in that connection is that we would like to know authoritatively from the Minister&mdash;because there have been some conflicting statements at certain local authority meetings&mdash; what precise arrangements are proposed in regard to the relief of health and housing charges in relation to the transitional nine months period. Some people have suggested that the amount of relief should be 25 per cent.  Others apparently have said that it will only be 12½ per cent.  We would like to know precisely from the Minister what is intended in this regard.</P>
    <P>A substantial proportion of local authorities' outgoings relate to loan charges which are at the moment paid on a yearly basis.  We would like to know what precisely is to happen in regard to those charges, in particular repayments to the Local Loans Fund, during the transitional nine month period.  We would like to be assured that the repayments will be in proportion to the nine months and that there will not be demands for a full year's payment of charges in the nine months period.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that although this Bill does not provide for the changeover of the income tax year to the calendar year it is intended to do this in the longer term. I should like the Minister to spell out more precisely what the difficulties are in relation to making that changeover. He will, I think, agree that on the face of it is inappropriate and possibly confusing to have a situation in which all the financial years of the Government, public bodies, local authorities and so on are the calendar year but in relation to income tax that we would still cling to the old financial year.  I can see considerable difficulties and confusion arising in regard to this and we would certainly favour, if it were at all possible, the changing of the income tax year at the same time.  The Minister has indicated that there are difficulties involved.  I appreciate that but if he would outline some of the difficulties we might, perhaps, be more reconciled to leaving this apparent anomaly to which we are not very reconciled <Col N="199" /> at the moment because we can see difficulties arising from it.</P>
    <P>I wonder could the Minister indicate to us what will be the precise position in the House here and in our procedure in relation to the transitional period under the Appropriation Bill. At the moment when the necessary Financial Resolutions are passed this provides, in practice, the necessary money up to Christmas and then the balance is provided when the Estimate for each Department is passed. Perhaps the Minister would spell out for us how this will operate in the nine months transitional period.  In other words, what will be the effect? Will it be that if the budget is introduced, let us say in April and the necessary Financial Resolutions are passed that will cover the whole requirement up to 31st December and that thereafter we will then apply the Appropriation Bill as he has indicated in the calendar year?  If that is so, then I appreciate that that is the position but I want to be absolutely certain that that is so.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister why we should not adopt the procedure adopted by the original six members of the EEC by having an autumn budget, at least in the short term. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The original six members of the EEC present their budgets to their parliaments in the autumn prior to the opening of the year to which they relate.  The merit in our circumstances of adopting this practice will be explored, but it may be assumed, I think, that any such further change in our financial timetable would be unlikely in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I can see certain objections, perhaps, to that procedure but the Minister will appreciate that if we are going to make changes which will cause a certain amount of upheaval no matter how well it is organised it would be better to make any changes that have to be made now and not to face us with a further change at some time in the future.  In so far as co-ordination with our EEC partners is <Col N="200" /> concerned it would appear that under this Bill we are only going part of the road and not going the whole way. It can be argued, of course, that on the basis proposed in this Bill at least our financial year statistics and so on will be on a calendar year basis and will, therefore, be comparable but we would appreciate it if the Minister would indicate what the problems would be for us if we were to adopt the same procedure in relation to autumn budgets as the original six in the EEC and why, if we are going to make changes as we are under this Bill, we should not go the whole hog and make that change.</P>
    <P>Subject to these various queries that I have put, we favour the principle involved in this Bill but we recognise that there can be considerable difficulties involved in its implementation. We wish to ensure that those difficulties are kept to a minimum, and that any steps that are open will be taken to minimise not only difficulties but in particular hardship for individual ratepayers.  We would like to hear the Minister in regard to these various points so that we can consider what he has to say, consider our position and consider whether or not we would wish to put down any amendments to this Bill on the next Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill may be essential because of our entry to the EEC.  Deputy Colley has covered many of the points I wished to make.  Coming from a rural area, I should like to emphasise that we are to have a transitional period in one of the worst years the farmers have had in a long time.  Three moieties of rates may have to be paid in the one year.  The Minister said yesterday that everybody had more money in his pocket this year than last year.  I state very definitely that farmers have not got more money in their pockets.  I can speak with authority, as a farmer.  This was a disastrous year for farmers.  I do not know who is responsible.  I shall not blame anybody, but it is wrong to say that farmers have more money this year.  Rates were traditionally paid in October and March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers sell grass-fed cattle in <Col N="201" /> October.  It is usual that animals the farmer has been feeding during the winter months are sold in March.  It can be said that the rates are due when the county council strike the rate but the first moiety was never paid until September and the second moiety, which was due on 1st October, was never paid until March.  Those with small valuations may be in a position to pay their rates in November. It can be said that the people I am referring to, the small farmers, do not pay rates in respect of their land but it should be remembered that they must pay rates in respect of the buildings on their land.</P>
    <P>In my county the rate has gone to over £7 in the £ and farmers must pay that full rate in respect of their buildings. For this reason I should like to see this legislation postponed.  However, I am not pressing this because my party is not opposed to the legislation. In my view this is the worst year for this transitional period.  At present there are too many cattle being offered for sale.  Farmers are anxious to sell them because it costs a minimum of £1 per day to keep them.  The gates at Athenry mart last week were closed early because of the big number of cattle offered for sale.</P>
    <P>It will be said that the price of cattle will increase but it should be remembered that they will have to be cared for the 28 days in February and 31 days in March.  If the price increases in April it would want to be in the region of £60 per beast to cover the cost of feeding them for the months of February and March.  At present hay is costing £1 per bale and nuts have increased by £75 per ton. When I objected in this House to an £8 tariff on calves last summer I was told there was a scarcity of cattle in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is saying is of very great interest but I am anxious that the Deputy would relate his remarks more closely to the measure now under discussion, the Exchequer and Local Financial Years Bill, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating my <Col N="202" /> remarks to the ability of the farmer to pay three moieties in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made his point in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am explaining why the farmers have not the money to pay three moieties as they will have to from April 1974 to December of the same year.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries made a statement recently to the effect that the reason cattle were so cheap was that there were a million more cattle in the country but when I asked a question in relation to the price of cattle I was informed that there was a scarcity.</P>
      <P>Cattle prices are very bad at present and it is for this reason that I am concerned about the fact that farmers will have to pay three moieties this year.  The question of the loan charges is another important matter.  How will they be fitted in?  In my view the change in the system of paying rates will prove very awkward particularly for the farming community.  I accept that there is a lot to be said in favour of having the financial year ending on 31st December but the transitional period is at the wrong time.  I believe it has been agreed in principle by the Government that the income tax year should be changed but it is a pity that this could not be done right now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this legislation was left over for one year it is possible prices would improve and the circumstances of the people would improve so that they would be in a better position to meet these demands.  It has been stated that the people in this country have more money in their pockets this year than ever before but the farming community have not got the money.  They have gone through a very bad year and to ask them to pay three moieties of rates in one year is a bit too much. The Minister should make arrangements with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to have some easing in the collection of these rates. There will be a temptation by the local authorities who are budgeting for nine months only to put 1p or 2p on.  The rates this year, because they will only cover nine months, will not be very high, but the following year I <Col N="203" /> believe they will soar.  I have no objection to the change but I believe the Minister picked on a wrong year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with Deputy Callanan's point first.  It would be a matter in the future, as in the past, for rate collectors to decide how to collect the rates.  As the Deputy is aware, at the moment rates are payable in respect of the first moiety on demand and in respect of the second moiety on the 1st October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not paid that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the law. Many people pay them then or within a certain time afterwards.  Indeed rate collectors use many devices to secure early payment because the sooner they receive payment the higher commission they earn.  A large number of people pay their rates earlier than the end of March or December.  I accept there is a difficulty as far as the farming community is concerned but the present practice in relation to the farming community is one that has arisen because of consideration in rural areas of the peak periods of income which farmers have.  I do not see any reason for a change in that.  It will be a matter for each local authority to adopt its own procedures for the collection of its own rates.</P>
      <P>Of course, local authorities, if they do not obtain payment of the rate when it becomes due, are obliged then to resort to borrowing, and borrowing as we know today can be a most costly process.  Many local authorities in recent years have been expediting the pace at which they collect the rates because by so doing they are able to reduce the rates.  The alternative to early payment is heavy borrowing which in turn has to be loaded on to the rates.  It would be a matter for each local authority to consider these things within its own sphere of influence and knowledge.  We do not see why the change in the financial or local year should in any way bring about any difficulties or any additional burdens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> When people say there will be three moieties this year they are overstating the case.  Many people have already paid their rates for 1973/74 and they will not be involved in any payment at all in respect of this local year.</P>

      <P>When the Deputy was talking about the difficulty of paying rates because of farm incomes going down I assumed he was referring to farmers who were liable to rates in respect of their agricultural holdings but I accept what he now states.  The balance which would become payable under law in 1974 will only be in respect of three-quarters of the year and, therefore, instalments of a much smaller sum are involved. It is not a sum for a 12-month period but it will be for each local representative to make his own case for his own area for such measures of relief as he considers to be appropriate having regard to this change.  Both Deputies Colley and Callanan said they thought it a pity that we were not proceeding also to have the income tax year coinciding with the proposed financial year which is in accordance with the calendar year. The Deputies cannot have it both ways.  They maintain we are creating difficulties and adding to the burden of payments that people will have to make because of our moving towards the financial year in respect of rates while at the same time they are saying we should make the change also in respect of income tax.  According to the Deputies' arguement would that not create a burden for people who would have to pay their income tax in full before the 31st December of this year?</P>

      <P>As to the possibility of adopting the original Six EEC practice of having budgets in the autumn rather than in the spring, perhaps, there is some misunderstanding as to what EEC budgets in the autumn are all about.  Mainly, they concern debates on estimated expenditure and revenue but in most cases it is not possible for EEC countries any more than it would be possible for us to announce in the autumn the tax changes that were to take place as and from the 1st of the following January.  In particular, it would not be possible to announce in advance what changes were to take place in respect of excise because to do this would result in massive purchases prior to the coming into effect of the changes.  However, it is something I am having a look at.  There is much to be said for considering the forthcoming financial year in advance rather than considering it eight weeks or more after the date of commencement of the financial year.  Obviously, it is preferable to plan ahead.  Perhaps the need for that is greatest when we are in a period of growth and when we need to set targets not only for the year but for the years ahead but it is something it would be unreasonable to bring in this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a number of difficulties mainly for parts of the public sector as a result of the changes we are making and we shall have to do in nine months a great deal of what normally we would spread over a 12 month period.  This applies to several sectors and not merely the individuals or companies that will be affected directly.  For example, the Valuation Office will have to prepare their valuation lists earlier than has been the practice up to now.  The same problem will arise also in relation to local authorities and Government Departments who will have to prepare their <Col N="206" /> estimates ahead of normal schedules. Therefore, there will be quite an amount of pressure without our adding to it by any further change at this stage.  It may well be that in the light of experience it will be found desirable to modify some of our present procedures.  I think the best way of reaching the right decisions is to make the changes proposed now and see how they work out.</P>
    <P>I was asked specifically to identify some of the difficulties in regard to changing the income tax year.  We have discussed this question at considerable length with the Revenue Commissioners and we are satisfied that there is a great deal more study to be done in this area because of the complexities of the whole income tax code.  As Deputies will be aware, in 1967 there was a special income tax Act for the purpose of consolidating the income tax laws.  The Act alone is larger in volume than the total of all other legislation passed in 1967. That is an indication of the tremendous studies that must be made before any change in the income tax year could be brought about.  We are looking at the matter and in any event it would be preferable that the business world would become accustomed to such changes as may be required by reason of the changes in the financial year before they would be plunged into the much more complex changes that would result from a change in the income tax year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the legal difficulties involved but would there be any practical difficulties for the taxpayer if a change were to be brought about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The practical difficulties would be no more or no less than those the Deputy referred to in relation to the collection of rates.  In respect of those persons who come within the PAYE system there would not be any significant difference because they pay by instalments in any event.  There is another difficulty which in our particular situation is not inconsiderable and that is in relation to the double taxation agreements we have.  The one which is most <Col N="207" /> material in our circumstances is that with Britain.  As yet, there is no indication from Britain of any change in their income tax year.  They are slow enough in regard to changing their financial year.  Therefore, any change contemplated by us would involve negotiating a change in our double taxation agreements but, then, if Britain proceeded towards a change in the income tax year we would have to re-negotiate.  Therefore, perhaps it is best to wait a while and see what happens but I would anticipate that a change would come about eventually.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley raised the question of section 8 (2).  He considers it to be too sweeping to provide for the validation of acts in advance of the legislation. I can understand his concern here but would point out that validity will be given only to something done in pursuance of this Act and that anything done beyond the scope of this Act which is not necessary to achieve the purpose of the Act, that is, to change the financial and local year, would be <i>ultra vires</i> and would not be in any way saved by this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the advice I am giving the Deputy and it is not in conflict with any advice I might receive. Deputy Colley, too, expressed some doubts in relation to section 6. I suppose one's attitude towards life changes when one changes position in <Col N="208" /> this House.  The Decimal Currency Act of 1970 had a section which is similar to section 6 here.  Section 10 (2) of that Act says that an order under this section may include such consequential, supplementary and transitional provisions as the Minister making the order thinks fit.  In the Bill before us there is a reference to the Minister for State.  That is the only change there is between the two sections.  Again, the Minister's power to make such orders extends only to the authority conferred by this Act and does not allow him to make any order beyond the scope of the Act. If the Minister were to go outside the scope of the Act his action would be open to immediate challenge.</P>
      <P>In dealing with section 8, I overlooked referring to some of the areas of difficulty which in our opinion need to be covered.  For instance, local authorities and other statutory bodies are required, some by statute, and others by order to prepare estimates and accounts at a certain time and to operate within a certain financial year and so on.</P>
      <P>In order to prepare for the nine-month period, which admittedly is comparatively short, it has been necessary for a number of these organisations to start gearing their administration and adopting estimates to meet the requirements of the transitional period.  In some cases they have had to make changes in their procedures. While in some cases they have been able to make the necessary changes under existing legal provisions there have been other cases where the procedures are such that it will be after the event that changes can be validated. We thought it necessary and desirable to validate what might have already occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Colley knows, the Office of Public Works have to issue estimates and demands to local authorities each year in relation to arterial drainage.  The demands for the new year had to be made in December, 1973, on a nine-months basis.  It is necessary to give such demands full legal validity.  Rating authorities have to hold their statutory estimates meetings and because of the dates of these <Col N="209" /> meetings to anticipate the transitional short period a number of the local bodies have held statutory meetings already and have had to make certain decisions as a consequence of having those meetings.  This umbrella provision will provide that all such actions are valid.</P>
    <P>As I want to emphasise, it will be only valid if it is done in pursuance of the objectives of the Act.  I trust that that covers the points which the Deputies raised.  I should like to express my appreciation of the manner in which they have received and discussed the Bill.  I am sure that if there are any other difficulties we will be able to resolve them in the course of the passage of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill covers its main purpose and scope.  I would like to emphasise that the Bill, while proposing to broaden the general road powers of local authorities, to confer on them powers to construct, maintain, and improve motorways, and to empower me to take steps for the co-ordination of works on national roads and motorways, is merely an enabling measure.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill do not seek to set up special financial arrangements under which programmes for motorways and national roads could be launched.  The financing of such programmes must continue to be contingent on the amounts which the Government may, from time to time, decide should be made available either for these specific purposes or for roads purposes generally.  This is not to say that the Government are unmindful of the needs of the roads system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware from my speech on my Department's Estimates, an additional £4½ million was made available for the roads programme this year over and above what was provided by my predecessors last year.  This is a generous and practical demonstration of the Government's recognition of the need for substantial investment in the improvement and maintenance of our public road network.  I am sure there is little need for me to remind the House of the heavy growth in the volume of traffic using our roads in recent years and of the serious problems which this growth has created. Within the ten years from 1963 to 1973, the number of vehicles using our roads has increased by 69 per cent from 382,038 to 646,205.  The greater <Col N="212" /> bulk of all travel for agricultural, commercial and social purposes is now effected by road and the provision and maintenance of a safe and efficient road network is essential for such purposes.  At the same time we have not managed to keep pace with the demands of this increasing traffic and, as a result, our existing road network has been operating under severe limitations.</P>
    <P>Sections of our important national network, particularly on the approaches to towns and cities are critically deficient both as regards pavement and capacity and the extent of the problems posed by traffic congestion on most of our urban and city streets needs no elaboration.  This situation is the source of serious economic loss to the community resulting from traffic accidents, time lost through traffic congestion, extra fuel consumed and losses resulting from wear and tear on vehicles and parts.</P>
    <P>Apart from the scarcity of financial resources, there have been other constraints inhibiting the pursuit of an effective and progressive roads programme.  The law relating to public roads has not been reviewed in any detail since 1925 and, as a result, the powers of road authorities are defective and inadequate in a number of important respects.  The present Bill, which I hope to follow in due course with a comprehensive measure, is the first step in remedying this situation.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the wide general power which section 3 of the Bill proposes to confer on road authorities, that is, to do all things necessary for or incidental to the maintenance, construction or improvement of public roads, will be welcomed by road authorities as it will enable them to be more flexible and effective in their efforts to provide a reasonable level of service to road users from the aspects of safety, convenience and amenity.  In effect these provisions should mean the end of the doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i> in so far as road authorities' activities are concerned.  A major defect in existing roads law is the absence of power to build a motorway.  This type of facility is <Col N="213" /> accepted in all developed countries as the proper means of dealing with heavy traffic volumes with maximum safety.  In fact, the stage has already been reached where, due to the volumes of traffic being carried, the need to plan for the provision of such facilities on certain sections of our road network has been established.  A motorway has two essential characteristics, for example, it is limited as to use since only vehicular traffic of specified classes may use it and access to it is prohibited except at recognised properly designed junctions or interchanges. All our public roads are &ldquo;all purpose&rdquo; roads which may be used by all classes of traffic, including pedestrians, cyclists, and animals and, in addition, under the common law, all landowners have a right of access to or from the adjoining public road from any point on their property. There is no provision in existing roads law which would enable road authorities to deal adequately with the problem of control of access for the purposes of providing a motorway. Accordingly, the Bill makes specific provision in this regard in sections 6 and 8.</P>
    <P>One particular motorway project which is at present in issue is the proposal of the Dublin County Council for replacement of a section of the Dublin-Belfast national primary route (N.1.) between the city and a point beyond the airport for which land reservations have been made by the council.  A compulsory purchase order which proposes to authorise the council to acquire the necessary land for the project was made in 1971, but cannot be dealt with until the present Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>Other motorway proposals will be developed by road authorities from studies and surveys which have been completed or which are at present in progress.  In this connection, Deputies will be aware that the Government have recently given approval in principle to a proposal for the provision of a motorway bridge across the Liffey. This bridge and approaches is one of the key elements in the comprehensive programme recommended in the Dublin Transportation Study to meet <Col N="214" /> the projected needs of the Dublin region over the next 20 years.  While the bridge and its approaches can be regarded as a self-contained project which would independently afford substantial improvement of traffic flows in central city areas, its actual benefits will be much wider as it will also provide access to the proposed new roads to Dublin Airport and the west and to a new Fairview by-pass.  In addition, surveys in relation to the Dublin-Kilcock road which are at present being undertaken by the road authorities concerned, may lead to the development of motorway proposals for sections of that road.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the question of co-ordination of works on national roads and motorways.  As time goes on such works will tend to be larger in scale and increasingly complex.  In some cases it is foreseen that schemes of road improvement on these roads will traverse the areas of more than one road authority.  It will be clear that proper co-ordination of all stages of the formulation, planning, and execution of the works is essential so that the best return will be got for the expenditure in terms of economy, efficiency and uniformity.</P>
    <P>The provisions of sections 11, 12 and 13 of the Bill will enable me to take steps to achieve these desirable objectives.  I would emphasise, however, that it is my intention to resort to these powers only after consultation with the road authorities concerned and, with particular reference to sections 12 and 13, where I am satisfied that a conflict of views or interests at local level cannot be settled by agreement.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in what is now becoming the usual position of being asked to comment on legislation that was in the process of preparation at the time I left the Department of Local Government.  From the studies I made of the whole roads problem while in the Department, I realised that the law dealing with public roads, including that dealing with the powers, functions and duties of road authorities, is very complex, as the Minister tried <Col N="215" /> to indicate in his introductory speech. It is a patchwork of common law on the one hand and statute law on the other.  From my investigations into the law in connection with this matter, it was obvious that there was need for a revision and the introduction of modern legislation to consolidate all the roads law.  In fact, the statute law ranges back as far as 1836 and, although there have been some amendments made from time to time, inevitably there are still gaps.  As we know, doubts have arisen from time to time regarding the real authority of the Minister and local authorities in relation to matters arising from the construction, maintenance and improvement of roads.</P>
      <P>The inadequacies in the existing legislation arise chiefly in relation to the powers of road authorities.  There are certain important powers about which doubts have arisen, such as the powers to provide dual carriageways which have already been challenged; there are certain other powers also in doubt, including the power to build motorways which it has become obvious in recent years are becoming a necessity in some areas.  Because of this doubt it was necessary to introduce legislation to clarify the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put on record that the Fianna Fáil Government recognised many of these difficulties as far back as 1969.  At that time a major decision was made instructing the Minister for Local Government to carry out a thorough review of all roads law and to prepare a comprehensive roads Bill which, as well as providing the additional powers that would be required, would also remedy the defects in the existing law and effect a measure of consolidation.  As the Minister has rightly pointed out, a difficulty arose in Dublin where the county council had issued a compulsory purchase order for the acquisition of land to enable them to construct a motorway on the Dublin-Belfast road between Santry and the turn-off for Dublin Airport.  A doubt arose in relation to their legal powers to acquire land for the motorway.  At that time it was decided by the Fianna <Col N="216" /> Fáil Government to proceed with the preparation of a shorter Bill that would confer adequate powers on the road authorities to enable them to construct, maintain and improve motorways.  It would also enable the Minister to issue certain directions to the road authorities in relation to the co-ordination, planning and execution of works on national roads and motorways.</P>
    <P>It was our intention to proceed with the general roads Bill referred to by me as a follow-up to the shorter roads Bill.  I am pleased to note the Minister has stated that is his intention also and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss the whole question of roads policy in the not too distant future. However, although I look forward to the opportunity for a comprehensive debate on this matter, the Bill provided the Minister with the opportunity for some elaboration on the Coalition Government's policy in relation to roads generally.  I do not think the Minister availed of this opportunity in his introductory statement and I do not know whether he intends to do so before the debate concludes.  I would encourage him to elaborate a bit more on his intentions.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of road policies on which the Government have been so far very silent.  One is the question of road reclassification.  I hope the Minister will avail of this opportunity to try to tell us where exactly the Government stand on this matter.  Our national roads have already been designated and the national primary and national secondary routes have been established.  I should like the Minister to tell the House whether it is his intention to classify the roads which it was intended to form into a regional network. I am sure the Minister is aware that quite an amount of consultation has gone on between the Departmental officials on behalf of the Minister and the various local authorities.  This happened prior to the selection of regional roads.  I hope the Minister will let us know whether it is his intention to proceed with the classification of regional roads, as it was intended.</P>

      <Col N="217" /> It is significant that in his four page introductory speech the Minister left possibly the most important powers in the Bill to a brief paragraph at the end.  It is true to say that the Minister is taking unto himself quite elaborate powers under sections 11, 12 and 13 of the Bill.  However, we can come to that in detail during Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>When the Minister approves a scheme under section 4 (3), modified or otherwise, the relevant subsection states that the scheme shall have the same effect as if it were a compulsory purchase order under section 10 (1) of the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960.  At this point I should like to ask the Minister to explain whether the procedures in relation to the making and the approving of that scheme will be in every way identical with the CPO process.  I hope the Minister will elaborate on that.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of this Bill which will raise great difficulty and public concern is the whole question of compensation and under section 6 (5) it is indicated that persons who claim to have suffered some disturbance or depreciation in value will have the opportunity to claim compensation.  I should like the Minister to elaborate more on this when he is replying&mdash; whether the system of claiming compensation will be exactly the same as that under the CPO process, whether, if agreement is not reached between the authority and the individual, and if it goes to an arbitrator, it is present day market values that will be paid in relation to land that is being acquired. Where houses are concerned, where a person's residence is being interfered with, if he is obliged to leave the area, will the Minister assure the House that such a person will be fully compensated by way of the construction of a completely new house at an alternative location with similar amenities?</P>
    <P>It has been the experience in England and in other countries where motorways have been constructed, especially where they have gone through urban areas, where they are interfering with dwellinghouses, though some householders are not directly in the line of the proposed <Col N="218" /> motorway but their houses are very close to and adjacent to the motorway, because of the density of traffic and the consequent noise and fumes and other disturbing features caused by the high volume of traffic, the amenities they enjoy in that environment are seriously deteriorated.  Some people who find themselves in such circumstances may not consider that they would wish to live in such conditions and decide to move, even though the house might not be demolished.  I should like the Minister to give an assurance that persons who find themselves in such circumstances because of this Bill will be compensated. I hope also he will give some idea of the machinery through which compensation will be assessed in such cases.</P>
    <P>It is easy for us to pass legislation like this.  It seems short, necessary and worthwhile, but it can have very serious effects on the lives of certain individuals in its implementation. Now is the time for us to give assurances to such people that they will be fully and fairly dealt with under any steps taken following the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 8 (3) and (4) the Minister is asking for authority to revoke planning permission if it is found that it exists in respect of ground to be included in a scheme. Again, I ask the Minister to give an assurance as to the exact machinery to be employed to assess compensation to people who have legitimately received planning permission and who find that permission subsequently revoked under this section where a scheme is being made.  There is also the difficulty in relation to persons who have outline planning permission but had not proceeded to the stage of applying for full planning permission. They may find their outline permission has been revoked.  When it comes to assessing compensation for those persons I should like to know whether there will be any distinction between the value of the outline planning permission and of the full planning approval.  I should like to get from the Minister also the amount of the compensation to be paid.  Is it to <Col N="219" /> be based on the market value of the property in respect of which planning permission has been given at the time at which the scheme is made?  These are very important and pertinent questions and we cannot be expected to accept the Bill <i>in toto</i> without assurances on such matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt very quickly with sections 11, 12 and 13.  Under these sections completely new powers are being taken by the Minister.  At the moment, confusion between the common law and statute law raises difficulties but I wonder is it necessary to seek such sweeping powers in the future to overcome the difficulties which are there at present or which can be anticipated.  Under these sections it is clear that the Minister can authorise that a scheme be drawn up. One of the sections provides that if the Minister finds that a local authority are not complying or are refusing to comply with a direction from him, he can draw up a scheme himself with effect similar to CPO.  The section says that following consultation the Minister can draw up a scheme. That is a very sweeping authority.  If the Minister so wishes, all of the roads constructed under this Bill could be carried out under his direction, under his instruction, without the participation of local road authorities in any way whatsoever. Consultation can be a very nebulous thing.  The Minister can consult but he need not be satisfied after consultation, which need not take very long, and he can decide to proceed in his own way.</P>
    <P>In being asked to accept this Bill, I think the public should be aware and the members of the local authority should be aware that the Minister for Local Government is seeking supreme powers in relation to the construction of motorways and national roads under this Bill so that they will not be under any illusions as to what his intentions are. The whole question of whether it is proper and correct that the Minister should have these powers, or that he should, in fact, establish an authority <Col N="220" /> to carry out the planning, designing and construction of these major highways, is a matter on which the House is entitled to some explanation from him.  I am sure he is aware of the document published by the Civil Engineering Contractors' Association, which was prepared by the Construction Industry Federation in October, 1973 entitled <i>Building a National Road System&mdash;a New Approach</i>.  I should like to quote from page one of that document and when the Minister is replying, perhaps, he will let us know where he stands in this matter:</P>
    <P>At the present time most of the thirty-one local authorities (Dublin Corporation being the main exception) carry out the work of road construction on a piecemeal basis by the system of direct labour whereby each local authority employs its own work force to carry out the work which is designed and supervised by its own engineering staffs.  The building of modern roads, however, and in particular the construction of a national highway network, is a massive undertaking in both civil engineering and administrative terms requiring the most sophisticated design and planning techniques and a high degree of skilled execution.  Within the present system, however, planning tends to be on a county rather than a regional or national basis which seriously inhibits the achievement of optimum standards of design and alignment in the overall route. We believe that the requirements of national route planning, design and skilled execution of the work can best be achieved under a national roads authority which would be responsible for the planning, programming and design of national highway routes.</P>
    <P>I would like some clarification from the Minister whether this Government favour a national roads authority or whether they favour the continuance of the existing system where each local authority is a roads authority in its own right and performs these functions under the overall general direction given by the Department of <Col N="221" /> Local Government but where most of the planning and execution of the work is under the control of the local authority and the county engineer is the person mostly involved in overseeing the construction.  There is a very big principle involved here.</P>
    <P>It is obvious in the Bill that the Minister is seeking power which would enable him to establish a roads authority but he is not making it very clear whether, in fact, statutory responsibility for roads, which is at present vested in road authorities, will be affected in any way by this Bill.  The Minister was rather cautious in his opening statement when he dealt with the question of finance.  I suppose he got good warning from his colleague, the Minister for Finance, not to create the impression abroad that unlimited finance would be available immediately to undertake the immediate construction of a motorway on a massive scale.  It is a wise precaution to include it there but it would have been more helpful if the Minister had given us some indication of the Government's policy in relation to the future financing of roads.</P>
    <P>I understand some EEC regulations may have some influence on our method of road financing in the future.  I hope the Minister in his reply will indicate in what way and when, if ever, the EEC regulations will affect the financing of road construction in this country and whether any approaches have been made by his Department or any member of the Government on behalf of his Department to secure special funds from the EEC for the construction of motorways in particular.  The investment in roads is very important.  I agree with most of the other sentiments in the Minister's statement about the capacity of our roads and the substantial increase in traffic.  It is obvious that a heavy investment is needed and it is obvious from what he said that this legislation is needed if rapid progress is to be made.  I believe we could make a very strong case to the EEC to obtain money from the regional fund or the social fund for the construction of roads.</P>
    <P>This would help to open up the <Col N="222" /> undeveloped parts of the country where we experience great difficulty in attracting new industry.  It is my belief that a proper road network into the west of Ireland would contribute more to the industrial development of that area than any other single measure the Government could take.  I am happy to see the Minister acknowledging that work is continuing on the surveying and designing of the first section of such a motorway to the west on the Kilcock/Dublin stretch.  I hope he will give us some indication of the time scale he has in mind in relation to the construction of these motorways.  I realise from the time you make a decision to construct a motorway until the first vehicle travels along it 15 to 20 years can elapse.  Therefore, it is important that we should make positive decisions now if we are to see a good road network in a reasonable length of time.</P>
    <P>The acquisition process can be very lengthy and can involve the Minister or local authorities in complex legal action which can delay his best intention.  Delay in designing these roads and deciding where exactly they will be is not to the advantage of the country.  I hope the Minister can give us some indication of the time scale of these motorways and where he sees the priority.  There is mention in the Bill of the short motorway in the Dublin area from Santry to Dublin Airport.  That seems to be the only positive decision so far so I hope the Minister will give us a clear indication of his intentions when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to welcome this Bill and, like Deputy Molloy, I would like clarification on a couple of points.  The Bill is designed to speed up the construction of roads and motorways and in that regard it can be seen as the answer to an engineer's prayer.  However, from the point of view of the landowners, where land acquisition will take place it requires, as Deputy Molloy said, some clarification as to how this will be achieved.  Up to this when a local authority embarked on a new road scheme it was open to the engineers involved to approach <Col N="223" /> landowners and make as good a deal as they could with as many of them as possible although there may have been one or two who held up a particular scheme pending a compulsory purchase order.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister when a scheme is being drawn up, under this Bill, is the power to approach landowners and purchase the land in advance to be abolished or will this system continue?  I can see considerable difficulties from the financial point of view if the old provision is done away with because once the notice appears that a scheme has been drawn up you could get a lobby of farmers involved who would come together on the site, decide what their price would be and would not depart from it.  It is essential that the compensation for land, especially in the case of a motorway, is very carefully looked at.  If you take the section which deals with the positive exclusion of access to motorways you can find a farmer with a substantial farm with a motorway going through it.  His farm can be left in very small pieces over a couple of miles of road without any means of access to the land.  This point is as important as that made by Deputy Molloy about houses where planning permission already exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reside in a county which carries the bulk of the traffic west and south. The necessity for very quick action in the provision of motorways in such an area is very apparent.  In many counties the local road work force would be incapable of carrying out the jobs which are urgently needed. I should like to hear of any proposals the Minister might have in his Department or of any recommendations to local authorities for carrying out major schemes.  Part of the Naas-Dublin dual carriageway was constructed under contract but nevertheless it is true to say that we have not got a contract system as such whereby a contractor can be called upon, or tenders invited from such people, to construct major road works.  This will continue to be the case unless there is some system whereby there will be a <Col N="224" /> continuation of work when one scheme is finished and the contractor will not have to disband his work force and have his machinery lying idle waiting for another job.  It is advisable that a key work force be adequately maintained with sufficient work.  There is work on roads for a great many years before they even reach the present day required standards.</P>
    <P>Realising how congested our provincial towns are with traffic, one can realise the glaring necessity that they be by-passed.  A short time ago if one mentioned by-passing a town he would not want to be a candidate for the local authority.  There would be an outcry that business would be lost.  We are rapidly approaching the time where business will be lost due to the fact that people in the hinterlands are unable to find parking facilities in the town due to the volume of traffic. Consequently, the business done by passing traffic, which was considerable a few years ago, is now non-existent.</P>
    <P>During the weeks when we were supposed to have had a petrol shortage, it was evident that there was no reduction in traffic.  Speed may not have been so great but the volume of traffic seemed to me to be as great as ever, and it is rising every day.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify these points in his reply.  I hope that Deputy Molloy's forecast of what can happen from the point of decision to the point of actually using the motorway&mdash;that it could be as long as 20 years&mdash;is without any foundation.  I hope we will see a vast improvement, which is so urgently necessary, taking place as soon as this Bill passes through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to discuss this Bill as it will affect planning and development.  This is provided for in section 8, which I will discuss later.  The long term provisions of this Bill are very much for the future.  It is no harm for a Government to try to visualise what the motive power will be in the next ten years, or how much of the conventional motive power will be then available, because we must remember <Col N="225" /> that by the time the full provisions of this Bill are in operation it will have cost the State many millions of pounds.  There is a short-term need for some of the provisions of this Bill. This is a Bill which, with additions which may be made from time to time, will give this country the means for a proper transport system.  What will that transport system be?  What will the motive power for that system be?  Will it be petrol or oil?  If not, there is a very large question mark indeed.  That is a problem for the Minister.  He may wish to refer to it.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the distribution of motorways and major roads of all kinds.  The economy can be affected by ministerial or governmental decisions.  I should hate to see a situation with Dublin as the main centre of radiation, that is, that all motorways will lead from Dublin to the remoter parts of the country. Again we have to look to the future. Will any provision be made for Belfast as a link-up for trade and commerce, especially to the northwestern counties, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal?  This must be kept in mind when spending money on motorways or any other form of transport for passengers or commerce.</P>
      <P>There are ports in the west which could be developed.  An airport could be located in the north-west.  The point I am making is that we have reached a stage in Dublin where we must look at the wisdom of large expansion, populationwise and otherwise, at the expense of the country. This is something which needs to be chalked up with a view to keeping an eye on it when we are talking about motorways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 8 there is provision for dealing with planning permissions granted whether or not work has started.  Of course, the same applies to projects, even if they have been started and completed, where compensation must be paid.  But, in this field of existing planning permissions, whether they be outline or full, there are some question marks.  For instance, at what stage does the Minister revoke planning permission granted?  Will it be when a scheme <Col N="226" /> has been drawn up by the local authority, by two local authorities, or in default by the Minister?  At what stage is the planning permission revoked? And, if a planning permission will not be revoked until, say, ten years time, in cases where the roadway or motorway is being used, is it only then that it will be revoked?  If, say, a person has outline planning permission, can he get full planning permission in the meantime?  I should like to hear more about this because a circular by the Minister to local authorities on the operation of their planning regulations said that while many development plans contained provisions against ribbon building&mdash; that is building along main roads or other roads&mdash;it was the Minister's view that such clauses should not prevent a liberal approach to individual cases.</P>
    <P>I do not think the planning authority have any function whatsoever.  If they have a county development plan and this makes provision for non-interference with roads, they cannot grant planning permissions which contravene their own county development plan.  It is only the Minister, on appeal, or the Minister, at the request of the local authority, who can alter the county development plan.  Therefore, this seems to be cutting across the provisions of this.  In other words, if a local authority apply to the Minister for permission to contravene their county development plan&mdash;such a plan may include certain provisions regarding buildings, commercial or otherwise, housing along the major roads, and so on&mdash;in keeping with the sentiments of his circular and if he gives them permission to contravene their plan, this may be cutting right across the provisions of section 8 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>When I was dealing with planning in the Department of Local Government I had occasion to refuse planning permission on a number of occasions along the routes of proposed roads. This was done because it would cost a large sum if there was any interference with the granting of planning permission, if there was any interference with the course of roads proposed for the future such as are envisaged by this Bill.  I remember <Col N="227" /> distinctly two cases.  There was the case of Rolon Caravans, where the road or proposed motorway went through the site of the proposed factory. The advice given by the roads people and the Department of Local Government was that it would cost hundreds of thousands to deviate from the course which the Department officials had planned for that road.  All the advice available in the Department of Local Government was &ldquo;No.  It is going to cost many hundreds of thousands to give that planning permission.&rdquo; Although I was anxious to encourage industrial development and although I was urged by Deputies of all parties, including the Fianna Fáil Party, I did not grant planning permission. But the present Minister for Local Government did.  Why?  What were the considerations?  Did he go against the advice of his own officials, the same officials whose advice I relied on and took?  Incidentally, the firm has now gone out of business, unfortunately. The property, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16th January, 1974, has been purchased by Euro Estates and is a very valuable property because it has full planning permission without any conditions for industrial commercial development.  I hope the Minister will tell us why.  These are the matters that the Minister and members of his party and the other parties forming the present Government, when over here, made allegations and innuendos about to the effect that we were misbehaving when over there.</P>

If they propose to develop this industrially or commercially, will they be allowed to do this?  At what stage can the Minister come in now and say: &ldquo;Look, there is section 8.

      <P>According to the provisions of the Bill the Minister is seeking to put through, planning permissions already granted could be abolished.  This is a sad state of affairs. In the case of Rolon Caravans I had an estimate and if the road were diverted away from the site of the proposed factory or commercial development it would cost the ratepayers of this city a very large sum, running into well over £250,000.  This is the advice I got from the people in the roads section at the time.  This should not be done and it was not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did I not sign the order that was ready for refusal?  There was a <Col N="231" /> possibility that if the company wanted temporary accommodation to deal with a problem they could be granted permission for five or six years.  The advice I got was that this road development would possibly take about 12 years.  I was toying with the idea of suggesting that temporary permission would take the company out of a spot until such time as they found alternative accommodation.  I did not get around to that.  It would have been feasible to grant temporary permission for five or six years or anything up to ten years.  I am surprised that the Minister did not grant that kind of permission.</P>

      <P>The need for legislation to improve our roads is evident to every man, woman and child who travels on our roads.  The fact that existing legislation did not permit the purchase of land and the construction of motorways is the reason for the introduction of this Bill.  I regret that in introducing it the Minister made no attempt to say where the vast sums of money necessary for the construction of motorways will come from.  He made a point of saying that the provisions of the Bill do not seek to set up special financial arrangements under which programmes for motorways and national roads could be launched. <Col N="232" /> When will we hear of the financial arrangements for the construction of motorways?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The scale of the problem can be seen if one looks at the plans for the construction of motorways in County Dublin.  The Dublin transportation study mentioned by the Minister in his opening statement envisaged the construction of what they call a motorway box around County Dublin: an outer ring road, a motorway going from Baldoyle through Santry, across into Blanchardstown, joining the new towns of Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, on into Tallaght and right around the southern suburbs.  There will be other motorways heading north, west and south coming off that.  By the time we get around to the construction of this motorway the estimated cost will be only a small part of the actual cost; according to 1973 prices, the cost of this ring road and the other roads I have mentioned is £60 million.  If you multiply that by the requirements of other city areas and the rest of the country you can get some idea of the scale of the problems.</P>
      <P>The introduction of enabling legislation is fine, but the Minister has a responsibility to say where the money is coming from, when it is coming, and when construction of these motorways can commence.  I am in the fortunate position that my area is the only one mentioned in the Bill as definitely getting a motorway.  The section mentioned is the area Santry to the airport.  I welcome this move, but I feel sorry for other Deputies in whose constituencies motorways are needed and for which no provision has been made by the Minister.  I would like to see some provisions being made for other motorways as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some sections of the Bill I would like to go through.  Section 6, <Col N="233" /> subsections (5) and (6) deals with compensation being paid for the acquisition of land for motorways, but I would ask the Minister if he would be good enough to reply to a few points I wish to raise in this connection.  One is the problem of people who are not necessarily affected by the purchase or construction of the motorway but who happen to live near it and who will suffer inconvenience due to noise and so on from the extra traffic passing in proximity to their homes, something which is recognised worldwide as being, to say the least of it, undesirable. I should like the Minister's assurance that compensation of this type is covered under section 6 or somewhere else in the Bill.  As far as I can see, this section merely covers compensation for purchase of the land.</P>
    <P>Another compensation problem is that in relation to the farmer owning, say, 100 acres.  If a motorway is planned and is constructed through his farm, is he merely paid for the section of the land that is being physically used for the motorway or is he compensated for lack of access from one side of the motorway to the other because, quite properly, the Bill provides that there should be no access onto the motorway and that it should not be used by farm animals, by cyclists, <i>et cetera</i>?  How does the Minister see this problem of compensation for a farmer whose farm could be destroyed or cut in half by a motorway?</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, section 7 relates to the compulsory purchase order which was initiated by the Dublin County Council for that section of the motorway from the city boundary at Santry out to Dublin Airport?  The need for this is evident to the Minister because, like myself, he travels this route frequently. The means of access to the city from the airport is appalling.  The first piece of roadway that any traveller to this country sees, that section of road from the airport to the city going through Santry, is a very bad advertisement for the standard of our roads.  There are constant traffic jams. The road was never built for the traffic it is taking and its surface is <Col N="234" /> always broken up and no matter how much repaving is done it is impossible to maintain a proper surface on it.  If the Minister would confirm the CPO and provide the money for this motorway we would be able to get this project going in County Dublin soon.</P>
    <P>Another advantage of this undertaking is that it will be the first section of the new motorway to the North. In days when we talk about unity and about communication between Dublin and Belfast, surely the first form of communication should be a proper road network, and a proper motorway from Dublin to Belfast should be a priority of this Government.  I was told the Minister would give urgent consideration to co-operation with the Dublin County Council, with the Meath and Louth County Councils with a view to constructing this motorway to join up with the M1 coming out of Belfast.  This would be a form of practical co-operation between North and South.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill deals with the revocation or suspension of planning permission.  I would like clarification from the Minister with regard to the compensation to be paid in such cases. Take the hypothetical case of a housing estate of 200 houses.  Planning permission is given; construction is started.  At a later stage the Minister or the council decide they want to build a motorway in close proximity to the site.  What is the situation in regard to revocation of part of the permission if work has commenced? What is the situation in regard to compensation to people who may have moved into the houses quite close to where the motorway is to be built?  This is the sort of question it is necessary for the Minister to answer, so that the people will know exactly where they stand in regard to the sweeping powers the Minister is taking unto himself in this Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the things that I welcome particularly in the Bill is the fact that access to the motorway will be restricted, unlike the situation on the dual carriageways.  It is important <Col N="235" /> when thinking of the construction and planning of motorways that we should never again make the mistakes made on the stretch from Dublin to Naas which probably has had more fatal accidents per mile than any other stretch of road in the country. It was built when it seemed to be the thing to do.  As a dual carriageway it was a compromise between the roads we had and the motorway.  It has resulted in a number of ghastly accidents and many deaths.  When the Minister eventually provides money for the construction of these motorways, the fact that access to these roads is being controlled, the type of vehicle and people to use them, is one of the most desirable sections of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking sweeping powers in sections 11, 12 and 13 and, as Deputy Molloy mentioned, the Minister merely gave himself eight lines of a four page speech to deal with these sections.  In my opinion these are the most far-reaching sections of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>The Minister will have his opportunity to reply.  There is much to recommend sections 11, 12 and 13.  There is much to be said for co-operation, for having a national road authority, but there are also many things against this.  The Minister says that under these powers he can instruct or appoint authorities to construct a motorway if he finds he is not getting co-operation from a county council and he merely has to consult with the county council and tell them what he is doing.  Consultation is a much abused word.  In practice representatives of the county council could be brought to the Custom House and told: &ldquo;We <Col N="236" /> are building the motorway from point A to point B whether you like it or not&rdquo; and that is a form of consultation. Under sections 11, 12 and 13, as I see it, that could be done.</P>
      <P>There is much to be said for having a single agency building all the motorways because you have the problem of over-worked engineers in many counties.  They have enough difficulty in trying to keep up with minor roads without becoming involved in major motorway construction, but this is something that needs more explanation than eight lines of a four-page speech on three sections of a Motorways Bill.  It needs clarification and it should be discussed with all local authorities concerned.  The manner in which the Minister is dealing with it is, to say the least, inadequate.  I hope he will contact county councils and local authorities generally and seek their views on these sections.  Even if it could be done on a regional basis rather than a county basis and if these motorways were to be planned by representatives of county councils going to a regional body to discuss these matters rather than having it all done through the Department, it might be a good idea. While much could be said for and against I feel the Minister's treatment of the matter was inadequate.</P>
      <P>The need for the Bill is shown by the figures the Minister himself quoted. We see the increase from 1963 to 1973 during years of expansion under Fianna Fáil when the number of vehicles using the roads went up from 383,038 to 646,205.  The need for the Bill is also evident to anybody who travels our roads.  If you go from Dublin to Galway you find appalling delays between Lucan and Kilcock.  If you are unlucky enough to get behind a truck you will not be able to pass it until you get beyond Kilcock.  This sort of thing is not economic in a country attempting to expand industrially and sell its goods abroad: we need proper road communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should have taken this opportunity to tell the House how he proposes to finance the type of legislation he is introducing.  He did say that the present Bill, which he hoped to follow in due course with a comprehensive measure, was the first <Col N="237" /> step in remedying the situation in regard to the construction of roads.</P>
    <P>The principal things I should like the Minister to clarify are the matter of financing and the question of the compensation to be paid to people unfortunate enough to live in close proximity to motorways and also how the farming community will be compensated for the division of their lands.</P>

      <P>Like other Members who have contributed to this debate I welcome this legislation and I commend the Minister on bringing it before us and wish him success with it.  Despite the fact that it is only a 17 section Bill and that we are taking it in a valley period&mdash;Thursday morning&mdash;it is a very important piece of legislation.  The Minister is one of the few members of the present Administration who seem to be getting on with the job and doing things.  Perhaps we disagree with some of the things he does and would prefer that he would do some things differently but at least to me and I think to many others on this side of the House, he gives every indication that he is doing his best and dealing with matters as they come before him unlike many of his colleagues who seem to regard their Ministerial offices simply as vehicles to promote their own personal prestige.</P>
      <P>This is an important piece of legislation and it gives us an opportunity of discharging one of our very important functions.  In dealing with it we face one of the very real problems of our time&mdash;how to provide for and achieve progress and at the same time protect our environment on the one hand and the rights and amenities of individuals on the other.  In its own way this small Bill is a classic example of the modern dilemma and I hope the House will deal with it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have motorways as the Minister and Deputies have pointed out.  If anybody is in any doubt about the need for progress in this area he <Col N="238" /> has only to try to get out of Dublin to the west of Ireland on a Friday evening or come into Dublin from the west on a Monday morning.  Most of us in this House are conscious of the situation that prevails on the Dublin-Maynooth-Kilcock road.  That sort of situation is repeated around the city but the western road brings home to us particularly vividly the problem which is arising in this matter of access to Dublin city.  Indeed, this type of problem arises around the country in regard to other cities and towns also.  We must have up-to-date modern motorways if we are to cope with the situation that is inexorably developing.  I agree also with what Deputies Cunningham and Molloy have said about this Bill having an important bearing on decentralisation. All parties in this House are committed firmly to the need for decentralisation. It is an essential part of any sensible decentralisation programme that there be easy access to Dublin from the different parts of the country and particularly from the west of Ireland.  The situation has developed that a large volume of our import-export trade is channelled through the port of Dublin.  That being so, it is essential from the point of view of industrial and economic development, and indeed the convenience of private citizens, that there be an adequate road system in and out of Dublin city, particularly to the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let me digress for a moment and say that I believe a great deal more could be done in and around the city in trying to encourage diversions off the main arteries.  There are some alternative ways in and out of Dublin &mdash;for instance through the Minister's own county&mdash;which are not as fully availed of as they might be.  If somebody were to give more attention to that aspect, to inform road users of the alternatives to encourage their use, perhaps here and there and carry out minor works which would make these alternative routes more attractive, some relief of the congestion could be achieved.  It would however at least be only temporary and there <Col N="239" /> is no doubt that motorways are the solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fortunate in that we on this side of the House propose to take a very constructive and helpful approach to this Bill and to anything else that he will attempt in this field. One recalls that in our day we were often subject to very destructive criticism in this regard.  Great public agitation was fostered over the Bray road.  It is easy to create agitation and to whip up opposition to things that are really necessary in the roads situation. The Minister can be assured that we on this side of the House are conscious of the problems and of the needs that exist.  He can be assured of a helpful and constructive approach by us to anything he tries to do.</P>
    <P>This Bill directs our attention to the modern problem of achieving progress while, at the same time, trying to preserve the quality of life.  When we come to the Committee Stage we can go further into the detailed provisions and see whether we can improve them in the various ways which have been mentioned by some of my colleagues, particularly in regard to compensation. On this Second Stage I should like merely to mention some broader aspects.  I would like to have seen some directive principles written into the Bill.  I would like to have seen directive principles written in in regard to conservation.  I am not sure to whom the directive principles should be addressed, whether the Minister should bind himself in his official capacity or whether the directives should be addressed to local authorities; but enshrined in the Bill there should be some mandatory provisions that in the construction of motorways the general beauty, attractiveness and amenities of the countryside should be preserved to the greatest possible extent. Trees and other physical features should be subject to the minimum interference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey will include existing industries in that, I am sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps industrialists are quite capable in this context of <Col N="240" /> looking after themselves and protecting their interests.  I am concerned with the general appearance of the countryside and to see, if possible, enshrined in the Bill some directive principles to the effect that in the construction of motorways regard must be had to the appearance of the countryside before and after their construction.  Engineers are very fine people.  They have their own priorities.  There is a very natural tendency and temptation for an engineer to draw a straight line across the map.  I have seen that happen.  That is the simplest thing for an engineer to do and it is probably in keeping with his training.  However, there are other considerations and I would like to have seen in the Bill some reference to the preservation of the beauty of our countryside.</P>
      <P>I would also like to have seen, in regard to compensation, some directive principle that a broad view be taken.  Here we can learn a great deal from the English and continental experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Ray Burke has pointed out there is more involved in the construction of these roadways or motorways than strict compensation for the property acquired.  The construction of a roadway or motorway will often have an important and significant impact on the lives of a lot of people who live in the vicinity of these proposed motorways.  I should like to give the example of a stud farm.  I am aware of a case where very serious problems have arisen in regard to such a farm.  If a road or motorway is run through the middle of a stud farm, and indeed this applies to many farms, strictly speaking one could consider that the owner of the particular farm is only entitled to be paid a reasonable rate for the actual land taken for the provision of the roadway. However in the case I have in mind, a stud farm, the farm is a unit, an entity with its own centre of activity and the construction of a roadway through it will completely destroy its viability.  Therefore, it is very difficult to see how the proprietor of that particular establishment can be compensated for what is about to happen.  We can, as Deputy Burke <Col N="241" /> has pointed out, have situations&mdash; reports of such have indeed appeared in the newspapers&mdash;where persons whose property is not physically involved in the construction of the motorway are nevertheless vitally affected by it.  People who live in close proximity to the proposed routes of motorways or who have amenities or facilities adjacent to them can be adversely affected by the advent of the motorway though in fact their property may not be directly involved in the construction.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen some direct principle enshrined in the legislation compelling the Minister or the local authorities or whoever is concerned to take a broad view of the implications of the construction of these motorways from the point of view of compensation to the individual citizens concerned.  What we do in this piece of legislation will affect the lives and the property, the amenities and the facilities of many private individuals in the future.  It is only the Members of this House who can, by foresight in the framing of this legislation, protect the private citizen, and it is our duty to do so.  It is our duty to make provisions which will ensure that local authorities in the future, pursuing their own priorities as they must, will not be able, inadvertently or otherwise, to tread on the rights of private citizens.</P>
    <P>I hope that when we come to the details of the individual sections we will discharge fully the obligation placed on us in this regard to try to ensure that while these necessary motorways are provided this will be done with the minimum of inconvenience, not to mention hardship, for our citizens along the routes involved. The need for these motorways is self-evident, and we all agree with the Minister in that.  I am not sure, however, if it would not have been better to entrust the job of the construction of motorways to some sort of central authority, perhaps directly under the auspices of the Minister's own Department.</P>
    <P>I can see the dilemma the Minister was presented with in this regard.  I can appreciate his <Col N="242" /> anxiety to get on with the job and, if possible, to be ahead of events&mdash;to get the machinery moving now, to have decisions taken now, and to get the preliminary details over with so as to ensure that motorways are there when they are needed.  To that extent there is a great temptation for him to avail of the machinery that exists in the local authorities who have the staff, the expertise and the machinery to do this job.  However, there is a danger that in being left to local authorities it will suffer the disadvantages of a piecemeal approach.  Strictly from the long-term administrative point of view a central body would have been a far better solution, but then the setting up of such an authority and the creating of all the new machinery it would need would undoubtedly take time.  I believe the Minister has therefore opted for the machinery in the local authorities because it is already in existence.</P>
    <P>If the decision has been taken not to set up a central authority because it would delay matters, then I go along with the Minister to leave the job to the local authorities.  However, if that decision has not been finally and irrevocably taken, perhaps the Minister would consider whether at this stage the establishment of some central authority which could do the job comprehensively would be a better solution.  I readily confess that I have not access to all the detailed arguments which the Minister has in that regard and if he has decided that the local authority's way is the quickest and best way of doing this, I accept that decision on his part.</P>
    <P>When we come to discuss this legislation on Committee Stage I will endeavour to be as constructive and as helpful as possible in regard to the different provisions.  My main contribution at this stage is to ask the Minister to consider whether he should not have clearly and unequivocally written into the Bill certain mandatory directive principles along the lines I have set out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  It is a measure that is long overdue. <Col N="243" /> It has been the practice here for many years to engage outside agencies to draw up reports in relation to road building.  While much of the material produced provided good reading and contained a fair degree of sense our particular needs were not always taken into consideration and because of this there was a tendency to shelve these reports.</P>
      <P>This Bill will give more autonomy to local authorities and, consequently, will result in decisions being made with less delay than has been the practice up to now.  Now that we are a developing nation and are members of the EEC it is all the more important that we have first-class motorways. Other speakers have referred to this need in the context of decentralisation, but if there should be decentralisation&mdash;and we all hope that there will be&mdash;the likelihood is that Dublin will remain the largest port area of the country.  It is essential that we have adequate motorways to allow for the movement of merchandise to and from the country but it is important also that due attention be given to such aspects of road building as landscaping. The entire work of creating a motorway should not be left solely to engineers.  While these people do a good job in so far as construction is concerned, they tend to overlook other aspects that are very important also. Therefore, it is important to have planners and people who are experts in landscaping.  So far the roads that have been built here are very dull. That is not the position on the Continent where trees and shrubs along the motorways lend a very pleasant and fresh appearance to the environment. I hope that the necessary steps will be taken here to ensure that this aspect of road work is not overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not very happy with some of the developments taking place in Dublin.  I refer in particular to the new road at Macken Street.  The plans would seem to sound the death knell for the villages of Ringsend and Irishtown.  At least it would seem that these villages would be almost doomed to extinction.  Regarding the development of roadway in the Sandymount <Col N="244" /> beach area I suggest that this development be taken into consideration in terms of the proposed plans for Dublin Bay.  We must preserve the quality of our towns.</P>
    <P>We have available to us the Travers Morgan plan for local authorities.  In many ways this is a good plan but some aspects of it cause me some anxiety, for instance, the proposal for a major roadway through the Liberties area of Dublin.  If this project is undertaken it could cause some trouble in that it would result in the uprooting of a vast area of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The problems that apply in respect of motorways in Dublin apply also to any other part of the country.  In roadway construction towns should be avoided.  In the past there was a widely held opinion that to by-pass a town was to allow that town to die.  However, that has not proved to be correct. On the contrary those towns that have been by-passed have expanded in growth.</P>
    <P>It has always been my impression that society is intended to conform with roadways rather than that roadways should conform with society.  In any new thinking I would hope that the quality of society would be taken into account.  I would hope, too, that when major road programmes are being put before local authorities there would be consultation prior to any action being taken.  The road proposed for the Macken Street area is causing some concern in so far as there is a fear that there may not be adequate consultation.  It is my belief that there will be consultation before any final decision is taken.  However, it is important to ensure that where possible the needs of the community are catered for.  Any project that has not the goodwill of the people in the area concerned may be the cause of much dissension.</P>
    <P>In Dublin one of the major failings in development work has been the slowness of the local authority in regard to road development.  As far back as 30 years ago people were refused permission to build because of projected road widening work but that work has not yet been carried out.  The result of this has been that <Col N="245" /> a major part of the city has been left to decay.  It was a fallacy to think that wide roads were necessary within the city area.  Motorways must be built around towns and cities and not through them so that we minimise the amount of traffic entering cities and towns.  One step that could be taken in this direction would be to limit car parking facilities within any new office block development area and also to provide more pedestrian ways within our cities.  There is a tendency today to develop vast shopping areas outside cities and this results in centre city areas being neglected.  A good transport system is essential in any city.  It is essential particularly in the context of road development.  We must preserve our city as a living entity and that can be done by restricting traffic inflow as much as possible. Obviously, allowance must be made for the servicing of shops, industries <i>et cetera</i> but we must limit the number of private cars entering the city.  An effective transport system can work very effectively if we limit the transport coming into the cities and have car parks on the main roads outside the cities.  There should be efficient bus services carrying traffic to the inner portion of the cities. There should be pedestrian walks such as we have in parts of Dublin.  If Dublin traffic was managed in this manner Dublin would soon have a new look.  It is rather tatty at the moment.</P>
    <P>Decisions are now being taken to improve the roads.  We will go ahead and develop the roadways in order to facilitate the transaction of business.</P>

      <P>It is with a certain amount of frustration that one stands up to speak on anything to do with roads, especially when one comes from my county where we have a chronic shortage of adequate roads.  I know that colossal demands will be made for funds for new roads and there is a limited amount of finance available for this type of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome this Bill and concur that we have in Deputy Tully one Minister who seems to be doing his work in the Government.  I know he <Col N="246" /> is applying himself to his job in a very conscientious and thorough fashion.  Those of us who knew him when he was in Opposition recognised at a very early stage that he could only operate in such a manner.  I concur in the main with the views expressed in the Bill.  One may have some reservations about the vast powers given to the Minister in this Bill.  During the debate on the Committee Stage we can discuss ways and means of assessing how these powers will operate and whether any alterations will be necessary.</P>
    <P>I come from Bandon, County Cork. In west Cork we produce a vast quantity of beef.  As a consequence huge lorries travel along the roads from Skibbereen, Dunmanway and Bandon to Cork thereby causing severe congestion on the Bandon to Cork road.  This road is probably the second busiest road in the county but it has never been classified as a national primary road.  On several occasions the Cork County Council have submitted schemes to the Minister looking for a dual carriageway from Cork to Bandon.  At a later stage in the discussion perhaps the Minister will give his views about the reclassification of the road I have just mentioned.  Many other roads seem to be in need of reclassification also.  As a result of legislation passed by the Dáil the reclassification of a road may not be very important. Powers are being granted to the Minister, and he may have power to allocate substantial sums of money for the improvement of these roads.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we face huge problems involving the development of the refinery in the Bantry area. The type of transport that will be necessary between Cork and Bantry boggles the mind.  The roads at the moment are totally inadequate to cater for the type of traffic expected. With the imminence of the establishment of the refinery in the area road development should be a priority.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of mentioning these facts because there has been so much discussion in relation to the planning permission for the refinery.  My opinion is that unless <Col N="247" /> the road network is improved considerably the refinery will not be able to operate in the area.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned the need for further clarification in regard to the type of compensation that will be offered to people whose land will be taken.  That may not be an insurmountable obstacle.  There is already a system in operation which, while it may not please everybody, gives fair compensation to people whose land is taken over by local authorities.  There are other people who may not seem to have a case for compensation and who have not been provided for in any Bill.  These people are entitled to have their cases carefully considered. They are the people who like to get out to the quiet, peaceful environment of the country and to build houses off lonely laneways.  Some of these people may suddenly find themselves, because of a decision made by a local authority, living virtually on the edge of a main thoroughfare, the quality of their lives being thereby seriously affected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred to stud farms.  What he said would apply equally to all sorts of farms where, because of noise or vibrations caused by heavy traffic going over roadways, cattle or horses might abort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a lot of action.  The bridge would have been built by now.  This Bill has social and environmental as well as economic aspects which have been lucidly stated by previous speakers.  There is one aspect we cannot afford to neglect in relation to road building, namely, a reduction of the carnage on our roads.  We should try to include as many safety regulations as possible.  I have been reading some of the reports of An Foras Forbartha on this aspect and they make grim reading.  It is important that the Minister spells out the type of constraints that will be put on the building of the roads.  I refer to access points.  No matter where the Minister may build roadways he will find the necessity for access points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>While a bridge or a tunnel may be thought to be the answer, I cannot see it being a practical proposition.  If a bridge or a tunnel is thought to be the answer it will be necessary to build them every mile, especially in rural areas.  The type of bridge that may be cheapest and ideal for pedestrians may not be suitable for rural areas; for instance, one can visualise the difficulty in taking cattle from one side of the road to the other on a bridge such as that at Fairview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other countries there are severe restrictions and this is right.  No matter how much we speak about the <Col N="249" /> quality of life, if there is not life there cannot be quality.  I would urge the Minister to ensure that the question of safety is the primary aspect in the building of roads.  All of us are aware of the appalling accidents on the dual carriageway from Dublin to Naas. Unless we provide roads with sufficient safety standards there will be further carnage on the roads.  Consequently, the Minister has a tremendous responsibility to ensure that our roads are the safest that can be built.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk about a central authority for roads and a good case can be made for this type of authority in that there is a co-ordinated administration and system of road networks.  However, the question arises as to how county council workers would be affected if a central authority takes over this kind of work.  While the number of such workers may be diminishing, they still constitute a fair work force in the country.  They are entitled to know how their future may be affected by the establishment of such an authority.  It is only natural that there would be certain reservations if the functions were taken over by some kind of agency or by firms who may be established specifically to do road building.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the necessity for a proper road network in relation to industry and this is so obvious it does not need re-stating.  If we are to preserve the population in rural Ireland, the Minister must give priority to the building of a proper road network to serve the remote areas. We know there will be demands in Dublin, Cork city and other cities for improvements and they are legitimate demands.  Nevertheless, not only do we have an economic but also a social obligation to ensure that industry is not prevented from going to rural areas because we are not able to provide a proper system of roads for the transportation of goods.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to sections 11, 12 and 13 and, on first reading, these sections appeared to confer tremendous powers.  I find it difficult to visualise cases where local authorities will be in such direct conflict with <Col N="250" /> the Department of Local Government in relation to road building.  It may happen, and perhaps some amendments may have to be submitted to protect local interests, but I imagine in the vast majority of cases there will be complete unanimity in approach on this subject.</P>
    <P>In section 12 it is stated that the Minister may, by order, compel or require the road authority to comply with such direction in a satisfactory manner and he may specify the manner in which such direction is to be complied with.  The Minister could quite easily get over the objections that may be raised to these powers if he were to confer those rights on the elected representatives in the local authority.</P>
    <P>In his recent paper on local authorities, the Minister stressed the vital importance of elected representatives.  We fully agree with him but if the Minister found that the elected representatives on a local authority were in conflict with a ruling of his, then I think he should be very reluctant to enforce such a ruling.  That would be a constraint that would make most of us feel happy.  We might not always have Jimmy Tully as Minister for Local Government&mdash;other less conscientious people might be in that Department&mdash; and it is therefore important that some restrictions be put on the powers demanded in this section.  All in all, this Bill has the support of all of us, no matter on which side of the House we are.</P>
    <P>I consider that the preservation of our environment is very important.  In road building you could have the bulldozing of, perhaps, some valuable trees.  As much as possible, local authorities should be instructed to ensure that all other avenues are explored before any trees are cut to the ground.</P>
    <P>Somebody referred to the landscaping of roads.  In this country we do not have to take road landscaping too seriously because we have a beautiful countryside in its natural state.  In the past someone described some of our roadways as being green tunnels&mdash; you could not see over the hedges.  If people are able to see into the countryside from our new motorways, I think that will be landscaping enough.  I would not be in favour of <Col N="251" /> involving the State in too much expenditure on this kind of thing.  Our natural landscaping is far superior.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal specifically with some of our smaller towns and the need for an overall plan for relieving congestion.  Nevertheless, if in the building of these motorways we do not make some provision to relieve congestion in some towns there will be tremendous economic loss to these communities.  It is part of good planning for the Minister to ensure that a serious attempt at congestion relief will be made.  In this day and age it is important that as many regulations as are necessary will be enforced to ensure that our roads are the safest that can possibly be built.  In section 9 the Minister has this very important aspect in mind.</P>
    <P>However, we will run into more problems in rural Ireland.  If, for instance, pedestrians, pedal cyclists and persons using vehicles other than the classes prescribed, use certain roadways, I can see a tremendous number of problems arising.  I know what the Minister has in mind and why he has it in mind.  He is right, but I think we would be unwise to enact legislation which could not be enforced easily.  It would have the effect of a certain loss of respect for the law. If we are to prohibit a cyclist from cycling on a road and if this is to be done on a fairly regular scale, unless we can prosecute that man and see that he is brought to justice for his offence, our laws will be the subject of a certain amount of disrespect.  These are only small things and as far as I am concerned I welcome the whole thinking behind the Bill.  I agree with the Minister on the necessity for having some such legislation enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank Deputies, with one or two exceptions, for the way in which they have received the Bill.  Although some of their comments may not all have been well informed, I am quite sure they were well intended.  I was a little surprised at how critical Deputy Molloy was of a Bill which I understand <Col N="252" /> he considered to be his brainchild. However, I suppose that is what moving around this House does.  He asked me a number of questions which I will attempt to answer.  He is aware, of course, that the answers to some of them are not ready now and could not be for some time.</P>
      <P>I should like particularly to refer to Deputy Cunningham's charge.  I refer to the rather serious charge he made in relation to the Bill&mdash;it had very slight relation to it but he succeeded in getting it in and I ask your permission, Sir, to deal with it now&mdash; and the planning permission which Rolon Caravans got for what he alleged was the site of the motorway. Rolon Caravans were in operation at Santry and employed a very big labour force making caravans and so on.  In August, 1972, an application for planning permission to extend the factory was on Deputy Cunningham's desk&mdash;he was the Parliamentary Secretary who had responsibility for dealing with planning appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can find that one out for himself.  I am just telling him what the situation was. Deputy Cunningham admitted that he had got advice and that the advice was that it would cost a lot of money to move the site of the road but that there was a possibility that permission could be granted&mdash;if I remember him correctly&mdash;up to 12 or possibly 16 years which the man could continue his factory.  I think it would have been eight to 12 years.  Deputy Cunningham apparently did not bother very much about it.  He said he did not give a decision, that he just left it there.  This happened in many other cases&mdash;he put it away on a shelf to gather dust until I came on the scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I came along I found that there was such a recommendation and I asked that the matter be looked <Col N="253" /> at again.  I found that Dublin County Council, in consultation with the officials of my Department, were prepared not alone to alter the site of the road but were willing to do it and it would cost less eventually because of the type of land that would be acquired.  By doing this they would (a) prevent the destruction of this firm and the consequent dismissal of a substantial number of employees, and (b) they would release on the other side of the road an area which had been zoned for light engineering by the same local authority.  I, therefore, gave the planning permission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham should be a little careful about these things.  If he wants to make charges he should be prepared to substantiate them.  His obvious intention was to get in here and make a charge which he thought would stick at least over the weekend before I could get an opportunity to refute it.  I want to say that as far as I am concerned, the planning appeals section, dealt with in the main by my Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Begley, is open for all to examine. They will find no &ldquo;hookey&rdquo; decisions there.  They will find no &ldquo;hookey&rdquo; decisions taken by me.  Deputy Begley referred to me for a second opinion. We stand over the things we do and we are not ashamed of the things we do.  It ill becomes somebody like Deputy Cunningham who, as I said, had not the courage to deal with this matter but left it to one side until I took over, to try to cast a slur not alone on me but on my Parliamentary Secretary and indeed on the firms concerned. The fact that permission was granted to people on the other side of the road was incidental to the whole decision.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council decided it was possible to move the road without any extra cost&mdash;as a matter of fact it would reduce the costs&mdash;and there was no question whatever of refusing.  In fact, to show how Deputy Cunningham was attempting to blacken somebody here he did not mention the owner of the farm being sold but mentioned the auctioneer in an effort to blacken a Member of the Oireachtas.  I am sure Deputy Molloy would not stoop to this. I was surprised that anybody in this <Col N="254" /> House would attempt to make a charge like that and then run away.  He went out of the House pretty soon afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not run away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He got out pretty quickly.  He did not wait to hear what the explanation was.  I want to put it on the record.  That is the story of Rolon Caravans.  The fact that subsequently, for other reasons of which I am not aware, the factory closed down and was sold had nothing whatever to do with it.  The decision was given on the facts as they then were and there is nothing underhand about it.  It is only fair to everybody concerned to say that this is what happened.  I may add that the 120 or 130 appeals per month which were being dealt with by Deputy Cunningham, when he was Parliamentary Secretary, have now been stepped up during last month to 590.  Perhaps if he spent a little bit more time looking after that part of his business he might not have to come in here as an Opposition Deputy to try to throw a slur on these people.  I do not want to say anything more about this but I think it is only right that this matter should be clarified.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy asked about regional roads and what was happening.  We have reclassified a number of roads and we asked the local authorities some months ago for their comments and their recommendations for the classification of regional roads.  We are awaiting their recommendations. I suppose we will have to send a request to all of them to send the information in as quickly as possible so that a decision can be taken.  That was a fair question and I am not objecting to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy also asked if it would be the same authority under this Bill as under the CPO.  The answer to that is yes.  Section 4(3) gives the same relevance as the CPO and with regard to compensation it is the same.  The Kenny Report may have some bearing on it.  If the land is in a designated area there can be a limit on the price.  That is one of the things on which it may have an effect; <Col N="255" /> otherwise the CPO regulations will operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>They may not get the market value by way of compensation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They may get the market value but not an inflated value.  If somebody buys land in an effort to try to re-sell it and make a lot of money on it, he will not get that money back.  If that person considers that is market value, it is his hard luck.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an entirely different matter and is something that will have to be dealt with.  I would prefer to deal with it at a later stage. I want to make it clear my opinion is that, where CPOs are concerned, I do not believe somebody who has applied for outline permission for land for a certain purpose should get any consideration when a CPO is invoked.  It would be wrong if they did.  If they have plans to proceed with houses that is a different thing altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Molloy is aware that there is a new planning Bill which will be before the House very shortly.  It will deal with the limited time over which planning permission will operate.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with this because people have got planning permission and have sat on it for years while the value of the land was growing and growing.  I do not know whether he noticed that he asked a very significant question when he asked me whether there would be a different value on outline permission and on full permission.  This is one of the things which has caused all the trouble in this country with regard to housing and planning permission.  We all know that land is land until planning permission goes on it.  It then gets an inflated value because somebody has succeeded in getting planning permission.  It is on the planning permission that people buy, not on the land.  I do not think that is a good <Col N="256" /> idea and I will do what I can to prevent that sort of thing continuing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is like a lot of other things.  When Deputy Molloy was Minister he did not seem to know a lot about what was happening.  While I was flattered by Deputy Haughey's compliments and also by those of Deputy Crowley I would point out that my colleagues work equally hard in this Cabinet, as they probably know.  However he made the comment about the question of landscaping and that there should be some effort to preserve the amenities of an area. Section 3 (1) of the Bill provides for this and I think he will find that as far as the administration of this is concerned there will be a definite effort made when the roads and motorways are being built to ensure that there will not be damage done to environment where it can possibly be avoided.  It was wrong to damage the environment.  This was done in the past.  Certain areas were despoiled <Col N="258" /> because proper care was not taken and I do not want to see that continuing.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the question of the farmer who gets his farm divided in two.  I think it was Deputy Malone who referred to the farmer who owned both sides of the road over an area of a couple of miles.  He certainly would have some farm and if it was divided in two there would still be two very big farms.  If land is being divided by a motorway Deputy Crowley felt it would not be possible to build either the flyovers or the tunnels under such a road in order to allow traffic from minor roads or animals to cross. This has happened all over the continent and in England.  It was done very effectively.  Therefore, he need have no worries about that.  It will be possible to have this sort of thing looked after.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy was interested in the question of compensation.  I gave him a partial answer a few minutes ago.  Deputy R.P. Burke seemed to want everybody to get everything he possibly could and still wanted motorways and roads to go ahead.  He queried where the money would come from and then he started to enumerate all the people who live near motorways or roads, all of whom should be compensated in some way. I am sure he felt like an old man who lived about one mile from me who 60 or 70 years ago, prevented a bridge being built across a river.  This bridge would have been very useful now.  At that time it would have cost £100 now it would cost £250,000.  He objected because passing cars would annoy the family.  His house was built more than half a mile from the road and the cars were drawn by horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy R.P. Burke feels that people living that far from motorways should be compensated. If everybody said that he was being annoyed or that his quality of life &mdash;which is the &ldquo;in word&rdquo; at present &mdash;was being affected and that he should receive compensation, the bills for building roads and motorways would skyrocket so high that it would be difficult to even start them.  The same thing applies to suggestions <Col N="259" /> made by a number of people, including Deputy O'Brien and Deputy R.P. Burke, about the question of houses which might be damaged.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were made that a number of houses in Dublin city would be destroyed by motorways, ring roads, <i>et cetera</i>, I want to assure the House that good houses will not be destroyed by motorways, except when there is no other way of getting around the problem.  If that has to be done, those who are affected will get compensation.  I have no hesitation in saying that they will be looked after.  To say that because there is a proposal, to build a major radial road or a ring road in Dublin, whole areas in the city will be wiped out is too ridiculous to require an answer.  That was said when the proposal was only suggested.</P>
    <P>This will appear in tomorrow's newspapers and some people will say: &ldquo;It was agreed in the Dáil that whole areas will be destroyed by motorways.&rdquo;  The motorway at Sandymount is to be built as far out as possible in order to avoid interfering with houses.  People try to get things both ways.  It gets tiresome when those who should know better use such an argument.</P>
    <P>Deputy R.P. Burke spoke about the Dublin-Belfast road on which he and I travel fairly often.  This road is bad.  I blame Dublin County Council for not making the necessary efforts up to now to do anything about the Dublin-Belfast road, the Dublin-Navan road and, indeed, all major roads.  The major roads leading from Dublin are a national disgrace.  Something is being done now about them.  I gave £1,250,000 extra in this financial year to Dublin in an effort to have something done about them.  This is only a drop in the ocean because there are so many bad roads around Dublin which require an enormous amount of money to be spent on them.  Deputies who were then on this side of the House now talk about something being done about these roads.  This is ridiculous because if these roads had been tackled properly, and if the amount of money needed had been made available years <Col N="260" /> ago, or if the local authorities had pressed for that money, the job would have been a lot easier than it is now. I gave £4,500,000 extra to the country in an effort to improve roads.  This is still not enough or even nearly enough. We will have to find much more money for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy raised a fair question. He asked: what about financing? From what he said it appeared that he was fairly well briefed on this.  Road authorities are at present receiving 100 per cent recoupment for the cost of improvements to national roads, including bridges.  I expect that the same principle will apply to motorways and bridges forming parts of motorways.  It would be unrealistic to suggest that this money could be taken out of the Road Fund.  The necessary amount would not be there.  Therefore, alternative sources must be found.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Molloy suggested, a possible additional source for motorway projects would be the Regional Development Fund of the EEC.  They have been approached and I expect that this will result in certain moneys being made available.  Of course, we can borrow money.  It is possible that there will be allocations from the capital budget or loans from the European Investment Bank or commercial lending agencies.  No decision has been reached on how the major financing will be done.  We can take it that it will not be possible to finance these works in the normal way because the amount involved is colossal.  It has been said in this House that the amount of money required would be tremendous.  Deputy R.P. Burke started to add millions and millions and by the time he had finished he had convinced himself that there was not a hope in the world of doing anything.  I agree with him that the amount of money is very big and that with every year which passes the amount required will be greater.  That is why we are determined to make a start as soon as we possibly can.  We cannot start until this Bill goes through the House.  Therefore, I would ask the Opposition to ensure that it is not held up unduly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred to stud farms.  I agree that it is a serious matter for a person with a stud farm <Col N="261" /> if a major road or motorway goes through that farm.  A stud farm would be absolutely useless in such conditions.  If roads and motorways are to be established we must have full consultation with those who will be affected.  It is not good enough, as apparently happened on occasions, for somebody to draw a line on the map and say that is the way the motorway will go and then, without consultation, to have a CPO put on somebody. It could and did occur that in some cases big farmers who would lose a single portion of their land if the motorway went a certain way were, in fact, able to ensure that the line was drawn outside their boundaries. In one case six 15-acre farmers had their land cut up.  I would not have that under any circumstances.  It is wrong.</P>
    <P>The farmers and everybody else are entitled to be consulted.  Special interest should be taken in the small farmer who is trying to make a living out of his land.  He should not be walked on because his neighbour who has more land and money may be able to influence those who are considering the matter.  Therefore, my officials will continue to consult with the local authority engineers and the people concerned when such work is being planned.  I think this must be done.</P>
    <P>We have heard discussion as to whether or not there should be a general road authority or whether the local authority should continue, and we had a quotation by Deputy Molloy from a group of interested people who felt that this should be done in such a way that certain contractors should be able to contract for and do all this work.  They have a point of view but I stated, immediately after that, that the one thing I will not agree to&mdash; and it was, I think, mentioned in their statement also that they were interested in doing this&mdash;is to put in jeopardy the livelihood of thousands of road workers by handing over the entire road system of this country to a national road authority or to contract work.  I make that very, very clear; I will not agree to that under any circumstances.  I think it would be wrong, socially wrong.  I think those <Col N="262" /> people, who are employees with pension rights and have been doing a damn good job for very low pay for many years, should not have their jobs jeopardised.  I want to make that very clear so there will be no doubt about it.</P>
    <P>In fact, we already have such a national road authority&mdash;the officials of the Department of Local Government &mdash;who are, I consider, perhaps the best civil servants in this country and are doing their job fairly well.  They have been overseeing this sort of thing. While discussion has not been finalised as to how this will be worked out, I feel they will be quite capable of ensuring co-operation between local authorities without any major row; that where a road, motorway, main road or arterial road, call it what you like, is going from one local authority boundary into another there will be the necessary co-operation to ensure that it be carried out in the proper way and that there will be no hitch as a result. In addition to this, the engineering staffs of the local authorities are at a very high level.  I feel they will be able to carry out this type of work and ensure that it is done properly.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of examples of this.  At the present time, we can see where this work has been carried out throughout the country.  I see no reason why further delays should occur while we set up some type of major road body, which would only hold the thing up and would cost a lot of extra money.  One thing I do not like is the system we had here over a number of years where every new body set up to do work being done by somebody else before that resulted in a lot of extra cost and, very often, not so much efficiency. I am very sure that my recommendation will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy, I am sure, does not have to get any examples.  He was long enough in the job I am now doing to have had a damn good look at them.  Sometime he might like to go back over his notes and see where something like this happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that the Bill should go through as quickly as possible.  I will <Col N="263" /> give the fullest information I can to the House on any issue they want to raise on Committee Stage.  I will also ensure, as far as I possibly can, that the necessary money required for the financing of the schemes will be made available in good time, and fairly quickly, and that we will not have to be waiting for many years to get started.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Molloy is aware, the Dublin one should be under way fairly quickly.  I quite agree with Deputy Crowley when he says that Dublin is not the only place concerned; we will have to look at major roadways all over this country.  In some places efforts have been made but in others they have not.  Deputy Crowley was a little off beam when he referred to the fact that the Dublin one only was mentioned and that we were not mentioning anything else.  I think he should know that the reason the Dublin one was mentioned was that the forward planning was done there.  I would suggest that other local authorities, if they want to have something done about this, should prepare their planning, they should let us know what they want to do.  If they do this, they will be getting to the head of the queue; if they do not do it, then they do not have anybody to blame except themselves.  But there are a number of roads: people have come into me&mdash;local authority representatives and others&mdash;to discuss roads in their areas; the question of by-pass roads and the question of where there should be a major change in the road system.  Again, I want to assure those people, and the House, that I consider that money spent on this type of work is money very well spent.  Where we have towns being cluttered up, because of too much major traffic being directed through the main streets, an effort should be made to try to have a road system devised which will relieve this situation.  There are one or two cases &mdash;I think Waterford is one example&mdash; where a very slight change could help to remedy the situation.  Wexford is another; Drogheda has done something about this; they are preparing or are about to start a by-pass road&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Carlow, Athlone, most of the old towns with the narrow streets, through no fault of the present local authorities, are in that situation.  But there is no point in sitting there, looking at it and complaining that the Government are doing nothing about it.  The initiative must come from the local authorities.  They should prepare and, if it cannot be done this year or next year, they are at least getting closer to the point where something will be done if they bring the matter to the notice of the Department of Local Government. That is very worth while work they could do.  I would appeal to local authorities to ensure that this sort of thing is done.</P>
      <P>Again I would say thanks to the Deputies who have given their attention to the Bill, who even went to the trouble of reading the notes.  As far as I am concerned, whatever information I can give them I will give on the next Stage.  I would like to take the next Stage, if the Opposition are prepared, as early as possible next week, say, Wednesday or Thursday, if at all possible, because I want particularly to get this Bill through the House.</P>
      <P>There were quite a number of points made in this debate which were made as if this was the major Bill. Comprehensive legislation will have to be introduced.  We cannot do certain things under this Bill; this is an enabling Bill which will allow certain things to be done.  In order to do other things there will have to be specific Bills introduced which will allow us to do these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, one point about the Dublin situation I should like to mention and which I almost forgot is the fact that I had some people who apparently were not aware of the fact that the plans must be published. They must be given an opportunity of giving evidence at an inquiry before the thing is finalised.  Some people seem to imagine that the Government or the local authority can simply ride rough-shod over them when they want to do something.  The position is that, <Col N="265" /> after the publication of the plans, they will get an opportunity of deciding. But I would appeal particularly to Members of this House not to go off half-cocked.  It may be all right for the representative of a resident's association or somebody who feels interested to say that they are disturbed about something or other. That may be all right.  It is not all right when a Member of this House, whether on this side or the other side, makes a statement in public which may get him a few lines in an evening paper to the effect that he is opposing this or that.  If we go around opposing everything without even taking the trouble to find out what is contained in it, then there will be no progress in this country, no matter what Government are in office.  I would appeal to Members to show a little more common sense when they are asked for a comment from somebody who, rightly, feels entitled to get information which will make a headline for him.</P>

      <P>At the moment five Dublin hospitals have special facilities to cope with accident and emergencies from 6 p.m to 9 a.m. each night from Monday to Friday and from 6 p.m. on Friday to 9 a.m. on Monday. These are Jervis Street, the Mater, Dr. Steevens', the Meath and St. Vincent's hospitals.  They operate a rota system whereby one or two hospitals on the south side and one hospital on the north side are on duty each night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It occasionally happens that a hospital on duty may withdraw temporarily from a rota because of pressure on beds.  In these circumstances arrangements are made with another hospital to take any further accident cases.  This rota system seems to work <Col N="268" /> reasonably well but certain improvements are being made.  An improved and extended casualty department will be built at Jervis Street Hospital in the near future.  St. Laurence's Hospital also take accident cases and it is expected that they will participate more fully in the Dublin accident arrangements when additional staff and equipment are obtained.  In addition, the James Connolly Memorial Hospital has facilities for the reception and treatment of accident cases from St. Laurence's Hospital.</P>

      <P>Generally I would agree with the Deputy when he says that recipients of social welfare assistance allowances should be entitled to a medical card.  I cannot conceive of any case where somebody would be denied a medical card if he was in receipt of such an allowance. The Deputy refers here to a specific case.  I think that either I or the Parliamentary Secretary invited the Deputy to talk about this person. There is a little more in this case than the Deputy possibly knows. Suffice it to say that when he claimed to be unemployed he was not, in fact, unemployed.  If the Deputy wants to accept my invitation to talk about this case I will make myself available to do so.</P>

      <P>The question of establishing a residential centre for the mentally handicapped at Cloonamahon, Collooney, is at present being examined by the North Western Health Board.  If it is found to be a feasible proposition, the intention is that the centre would be under the control of the board and would be financed from public funds.  I would, of course, be most anxious that the views of the Sligo Parents and Friends Association about its operation should be considered and I have arranged for a discussion on the matter next week between my Department, the health board and the association.</P>

I would not be prepared to say at this stage whether or not it should be used exclusively for adult mentally handicapped or mentally handicapped children.  In any case, the proposition appears to me as one that would relieve the situation in respect of both the children and the adults.

      <P>Additional financial assistance for single-parent families was provided in the 1973 budget.  This included a new scheme of assistance for unmarried mothers, a new benefit for deserted wives and a special addition of 15p a week in respect of each dependent child of a widow, deserted wife or unmarried mother over and above the increase of 50p a week granted to children of other social welfare beneficiaries.  Further financial assistance flowed from the decision to relieve these categories of the necessity to pay the employees' share of an employment contribution while working. Single-parent families also benefited from the general increase in rates and the easing of the means test provided in the budget.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Single women are already eligible to receive a variety of benefits by way of social insurance and social assistance from my Department in relation to contingencies such as sickness, unemployment, retirement and old age.  In the past year the substantial increases in the rates of benefit and the extension of services to new classes have done much to help single women.  The extension of services included reduction in the minimum age for old age pension, removal of restrictive conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance in the case of women employed in domestic service or agriculture and the introduction of an unmarried mother's allowance.</P>
      <P>I might mention also that the social insurance arrangements were specially altered some time ago to enable credited contributions to be given to women who give up their employment to look after an aged and incapacitated relative for any period in which the assisted relative had been receiving a prescribed relative allowance or an old age (care) allowance in respect of them.  This change ensures that eligible single women are able to maintain continuity of their insurance for unemployment benefit, disability benefit, retirement pension and other social insurance benefit purposes.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that notwithstanding all these measures there are single women, no longer young, living in conditions of financial hardship. The question of providing assistance for such women is at present under examination in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there are many spinsters, some old and others not so old, who for one reason or another have been taking care of their <Col N="275" /> parents who subsequently have departed this life, leaving these spinsters untrained for any employment and living in fairly poor circumstances? While the home assistance scheme does provide some allowance, I would submit to him that that allowance is more by way of charity.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he would consider formulating a proper scheme for spinsters who are not employable, so to speak, which would be a good social step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of charity mentioned in the Deputy's supplementary does not arise.  It is important that people realise that any benefit they receive from the Department of Social Welfare is theirs by right.  In regard to the other points raised by the Deputy, there is a recognition in the Department that considerable hardship can be caused and has been caused to single women giving up employment to look after an aged mother or father or other relative.  The change that would allow credit and contributors to be given to provide continuity in their entitlement to Social Welfare benefits is a recognition of that.  However, as I indicated in the last part of the answer, notwithstanding the changes that have been made in the past year, the Minister realises that this is an area of considerable hardship, and that matter is being examined at the moment in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This distinction in entitlement to unemployment assistance arises from the fact that the eligibility of women in general for unemployment assistance is governed by special statutory conditions additional to the normal conditions applicable to both men and women.  As far as spinsters are concerned&mdash;and also widows&mdash;a special condition requires <Col N="276" /> the applicant either to have a dependent child or to have at least 52 paid employment contributions in the four contribution years immediately preceding the contribution year in which the application is made.

Those employed in industrial, commercial and service type employment will become insurable for all benefits, and will be credited with sufficient contributions <Col N="280" /> to enable them to satisfy the statutory contribution conditions for receipt of the short-term benefits such as disability and unemployment benefit. They will also come under the pay-related benefit scheme.  Their title to pensions will not be affected by the change from voluntary to compulsory insurance.  Those in permanent and pensionable employment in the public sector, for example, civil servants employees of local and public authorities, teachers, <i>et cetera,</i> will also cease to be voluntary contributors and will become compulsorily insurable only for widows' and orphans' pensions. They will not come within the scope of the pay-related benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>Voluntary contributors who are self-employed will not, of course, be affected by the abolition of the remuneration limit, and will not come within the scope of the pay-related benefit scheme.</P>

    <P>It is estimated that 25,000 permanent and pensionable State employees and 15,000 permanent and pensionable employees of local or other public authorities and statutory transport undertakings will come into compulsory insurance on the abolition of the £1,600 limit on 1st April, 1974.  The <Col N="289" /> figure of 15,000 includes employees of health boards and their hospitals and of numerous other bodies, some of which might be regarded as semi-State bodies, but no separate figures for these are available.  All these employees will only be insured for widows' and orphans' pensions and, with certain minor exceptions, occupational injuries benefit.  The weekly contributions will be 80p for men and 53p for women.  Of these amounts the male employees will pay 39p and female employees 15p.</P>

I should like to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that included in that target are the two Border battalions which will be the subject of the building of a new barracks at Monaghan and the renovation of the existing one at a cost of over £¼ million in Dundalk. As happens elsewhere in the country, Army recruitment occurs around existing barracks.  Until we have those barracks there we cannot get the full flow of people from the areas of Louth, Meath, Monaghan and Cavan which we would get if we had good barracks there.  If I succeed in reaching the target, the highest target that was produced taking into account those Border battalions, it will be very good.  However, until I have those barracks in operation I have not myself fully organised to get the maximum number of recruits from every part of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The whole of the current year's provision for the local improvements scheme has already been fully allocated to the county councils. Counties Leitrim and Sligo were allocated £100,000 and £30,000 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> An increase in the allocation to any county can only come from underspending by other counties.  I have this matter under examination and if any reallocation is possible the needs of Sligo, Leitrim and Monaghan will be considered in conjunction with any other counties requiring additional allocations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the waiting lists in both counties are very long and cannot be dealt with until such time as there is a substantial increase in the allocation? In Leitrim there is a five-year waiting list and the one in Sligo is very long also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to increase the allocation unless there is money from some counties who do not spend their allocation completely.  If there is any money that is not being spent in other counties I would attempt to allocate it to those counties which are entitled most to it.  The amount of money allocated both to Counties Sligo and Leitrim was substantial&mdash;£100,000 and £30,000 respectively&mdash;but everything cannot be done in the one year. I appreciate the difficulty and realise that a lot of extra money is required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The funds available for local improvement schemes in the current <Col N="300" /> year have already been fully allocated. The provision to be made for the coming year is at present under consideration and will be notified to the county councils as soon as possible. As the Deputy is aware, full discretion is given to the county councils to decide the priorities in the allocation of grants and they will I am sure take into account the demand for schemes of the kind referred to in the questions.  Arrangements for the inspection of schemes are also a matter for each county council.  Persons concerned with particular bogs should make application direct to the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the introduction of a special scheme in respect of these bog roads in view of the fact that they will be used to a greater extent this year than has been the case for some time past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the introduction of a special scheme would make any difference but if more money could be made available under the existing scheme the problem could possibly be solved.  However, I cannot visualise a situation in which an amount of money substantial enough to do all the necessary work would be made available because a big backlog has accumulated, as Deputy MacSharry is aware.</P>

I have been in touch with local authorities on the matter and information received from authorities is being examined. May I also say that this is something which, when I was in Opposition, I asked on a number of occasions should receive attention, and I have had a file from Deputy Fitzpatrick, the Minister for Lands, since I took office and representations from other Deputies, so the matter is not being forgotten.

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if his scheme for tenant house purchase will be applied to tenants who purchased their houses under the immediately preceding purchase scheme should they find it to their advantage and <i>vice-versa.</i></P>

    <P>66.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he intends to accept finally the demands of NATO regarding the house purchase scheme; and, if so, if he will introduce legislation to ensure that those who break the law will not have any advantage over those who obey it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 65, and 66 together.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation's new house-purchase scheme has not been suspended. It applies to houses sold to tenants after 1st July, 1973.  As I explained to the Deputy in replies to his Question No. 69 on 8th November last, while I am aware that the sales scheme which I introduced on a national basis is more advantageous to tenants than the scheme operated by the previous Government, I have no power to alter the terms of legal transfers entered into by tenants to purchase their houses under the former scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's party had ample opportunity over many years of office to prepare a sales scheme as fair as that which now applies, and I cannot accept his suggestion that I should now assume responsibility for rectifying retrospectively the inequities which may have existed under the former administration. The Deputy's purported concern to have retrospective effect given to the new benefits is strikingly at variance with his lack of action to press the former Minister for Local Government to back-date the improved discount arrangements for sales schemes which were introduced as from 1st July, 1972.</P>
      <P>A decision as to the terms of the new national tenant purchase scheme was made by me with the approval of the Government.  Before reaching a decision, I considered the views of all interested parties, including those put forward on behalf of the persons most directly affected&mdash;the tenants&mdash;by the National Association of Tenants' Organisations and by other groups of tenants.  I completely reject the Deputy's implications that the new and equitable scheme was forced on the Government by any pressure group and that every person who may apply to purchase his house under the new arrangements is, or was, a law-breaker. It is difficult to reconcile the Deputy's resentment at my willingness to consider the point of view of the tenants with his alleged desire to have the terms of my new scheme applied to tenants who opted to purchase under the scheme introduced by the former Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister whether, if tenants under the new scheme find themselves at a disadvantage, they can opt for the old scheme? I have read in the newspapers that this happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they have that right until 31st May of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply said he would not consider introducing <Col N="309" /> legislation to get rid of any of the anomalies which have resulted from the new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that I am not in a position to do what Deputy Lemass asked me to do.  I would dearly like to do something for people who were &ldquo;codded&rdquo; into buying at a price which was excessive, but that would have to wait until an opportunity occurs to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that elected representatives of the three major parties advised the tenants to buy their houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for what anybody else did.  I am simply saying what I did with the agreement of the Government.  It is unfair that Deputy Lemass should continue to suggest that the people who bought their houses under the new scheme are in some kind of way inferior citizens.  He described them as &ldquo;lawbreakers&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if his attention has been drawn to allegations that serious anomalies exist in the tenant purchase scheme introduced by him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the application of the new terms of sale for local authority houses, announced last July, has thrown up anomalies in individual housing schemes in some areas.  I have discussed the matter with the representatives of tenants and I am having the overall position reviewed to ensure that fair sale prices will obtain in all cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring in the first part of the question to local authority houses built by Dublin Corporation.  The local authority estimate that they will complete 1,500 such dwellings in the current financial year.  They completed 1,394 dwellings in 1972-73.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the corporation that they estimate that the number of dwellings to be constructed on land made available by them in the current financial year will be approximately 1,200 which was the corresponding figure in 1972-73.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not pick it up correctly.  Did the Minister say that the figure was going from 1,550 to 1,200?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to take this easy.  I have asked would the Minister repeat the figures.  Would the Minister do me the courtesy, with the Ceann Comhairle's permission, of repeating the figures?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will be glad to repeat them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring in the first part of the Question to local authority houses built by Dublin Corporation.  The local <Col N="311" /> authority estimate that they will complete 1,500 such dwellings in the current financial year.  They completed 1,394 dwellings in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the corporation that they estimate that the number of dwellings to be constructed on land made available by them in the current financial year will be approximately 1,200 which was the corresponding figure in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>That means that in addition to the houses they are building themselves they are getting 1,200 on land that was given to other people who built them.</P>

      <P>Proposals to amend the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, fall to be dealt with in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1973.  It is not appropriate to give in advance details of the provisions that will appear in the Bill.  However, I would remind the Deputy that a model order for use in making tree preservation orders is available and that local authorities have not indicated that the form of the order has been a problem for them. Also, I would remind him that under section 45 of the 1963 Act no compensation is payable in respect of a preservation order relating to trees which are not comprised in woodlands and which are of special amenity value or of special interest.</P>

      <P>In making his new proposals, would the Minister advert to something which he said by way of reply, namely, that so far as he was aware local authorities did not find anything defective in the existing provisions? One does not quarrel with that, but most of us would find a reluctance on the part of local authorities to avail of existing provisions or to take any action under them. In his new provisions, would the Minister keep that fact in mind and, perhaps, consider placing some positive obligation on local authorities to be more active in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will arrange to dispense with ground rents in respect of all new local authority housing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Ground rents of new tenant purchase houses are usually purely nominal sums&mdash;in many cases as little as 5p per annum&mdash;charged by local authorities to retain a lessor's interest and to ensure that any future development of the land is in the best interests of the community.</P>
      <P>There are, however, tenant purchase schemes where rents of up to £18 per annum are charged as a method of reducing the amount of the deposit which the purchaser would otherwise be obliged to pay.  I would see no objection to the local authorities concerned accepting higher deposits in order to reduce such ground rents to nominal sums, if the purchasers could afford such payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that it is necessary to charge a ground rent in order that the terms of the lease are complied with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a nominal ground rent, usually of 5p per annum, and this must be charged.  If there is no charge and if tenants purchase their houses two or three might come together and sell to a supermarket.  If the 5p is charged the local authority have a right to decide what use it can be put to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure my colleague, Deputy Colley, could clear up this matter for us.  I would have thought leases could be designed by a local authority that would protect the <Col N="321" /> situation from the point of view of the local authority without charging ground rent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In most cases the local authority impose it themselves.  We are talking about ground rents imposed by the local authority and there should not be any difficulty in the authority making their own arrangement about something they imposed themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any case except where the other payment is made for the purpose of reducing the amount of the deposit.  We are talking about two different things.  The 5p per annum is a nominal sum for the purpose of keeping control by the local authority and I do not know of any case in which a greater sum is required to be charged.  If the person has the money and is able to pay the deposit, the question does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiation of proceedings for the acquisition of land for housing is a matter entirely for the housing authority.  I presume the Deputy has in mind the central city housing development programme which was adopted by the Dublin City Commissioners on 10th January, 1974, on the recommendation of the Dublin housing co-ordinator.  The programme includes proposals for the compulsory acquisition of designated parcels of land.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on land acquisition aspects of the programme at this stage in view of my quasi-judicial functions in regard to the compulsory acquisition of land.</P>

      <P>The Minister will agree, I am sure, that it is time that the grants for the wage earner were on a par with those for the farmer, who at least has the site while the wage earner has to buy it?  At the present moment, as far as I know, the maximum for a man with £125 valuation is £920.  These figures should be levelled off.  A sum of £920 at the present moment is totally inadequate because the cost of building has gone up in the last 18 months, as the Minister knows by anything up to £2,000 per house.  The grants should be brought up to this level.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to hear that.  However, would the Minister accept that very often while local authorities may or may not have adequate power to do certain things, particularly in regard to pollution, the difficulty is to get them to do them? Would he undertake some activity in <Col N="330" /> this area in order to spur on the local authorities to be more positive in this matter of water pollution?  I am aware of a particular case where the pollution is about to occur.  Everybody knows the cause of the imminent pollution and it is impossible to get the local authorities to do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was specific and I could not go into detail.  I have called together all the bodies interested in preventing water pollution and I am in the course of setting up a national body which will monitor and help to suggest ways of preventing water pollution. Indeed a number of things have been done as a result of that meeting, which has so far produced reasonable results.  I hope to have the body which will be able to control water pollution bodies set up soon because at the present time there are a number of bodies throughout the country working on water pollution.  They are all working on water pollution in their own areas. My idea was to get them all to work together.  This has proved to be successful and I hope before the summer to have something definite on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation certain industries concerned with lead recovery are subject to control under the Control of Atmospheric Pollution Regulations, 1970.  The effect of the regulations is to require that the best practicable means must be used to minimise atmospheric emissions which may cause nuisance.  I understand that the position of certain industries in the Clondalkin area under the regulations is receiving the special attention of Dublin County Council as the local authority concerned with implementation of the regulations.</P>
      <P>The question of any need to advise people in particular areas in regard to the use of vegetables which may be lead-tainted is a matter for the appropriate health authorities and I understand that this aspect also is kept under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the Minister for Health said it was a matter for the Minister for Local Government was because Dublin County Council come under the Department of Local Government. I have requested them to give the greatest attention to this matter.  They are doing this.  In fairness to Dublin County Council it should be said that they are trying to ensure&mdash;I am sure Deputy Burke will agree with this&mdash;that everything possible is being done in this regard and that nobody is injured as a result of what is happening there.</P>

He said he was reviewing the position to see whether assistance could be made available under this scheme or any other scheme and that he hoped to be in touch with the local authority.  He has not been in touch with the local authority.  I had intended to put down another question or to see the Minister personally.  I checked with the local authority and the Minister has not been in touch with them since he answered this question.</P>

      <P>I indicated to Deputy Callanan at the time that I thought this scheme was worthy of consideration. On checking the matter in my Department, I found that a previous grant had been paid not by my Department but by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Therefore, it was suggested that it would not be appropriate for my Department to pursue it and I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to investigate the matter for me.  I understand that this is still in progress and I have just told Deputy Hogan O'Higgins and I am now telling Deputy Callanan that I will try to get a decision in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my purpose to support local authorities, to the fullest extent that the available resources will allow, in the discharge of their responsibilities for the provision and maintenance of a public road network suited to the safe and efficient movement of persons and goods.  This includes financial assistance, technical and administrative advice and guidance in the planning and implementation of road programmes, and the provision of necessary legislative powers.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of that objective, grant allocations of £18.9 millions representing an increased provision of £4.5 million over 1972-73 have, as I indicated in my statements when introducing the Estimates for my Department on 20th November last, been made through the Road Fund in the current year.  It is my aim to maintain a progressive increase in the annual provision for road works to cope with the backlog of necessary improvements. The priorities in the allocation of these funds, apart from essential maintenance, are the removal of the deficiencies in the national inter-urban routes; relief of congestion and provision for future growth in the urban areas; and support for regional development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Use will be made of available sources for research into future needs for major routes, including An Foras Forbartha and specialist consultancy services.  It is proposed as far as practicable to develop forward programmes of schemes and to define corridors for <Col N="342" /> future new routes so that they can be kept free of development likely to hinder or increase the cost of the construction of the roads.</P>
    <P>Where new roads are required, construction to motorway standard will be considered if projected traffic flows indicate that this type of road would be the most efficient and economical.  The Motorways Bill, at present before the Dáil, is intended to provide local authorities with the necessary powers to construct and operate such roads. The financing of road works is being examined in association with budgetary and capital programme policies.</P>

I think they are very useful, although I do believe that many people who are excellent drivers do fail their test through nervousness or other reasons.  I am hoping there will be some way of getting around this problem, perhaps inside the coming <Col N="344" /> year.  There were a number of rather foolish stipulations which were laid down and I had those altered, one of them being that persons who failed on a simple point failed and did not know why they failed.  They now have to be told why they failed, and unless they commit a major breach or two reasonably serious breaches of the regulations, they do not fail; they could commit a whole series of small breaches and it would not fail them in their test.  Similarly on the question of giving hand signals, we must include it because the EEC conditions lay it down that it must be included.  In the Irish test now they are carried out when the vehicle is stationery.  Many people were put off by being given tests which would never be of use to them, while they were undergoing a nerve-racking experience.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning Development) Act, 1963, and the Housing Act, 1966, give local authorities powers to enable them to improve the total living environment and to contribute to the revitalisation of towns.  The Planning Act mentioned also gives such authorities powers to play a considerable part in the preservation <Col N="346" /> of our architectural and historical heritage including the conservation, restoration and rehabilitation of old districts.  Using their housing and planning powers, local authorities can make provision for effective residential communities to cater for a wide range of persons and provide for all reasonable community needs.</P>
    <P>I have strongly encouraged local authorities to look to the needs of their areas and in particular have asked them to examine the practicability of acquiring and conserving existing dwellings in built-up areas for the benefit of families on their waiting lists for re-housing.  I have specifically requested the Dublin Corporation to see to the provision of housing in those central city areas which have been traditionally residential in character, with a view to restoring living communities in these areas.  Progress by the corporation has been striking.  The Central City Housing Development Plan recently adopted by the commissioners envisages the acquisition of sites to a total of 80 acres.  A similar central city redevelopment proposal is envisaged by Limerick Corporation for the Thomondgate area and the first phase of the project is at tender stage.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would also have regard to new housing areas.  One appreciates that the local authority is primarily concerned with getting the houses built. That is a first priority, but if more attention could be given to rounding off, as it were, these new housing schemes it would be very beneficial. In fact I saw where the Minister commented at some scheme he opened on the necessity for tree planting.  One has every sympathy with the local authority in this regard but perhaps they could try to envisage a fully completed scheme more often.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that already instructions have been given to local authorities to do exactly this. The trouble is that there are many areas where houses were built with such little regard for any type of open space or playing space or trees that it is difficult, but every effort is being made to try even in such cases to have something done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Acts cited by the Deputy are not in force in this country. The law relating to planning and development, including the provision of amenities is contained in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  The proposals for local government reorganisation would not result in changes in the planning code except that, in the administration of the code, some planning duties of urban district councils may be transferred to county councils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the planning authorities.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, enables them to make an amenity area order declaring an area to be one of special amenity and the order may specify that no development, other than exempted development, or only specified development will be permitted in the area or any specified part of the area.</P>

      <P>The question of replacement of trees which have to be removed because of urban or road improvements is one to be settled at local authority level.  Replacement may not be appropriate or possible in every <Col N="351" /> case but, in notifying local authorities of Road Fund grants for the current year, my Department has requested that &ldquo;care should be taken at all times to ensure that road improvements are designed so as to harmonise with the environment and to cause the minimum harm ... to the amenities enjoyed by local people&rdquo;.</P>

That is not the only problem involved in moving trees.

      <P>Following receipt of a report from the city manager on the civic offices project, which included an assessment of the possibilities of using an alternative site for the development, I discussed the matter with a deputation from the Dublin City Commissioners. I conveyed to the deputation the misgivings of the Government regarding the use of the Wood Quay/Winetavern Street site for civic offices because of its significant location in relation to Christ Church, its archaeological importance and its value as an open space in the context of the Government's desire to develop The Liberties and surrounding areas for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> The matter was again discussed with a deputation from the commissioners and I have been notified that the commissioners at their meeting on 4th instant passed a resolution recommending that the offices be built on the Wood Quay/Winetavern Street site subject to a regrouping of the buildings in accordance with a plan submitted by the consultants. The matter is being examined and I hope to give the Government's views on this recommendation at an early date.</P>

The programme of the Council of Europe for the year includes pilot projects, symposia, conferences and reports which should result in a great deal of information on the approaches adopted in participating countries, and how these might be improved.  It might be appropriate at that stage to review our own approach.  In the meantime I hope that the Bill to amend the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, will go some way towards increasing the protection which can be given by local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All aspects of the exchange rate for the Irish pound and their implications <Col N="365" /> for the economy are kept under continual review, account being taken of the location of export markets, competitiveness in trade, developments in the EEC, the position of sterling and other relevant factors.  On the basis of this full and continuing review no change is considered to be warranted in the existing one-for-one relationship between the Irish pound and the pound sterling and no change is proposed. There are many advantages deriving from this relationship.  The stable monetary basis which it provides for the greater part of the country's external trading and financial transactions does much to maintain confidence and to promote and facilitate trade and commerce between Britain and this country.</P>
    <P>As regards countries other than Britain, the lower exchange rate for the Irish pound which has resulted from the floating of our currency gives our exporters a strong competitive advantage.  I am glad to say that they are grasping this advantage as is evidenced by the substantial increase in their exports to non-sterling destinations over the past year or so.  Tourist earnings from non-sterling sources are also being boosted.  As I have previously stated in the House, it is intended that the floating of our currency will be brought to an end and that participation in the EEC's exchange rate arrangements will be resumed when the circumstances enable this to be done.</P>
    <P>I would add that progress towards economic and monetary union in the EEC does not necessarily depend on the establishment of a common Community currency.  Similarly&mdash;as will be evident from what I have already said &mdash;many questions other than that of a common EEC currency have to be taken into account in regard to the relation between the Irish pound and sterling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his reply, listed the advantages of maintaining the link with sterling and I should like to ask him if he is aware that his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the debate yesterday referred to the disadvantage <Col N="366" /> in this regard in so far as we have to pay more with the pound floating, and floating downwards, for imports from non-sterling countries and that he did not mention even one of the advantages the Minister has listed now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

If the Deputies opposite want to have a prolonged debate on the Irish link with sterling or the performance of Irish currency we would be only too happy to give it to them.  I am sure Deputy Colley knows well that Irish manufacturers could be seriously disadvantaged if we were to revalue our currency in such a way as to make it possible for people to send goods into this country which by reason of any change which we would make would give them an unfair advantage over Irish producers.</P>

      <P>At the outset I wish to state that Fianna Fáil are anxious to haul this Government before the people as soon as possible so that they may have an opportunity <Col N="368" /> of registering their grave dissatisfaction with the numerous broken promises we have had from the Coalition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  It is important in any election that the people should have fair representation. Obviously, the Minister was conscious of this fact because in the recent local government reorganisation discussion document issued by the Department, he referred, first, to local democracy and said that the National Coalition Government would consider it a priority at all times that power be vested in the people and that local government must be made truly democratic and relevant to their needs.  Secondly, the Minister put much emphasis on the human touch in local representation and said he considered that a large and complicated system of local authority on the lines proposed by the previous Government would not be conducive to preserving the human touch, a human touch that should be characteristic of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister has refused to alter the number of county councillors representing Dublin county at the next local election, can he say if in his opinion the human touch can prevail in a situation where as many as 300,000 people are represented by only 25 county councillors?  There are some figures that I wish to put before the House.  The 1971 census showed that the population of County Dublin was 284,000.  Because of population growth since then the present total is likely to be over the 300,000 mark.  The area is represented by only 25 councillors. This area is the biggest electoral area <Col N="369" /> in the country.  Cork is the next biggest with a population of 224,000 and has a representation of 46 councillors. A number of other smaller authorities have more seats.  Galway, with a population of 149,000 has 31 seats; Mayo, where the population is 110,000, has 31 seats also.  Clare has a population of 75,000 and has 31 seats.  Meath, with a population of 72,000 has 29 seats while Louth, with a population of 75,000, has 26 seats.  The figure for Dublin&mdash;25 seats&mdash;is the same as for Cavan which has a population of 53,000.  The figure for Laois is the same and the population there is 45,000.  Is this justice?</P>
    <P>Taking all county councils into consideration the national average is one seat per 3,200 of population but in Dublin there is only one seat for every 11,300 of population.  It will be seen therefore that the figure for Dublin is much higher than for any other area in the country.  The average in the Ballybrack electoral area is one seat to each 12,500 of population; the figure for Dundrum is one to 8,500, while for Lucan it is one to 10,900.  As I have said, these figures are based on the 1971 census and do not take account of the massive growth in population that has taken place since then.  In my own area of Swords the ratio is one to 9,700, while in Tallaght it is one to 11,500.  We all know that since 1971 the population of Tallaght has exploded.  My colleague on the county council, Deputy McMahon, speaks regularly of this massive growth in population in that area.  Let us compare these figures with ratios of one seat per 1,000 or per 1,500 head of population in other areas.  For example the Dromahair area has one seat to 1,020 while Muine Bheag has one seat to 1,480.</P>
    <P>In the electoral area of Swords, for example, there was a population increase between the years 1966 and 1971 from 32,400 to 48,600, or 50 per cent.  If this rate of population growth has been maintained the present figure is likely to be 60,000 and not 48,000 as was mentioned earlier.  I am not advocating that representation should be reduced in other areas, but I envy those people.  However, it is only right <Col N="370" /> and proper that there should be local councillors to deal with such small populations as 1,000 or 1,500.  This is local government as it should be.  It is not right that in Dublin 12,000 people are represented by one county councillor. That situation does not represent democracy and neither does it represent local government as it should be.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council, being very much aware of the problem, requested the Minister to increase the representation. We got a reply on the 7th November last telling us that because of the long drawn out process and in view of the fact that it was the intention of the Minister to hold local elections in 1974, he could not see his way to increase the number of members of the county council.  However, the Minister has been attempting to gerrymander the allocation of the existing membership. If the Minister should go ahead with the local elections on the basis of present figures in County Dublin, figures which in 1974 are atrocious and inequitable, what will be the position in five years time?  At the present growth rate I can foresee a situation in which each 20,000 to 25,000 head of population will be represented by one councillor.  This area of County Dublin is experiencing the fastest growth rate in the country and perhaps it has the greatest problems of any county council in the country.  They are managing on behalf of this Government the really important progress which is taking place.  They are administering the new towns envisaged with a population of 150,000 in Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown. The ratepayers of County Dublin are carrying this burden on behalf of the country.  This is unjust. Not only are they carrying the burden but they are being represented by 25 county councillors acting on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The situation is even worse than the figures portray.  While there are 25 county councillors in the Dublin County Council three of these councillors are sent from the Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  This is so because of some old Act.  Dún Laoghaire are entitled to send three representatives to <Col N="371" /> the Dublin County Council.  The population of County Dublin is represented by 22 county councillors in the Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>Having discussed this on a general basis, I would like now to bring it down to a discussion on the particular areas and to speak about my own electoral area which stretches from Santry to Balbriggan, taking in over two-thirds of the Ballymun housing scheme.  It is an area situated in Dublin County but the Ballymun scheme was built by Dublin Corporation.  There are mainly corporation problems here. It has been my privilege to represent these people since 1967.  On some occasions they received a bad Press, but I have always found them to be the most honourable, decent people one could deal with.  On all occasions it has been a pleasure to visit their area. The people there are hardworking, honest-to-God people.</P>
    <P>The new area of Donaghmede is also situated in County Dublin and within the boundaries of this local electoral area.  The Minister, by his own action in the recent attempt to gerrymander which has not yet been finalised, highlighted the anomaly. With one minor alteration the Minister has made the Swords local electoral area, represented by five county councillors, into a Dáil constituency which will send three Deputies to Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should set in motion the procedure for a public inquiry which apparently is necessary to increase the number of members on a local authority.  He should set this procedure in motion so that an inquiry can be held and the proper representation given to the people of County Dublin.  I do not see any reason why this cannot be done immediately and still continue with the local elections in June.  Even if the local elections had to be postponed until September, although we do not want them postponed, justice should be done.  The people of County Dublin are crying out for such justice.  There <Col N="372" /> is no justice in the present situation. The situation will be even worse by 1979 when the next local elections are due.</P>
      <P>I would say to the Minister that he has made definite statements about not being prepared to do this.  It is a big man who can change his mind on greater enlightenment.  I ask him to give serious consideration to the figures I have given him and to put the inquiry procedure into operation so that the people of County Dublin can receive justice and the numerical representation to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been active in his own local authority area for many years.  He is aware of the problems of the people in the area.  I ask him to do to County Dublin what he would like to see done to County Meath, and that is to give them fair representation. They are paying for it in their rates and taxes.  Give them what they are entitled to because without an increase in the numbers I cannot see how the bulk of the work which is coming before the members of the Dublin County Council can continue to be administered over the next five years.  This work is reaching astronomical proportions.  The paper-work is increasing all the time.</P>
      <P>In other countries if a new town or city were built, in size comparable to Tallaght, a commission would be set up to be responsible for it.  Instead of that, 22 county councillors are expected to deal with Tallaght, Clondalkin, Blanchardstown and the fringe areas.  They have also to deal with the development of the scheduled towns of Swords, Malahide, Skerries, Balbriggan and Rush, and the expansion of the rural area of Lusk.</P>
      <P>I am asking for justice for the people of County Dublin.  The Minister should set up a public inquiry in order to increase the representation for these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking as a member of Dublin County Council, I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the request made in regard to the number of councillors in the Dublin County Council.  I appreciate fully that the time is very limited. <Col N="373" /> I understand that legislation is necessary before a public inquiry is held and that such public inquiry must be set up before representation can be increased.  I appreciate that time is limited.  I am sure that the local elections could at least be postponed for five or six months to allow a public inquiry to be held.</P>
      <P>I fully support the plea made by Deputy R.P. Burke.  He said that Dublin County Council are supposed to have 25 county councillors but, in fact, they have only 22.  Three members come from Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation because of some old Act and because of services provided by Dún Laoghaire to Dublin County Council.  As a result, Dún Laoghaire are entitled to send three councillors to Dublin County Council.  This is difficult to explain or understand.  The result is that Dublin County Council have only 22 members.  There has been a great growth in population.  I know the Minister is aware of that. The Dublin County Councillors give their services voluntarily to a certain degree.  Each year every built-up area has a growth in the number of residents' associations and they expect time to be given to them by their local representatives.  In the present situation it is not possible for a local representative to give time or service to these associations, due to his many commitments and the size of the local electoral areas.  This is also due to the number of people residing in such areas.</P>

      <P>For the information of the House, Dublin County Council considered my letter in which I informed them that it was not proposed to increase the overall numbers before the local elections and it was noted. Therefore, I take it it has been accepted by Dublin County Council. However, the knight in shining armour comes riding into the House this afternoon in an effort to get some publicity in the newspapers and starts shouting about what should and could be done for Dublin County Council and the residents in County Dublin.</P>
      <P>May I remind the Deputy that the membership of Dublin County Council was fixed at 24 in 1930 and was reduced to 20 members in 1942 by Fianna Fáil?  They increased the membership to 25 by an order in 1948. From 1948 to date the population of Dublin has been growing apace but it was never considered necessary to get further representation for them until I suggested recently that Dublin County Council and every other local authority in the country should try to redress the imbalance that occurred with regard to the number of people represented by public representatives in each area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make matters worse, in 1960 Dublin County Council considered this matter as did the then Minister for Local Government.  He changed the areas a bit but he did not change the membership.  However, there was no request from Deputy Burke's predecessor in Fianna Fáil for a change. Obviously there was none because it <Col N="375" /> was not done.  Now, after years and years in which the people of Dublin were, according to Deputy Burke, being badly represented&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy also referred to the fact that I was gerrymandering the county council areas. This is the sort of snide remark that is getting the Deputy the dressing-down he richly deserves.  There is no question of gerrymandering.  The Deputy is as well aware as I am that the change suggested by me in County Dublin in an effort to have an equal number of people represented by each councillor, was more likely to lose my own party a seat than any other party in Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>Let us give credit where credit is due. That is why I will not take insinuation from people like Deputy Burke that I am as crooked as they were when they had the chance.  As far as I am concerned, what I am doing is honest and above board.  I have notified the local authorities that I wanted them to change their local areas in an effort to redress the imbalance that existed.  This is being done at the present time.  I have got requests from numerous areas, including Meath County Council, asking me to change the numbers.  It is interesting that before the last two local elections I had a resolution passed by Meath County Council and submitted to the Department of Local Government requesting an increased membership but the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government refused to do it.  There was no such request from Dublin County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke has a hard neck to come here and accuse me of being dishonest or unfair in dealing with Dublin County Council.  If he had gone to the trouble of checking he <Col N="376" /> would have found out the facts.  I have said, and I propose to carry it out, that I will have a public inquiry at which each area can make its case for additional members and then in the election after this coming one they will, according to Deputy Burke, be properly represented.  If Fianna Fáil were still here it would not be done; if they were still in office we would have the imbalance in the representation that has been carried on for so many years without a squeal from any of their supporters on the local councils. For a long time there was no city council in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I may sound angry about this but I am angry.  I do not mind anyone making a comment as long as it is fair but to find Deputy Burke coming here now, knowing that I have been in the House with a Bill since the morning and that I was here for one and a half hours during Question Time, with a stupid thing like this for the sole purpose of getting a few lines in the morning's papers, pretending he was the person defending Dublin County Council and people throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned Deputy Burke has stepped over the line.  He has no justification whatever for what he did.  He came in and trotted out a trumped-up charge that could not hold water&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the figures prove it.  I am not denying the fact that in the Dublin County Council area there are 11,374 persons represented by each councillor; there are the most up-to-date figures we have.  In Dublin city there are 12,617 people represented by one person.  Deputy Burke should check on the facts.  Those of us who are long enough in the House, no matter on what side, are too used to the wise guys who give selective <Col N="377" /> statistics for the purpose of trying to get away with something.  As far as I and the Department of Local Government are concerned it will not work. We are being fair with the local authorities.  We have asked them to arrange their areas so that there would be proper representation, one against the other, within that area.  We propose to do what is necessary for the purpose of having each area properly represented in future but we could not do it before the local elections. The Deputy's own party did not want the elections postponed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like the last general election, they may wonder after the local elections why they did not get them postponed so that they might save their bacon.  They tried that before but they were caught, as they will be caught again.  I will be fair with local authorities.  I have given my decision to Dublin County Council and they have accepted it.  That being so, I do not propose to change my mind.  It has been said that it is a big man who changes his mind.  If I changed for Dublin County Council, what argument would I have for refusing <Col N="378" /> to change for other local authorities? Does Deputy Burke think Dublin is Ireland?  It is not and the people in the country will get from me exactly the same consideration as people living in Dublin city and county.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned the decision has been taken.  Local elections will take place in June on revised areas within the county.  In fact, although I did not have to do it, I asked the local authorities to give me their recommendations.  I could have made my own decision but I asked the elected representatives to let me know how they thought the matter should be arranged.  In some cases people decided to leave matters as they were even though the imbalance was completely wrong.  I am prepared to accept what the local authorities recommend but I will not have someone coming into this House trying to put across the statement that I am deliberately trying to do something dishonest, knowing well that the Deputy's party, since 1948, allowed this situation to continue.  He would be the last to make a complaint about it if his party were still in office.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 12th February, 1974.</P>
