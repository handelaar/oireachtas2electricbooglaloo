      <P>On a point of order, under what Standing Order or rules is such a statement made, not that I am objecting to it being made?  If there is a Standing Order that allows such a statement to be made are the Opposition entitled to have any say in the matter?  Where there is more than one element in the Opposition are those elements entitled to have something on the record as well if they so think fit?</P>

      <P>It is a longstanding practice Deputy&mdash;it is quite rigid; I have no discretion in the matter&mdash;that in the issuance of statements of this kind only the Leader or Leaders of the Opposition party or parties are allowed to speak.  There is no motion before the House.  Therefore there can be no debate and the Chair has no discretion in this matter at all.</P>

      <P>Again, on a point of order, is it not with the implied unanimous consent of the House that any such statement may be made? Furthermore, did this practice not arise originally, and indeed solely, from a practice where such was allowed when a National Loan or some such matter was introduced, where the support of the Opposition would be forthcoming and where it was allowed that there should be a statement to support this?  This practice developed from that but was never intended to cover it.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition, representing the vast bulk of the Opposition in this House, and the Taoiseach may have their own views expressed.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Sunningdale Conference the following declarations were made:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="7" /> The Irish Government fully accepted and solemnly declared that there could be no change in the status of Northern Ireland until a majority of the people of Northern Ireland desired a change in that status.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> The British Government solemnly declared that it was, and would remain, their policy to support the wishes of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  The present status of Northern Ireland is that it is part of the United Kingdom.  If in the future the majority of the people of Northern Ireland should indicate a wish to become part of a united Ireland, the British Government would support that wish.</P>
    <P>The Government are aware that their declaration has been the subject of some controversy and that misconceptions have arisen in relation to it.  The Government were advised that as the declaration was the subject of legal proceedings firstly in the High Court and later on appeal to the Supreme Court it would not be proper for them to comment on the matters that had been raised until the issues ceased to be <i>sub judice.</i> The judgments in the Supreme Court have now been delivered and the Government are glad of the opportunity which is thus afforded to them to clarify misunderstandings and correct certain misconceptions.</P>
    <P>All the parties at the Sunningdale Conference were fully aware of the divergent political attitudes which were represented at the conference. They were concerned however not to accentuate those divergences, but to find ways to bring about accord in this island.  With this end in view each Government in making its declaration was concerned to assist in the process of reconciliation which the conference was endeavouring to promote.</P>
    <P>Instead of indulging in essentially arid and potentially divisive arguments as to the rights and wrongs of historic events now long past, the Irish Government considered that they should concern themselves with the present and look to the future, and see how best they could serve the common cause of securing peace and justice in Northern Ireland.  The Government were well aware that differences exist in the constitutional law of the Republic of Ireland and of the United Kingdom as to the status of Northern Ireland but they considered that it would not be helpful to debate those constitutional differences.</P>
    <P>They considered that peace and progress could best be secured by allaying fears which, however unjustified the Government felt them to be, were nonetheless very real.  Their object therefore in making their solemn declaration to the conference was to reassure those in the majority community of Northern Ireland who were apprehensive of the new institutions which were being created&mdash;the power sharing Executive and the Council of Ireland.  The Government therefore declared that there could be no change in the status of Northern Ireland until a majority of the people of Northern Ireland desired a change in that status.  The declaration was of course referring to the <i>de facto</i> status of Northern Ireland, that is to say the factual position, to which reference is made in recent judgments in the High Court and the Supreme Court.  The factual position of Northern Ireland is that it is within the United Kingdom and my Government accept this as a fact.</P>
    <P>I now therefore solemnly reaffirm that the factual position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom cannot be changed except by a decision of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  This declaration, I believe, is in accordance with and follows from the resolve of all the democratic parties in the Republic that the unity of Ireland is to be achieved only by peaceful means and by consent.</P>
    <P>The declarations of the Irish and <Col N="9" /> British Governments, and the arrangements agreed at Sunningdale, will be incorporated in a formal agreement to be signed at the formal stage of the conference.  This formal agreement will be brought before the Dáil and registered with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I believe that what I have said here today represents the view of this House. I hope it will also be heard across political and community divisions by all who want to see an end for ever to conflict and dissension in any part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>All of us who live today in the island of Ireland have inherited an immensely difficult and complex problem which has brought suffering and death to innocent men and women in each generation. It is a problem which no previous generation in our history&mdash; whatever else it may have achieved&mdash; was able to resolve.  The way is open to us who live in Ireland at this particular time to begin to resolve it.  The House can be assured that this work, pursued in recent years, will be carried forward by my Government with energy and resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley:</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the fact that the Government at last have given some clarification of what they meant by their declaration in paragraph 5 of the Sunningdale communiqué.  I think it unfortunate that this clarification was so long delayed, but it was, perhaps, even more unfortunate that the declaration was so ambiguously drafted as to require this clarification.</P>
      <P>I have always maintained, and I am on the record of this House to this effect, that in dealings between Unionists and the rest of the Irish people clear, honest statements of positions and aspirations are more likely to lead to fruitful understanding and progress eventually than opaque ambiguous statements the effect of which in bridging differences can only be short-lived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The confusion that arose out of the wording of paragraph 5 of the Sunningdale communiqué was added to by many statements from different quarters and by the continuing refusal of the Government to explain their position.  The statement by the Taoiseach <Col N="10" /> that the Government's declaration as set out in paragraph 5 was referring to the <i>de facto</i> status of Northern Ireland is, therefore, welcome, even if belated.  The <i>de jure</i> positions of the two sovereign Governments concerned remain unchanged. As between the Irish Government and the British Government there are conflicting constitutional claims.</P>
    <P>As between those who wish to maintain the constitutional link with Britain and the rest of the Irish people, the position is somewhat different.  There is a full understanding and recognition of the political aspirations of Unionists but there is also a firm conviction that in the course of time most Unionists will come to see that their best interests lie in a united Ireland.  In seeking to bring about a united Ireland we in Dáil Éireann have abjured violence and seek agreement.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's position in this matter is set out in an amendment in the name of our Leader, Deputy Lynch, to a motion recently discussed in this House. I quote from that amendment:</P>
    <P>...that Dáil Éireann...</P>
    <P>Declares that the use or advocacy of violence to secure unity is abhorrent to it,</P>
    <P>Re-affirms the inalienable right of the people of Ireland to a united Ireland,</P>
    <P>Re-affirms their aspiration to achieve this by peaceful means, and</P>
    <P>Accepts that for practical purposes this involves the agreement of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We do not expect any substantial change in political aspirations in the short term.  As I have said, we understand and recognise the basic political aspirations of Unionists.  We ask them to do the same for the rest of the Irish people and to accept that we have no desire or intention of trying to coerce them into a united Ireland.  If they would do that, it could constitute a major step towards ridding this island of politically motivated violence.  With those who support the two major political and constitutional aspirations in this country agreeing to differ on these aspirations and foreswearing violence to achieve their aims, the men <Col N="11" /> of violence would be much more effectively isolated.</P>
    <P>We believe that the concept of a power sharing executive and a Council of Ireland, far from being a threat to Unionists, constitutes the best hope of establishing a climate in which the people of Northern Ireland can live normal, peaceful, industrious lives. Like the Government, we recognise that the fears in regard to these institutions, however unjustified we feel them to be, are nonetheless very real.  I would reiterate the views expressed by Deputy Lynch in this House on 27th February last and reported at column 1681 of the Official Report.  When speaking of the Council of Ireland, he said:</P>
    <P>Even if there was a desire on the part of one side to dominate the other then the proposed structure and composition of the Council of Ireland as indicated in the Sunningdale communiqué would, I believe, make that impossible.</P>
    <P>We believe the Council of Ireland could have great potential for the economic development of the whole island, thereby improving the lot of all the Irish people, north and south. We also believe it could play a major role in reconciling different traditions and aspirations in Ireland, while recognising that such differences are real and deep-rooted.  In this connection, while the Taoiseach may be right in saying that we should concern ourselves with the present and look to the future, I believe it would be both unrealistic and self-defeating to attempt to ignore the facts of our history which have produced the present situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In short, I believe Unionists could have a great deal to gain and, because of its structure, nothing to lose in the proposed Council of Ireland.  We welcome the Government's clarification of their position and trust it will contribute to a realistic assessment of the situation now existing, and thereby expedite the movement to establish peace and justice in Northern Ireland, an aim for which Fianna Fáil have worked hard and not unsuccessfully for a long time.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1973: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Col N="13" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, has now been in operation nearly ten years and the general planning system which it established has worked reasonably well.  Nevertheless, it would be surprising if, in that time, experience with legislation of such a complex nature had not shown a need to improve various provisions or make them more effective.  That is the purpose of this Bill.  The amendments proposed in the Bill fall into three groups&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  those relating to the establishment of new machinery for dealing with planning appeals and similar matters,</P>
      <P>(2)  those for strengthening the provisions of the Act of 1963 relating to unauthorised development, and</P>
      <P>(3)  miscellaneous amendments, some of a relatively minor nature.</P>
      <P>The amendments relating to the establishment of machinery for dealing with planning appeals are the most important part of the Bill and I propose to deal at some length with them.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that appeals should be decided by a board&mdash;An Bord Pleanála&mdash;and the detailed provisions relating to the board are set out in the Schedule.  The chairman is to be appointed by the Government in a whole-time capacity for such terms as they may fix.  There will not be less than two ordinary members and these will be appointed by the Minister for Local Government.  It would be possible to have part-time as well as whole-time members. Appointments will be for three years but members will be eligible for re-appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board will be an independent body whose terms of office will be safeguarded by the provisions in the Schedule to the Bill.  I would draw particular attention to the terms of Articles 6 and 10 which deal respectively <Col N="14" /> with the tenure of office of the chairman and ordinary members. In the event of a chairman or an ordinary member being removed from office, a statement of the reasons for removal must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I have said that the board will be independent and by that I mean that no power or control may be exercised over the board in relation to any particular case with which the board is concerned.  This, however, brings up a major difficulty in the proposed transfer of functions to the board. While such matters as procedure are regulated by law, decisions on planning appeals must be related to the &ldquo;proper planning and development of the area&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Planning is an instrument of policy and it follows that any body charged with making decisions on planning appeals cannot operate in a policy vacuum.  The issues they raise are related to national policies and objectives, e.g., expansion of housing output, location of industry, the degree of urbanisation, protection of the environment, road safety, measures to meet road traffic and transport needs, conservation and preservation of amenities.  A prime purpose of planning control is to facilitate or secure the implementation of such policies and objectives.  Planning cannot be static.  It must evolve and develop to meet the needs of the community in the interests of the common good which is the basic objective stated in the Long Title of the Act of 1963 and also of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Such national policies may well be usefully reflected in a local development plan for a particular area, but it is unlikely that all local development plans will ever achieve perfection and there is always the possibility of a national policy over-riding local considerations.  The local development plans are, therefore, not a sufficient policy guide for the planning appeals authority, although by law the appeals authority must have due regard to them.  The appeals authority must also be aware of and give due attention to various national policies.</P>
    <P>This poses no problem at present. The appeals authority is the Minister <Col N="15" /> for Local Government.  As a member of the Government, he is in the full stream of the policy making process and his own Department is responsible for a very important group of relevant functions in relation to infrastructure and development and social objectives.  A different situation arises with the board and two provisions of the Bill are designed to meet the problem.</P>
    <P>Because the board will not have available to it, in the same way as the present appeals authority, information as to national policies and objectives relevant to planning, section 4 of the Bill requires the board to keep itself informed of the policies and objectives of Government Department, semi-State agencies and harbour and planning authorities so far as may be necessary for the discharge of its functions.  Furthermore, in view of the need for some central focus for the issue of guidance to the board in this area, section 5 enables the Minister for Local Government to give the board general policy directives to which it must have regard but the Minister is specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to a particular case.  This latter provision which is contained in subsection (3) is particularly important.</P>
    <P>Section 4 and 5 mean, in effect, that the board will have available to it information and guidance for its assistance in applying the considerations laid down in the Planning and Development Act of 1963 for dealing with appeals but otherwise will be completely free to make such decision as it thinks proper in each individual case.</P>
    <P>Other sections relevant to the board are section 7 which deals with accounts and section 8 which requires the board to make a report to the Minister each year.  This report must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The board must also supply the Minister with any information he may request in relation to its functions.  Similar provision to this exists in the law relating to local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> Section 10 deals with the staffing of the Board.  It enables the board to employ its own staff but it is likely that difficulties will arise, particularly in the early stages, in getting skilled and experienced staff in sufficient numbers. To avoid disruption and delays, it is envisaged that for the time being the staff engaged on planning appeals work might be seconded to the board.  Certain controls over remuneration are given to the Minister to be exercised with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  This is in line with the Report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group.  Other standard-type provisions dealing with superannuation and membership of the Oireachtas or of a local authority are included in the Bill itself for employees and in the Schedual for members of the board.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is the section which provides that appeals, references, and similar matters, will as from &ldquo;the appropriate day&rdquo; be brought to and decided by the board instead of the Minister.  The various types of appeals and the other matters are set out fully in the explantory memorandum.  On the same day, under section 19, all such matters currently before the Minister will also become the responsibility of the board.</P>
    <P>I think it is generally accepted that one of the best features of the present system is that a person who wishes to make an appeal may do so simply by writing a letter.  This is being continued. All a person needs to do, if the decision of the planning authority is unacceptable to him and he feels that there are reasonable grounds, is to ask to have the decision reviewed.  If there is an oral hearing, he knows that there will be no undue formality in the procedure and that he can make his own case or be represented by another person. There is, of course, no objection to a solicitor submitting an appeal on behalf of a client or to counsel appearing on his behalf at an oral hearing but the point is that the appellant need not be deterred from exercising his rights by fears that he will not stand a chance unless he incurs heavy legal expense.  This is particularly valuable in the case of third parties who might otherwise hesitate to assert their rights <Col N="17" /> against big commercial, industrial or development concerns.  If this feature of the present system is to be preserved, the board will have to ensure that it does not develop a more formal or legalistic approach.</P>
    <P>On the other hand there has been some abuse of the appeals procedure. There have been some complaints that certain appeals were frivolous or vexatious.  The number may be few but there can be serious financial and other consequences for a developer who finds that he is unexpectedly held up by a third party appeal for which there may be no adequate planning grounds.  An appellant can, under the present procedure, drag out the proceedings and at the last minute cause further delay by demanding an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>To meet this problem, section 16 of the Bill will enable the board to deal expeditiously with an appeal which is clearly vexatious and section 17 will enable the board to require contributions to be made to the expenses involved in an appeal.  Section 17 is substantially a re-enactment of section 18 of the 1963 Act but widened now to cover third parties.</P>
    <P>Under the present system a party to an appeal can demand and must be given an oral hearing.  With the increased rate of development, changes in the nature of development and growing public interest in environmental and planning matters, the intake of appeals is now approaching 4,000 per annum or about 10 per cent of all applications for permission.  It is for this reason no longer practicable to ensure that every appellant who demands an oral hearing will get one unless we are prepared to accept very extensive delays.  The great majority of appeals are decided on written representations.  This system is more expeditious and, in general, has been accepted as fair.  Section 14 gives the board discretion as to whether or not an oral hearing will be held.</P>
    <P>However, this does not mean that there will be no oral hearings.  I fully accept that there is a strong case for hearings in certain circumstances.  I have in mind appeals relating to projects <Col N="18" /> of major importance and cases which are of general public interest. There may be others.  There are, for instance, some cases which can be dealt with more conveniently by way of oral hearing because of the type of issues involved or because of the delays involved in exchanges of documents or representations between a large number of parties.  I would expect, therefore, that the board would use their discretion in the general public interest so as to reduce the average time taken to deal with an appeal and have public hearings in appropriate cases.  It will be open to any person to petition the board to hold an oral hearing and such requests may be granted irrespective of whether they come from a person who is a party to the appeal.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into all the remaining provisions of the Bill.  As I have already indicated, these are directed mainly towards strengthening the provisions of the Act of 1963 in relation to unauthorised development and to effect various other improvements, some of a relatively minor nature, which experience has shown to be desirable.  I may mention a few of these provisions very briefly.  Section 22 enables a planning authority to serve a notice in respect of unauthorised development which has commenced or seems likely to commence. This will have the effect of increasing substantially the penalties which may be imposed for any contravention. Section 23 enables the High Court to prohibit continuance of any unauthorised development or use and section 25 provides that, if a planning permission is not used within five years of its grant, it lapses. There are also many amendments consequential on the transfer of functions from the Minister to the board.</P>
    <P>Many of these miscellaneous provisions are difficult to draft and, because of their complex nature, I think they would be better left for detailed consideration on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I would like to say that I will be prepared to give full and objective consideration to any <Col N="19" /> reasonable amendments which Deputies might wish to put forward at Committee Stage.  May I say that, because of an important appointment made before the arrangements for the long sitting today, I may have to leave the House before Deputy Molloy has finished his contribution but I am sure he will understand.</P>

Of course, we welcome also the opportunity presented by the Bill to review the working of the 1963 Planning and Development Act which the House will agree was a major piece of legislation.  Certainly, it was one of the most important pieces of legislation brought before the House over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his concluding remarks, recognises that many of the provisions in the Bill, as presented, were difficult to draft and are of a complex nature.  I welcome the Minister's assurance that he will be prepared to consider any reasonable amendments suggested by Deputies from either side of the House.  I think he expects there may be some from this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity presented to us now to discuss the 1963 Act in full and the Minister's amendments to it should not be missed.  We should give the 1963 Act a very thorough review and examination, considering very carefully the changes the Minister proposes.  We all recognise that the 1963 Act did place a very great burden of responsibility on the elected members of local authorities and also on the officials working in those local authorities.  That is greatly recognised. The House will agree also, that if it placed a great responsibility on those persons, it probably placed too great a responsibility on one person, that being the Minister for Local Government who, under the 1963 Act, was charged with deciding all appeals against planning authority decisions <Col N="20" /> on applications.  Over the years I think the elected members and officials have performed their responsibilities under the 1963 Act with very great care and they deserve the thanks of the community for the work done.</P>
    <P>There have been criticisms of the 1963 Act but, if it was lacking in anything, it must be the enforcement provisions which, as we know from experience, did allow unauthorised development to continue while proceedings were being instigated against the persons carrying out this unauthorised development.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, the Bill proposes three main areas of change.  The main one is the establishment of An Bord Pleanála which will undertake the Minister's functions in deciding on appeals and the strengthening of the provisions in the 1963 Act relating to unauthorised development.  Then it amends various provisions in the 1963 Act which, in the light of experience, needed improvement or to be made more effective.  We welcome all of these matters but we would like to go into them in much greater detail than has the Minister in his opening remarks. Sections 1 to 20, including the Schedule to the Bill, deal in the main with the establishment of the board, its powers and functions.  Section 21 to 24 deal with the strengthening of enforcement powers and sections 25 to 36 with the various improvements of the 1963 Act which the Minister mentioned.  My comments on Committee Stage will be confined largely to what I hope will be constructive criticism of the Bill as presented.  Then, depending on the Minister's explanations of the matters raised by Members of the House&mdash; when he comes to reply to the debate &mdash;we will reserve our right to put down amendments.  We do hope that the points we raise will receive full consideration by the Minister and that he will reply in full to them.  The Bill is complex and the 1963 Act is a substantial piece of legislation.  If we are to examine it here, any points we may raise deserve full investigation and consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to start with section 4 subsection (1) of the Bill.  I shall be coming back again to section 3 which, of course, is the main section.  Section <Col N="21" /> 4 (1) obliges the board to keep themselves informed of the policies and objectives for the time being of the Minister for Local Government, of planning authorities and any other body, which is a public authority, whose functions in the opinion of the board may have a bearing on proper planning and development.  One could say that this is one of the most important sections of the whole Bill because, if this section is allowed to stand unaltered, then the House can question seriously whether the board the Minister proposes to establish will be an independent one, as the House is led to believe it will be.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 4 (1) are limited to the policies of the Minister, the planning authorities or other public authorities and are defined in the Bill.  The provisions are weighted against such opinions as might quite properly be taken into consideration by the board.  I am referring to opinions of private individuals and groups who concern themselves with proper planning and development, either generally or in a particular case. The obvious constant flow of information in regard to the policies and objectives of the Minister and public authorities will tend of necessity to condition the minds of those persons whom it is intended to appoint to the board.  They may be influenced by the official view when they come to take decisions on appeals which come before them.</P>
    <P>The 1963 Act allowed for representation by An Taisce and Bord Fáilte so that their views could be taken into consideration.  This board are supposed to act independently and should be allowed to consider information from sources other than the official ones.  There are many people interested who involve themselves at great cost in time to studying planning matters.  They show concern for planning and development.  They have been making a valuable contribution to planning thought in this country. There should be some way in which they could submit their views to the board.  Their views should be considered in making decisions in regard to policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> Section 5 brings this matter a stage further and states that the Minister may give to the board general directives as to policy in relation to development and the board shall in performing its functions have regard to any directive under this section.  While subsection (3) provides that nothing in the section shall be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case with which the board is or may be concerned, it is, nevertheless, a watering down of the board's independence and allows the Minister in general terms to control the board without having any responsibility for the exercise of power by the board in any particular case.  If we are setting up an independent board such board should be independent of the Minister. This section seriously affects that independence.</P>
    <P>To illustrate this point, we have only to consider a recent directive issued by the Minister to local authorities which I claim authorised planning authorities to contravence their own development plans without the necessity of amending these plans or taking into consideration the proper planning development of an area.  The Minister's circular received widespread publicity and created a major change in the policy now being operated by planning authorities in dealing with applications coming before them.</P>
    <P>In the directive I have mentioned the Minister stated that as and from the time the circular was issued he and his Parliamentary Secretary were going to pay heed to the general relaxation of planning laws which were indicated in the circular.  That was a detrimental step which dismayed those who have dedicated their lives to planning and to increasing their knowledge of planning matters.</P>
    <P>If under this Bill the Minister is allowed to issue similar directives, which will have greater authority because they will be directives instead of circulars, this will be detrimental. A person acting on the board will be restricted in his degree of independence if he does not comply with the Minister's directives.  His position might be in jeopardy.  The board should be completely <Col N="23" /> independent of the Minister provided they are carrying out the functions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act as amended by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The independence of the chairman is also a matter for serious consideration. The position of the people who will be appointed members of the board is very important.  In exercising their duties they should be allowed to act independently.</P>
    <P>Clause 6 of the Schedule is of considerable importance.  It is provided that the chairman shall be a whole-time appointment.  There must of course be procedures for removing the chairman from office, but I would suggest that they should be confined to reasons such as ill-health, stated misbehaviour or incapacity of some kind.  This would be in line with the constitutional provisions for the removal of judges.  It is hard to limit the scope of the phrase in clause 6 of the Schedule as &ldquo;whose removal appears to the Government to be necessary for the effective performance by the board of its functions&rdquo;. This decision of the board, having regard to the duty of the board to have regard to the directives issued by the Minister, may preclude the chairman from taking an independent line which might be contrary to the ministerial view.  The chairman might be deterred from doing this by fear of removal under clause 6 of the Schedule.  I accept that there is the safeguard which provides that the Government shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the reasons for the removal.  As we know, by the time such statement is laid before each House of the Oireachtas the decision to remove the man will have been taken.  There is no provision in the Bill for the annulling of a Government decision by the Oireachtas.  The same applies to the ordinary members. They come under clause 10 of the Schedule.</P>
    <P>My points raise some doubts about the degree of independence exercisable by the chairman and ordinary members of the board.  The appointment of <Col N="24" /> the chairman is a Government appointment while the appointment of each ordinary member is a ministerial appointment.  It is extraordinary that there are no terms of reference what ever as to the qualifications required If the present attitude of the Government in regard to appointments is carried through, these positions are likely to be filled by supporters of the Coalition Government who will have even less independence.  We might consider it preferable to continue to have the Minister with the functions which he had under the 1963 Act rather than have a Fine Gael hack appointed to do the job; at least we can say that the Minister is answerable to the Oireachtas, but if some gentleman who is currying favour with the Fine Gael Party is appointed to carry out these important functions without necessarily having any qualifications whatsoever for the post and being answerable to nobody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary, to a Bill which was brought in by the Fine Gael Party when in Opposition, which sought the establishment of an independent board <Col N="25" /> and that the appointments to that board would be through the Civil Service Commission.  I think it even specified that the person should have certain professional qualifications before being considered for the appointment. The acceptability of this new board, their independence and the confidence that they will make fair and honest decisions, will depend on how qualified the persons to be appointed are for the job and the way they are appointed.  I do not see how the Minister can justify leaving this provision so open as it is at the moment, and I would ask him to consider an amendment setting out that at least by regulation the Minister would be obliged, following the passing of the Bill, to draw up qualifications for these positions.  We might accept that, but we would want greater assurances than are contained in the Bill at this time.  Clause 2 of the Schedule reads:</P>
      <P>The Board shall consist of a chairman and not less than two ordinary members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again we would like to question the wisdom of allowing a board to be established which could, in fact, consist of only three members as the Bill stands.  One of the over-riding considerations in amending the 1963 Act must be the speeding up of the whole planning appeal process.  We do not believe that a board of three will be adequate to deal expeditiously and in a fair manner with planning appeals if it is to be confined to such a small membership.  We also see a difficulty should one member of the three-member board become ill or be absent for some reason or other, that the two members then present would merely be approving of each other's recommendations.  We do not consider that the Bill should allow such a situation to happen and we should guard against it.  It must be accepted by the House that it will happen quite often, when there is a three-member board, that all three members will not be present for one reason or another.  In that situation there would be two members who would be swopping each other's recommendations and proper and <Col N="26" /> thorough consideration might not always be given in such circumstances. The only way to overcome that is to have a larger board of four ordinary members and a chairman.</P>
    <P>There can be many problems with a small board, one of which is that there could be one personality completely dominating the other two and his thinking could have an enormous influence on all decisions.  I do not think it would be practical to suggest that the members of the board should be changed after a short period.  If you wanted to attract the right calibre of person to undertake this onerous work, then there must be some guarantee of tenure of office; there must be some constancy in the position being offered to him.  On balance, I think that would be preferable, but in order to avoid the situation in which one person would dominate a small board, as those of us who have had experience of meetings know can happen, I suggest the larger board.</P>
    <P>It is not provided in the Bill that the Minister's directives should be issued in writing to the board.  We believe they should be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas before being given to the board, that they be general directives of policy and not related to specific matters or to specific appeals.  These directives which the Minister will issue will be of great importance and their contents should be known to the general public, to persons who are interested in planning applications or in appeals current at the time, or to persons who plan to make applications and who are trying to find out what exactly is the public policy in regard to planning in any particular area.  There should be full public knowledge in relation to planning policies.  Section 8 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>The board shall supply the Minister with such information relating to its functions as he shall from time to time request.</P>
    <P>This should be amended to include: &ldquo;and the Minister shall lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas all such request in writing together with the replies thereto&rdquo;.  What I am suggesting <Col N="27" /> is that all such requests under section 8 should be in writing and that these and the replies received to them should be laid before both Houses for the very same reason.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 there could be a situation in which part-time or consultant services are availed of.  I think that these should, at all times, be accompanied by a statutory declaration (1) that the person or persons involved are acting impartially in the interests of and to the instructions of the board; and (2) that no vested or other interest, past or present, shall prevent such impartiality.  That guarantee might be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The scheme of the Bill is embodied in sections 13 to 20.  They deal, in the main, with the changing of the appeal system.  The effect of these sections, as we know, is to transfer appeals from the Minister to the board.  As I stated at the outset, we support this principle, though we recognise that it still does not overcome some valid critisisms of the 1963 Act.  I should like to give one example: the person who conducts the appeal is not the ultimate decider.  In other words, a person, at present the Minister, who has not heard the case and has not had regard to the demeanour of witnesses or the effectiveness or otherwise of the cross-examination of witnesses, should not as a matter of natural justice make a decision based on writing furnished to him by other persons.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that that has been used as a criticism of the 1963 Act and the appeals system laid down under it.  In this Bill we are merely transferring that from the Minister to a board.  Still, that criticism could be valid.  I know it is difficult to see how this criticism could be overcome and all I am asking is that the Minister, who must have given some thought to this and fully considered it before finalising the Bill which is now before us would deal with that aspect of the criticism in his reply.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether section 13 includes an application under section 26 (3) of the 1963 Act.  That section provides for the <Col N="28" /> Minister's consent to the granting of permission for a development which would materially contravene a development plan.  As the Minister has said, the Bill is fairly complex and, of course, the 1963 Act is a substantial piece of legislation.  I should like him to clarify that the Bill confirms that this function still lies with the Minister.  If that is so I hope the Minister will tell us.</P>
    <P>At this stage I wish to pose a question to the Minister.  Would he consider putting a time limit on the period allowed for deciding planning appeals? The period could be three months or four months and that might seem reasonable.  We are anxious by this Bill to improve the appeals structure and to provide a system which will allow for early decisions on planning appeals.  This has been another major criticism against the 1963 Act&mdash;that it has been holding up development, that it has been difficult to get decisions from the Minister and the Department. The Minister has stated that he is short of qualified planners, that these people are scarce and that he has not been able to deal as expenditiously as he would have liked with the number of appeals coming before him.  All Ministers have been concerned about this delay in the issuing of appeals. All have tried to take special steps to remedy it.  It presents a big problem.</P>
    <P>I submit that when it was considered valid to include a time limit in stating a period within which the local authority were obliged to grant permission&mdash; the two month period&mdash;then it might also be valid to include a limit on the time available for making appeals.  I ask the Minister to consider that, why he has rejected it and if he would reconsider the whole matter and include a section stating a time limit.  It would act as a spur and might give some assurance to persons that their appeals will be dealt with fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us how many cases have arisen under the sections of the 1963 Act which are covered by section 13 of this Bill, in particular sections 29, 48, 76 and 85 of the 1963 Act.  I suspect there were very few but I should like to know how many.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> Before I leave the question of the board and the appointment of members, it seems from the explanatory memorandum and from the Minister's opening statement that the real intention behind the Bill is that the Minister will appoint civil servants to be the ordinary members of this board. If he does that and if he insists on maintaining a minimum of three members on the board, this again will greatly limit the independence of the board.  If, however, he agrees to our proposal for a five-member board, four of them ordinary members, he could then safely appoint a civil servant&mdash;one, or possibly two. This is an area we will have to go into in much greater detail on Committee Stage.  There is the whole question of terms of reference and the qualifications of those persons or whether it is to be merely a shifting from the Minister's back on to civil servants who will be acting as members of the board.</P>
    <P>It is a valid argument to say that to ensure the smooth introduction of this new planning appeals system one must avail of the services of staff who are accustomed to this work and who have been involved in it and who can be used during a transitional period. Some cynics might cast their eyes back to previous similar statements where this good intention actually became a practice in the long run. I do not think the civil servants themselves would wish to be the board as constituted; there must be outside persons from the community, fully and properly qualified.</P>
    <P>This, of course, raises the whole question of the type of people the Minister will attract, really well-qualified people to undertake this work.  The Minister has made no mention of the type of salary that will be available.  Of course it would not be normal to go into such details as that at this Stage, but I would suggest to the Minister that if this system is to be made to operate successfully he will have to pay substantial salaries to those persons, that he will have to look on their appointment somewhat similarly to the appointment of justices.  Those people will have to be <Col N="30" /> allowed to act independently and will have to be paid accordingly.  I trust the Minister will not be niggardly in this matter.  It is the end result that will count and we want the best qualified people appointed to these posts.  Section 14 is one of the shortest sections in the Bill and yet is one of the most important.  It states:</P>
    <P>The board shall have an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing of any reference or appeal to the board.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister and the Government to know that we have serious reservations about this section.  In the first place, it cuts across section 82 (2) of the 1963 Act which provides that regulations shall be made under the section providing for oral hearings of any reference or appeal in respect of which an oral hearing is requested by any person.  The radical change that is proposed here gives the board the right to refuse an oral hearing.  I am aware it has been held that such a power cannot be exercised in an orbitrary way, but one may ask what is the need for the words &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo;, unless it is to try to cut down the number of oral hearings?  One can reasonably suspect that that is what is behind it.  Indeed, the Minister was honest enough in his opening statement to spell it out&mdash;that that is the intention behind this section.  On their face value, the words could be deemed to contravene certain articles of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  Article 40.1 states:</P>
    <P>All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
    <P>This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3.10 of the same Article states:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>I submit that it can be held that the right to appeal is a property right and that this section which enables the <Col N="31" /> board to discriminate between one citizen and another brings about a situation where citizens may be held unequally before the law in respect of their property rights which the State in the Constitution binds itself to vindicate. I suspect the Minister will urge that this section is designed to deny a right to an oral hearing in respect of frivolous or vexatious appeals.  When one looks at the Explanatory Memorandum this is what it states.  The explanation given there dealing with section 14 states:</P>
    <P>This section gives the Board absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing of any reference or appeal. This will help the Board to deal expeditiously with cases, particularly where an appeal appeared to be ill-founded or vexatious... The Act of 1963 required the Minister to accede to the request of any party to an appeal for an oral hearing and it seems clear that the provision was being abused in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Most people will agree that it would be reasonable to hold that it would not be unconstitutional to deprive frivolous or vexiatious litigation of the assistance of the law but as the section stands it seems to go much further and, indeed, much further than any other provision dealing with appeals that one can find in legislation passed by this House over the years.  It goes quite far; the House is being asked to accept it but we question it and express serious reservations about it.  We look forward to hearing a fuller explanation from the Minister of the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the matter could be easily dealt with in the same way as is provided by the Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1857, as amended by section 51 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961.  These provisions relate to an application to a district justice for a case stated.  Section 4 of the 1857 Act provides that if the justice be of opinion that the application is merely frivolous, but not otherwise, he may refuse to state a case and shall, at the request of the applicant, sign and deliver to him a certificate of such a refusal.  We have serious reservations <Col N="32" /> on section 14 as it stands and we ask the Minister to consider seriously the points we have raised.  If he indicates his willingness to amend the section we can assure him of our full support. If the amendment we suggest to section 14 is accepted it would remove the necessity for the word &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; in section 16 which comes later on.</P>
    <P>Under section 15 the board may take into account... I suggest that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this context should be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because the whole basis for the institution of the board is the proper planning and development of the area concerned and it is considered that this should be central to the board's deliberations.  I fail to understand why the softer word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used rather than the more positive one obliging the board to take these necessary matters into consideration.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the absolute time limit in section 20 is undesirable and I should like the Minister to consider whether the board should be given a right in a proper case to extend the time for making an appeal in the interests of justice.  This is made all the more important by the fact that a person other than an applicant is not entitled as of right to notice of the making of the decision to grant planning permission but, notwithstanding that, he has under section 26 (5) <i>(c)</i> (ii) of the 1963 Act a period of 21 days to make an appeal beginning on the day of the giving of the decision which may or may not have been communicated to him.  I ask the Minister to consider granting the board discretion to extend the time so as to enable an appeal to be brought.  An amendment along these lines would require much thought but I am sure the Minister would agree&mdash;I am not in any doubt as to the difficulties my suggestion could create in trying to meet it by way of sections in the Bill &mdash;that it is a point that should be considered because one can think of many cases where it would have been more just if somebody had the authority to extend the time limit.  No provision was made for it.  I do not expect such a provision would be availed of very often but it should exist. <Col N="33" /> In that particular matter I would give absolute discretion to the board.</P>
    <P>The section deals with the extension of the time in which an appeal or an application sent by letter shall, in fact, be deemed to have been received.  This needed some tidying up.  There was a good deal of confusion in the early days of the operation of the 1963 Act and it is well to avail of this opportunity to clear it up.  The Minister's Explanatory Memorandum in relation to this section states:</P>
    <P>Clarification of the position in regard to the latest time for acceptance of appeals under the Acts.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the appallingly bad postal service available from time to time in certain parts of the country. Generally it is fairly good but there are occasions when the post is not delivered regularly.  I have had cases of the post being a week or ten days late. There is also the special position of persons living on islands where the post goes only once or twice a week, depending on the weather.  No provision is made for such persons.  I have had interesting cases because there is a number of islands in my constituency and in making representations for the people on them, living and working with these people over the years I have come across quite a number of cases where these time limits on acceptance dates for applications for planning permission or fishing licences have proved very awkward, when the boat did not travel and the person concerned was unable to go to the local post office or put a letter in the letter-box as is done on the mainland, and where we expect postal collection within 24 hours and delivery within 48 hours.  These people have been omitted from all the legislation up to now and I am suggesting there should be some proviso to cover people living on islands who do not have regular postal service.</P>
    <P>Even those who live on the mainland and enjoy 24 or 48-hour delivery service know that this service is not constant.  It is the aim of the Post Office and they achieve it in most cases but there are occasions when they do not provide this excellent service.  In such circumstances the three-day <Col N="34" /> limit might be a bit rigid and I suggest that five days after the closing date if the application comes by post should be acceptable, an extension of two days in relation to the matters dealt with under section 20.</P>
    <P>Under section 21 where a developer fails to provide proposed public open space, the section says that the local authority may purchase the open space and that an arbitrator can make a nil award unless it is shown that the value of the land has not been or will not be recovered as a result of the development.  I consider that this device will be very difficult to operate if, in fact, not impossible.  It will certainly be very cumbersome and probably ineffectual.  My immediate reaction to it, I am sorry to say, is not very encouraging but perhaps I can be reassured by the Minister who may have a more detailed explanation to give of these matters than he has so far given.  The amazing thing about this section is: why should any local authority be obliged to purchase open space when a developer provided in his application plans that he would supply such open space within the development?  And the developer not having provided it, the Minister, to overcome that difficulty, is merely allowing a local authority to purchase the public open space from the owner, the developer.</P>
    <P>The costs of purchasing and any costs arising from the development of the open space, such as laying it out in an orderly fashion, can be deducted from the purchase cost.  I say &ldquo;Thank you very much&rdquo; in a sarcastic way for the powers given under this section.  I do not see why the ratepayers should be obliged to contribute to the purchase of open space which it was intended the developer should provide.  I cannot understand the logic behind this. There must be a reasonable explanation for it.  One can see a situation where a local authority if they proceed under this section will be left with something which is of no value.  Open space as such has amenity value but no market value. It is not an asset from which the community, or the local authority <Col N="35" /> representing the ratepayers, can benefit in any way other than by its recreational and amenity value.  The local authority are being asked to spend the ratepayers' money acquiring it.  They can never resell it.  It is a wasted asset.  The onus was on the developer to provide this facility in the first place.  Maybe I am misreading the section, but I demand a fuller explanation of section 21.  Many persons whom I have consulted are puzzled by this section and cannot understand the thinking which would oblige a local authority to purchase open space which the developer should have provided.  I find this extraordinary. It does not seem to be much of an improvement on the existing position.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest a way to plug this loophole in the 1963 Act, a loophole which has caused great difficulties and many headaches for communities and public representatives who had to deal with the problems.  A condition should be included in the planning permission that a security bond be obtained by the developer to be held by the local authority until such time as the authority are satisfied that he has provided the amenities indicated in his plans.  There are provisions in the 1963 Act which enable local authorities to include such conditions in planning permissions.  I submit that unless this type of condition is included as a condition precedent, it has no strength, it is difficult to enforce and that developers can slip from under it and get away with nondevelopment of open space as required by the permission they obtained.</P>
    <P>There can often be a condition requiring agreement between the developer and the local authority as regards the disposal of effluents, for instance. If such a condition is placed in a planning permission given on appeal, then that condition should be condition precedent, the developer should be obliged to show to the local authority, before planning permission would have been deemed to have been granted to him, that he had in fact complied with the condition precedent. The situation at the moment is that <Col N="36" /> the Minister is granting permissions which contain conditions which oblige the developer to reach agreement with the local authority on a particular aspect of the development.  Normally this is to do with sewerage, or water, where it will be laid, where effluent will be discharged and arrangements for disposal of sewerage.  Once permission has issued, even though it includes such a condition and the developer has waited the prescribed period of 21 days, the permission is then deemed to have been granted.  From that moment he is authorised to go into a site and commence development even though he has not yet reached agreement about the condition contained in the permission he got stating that he must consult with the local authority and reach agreement about the disposal of sewerage, and failing agreement that he can go back to the Minister and appeal.</P>
    <P>Permissions with such conditions attached should not be deemed to have been granted until these conditions have been complied with.  In other words, in law they should be deemed conditions precedent.  I strongly urge the Minister to consider this point.  It may be said that what I am suggesting will introduce further complications into the planning field.  It might be claimed that it might act as a deterrent to development, but I submit that at least we will have orderly development.  We will not have the position where conditions are included in name but in fact developers can proceed without paying much heed to them at all.  This is happening to the open spaces.  The local authority should seek an insurance bond of sufficient security and the developer should show that he has obtained that bond before permission is deemed to have been granted&mdash;in other words, before he is entitled to go in and develop.  If that is done the many evasions of planning conditions will be ended.  We expected that the amendment to the 1963 Act would deal fully and adequately with this problem which has caused many headaches to residents' associations because of the non-completion of their estates, but the section as worded here does not deal effectively with that problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> Section 22 deals with the issuing of a warning notice.  This is new.  Would the Minister spell out the difference between a warning notice as proposed under subsection (2) and enforcement notices which one can apply under the 1963 Act?  In the Bill, the procedures for serving warning notices and the penalties for ignoring them are set out in relation to the likely development in contravention of the Act&mdash;unauthorised land use, likelihood of removal or damage of trees, features or structures during development.  This is a very good thing.  I accept and welcome the warning notice but should like clarification of the difference between it and the enforcement notice.  I suspect there must be some level of duplication between the effect the warning notice has and the effect the enforcement notice has.  The enforcement notice is primarily to deal with anticipated unauthorised development. It seems to be designed to overcome a situation where there is a condition in relation to trees and a person goes in overnight and knocks down all the trees.  There is no way in which the local authorities can then restore those trees.  By anticipating that he might do such a thing, a warning notice can be issued which will involve him in substantial fines if he touches the trees.  Of course this refers also to general developments, protection of amenities and any worthwhile features.  This is welcome and the Minister has our support.</P>
    <P>Section 23 states that any person may make application to the High Court to prohibit unauthorised development. The Fianna Fáil Party welcome this wholeheartedly.  We feel that difficulties which were experienced over the years will now be overcome and one of the major loopholes in enforcing the 1963 Act will be closed.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with withdrawal by planning authority of certain notices and cancellation of relevant entries in the register.  I should like the Minister to give us some examples of what he has in mind.</P>
    <P>Section 25 is a major section which provides for the first time for what the <Col N="38" /> Minister called the withering of planning permissions.  I should like to query the Minister on one point.  I do not think that in fairness and in justice it is proper to apply this retrospectively. One can imagine a situation where a person received planning permission, quite legitimately, four years and 11 months before the coming into operation of this Bill and one month later the planning permission dies.</P>
    <P>Retrospective legislation is something this House has been anxious to avoid wherever possible.  When introducing benefits very little retrospection is applied.  When grants are increased we are not inclined to give retrospection. There may be a good reason why a person who got planning permission has not acted on it, also there will be cases of people who have received planning permission and have not acted on it for no good reason.  Such cases cause difficulty in drawing up development plans.  It is very frustrating when drawing up development plans in towns and cities to have areas for which planning permission has been granted but has not been acted upon and the planner does not know what is to happen in those areas.  He cannot decide whether it will be open space, whether it will be for commercial use or residential use.  Planning permission has been granted.  It is a black spot and it inhibits the planner. I agree that this is a problem and it is proper that we should have legislation to deal with it but I submit that it is unfair to make this legislation retrospective. The retrospective aspect of this section is open to serious question. I would ask the Minister to reconsider this.</P>
    <P>Section (2) (b) relates to partially completed developments.  The question of a completion certificate comes in here.  As I read the section, the planning authority may issue a completed certificate and in the case of a dispute the developer may appeal to the District Court.  Appeals must be decided by a district justice.  I should like the Minister to explain why the board should not decide such cases.  As I read the section, it seems to indicate that if a developer receives <Col N="39" /> planning permission for 700 houses and proceeds to construct at the rate of 100 houses per year and if at the end of a five-year period he has only 500 houses completed planning permission for the remaining 200 dies.  I wonder whether that is wise.  The permission has been granted and obviously the developer had good intentions, had acted on the permission and the only inhibiting factor was the capacity of his organisation. It would seem to me that that permission should not die at the end of a five-year period.  We will go back to that later.</P>
    <P>Section 26 reads:</P>
    <P>(1) Notwithstanding section 10 (4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, summary proceedings against any person liable to be proceeded against pursuant to section 22 of this Act or in respect of a contravention of section 24 (2) of the Principal Act may be commenced&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) at any time within six months from the date on which the offence was committed,</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us some examples of what he has in mind here.</P>
    <P>Section 28 is an important section. It provides for the first time that the Minister may make regulations providing for:</P>
    <P>(i) the payment to planning authorities of prescribed fees by applicants for permission under the Principal Act to develop land,</P>
    <P>(ii) the payment or lodgment with the Board of prescribed fees or deposits by appellants,</P>
    <P>I submit that quite a number of people will consider this section, as worded, undesirable.  We have some doubts about it.  It must be remembered that in the main persons who will be seeking permission to develop will be persons anxious to develop their own property and that they are in quite a different position from persons who would be seeking legal redress in the courts.  The matter is made <Col N="40" /> worse by giving the Minister power to make regulations which may provide for the payment or lodgment with the board of prescribed fees or deposits by appellants.  This seems discriminatory and without legal justification. I think it is going a little too far.  Can the Minister give any precedent for this or can he give any explanation of what would happen the lodgment of fees or deposits?  I do not know whether the Minister overlooked this or whether we are to assume where the money goes.  I suggest to the Minister that there may not be any great necessity for this section when one considers that section 17 of the Bill provides that:</P>
    <P>(b) in case the decision of the planning authority is confirmed on appeal, or where the decision is varied on appeal, if the Board in determining the appeal does not accede in substance to the appellant's grounds of appeal, the Board, if it so thinks proper, may direct the appellant to pay&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) to the planning authority, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the planning authority for the expense occasioned to them in relation to the appeal,</P>
    <P>(ii) to any of the other parties to the appeal, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the party for the costs or other expenses occasioned to him in relation to the appeal.</P>
    <P>(iii) to the Board, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the Board towards the expense incurred by the Board in relation to the hearing of the appeal.</P>
    <P>The remarks relating to section 28 in the Explanatory Memorandum are misleading.  This memorandum states:</P>
    <P>The question of fees payable by applicants for permission is primarily associated with possible changes in the existing regulations requiring applicants to give public notice of their proposals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> When one reads section 28 in the Bill it is clear that no such restriction is built into it.  I submit that it is wrong to try to suggest, as is suggested in this document, that these fees will only be charged to cover the cost of public notices which may, in the future, be inserted by the Planning Authority <i>en bloc</i>, something I agree with but the Minister should have been more specific in the section in the Bill.  If he was seeking authority from the House to charge a fee to persons making application for planning permission and the purpose in charging that fee was to cover the local authority's costs in inserting a public notice in a newspaper of the person's intention to apply for permission then he should have said so in the section instead of giving the board overall authority to charge fees or demand lodgements or deposits for persons making application or persons making an appeal without any limit, without specifying any circumstances in which it could be done.</P>
    <P>I strongly favour the idea of requiring the planning authority to insert the public notice.  For far too long we have tolerated a situation where persons anxious to keep their intentions in relation to development as quiet as possible, away from persons who may be interested in it and who may prove an obstacle to them by way of objections, third party or otherwise, try to proceed surreptitiously, inserting applications, sometimes abusing the Irish language, in a paper which may be deemed by the local authority to be circulating in the area but which is not normally the paper purchased by the majority of people living there.  In western parts of the country <i>The Irish Times</i> does not have the same circulation in Connemara as <i>The Irish Press</i> or <i>The Irish Independent</i> and persons anxious to proceed in a sly way with developments have been known to put their advertisements in <i>The Irish Times</i> in Irish and it is then inserted in some obscure section of the paper in the hope that few people, if any, will see it.</P>
    <P>I am against these dodges and the Minister should have spelt it out quite clearly that in future the planning <Col N="42" /> authorities themselves would be required to insert such public notice in chosen newspapers circulating in the area and that they would put in these advertisements <i>en bloc</i> week after week, and that any development taking place in that area for which permission is required could be easily found on a certain page where they would all be published together.  To cover the planning authority's cost of inserting such an advertisement the person lodging the application should be required to pay a fee of £2 or whatever the advertisements are costing.  There should be no penalty involved, as is suggested in the section, whereby fees are charged to persons making application for planning permission.  We do not like this section and we will probably oppose it when it comes before this House on Committee Stage.  We hope the Minister will reconsider this because we feel our ideas are better than those contained in the section.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with section 32 (a).  In my view this change would mean that a person's entitlement to compensation following a planning refusal could be substantially diminished, particularly if the usual long time lag takes place between the time of the decision and the arbitration award.  Such things as a change in zoning between the time he receives the decision and the time when the arbitration award issues could largely affect an applicant's entitlement to compensation.  We have the classical case, especially in the Dublin area, with the Dublin Corporation, in par ticular, where there has been much dithering and doddering about the routing of proposed roads in the future. This has seriously interfered with planning in this city, has contributed to inflation of property values in Dublin and has frustrated the development plans of quite a number of com mercial enterprises, and private citizens in and around the city.  I am referring to those involved in commercial business in a big and small way.  I have practical experience of what has been happening.</P>
    <P>I know of cases where under Part 5 of the 1963 Act claims for compensation have been made and awards have <Col N="43" /> been issued of up to £40,000 as a result of the planning authority's refusal to grant permission because they were reserving the area of land for some particular purpose.  The person who made the appeal for compensation is successful but two or three years later the planning authority write back and inform the applicant that they do not now intend to proceed with the use which was the reason for refusing permission originally.  The applicant is told that he can now proceed even though in the meantime he has been paid compensation on the basis that the local authority had informed him he could not proceed.  Most of this difficulty is being created by the indecision of the planning authorities in Dublin in relation to the location and routing of the future road systems for the city.  Much of the planning that has gone on and the decisions made on it have been largely impracticable.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister take an interest in this matter.  In laying down routes for roads and plans for future road widening the authorities should as far as practicable pay some heed to the practicalities of the proposals which they are adopting.  The experience has been that decisions made one week might be changed two years later and that a decision to hold land now because it is designed as an area through which a road will go at sometime in the future may be changed in two years' time.  That area is then open again for development.  That is of significant importance under section 32 (a).  It is a matter which will not involve the Minister that much because he does not involve himself in the actual arbitration awards but we should be anxious to see justice done for all.  It can affect large businesses and small business concerns.</P>
    <P>I know of cases where the corporation have zoned an area as a route for a road and the business houses in that area have run down as a result but claims for compensation have not been accepted by the corporation on the basis that it was long-term planning. The corporation do not place a CPO on property because they do not <Col N="44" /> require it for some time.  The corporation are killing certain areas in the city and putting small businesses to the wall because of the decisions of the planning authority.  In some of these cases after two years have elapsed the problem disappears, the corporation change their mind and decide against putting the road there. During that time the business has been cripped.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider making it obligatory for persons who have received planning permission to post a copy of the planning permission on the site?  It could be called a building permit and would facilitate inspections, especially of unauthorised development. I have seen such a system in operation in other countries.  A building inspector or planning officer visits all building sites and the building permit must be posted by the developer in a prominent position where it can be inspected.  The building inspector or planning officer determines whether the conditions of the permit are being complied with.  Of course, in the first instance he ascertains whether there is permission to build. Although we impose a number of restrictions on the granting of permission we do not seem to have much provision in our planning Acts for the inspection of developments after planning permission has been granted. This is an area in which there is a need for some tightening up.  I am not anxious that an army of inspectors be sent out to survey the whole countryside but there is a need for provision in the Act for the control and inspection of development.  At present we are relying mainly on interested local residents to bring forward complaints regarding non-compliance with conditions attached to permission to develop.  Apparently there is no real machinery for inspection by the planning authorities.</P>
    <P>Under the Public Health Acts a person is obliged to obtain a certificate of satisfactory completion before a dwelling can be occupied.  Since that is deemed necessary under the Health Acts why should it not be necessary also in relation to planning Acts? Many of the complaints arising from <Col N="45" /> planning development and building generally may not all be related to the Planning Act but to standards of construction.  This stems from the fact that we do not have a building code in this country.  Sections 86, 87 and 88 of the Principal Act were never adopted.  This is an aspect of building that the Minister might refer to when he is replying.  The Act of 1963 provided that national building regulations and established by-laws would apply uniformly throughout the country but that provision has not been put into operation.  Many of the complaints that are made result from the different standards that are applied. There are building bye-laws in Dublin, Cork, Dún Laoghaire and Galway only.  Therefore in all other places local authorities are entitled to decide on the standards to be applied.  This area, too, needs reviewing.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the 1963 Act does not impose any real obligation on the owner of a development to answer a notice issued under that section.  I am referring to a notice asking him to state his interest in the premises concerned.  There should be a clause enabling the local authority to assume that the person on whom the notice is served is the owner until he proves otherwise.  There have been cases where prosecutions under the Planning Act have been lost on technicalities because of the failure to show ownership, although section 9 provides for the issuing of a notice demanding that a person shall state his interest and so on and that he must reply by a certain date or otherwise is liable to a fine in the region of £20.  A local authority are faced with a weak case in court if they have not been able to show that they know who is the owner of the property.</P>
    <P>There is provision in this Bill for the appointment to the board that is proposed by the Minister of a chairman and a minimum of two members. We suggest there should be a minimum of four members.  So far as I am aware there is no provision for the appointment of a vice-chairman or somebody to act in the absence of the chairman.  Will the board be enabled to split up so that there could be <Col N="46" /> two sub-committees in operation, each performing the functions of the board?  This is a matter for Committee Stage, but perhaps, in his reply the Minister should throw some light on this aspect.  Regarding the personnel of the board, the Minister should appoint only those with recognised qualifications and who have had some years experience in their own line of work.  For instance, a qualified planner with at least ten years' experience would be a suitable person to appoint to the board as also would a qualified engineer with the same length of experience or an architect or a civil servant who had gained experience in the Department.  That would be the type of board we would like to see instituted, with a chairman who would be a person of great repute.  The remuneration of these people would need to be substantial so as to ensure that they were acting independently and that they would not be tempted to give up the job after a while.  The position should be as attractive as possible so as to avoid frequent changing of personnel.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, while we were in office we were working on a Bill that was on lines similar to the proposals now before us.  We intended providing for the establishment of a board and for removing from the Minister for Local Government the responsibility of having to decide on planning appeals.  We intended&mdash;in fact it was provided in a Bill introduced by a former Minister, Mr. Kevin Boland&mdash;that the Irish language and the Gaeltacht areas would be given special consideration.  We intended including that section again in whatever Bill we would have brought before the House.  I am surprised that the Minister has chosen to drop that section.  I hope he has good reasons for doing so.  Much of what we hear from Government Ministers in relation to the Irish language, to the Gaeltacht and to Irish culture in general is very depressing. If the dropping of the section I have referred to is a further indication of the downgrading of the importance of the Gaeltacht areas and of the Irish language this step is <Col N="47" /> to be regretted and I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision. We intended providing that, notwithstanding sections 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36 and 37 of the 1963 Act, regard could be had to the special interest of the Gaeltacht and of the Irish language.</P>

      <P>I had expected that, coming from a Gaeltacht area and representing a constituency which includes a Gaeltacht area, the Parliamentary Secretary would be in sympathy with the point I am making.  As a member of the county council he must have had similar experience in dealing with the developments in the Gaeltacht.  Under the 1963 Act no special provision could be made for a Gaeltacht area. The intention was to make special reference to the Gaeltacht in the Planning Act.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in the 1963 Act which allows that.  This was being overcome by the Bill we intended bringing in.  We agree largely with the broad principles of the Bill the Minister has brought in but we regret he has chosen to drop this particular aspect of the Bill we were working on.  We will probably put down an amendment on this and we can go into it in detail on the Committee Stage. There are cases which can be quoted of frustration by Planning Authorities of development proposals for Gaeltacht areas.  Gaeltarra Éireann have experience of this.  There is a necessity for a section such as we propose which would overcome these difficulties and would ensure that planning authorities would have to give special consideration to a proposed development in a <Col N="48" /> Gaeltacht area.  They should not be allowed to make rigid interpretations of development plans, as drawn up under the Act, which operate to the detriment of Gaeltacht areas.  I know the Minister can correct some of the wrong decisions of planning authorities in relation to applications in Gaeltacht areas and also in other areas but we do not think it is adequate that one should have to appeal them and go to the Minister or the board when they are established.  There should be an obvious commitment in the Bill in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>It would be interesting to hear from the Minister an estimate of the cost of administrative and technical staff engaged solely on planning in his Department so that we will have some idea of what the appeal system costs. Much of the expense cannot be isolated, but I should like to know what the estimated figure is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has the Minister not included agricultural buildings in this Bill? People expected that when an amendment of the 1963 Act was introduced those clauses in that Act which enabled exemption to be made from the provisions of the Act for agricultural buildings would not be included in this Bill.  Quite an amount of agricultural activity has led to serious water pollution, especially in the midland counties. The reason for this is that some of these agricultural buildings and industries were allowed to be constructed and to operate without any restriction under the 1963 Planning Act.  If the local planning authorities had the power to control them by including conditions for disposal of effluent and the treatment of it much of the pollution of the water that has taken place might not have taken place at all.  Whatever about the mays and the mights of the past, we expected, and I think a substantial section of the community expected, that in the amendment of the 1963 Act these buildings, especially the dangerous ones, would be included.  The Minister will probably answer that he has a special arrangement with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries that, where they consider an agricultural building being considered for grant <Col N="49" /> purposes may because of its omissions in some form or other be a pollution hazard they may require the applicant before the grant is paid to get planning permission.  I do not consider that is adequate.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of agricultural developments which can proceed without the grant.  The people deciding to erect them may decide that the grant is of no benefit to them and that they could not get planning permission if they applied for it.  Some of those people might feel it is better to skip the grant and slap up the building. That loose position still obtains.  I expect the Minister will inform the House why he has omitted agricultural buildings from this Bill.</P>
    <P>I realise that this is an agricultural country, that over 30 per cent of our community derive their income solely from agriculture and that the amount of agricultural activity is enormous. If we were to include every haybarn, every cow byre and shed under the Planning Act it would add substantially to the work.  The Act would then become unworkable.  I appreciate that argument but I think there is sufficient ability in the Minister's Department to devise some section in this Bill which would control the dirty agricultural developments, particularly those in the pig industry and the chicken rearing, the location of silage pits and the disposal of slurry.  The Minister could have specified certain agricultural buildings to be included under this Bill.  I hope we can have a fuller debate on this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will give some consideration to the points I have made.  We wholeheartedly welcome the proposal to transfer the power to decide planning appeals from the Minister to a planning board.  We will have a debate on the construction of that board but we agree to the principle of it.  As the House knows, we decided to introduce similar legislation when we were in Government. The Parliamentary Secretary said I had plenty of time to bring it in but if he does a little study in the Department he will find that much of the delay was not caused by me, the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government. <Col N="50" /> The Minister indicated in his statement that many of these miscellaneous provisions were difficult to draft and because of their complex nature he suggests that it would be better if we left detailed discussion of them to Committee Stage.  The Minister must accept that the drafting was largely done while this party were in office.  I was very anxious when I was in the Department to bring this Bill forward.  Anybody who wants to make honest inquiries will find that the drafting was well advanced.  It was with the parliamentary draftsman for quite a long time.  I am not interested in that now.  I am interested in the Bill before us which generally has our approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most people in this House I welcome this Bill.  We all know that during the past few years there has been a great need for changing the 1963 Planning Act.  At the time it was passed it was a good Act but things have changed since then.  One of the fine things in the present Bill is the appointment of a planning board.  The Fine Gael Party advocated this when they were in opposition.  In 1969 they introduced a Bill in the Seanad which was not accepted by the Fianna Fáil Government. They wanted to keep their finger in the pie.  I am glad they are now supporting the appointment of this board.  There has always been a certain amount of unease in the public mind regarding decisions made by politicians.  They may have been made in good faith but the fact that they were made by politicians was regarded as suspect.</P>
      <P>I believe this will take a big responsibility away from the Minister. The Fine Gael Party always advocated the need for a board because we have seen some very strange decisions made.  My constituency, the postal area No. 4 of Dublin South East has been under considerable pressure for some time.  Were it not for the residents' association and other interested bodies, much of that area would have been lost for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one case where a gentleman <Col N="51" /> not unknown to this House applied to have a house in a good residential area converted to office use.  The local authority rightly turned down the application and my information is that the Department's officials were against it also but the Minister gave permission in an area that was zoned for housing.  This kind of behaviour makes the people suspicious because it enhances the value of property.  In the case I have mentioned the property appreciated in value from £25,000 or £30,000 to £80,000.  I am not implying that there was anything going into anyone's pocket.  I am merely saying that because of influence a change of zoning was made and as a result some people got a lot of money.  That is the reason there has been grave suspicion with regard to planning.</P>
    <P>The Government will appoint a chairman to the board.  I hope they will appoint a judge.  The Judiciary have always been above reproach and people would be reassured that unbiased decisions would be made.  A judge should be seconded for a period; in other words, we could have a rotation of judges every few years. This would ensure that new ideas would be presented by the various judges rather than appointing one man <i>saecula saeculorum.</i></P>
    <P>The board should be a fairly large body.  I am not too happy with the number specified in the Bill for ordinary members.  I am not saying that all of them should sit on the board all the time but various planning appeals may call for different expertise.  I do not think it is a good idea to have someone from the Department.  If a man is appointed for two or three years he knows he will be returning to his Department afterward and this may inhibit him from making certain decisions.  Ordinary members should be from outside the Department.  They should be senior planners or developers and they should be fully informed on all matters relevant to their work.</P>
    <P>I agree with section 4 where it states that the board, so far as may be necessary <Col N="52" /> for the performance of their functions, shall keep themselves informed of the policies and objectives of the Minister.  This is important. The board must have knowledge of draft development plans, of national planning and of the intentions of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 5 states that the Minister may give the board general directives on policy in relation to development. I should rather see this in section 4 where it is provided the board will take into account what the Minister has in mind.  A responsible board will have regard to this without requiring that it be written into section 5.  Subsection (3) of section 5 states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case....</P>
    <P>It would be better if this were not inserted. If we are going to appoint a board it should be a good one.  I have no doubt this board will be effective and will take into account the Minister's views.</P>
    <P>Section 14 refers to oral hearings and it is stated that the board will have absolute discretion to hold such hearings of any reference or appeal to them.  I will give them that providing they will state in writing to the people concerned the reasons they are not getting an oral hearing.  It may be that the appeal put forward is so frivolous or of such a weak nature that it would not warrant a hearing but the person concerned should be told so in writing. It is not sufficient just to state that the board shall have an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing.  It might happen the board would rule out oral hearings that might have an important bearing on planning.  We should be careful in this matter.  I realise there may be vexatious or frivolous appeals but I do not think there will be many. When we speak about planning we mean planning for people.  If people consider they have a grievance they should be given every facility to redress it.  If the board decide not to give an oral hearing because of the nature of the appeal they should state this in writing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> Section 16 is worthwhile.  It will deal with vexatious and frivolous appeals in a quick manner.  One of the problems today is that people stall on these matters and use every means within the law to hold up appeals.  There are people violating the planning laws who try to stretch matters over five years so that they are statute-barred.  There are people who move into private houses but then turn them into offices and they use every means possible to stretch this over five years.  Section 16 will deal effectively with this kind of behaviour.</P>
    <P>I am not all happy with section 17 because it tends to throw the onus on the third party.  In this connection the intentions of the Minister and what an independent board may do are two different things.  I am against costs being levied on a third party.  Developers and people with money will be prepared to fight and meet whatever costs may arise; the ordinary man in the street cannot afford to do this.  If a developer won his case and appealed for costs on the basis of the time during which development was held up and profits thereby lost very few people would want to make third party appeals. This would also inhibit the local authority going ahead because local authorities are very conscious of the large sums levied on ratepayers and they might therefore tend not to pursue legitimate appeals in case such appeals might go against them.</P>
    <P>Section 17 (1) (b) is in the 1963 Act.  I do not remember it being used. An independent outside board might well say: &ldquo;We do not like this and so we will make you pay&rdquo;.  The section provides that the board may direct the appellant to pay&mdash;</P>
    <P>to the Board, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the Board towards the expense incurred by the Board in relation to the hearing of the appeal.</P>
    <P>I think this is wrong.  Indeed I doubt the constitutionality of it.  I should like to see section 17 withdrawn and an amendment made of the 1963 Act <Col N="54" /> protecting the third party.  Over the last six months there has been a fair lobby against this sort of thing.  This, I admit, can be troublesome and cumbersome.  People get awkward at times.  But this is what democracy is all about.  We are dealing with human beings and it is our duty here to ensure that their rights are protected. I know quite a few people who are concerned about this section and I would ask the Minister to have another look at it and to clarify the situation.  An independent body may take a different view from that taken by the Minister and his predecessors.</P>
    <P>Under section 21 planning enforcement and the control of open spaces are dealt with.  I agree with what Deputy Molloy said on this section. Where a developer puts in a plan stating that he is making provision for an open space which he intends to develop he should be compelled to implement that plan to the full.  We know from sad experience the derelict condition of open spaces around the perimeter of this city.  The houses are built, the builder is paid and he promptly moves on to another site. If the local authority subsequently develops these derelict sites then the builder should be compelled to recompense the local authority.  If a penalty is imposed on the builder he will not leave behind him a trail of destruction and the Minister might well see better standards in future building developments.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is a good section because it discourages unauthorised development at an early stage.  When a builder moves into a residential area to do some development a warning should be issued that the area is residential and the local authority will not tolerate the conversion of private dwellings into offices.  One cannot stop a developer changing the inside of a premises, but one can stop a developer turning a premises into offices.  It is important that we should move in this regard as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not believe a fine of £100 is a sufficient deterrent.  If a developer knocks something down which should not be knocked down there should be a recurring fine for a period of 12 <Col N="55" /> months or so.  If that is not done then the section will not be effective.</P>
    <P>There is too the problem of unauthorised development.  The fines bear no relation to the profits made.  If someone puts up a kitchenette the local authority are very quick in getting at that person.  When however an office block goes up or an extra floor is added to an hotel it is not so easy to get at these people because of their influence and their resources.  They can pay the fine of £100 a day.</P>

      <P>That is <i>sub judice.</i> He can pay it and may be allowed to add it on to the bill.  But the important thing is that there is an early warning notice for these people who know when they buy these properties that they are going to break the law.  But they say: &ldquo;It has happened before and we will get over it somehow or other&rdquo;.  It is important that we put the finger on these people for once and this is what I hope this Bill will achieve.  A certain professional body took a stand against the third party appeal.  If this professional body took a stand against their members who are violating the planning laws around this town and tried to improve the standards of their own profession, then I would listen and respect their views. But, until such time as they do so, their views mean very little to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been waiting for section 23.  The High Court can require people to stop an unauthorised development. Up to now, one knew that an unauthorised development was taking place; one ran to the corporation and the corporation more or less said: &ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; One went to the Minister and there were laws here and laws there. There may well have been laws here and laws there but they were not or could not be enforced; they were cumbersome and slow and so the development went ahead.  Now, in section 23, not necessarily the local authority but &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; can go to the High Court and have <Col N="56" /> this unauthorised development stopped.  This is very important and is one of the many good features of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 24 is to give greater flexibility.  This is something about which I have felt strongly and I am very happy that it is written into the Bill.  I think Deputy Molloy referred to a directive the Minister issued about flexibility.  I compliment the Minister on this.  The local authorities, as soon as they see an &ldquo;i&rdquo; not dotted, assume that there is a fault; they refer it to Local Government in the hope that they will deal with it.  This is wrong.  Local authority should process.  But, where there are minor details or technical problems only involved they tend to hold it for an interminable number of weeks and then pass it back, saying: &ldquo;We are refusing this&rdquo;.  When this new board commence their work in respect of any frivolous appeals referred to it by local authorities, I would request the Minister to write to those local authorities asking them to get on with their job and not hold up development on the basis of something very minor or technical.</P>
    <P>I think a commission has been sitting on the question of bye-laws since 1963.  I do not think they can be sitting on it at this stage; they must be lying down on it.  What we need is to get on with good planning. This is what this Bill is intended to do.  That is why I feel the flexibility feature of section 24 is important. The Minister must make it quite clear to local authorities that he wants them to exercise this flexibility; that he does not want them referring to some rule book and letting it do the work for them.  It is important that they exercise a degree of commonsense and judgement.  In other countries now they realise that the rule book is good but one can tie oneself down completely with rules and regulations.  Where one has efficient and responsible planning officers they will let by only what they believe to be good planning and desirable development in an area even though it may have some small fault of a technical nature.  In cases like <Col N="57" /> that, they should let it go and get on with the planning.</P>
    <P>Section 24, subsection (1), says:</P>
    <P>Where a planning authority serve a notice mentioned in section 30, 31, 32, 35, 36, 37 or 44 of the Principal Act they may by notice in writing withdraw the notice.</P>
    <P>and subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>(2) Where a planning authority withdraw a notice pursuant to this section, they shall cancel the relevant entry in the register.</P>
    <P>I should like some explanation of subsection (1) and, as regards subsection (2), I think they should recall the withdrawal in the register and leave the original plan on the register. It is important that it is there as a record rather than a reason.</P>
    <P>Section 25 has to do with the expiring of permissions after a period of five years.  This is a very good section, where you have people getting planning and outline permissions and just sitting on them to develop more money.  They leave the land lying derelict.  In this case the permission will fall after five years.  That I consider to be first class.  Where there are derelict sites left lying and the corporation cannot get an owner, I believe they should put a notice up for 12 months indicating their intention to take over this land for development. Then, if nobody turns up within that period of 12 months, they should take over the land and develop it. Walking around Dublin one sees a great number of derelict sites.  One would often wonder were we in a war with so many gaps to be seen. Nobody seems to know to whom they belong.  I think Deputy Molloy touched on this earlier with regard to roads and areas being allowed to deteriorate because of prospective roads going through them.  I would agree wholeheartedly with him here. The road situation and the local authorities attitude to it are ludicrous. They talk about roads in 20 years time and they will not allow good development to take place because a road may go through a particular area. Then, after a few years, the plans for such a road are cancelled. <Col N="58" /> Subsection (7) reads:</P>
    <P>Any person who is aggrieved by a decision of a planning authority on an application for a development certificate may appeal to the District Court within six months of the date of such decision.</P>
    <P>I believe the District Court is not the place to deal with these things.  I think it should be the Circuit Court. Anybody who has been in a District Court will realise that they are hardly able to deal with the simplest legal situations without imposing this on them.  I do not think they are capable of dealing with this type of situation. If we substituted the Circuit Court for the District Court here we would get far better decisions.  After all, this is the whole purpose of this Bill, to get better decisions.</P>
    <P>Section 27 has to do with submissions and consultations and subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>The Board may make submissions to the Minister with respect to any matters pertaining to its functions.</P>
    <P>I think that is excellent.  I think also the board should be able to commission research.  It is important that the board set up a research unit on the basis of good planning and techniques and that they publish such research.  That is something the board should consider doing.</P>
    <P>I agree with section 28.  Subsection (a) (i) reads:</P>
    <P>(a) providing for,</P>
    <P>(i) the payment to planning authorities of prescribed fees by applicants for permission under the Principle Act to develop land.</P>
    <P>With regard to commercial and industrial development, there is no reason why the local authority should not levy fees.  I would not want to impose a fee on small developments but on the larger developments it is only right and proper.  If we had this money from fees we might be able to pay for the planners which we cannot now get.  This should have been done long ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> Subsection (a) (ii) of section 28 reads:</P>
    <P>(ii) the payment or lodgment with the Board of prescribed fees or deposits by appellants, and the regulations may provide for the payment or lodgment of fees or deposits of different amounts, and for the exemption of applicants or appellants from the payment of fees or lodgment of deposits in specified circumstances,</P>
    <P>I am very wary about this.  It is attacking the third party appeal.  It is probably well known that I am very much in favour of the third party appeal.  It is necessary.  This part of section 28 is a subtle way of attacking it.  In section 17 we had such a provision and it is rearing its ugly head again in section 28.  I do not like it.  I will speak about this on Committee Stage.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on it.  I may be reading this section wrongly.  There may be nothing at all in it against third party appeal, but I feel there is. If there is, we should ensure that it is taken out.</P>
    <P>There are not sufficient inspectors at local authority level.  There should be inspection of developments as they are going up.  We have all seen a certain building going up lately in contravention of planning permission. If we had sufficient inspectors, this would not have happened.  When an authority give permission they should know what is happening.  We must try to close loopholes.  If we had the staff, we would be able to implement the 1963 Act.  As of now, we have not been able to implement that Act and the developers have been riding roughshod over it and hence the number of illegal developments which have gone up and have stayed up, regrettably.  With regard to illegal developments, I feel that when they go up they should be taken over. Anyone who violates a plan should not make any profit at all.  He is violating the law and the local authority should move in.  An arbitrary price, which would be low, should be fixed on the development.  The developer should be told to move out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> I would say the same in regard to the demolition of a building without permission.  The people who demolish buildings or their associates should not be given planning permission for such sites.  Such deterrents would stop the sharp practice which obtains in our society today.  We are concerned about the big money involved in development today.  Sanctions, small fines or threats are of little consequence. People engaged in such practices may intimidate others by reason of their money, force or their position in the community.  When such people step out of line, they should be made to pay penalties.  The only way we can make them pay penalties is by restricting their permission. With regard to demolition of a building, there should be a recurring fine for 12 months.  The fine should be £100 a day.  That would stop many of these people.  Where a man goes ahead and builds an unauthorised structure that structure should be taken away from him.  A sum far less than it is worth should be given to him.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I am merely speaking here on aspects that worry me.  There should be a section in the Bill covering agricultural development. Agricultural development should come with the scope of normal planning.  There would then be ordered development.  The agricultural community would be thankful for this in the long run.  As I said earlier, planning is about people and for people.  It is not there to restrict. It is there to order, to make the environment and life better.  There would be some criticism of a section covering agricultural development. There is a certain amount of pollution into our rivers.  Any steps which can be taken to stop that should be taken.  I will speak on various aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I would like to thank the Minister for bringing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he will give every opportunity to Deputies to put down amendments in order to make this a good Bill.  The Bill should close the loopholes and relieve the anxiety of many people.  It should ensure ordered development.  If people are inclined to <Col N="61" /> break the law, they should know that they will be made pay.  This would deter them and might encourage an attitude of mind among architects and townplanners which would encourage them to concentrate their efforts on good development and not on trying to get around the law. Where one or two groups get away with flouting planning permission this tends to snowball.  It is important that this should be stopped and should be seen to be stopped.  It is hard to close loopholes.  The &ldquo;wide boys&rdquo; always find a way around.</P>
    <P>It is our job here from time to time to review legislation such as this.  It should not be the law for all time. As I said at the beginning, times change, attitudes and ways of life change.  As our economy develops, there are stresses and strains on our resources.  It is important that planning legislation be up-dated from time to time to meet the needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the other speakers, would like to support the broad principles outlined in this Bill. The necessity for the Bill is brought about by the length of time that has elapsed and the number of changes that have taken place in the economy since the last Act was passed in 1963. The Minister, in his Second Reading speech, mentioned the fact that the 1963 Act has been in operation for approximately ten years.  The general planning system which the Act established has worked reasonably well and it is only fair to say that when the 1963 Act was introduced it was a major piece of legislation.  The fact that it has worked as well as it has for the ten years is a tremendous tribute to the men who drafted it. However, any major piece of legislation obviously needs to be amended at various times and, for the future, no matter what Government are in power, it should be one of their aims to review planning legislation at least once every five years.  In the light of economic, social and other changes, it is absolutely essential that something as involved in the everyday lives of the citizens as planning, should be reviewed regularly and amended, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> Nowdays the general body of citizens are involved in local affairs. This can be seen in the number of community councils, residents' associations and tenants' associations in existence. Almost every area has some sort of residents' association representing it. In practice, much of the work of these associations is concerned with holding a watching brief over planning proposals for the area.  It is vitally important that any amendment of the 1963 Act should not only be fair but be seen to be fair.</P>
    <P>Probably the major proposal of this amendment of the 1963 Act is that to bring in An Bord Pleanála in its present form.  I believe that the composition of this board is not only unfair but will be seen by the public to be unfair.  The idea of a board, first of all, is something that has been generally accepted by parties on all sides of the House in the light of the experience of the Planning Act since 1963.  Nevertheless, I have my own reservations about the board in its present form. Provision for a board which would be completely independent of Dáil Éireann, which would have no responsibility to Dáil Éireann, the decisions of which could not be questioned by Dail Éireann is not good legislation.</P>
    <P>At the moment the Minister, in his wisdom, being the person responsible, makes decisions regarding various appeals which are placed before him. If a Member of the Dáil is unhappy about a decision made by the Minister, he can question the Minister on this decision, but the board suggested here will, to a great extent, operate as a semi-State body.  Therefore, if a decision made by the board is queried in the House, I can envisage the Minister saying: &ldquo;I have no responsibility in the matter; it is a question for the board.&rdquo; The board will lay a report before the Dáil annually but, again, this report is not necessarily open for discussion.  It is essential, since planning is so involved in the local and everyday life of the citizens, that some control be in the hands of the elected Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, that questions can be asked and answers received on the operations of this board.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="63" /> to bring in an amendment on Committee Stage which would provide for an annual debate on the operations and decisions of the board.</P>
    <P>There are many things in the Schedule to the Bill that I am very unhappy about.  First of all, clause 2 reads:</P>
    <P>The Board shall consist of a chairman and not less than two ordinary members.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that two ordinary members and a chairman are not sufficient for a board with responsibility of the magnitude this board will have.  The minimum membership should be a chairman and four ordinary members, or, if the Minister so decides, a chairman and six ordinary members.  I suggest this particularly because of Clause 18 of the Schedule which reads:</P>
    <P>The quorum for a meeting of the Board shall be such as may from time to time be fixed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In practice, if there is a chairman and two members, the quorum is most likely two.  I can envisage a situation in which a member of the board is ill; there is a quorum of two and there are 100 appeals up for decision. One member of the board takes 50 and the other member takes 50.  They examine them individually, then the two of them come back and have their board meeting.  It would not be unreasonable to say that it is quite likely that this would be a rubber stamping operation, that one would accept the other's recommendations on particular proposals.</P>
    <P>As the ordered development of this country is involved in the operations of this board, it would be wrong to have only two men organising such a development.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to adopt my suggestion of a board with a chairman and not less than four members.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak about the method of appointment.  Paragraph 4 of the Schedule states that the chairman of the board shall be appointed by the Government.  This is fair enough but the Schedule does not set <Col N="64" /> down any qualifications.  Neither does it set down qualifications for ordinary members of the board.  In my opinion the chairman should be a judge.  As has been said, the Judiciary have always been above suspicion.  They have always carried out their tasks and duties in an honourable way and have earned the respect of all citizens.</P>
    <P>A board with responsibilities of the magnitude to be entrusted to this board should have a judge as their chairman and this should be written into the Schedule.  There are many reasons for this.  First of all, the board will have vast responsibilities for the orderly development of the country and I cannot think of any better person than a judge to bring objective decisions to bear.  It is part of his stock in trade on the bench.  A judge also has knowledge of the law and, as we know, decisions in regard to planning and development are always argued not just by architects and engineers but by senior counsel and solicitors.  According to the Schedule, the chairman will have the casting vote if there is a matter in dispute.  In a case of that kind the chairman should be seen to be a person above reproach, and that is another reason why a judge would be the ideal person.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 of the Schedule states that the Government may remove from office a chairman, and the reasons are given.  It says that the Government shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the reasons for the removal.  That is not good enough.  If a man of this stature is to be removed from office&mdash;this board will have some stature in Irish society &mdash;it should not be a matter merely of laying a simple statement before each House.  A dismissal motion should be brought before each House and debated and voted on.</P>
    <P>I come now to the ordinary membership of the board.  In the Schedule the Minister envisages two.  I recommend four.  The Schedule does not make any mention of the necessary qualifications for membership.  Deputy Molloy has suggested that under the <Col N="65" /> present Bill the members could be chosen from the supporters of any party who happened to be in Government at the particular time.  This is a wrong situation.  The Minister should have set down specific qualifications necessary for appointment to the board and the appointments should be made by the Civil Service Commissioners. The idea of the board is to remove any suspicions from the minds of the public and therefore great care should be taken in the appointment of members.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Schedule be amended to set down specific qualifications for membership and that the members should be appointed after interview by the Civil Service Commissioners. I further suggest that one member should be a town planner and that he should have had at least ten years practical experience.  I suggest that another member should be an architect.  The need for this is obvious to those of us who have seen so many buildings going up in this city and throughout the country completely out of tone with the general surroundings. The appointment of an architect to the board would go a long way towards avoiding this in the future.  I suggest that a third member should be a civil engineer with ten years practical experience.  When I say this I am not casting any reflection on the ability of the Minister for Local Government as an individual to select a proper board.</P>
    <P>In addition it is essential that any such board would take into consideration general broad principles of Government policy and for that reason the fourth person on the board should be a senior civil servant who would be best able to advise on general principles of policy.  If a local authority, for example, were to refuse an application for an oil refinery in a particular area and if the Government felt that it was a good idea to have an oil refinery in a particular area because we have not sufficient of them, it should be up to the Minister's adviser, the civil servant appointed by him on the board, to so advise the board and let the board make up its own mind. It is absolutely essential for the Minister <Col N="66" /> to have one nominee on the board, a civil servant capable of informing the board of the general outlines of Government policy.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill says that the board shall keep itself informed on certain policies and objectives.  This is right and proper but in the next section, section 5 (2) I think the Minister has gone too far when he says that the board shall in performing its functions have regard to any directive under this section&mdash;and this is general policy directives as to development.  With the appointment of a civil servant the Minister could keep the board informed but the Minister, probably unwittingly, went too far in this subsection when he said &ldquo;The Board shall in performing its functions have regard to any directive under this section.&rdquo; This subsection strikes at the independence which all sides of the House want this board to have.  The Minister should consider an amendment which our party will put down for the Committee Stage to alter subsection 2 and I should like to hear the Minister's comments when he is replying on this subsection.</P>
    <P>I have said that the board should comprise a chairman and not less than four and possibly six members. If the Minister decides to increase membership to a maximum of six, I suggest that such bodies as the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Congress of Trade Unions, the Builders Federation or some similar bodies would be asked by the Minister to appoint nominees to the board.  In particular, I mention the Confederation of Irish Industry and perhaps An Taisce or some similar organisation.</P>

      <P>What I suggested was that the chairman would be a judge and that of the four-member board one would be a town planner, one an architect and one an engineer. The fourth could be a senior civil servant appointed by the Minister.  If the Minister felt he would like to put in two outsiders, very well but the board should have the qualifications set down, one a town planner, one an architect and one an engineer.  Those three men together with the chairman should be permanent appointees because it is essential to get the best possible men for the job and, therefore, essential to make these positions permanent.  It is suggested in the Bill that the term would be three years and that the board be reviewed at the end of each term.  As regards the civil servant and the other two members&mdash; if the Minister wishes to appoint them &mdash;they would at the Minister's discretion serve for one term and could be considered for re-appointment.  A civil servant might be retiring or might be transferred to a different section.</P>

    <P>As this board will have such extensive powers, I think that in regard to the sacking of the chairman and members it is not sufficient for the Minister to lay before the House a statement in writing of the reasons for the removal of either chairman or members.  A full debate on a motion from the Minister <Col N="68" /> would be in order and a vote should be taken on the motion.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the operation of the board and that brings me back to section 5 at which I hope the Minister will look again on Committee Stage.  Not only does the Bill involve the setting up of this board but it brings in some very necessary amendments of the 1963 Act with some of which I agree and in some of which the Minister has gone too far. Under section 13 (4) it is stated:</P>
    <P>In case there is attached to a permission or approval granted under section 26 of the Principal Act a condition which provides that a contribution or other matter is to be agreed between the planning authority and the person to whom the permission or approval is granted and that in default of agreement the contribution or other matter is to be determined by the Minister, the condition shall be construed as providing that in default of agreement the contribution or other matter is to be determined by the Board.</P>
    <P>The question of contribution generally for planning permissions is one that has been debated, I suppose, by every county council, corporation and local authority in the country on a number of occasions.  In County Dublin at present, for every acre of development land the applicant is responsible for a contribution of £1,500 to the county council.  I see nothing in this Bill which gives the council the power of collection.  A subsection should be included stating that the collection of these contributions would be a legally binding debt which, I understand, it is not at the moment and was not under the previous Act.  This is a small point which I should like the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is one of the shortest sections in the Bill containing two lines.  In these two lines there is more potential dynamite than in any other section.  Referring to oral hearings section 14 says:</P>
    <P>The Board shall have an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing of <Col N="69" /> any reference or appeal to the Board.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Molloy that this section is unconstitutional.  The property rights of citizens are sacrosanct and written into the Constitution. Section 14 will be found unconstitutional if it is passed in its present form.  As I understand it, the Minister is attempting to remove the headache of frivolous and vexatious appeals, be they by appellants, by applicants or by third parties.  In this section, the Minister is going unintentionally too far.  His heart was in the right place but his hand carried him too far.  He should have another look at this section.  His aim could be included in the Bill in wording which is not quite as rigid as that used in this section.</P>
    <P>Section 14 could read that the board have absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing; that if they refuse an oral hearing they must give reasons in writing for such refusal; and that if the appellant is not happy with the reasons stated in the letter he can appeal to a higher authority, a court of law, Circuit Court or somewhere else.  To make the bald statement that &ldquo;the Board shall have an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing&rdquo; is, in view of the magnitude of this legislation, going too far. The Minister requested contributions from Members and said that he would consider any proposals for such amendments.  I ask him to look at this section again.  As I have said, I agree with his intention but feel he has gone too far.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is linked with section 14, which deals with frivolous and vexatious appeals.  I can see great difficulty for any board in implementing section 17 and in deciding exactly what amount of compensation should be paid.  Would it be calculated on professional fees involved?  Would they take into account such items as the interest on capital involved in the amount of land tied up?  Would there be a payment for unnecessary delay and loss of profits? Would all these items be included in the calculation for compensation? When replying would the Minister outline exactly what he has in mind so <Col N="70" /> far as the compensation factor is concerned?</P>
    <P>A provision for compensation and appeals should be in a Bill of this kind, although it was not in the 1963 Bill. On the day of the oral hearings third party appeals may be withdrawn. Three to six months can elapse from the date of the lodgment of an appeal against a notification of decision to the granting of permission by a local authority.  Any third party who delays by a frivolous appeal a single house, a housing scheme or a commercial development should have some financial responsibility.</P>
    <P>We are involved here in the rights of citizens.  When drafting legislation concerning compensation we must make absolutely certain that we do not go too far.  In theory we should give the right to a residents' association or to an individual to appeal; but in practice they would be so nervous of appealing because of the problems of compensation that they would not appeal.  There is a thin white line in regard to exactly how far one can go on the question of compensation.</P>
    <P>In ordinary planning applications to local authorities there is a time limit of two months.  It is essential when setting up an appeals board that a time limit on their decisions be also set. Two months might be short and I would suggest three months at the maximum.  Unless they have made firm decisions in three months the applicant should win his appeal by default.  This would be in line with procedure in local authorities.  A very good suggestion by the Minister was that, as happens in the case of an application to a local authority, an applicant could write to the appeals board and say that if the board have not had enough time that the applicant would give them another three months to consider the case.</P>
    <P>One of the problems about appeals in the past has been the long delays involved.  When revising the Planning Act, it should be written in that a time limit on appeals be set.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 18.  This section enables the board to accept amendments to plans which have been submitted <Col N="71" /> to the local authority and have been refused and are on appeal to the board.  The board, rather than refusing an appeal because of some technicality in a drawing, are empowered under this subsection to accept amendments when they are considering an appeal.  This would help in the case of a man applying for a single house in a rural area who, because of the siting of perhaps a septic tank, is refused permission by the local authority.  He appeals to the board and would be refused again but under this subsection it is possible to change the plan slightly and consequently the board is empowered to grant permission.  This is a very welcome change and I compliment the Minister on including it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with the time for appeals generally, the problem of postal deliveries and the extra three days.  I welcome this.</P>
    <P>Section 21 refers to open spaces.  I believe strongly that when a man buys a house, perhaps one house on an estate of 100 houses, he also buys 1 per cent of the open space attached to that estate as set down in the plans submitted and passed by the council or the new planning board.  I believe it is wrong that the local authority, as is suggested by this section, should have to buy the open space which is attached to the development from the developer.  It is a condition of all planning permissions that a certain area, perhaps 10 or 15 per cent of the land, be allocated for open space.  If it is a condition of the permission that the purchasers of the houses have a right to this open space and I do not think it should be necessary for the local authority to have to buy the open space.</P>
    <P>So far as the taking in charge of open space is concerned, anything that will improve the present appalling situation is to be welcomed.  I would ask the Minister to alter slightly what he has proposed because there is more to the taking in charge of estates than the open space.  There are the problems of the erection of telephone poles, lights, the proper <Col N="72" /> completion of roads, sewers, water mains, <i>et cetera.</i> Most of the estates that have caused problems are estates that were built prior to the 1963 Act in the Dublin area, estates which have never been taken in charge and, as matters stand, cannot be taken in charge because the developers, if they were individuals, have died or companies have been liquidated.  I should like the Minister, when he is replying, to refer to the question of the taking in charge of older estates.  As the Act is interpreted in Dublin County Council at the moment no estate will be taken in charge unless the developer makes a request to have the estate taken in charge.  I am not just talking of open space but of all the other things as well.  I believe the Minister has attempted to solve the problem but I do not think section 21 has gone far enough or will solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Section 22 deals with the preservation of trees or other features whether structural or natural.  Any protection we can give to the environment is to be welcomed.  Trees, <i>et cetera</i> should as far as possible be protected by local authorities and by Planning Acts and all Acts of the Oireachtas.  There is mention somewhere of a fine of £100. I do not believe this is heavy enough. The Minister could have gone higher than £100.  When a tree or other feature has been taken away it is not always easy to replace it.  In my own area we had an old windmill which was a feature of the area and a landmark. Overnight it just disappeared. Under the legislation we had at the time there was very little we could do.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that the High Court may prohibit unauthorised development or use of land.  This is one of the most welcome sections of this Bill.  We have had the experience in County Dublin of unauthorised caravan sites.  This section will permit the local authority, if they see unauthorised development taking place, to go to the High Court and get an injunction to stop that development.  This is really welcome.  Our experience in County Dublin is that one caravan is put into a field.  The county council come out and tell the owner of the <Col N="73" /> field to stop but under the present legislation they have no power to prevent him going any further.  He then applies to the Minister for retention of the caravan site and is refused.  In the meantime there are 20 or 30 caravans with families on the site.  What is a local authority to do?  Are they to put the families on the side of the road?  In theory that can be done but in practice we cannot put unfortunate people on the side of the road.  In the meantime the owner of a site is in receipt of exorbitant rents for the siting of these caravans, year in and year out.  We have seen, within the boundaries of County Dublin, some of the most appalling cases of squalor on some of these caravan sites, not the responsibility of, or because of lack of effort on behalf of the people living in the caravans on these sites. It is because of the fact that it is physically impossible to keep an undeveloped field from tearing up with the muck and water and no proper sewerage.  In some cases there is just a pump in the middle of the field which serves as the fresh water supply for the dwellers of the caravans.  It is impossible to keep such sites from developing into a situation of squalor. Anything that will help to prevent this situation arising in the future is welcome. In this regard I am delighted that the Minister has inserted section 23 into this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for the &ldquo;withering&rdquo; of planning permissions. This is a good idea but the Minister should have left this to permissions granted after the coming into force of this particular Bill.  A man who received planning permission four years and eleven months ago will lose his right to build or extend one month after this Bill comes into operation.  If this is not the case it is how I read it, and, for that reason, the Minister should clarify it when replying.</P>
    <P>Within the boundaries of Dublin we have old permissions in many areas some of which, in the light of developments which have taken place since they were granted, are now found to be contradicting recent developments. For example, there is <Col N="74" /> such a development taking place at Castleknock at present where shops are being erected.  When permission was granted some years ago this development, which then was granted for a rural area, did not contradict what was going on around.  Now, however, it is in contradiction to the development in progress there.  Permission to erect licensed premises can be given in areas at a time when it seems harmless but in later years it can be found very controversial.  The same situation can arise in the case of petrol stations, particularly where old applications are re-activated years after permission is granted.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, within the greater Dublin area there is a lack of proper sewerage facilities and when a planning application is granted by a local authority a certain reservation of the already short supply of sewerage facilities has to be made.  Unless this development goes ahead this reservation which is not acted upon is sitting there tying up other land which could be developed if this old permission was abolished.  For that reason the idea of the Minister in &ldquo;withering&rdquo; permissions is a good one.</P>
    <P>Section 28 deals with the question of the lodgment of money and the payment to planning authorities of prescribed fees by applicants for permission under the Principal Act to develop land.  I am completely against this section.  In most cases the applicant is a landowner himself who has been paying rates and taxes for a number of years.  Such a person is entitled to have any application that he makes for the development of his land considered by the local authority to which he has been paying rates.  I am against any suggestion of lodgment of money with the local authority for planning applications.</P>
    <P>Section 29 seeks to introduce what is a very welcome amendment to the previous Act and that is in regard to draft development plans and variations being made to them.  The development plan for County Dublin was drafted in 1965 but we found there were so many amendments that we had to start again.  The officials worked on it from 1968 and the plan <Col N="75" /> was eventually passed in 1972.  When a development plan is made it must go on display for a number of months after which objections have to be considered.  Having considered the objections and if there are major alterations made, the whole plan must go on display again, not just the sections that have been altered.  In practice one could have a situation where <i>ad infinitum</i> there is a plan on display, consideration of the objections, alterations to the plan, back on display, further alterations followed by a further display, further objections and further display.  One can have this never-ending circle and the Minister, in this section, has gone a long way towards sorting this situation out.</P>
    <P>Section 30 (a) deals with the problem of noise.  While one can bring in regulations concerning noise there are certain areas where, because of their geographical position, their close proximity to airports, ports, railway stations and motorways, there will be a certain amount of noise. There will also be noise in areas where major roadways are planned. A condition may be inserted in such planning applications regarding noise but, in my view, the only solution would be to give grants from the Department where the noise factor cannot be avoided.  Some reference should be made to the payment of such grants by the Department in such cases.</P>
    <P>Subsection (b) deals with the welcome idea that, with the agreement of an applicant, a local authority can take longer than the two months to consider any particular planning application but what is relevant for the local authority should also be relevant for the board as suggested by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On section 31 it is a question of the Minister's heart being in the right place but going too far on the proposal. That section deals with the special amenity orders.  I do not agree that any Minister should have the right to make amenity orders in local authority areas where there is a local authority operating.  If we are to have <Col N="76" /> the local democracy and local control that we are all aiming for, no Minister should take on himself the power to make a local amenity order without having the agreement of the local authority concerned.  Recently the Minister issued a White Paper on Local Government Re-organisation in which there was reference in that document to local democracy and control.  Perhaps on reconsideration the Minister will alter this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of section 33 provides that:</P>
    <P>...Building regulations may make provision in relation to the special needs of disabled persons.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to alter that paragraph so as to read: &ldquo;Building regulations shall make provision in relation to the special needs of disabled persons.&rdquo; For too long most of our public buildings and places of entertainment such as cinemas, halls, and sports stadia have been designed without any consideration being given to these special needs of the disabled. We have now an opportunity of altering that situation and of considering the whole planning spectrum.  The Minister has gone a long way in this direction by the insertion of the paragraph I have referred to but he should go that bit further and say that as and from the enacting of this Bill, the development of such places as Government offices, amenity halls, shops and factories must be carried out in a manner that would meet the special needs of the disabled.  I hope the Minister will agree to change the paragraph to read as I have indicated. We shall table an amendment to this effect between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 34, paragraph (a) refers to the insertion in paragraph (i) of section 4 (1) of the words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;not being works comprised in the fencing or enclosure of land which has been open to or used by the public within the ten years preceding the date on which the works are commenced&rdquo; after &ldquo;Land Reclamation Act, 1949&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This brings up the whole question of <Col N="77" /> rights of way and of the protection of these rights of way.  In the past efforts have been made by private individuals to fence off rights of way that have been used traditionally by the general public.  There was an example of this in Wicklow not so long ago. Attempts have been made in some cases to turn parts of beaches into private domains.  We should do everything in our power to prevent any such practices.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I wish to make concerning the whole question of planning.  In relation to an application for planning permission the present position is that the applicant merely has to state his interest in the property in respect of which planning permission is being sought.  He may write the word &ldquo;none&rdquo; in answer to that question. This position is unjust.  Let us take a hypothetical situation: somebody from, say, Donegal who wished to be contrary could apply for planning permission for the development of a six storey office block on a site owned by the Minister out at Laytown.  This could be done without the owner's permission being sought and without there being any intention to purchase the property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that it is wrong that anybody's property should be liable to a planning application without the owner having to give his permission for any such application to be made.  I can understand the problems involved in respect of the development of a large tract of land in which case there would be the intention on the part of the applicant to purchase the land.  Surely it would be possible to have at least a provisional contract that would be subject to planning permission being granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation may be annoying but, as the Deputy knows, planning permission is of no use to anybody who has no interest in the land concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's point but at the same time <Col N="78" /> something more than the answer &ldquo;none&rdquo; should appear on a planning application form in reply to the question concerning interest in the land involved.</P>
      <P>Within the boundaries of County Dublin we have witnessed the phenomenon of the development&mdash; some of it envisaged and some of which has already taken place&mdash;of large areas of 5,000 and 6,000 acres of land.  I refer to the new towns of Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Clondalkin. Together with all the other work with which they must cope, the local authority within County Dublin are expected to assume responsibility for these new areas.  The Department, having approved of development plans as drawn up by a local authority, should appoint a commission who would be responsible for the day-to-day management and orderly development of towns of this magnitude.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am suggesting is that each of these towns should have local offices where the residents of the area could ascertain what was going on in the vicinity on a day-to-day basis and where they could be made aware of future developments. This would protect the interests of existing residents and would facilitate people involved in development work in the area.  From our experience within the boundaries of County Dublin we have been made aware of the types of problems that can arise in the development of large areas of land.  We can pass this Bill here.  Perhaps we may table amendments that will be accepted by the Minister.  We could talk about enforcement proceedings and all the things we would like to see done but unless we have men with the necessary qualifications to carry out this work all the pious platitudes we pour forth here will be of no avail.  I cannot speak for other local authorities but I know in my local authority and from the Department of Local Government that there is a gigantic shortage of professional men, town planners, architects, engineers, people capable of interpreting this Bill and capable of carrying out its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> I would like to see greater encouragement given to those people by the payment of higher salaries to men who are prepared to study and become experienced town planners, architects and engineers.  The rates of salary for planners and people involved in local government generally are far too low. Greater encouragement should be given to various students to direct their interests towards planning.  We have many people taking other degrees but planning has now become one of the major questions which touches the life of every citizen at some time during his life.  In order to carry out the various sections of this Bill it is necessary to have adequate staff.  The Minister should encourage, by suitable financial reward, qualified people to engage in planning work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not enough of them, whether they are men or women.  I should now like to say a few words on roadside signs and the problem of people involved in the business of outdoor advertising.  These people are finding it impossible to get planning permission from local authorities to erect various signs. Some protection should be written into the Bill for those people involved in the legitimate business of the erection of outdoor hoardings.  There are regulations sent out by the Department forbidding the construction of signs along arterial roads.  This is a good idea but there must be a compromise thought up which would give the people engaged in the legitimate business of the erection of outdoor advertising hoardings protection and <Col N="80" /> at the same time protect the country generally.</P>
      <P>I suggest that at the entry to all towns one large advertising hoarding should be erected.  This could set out the various elements in the particular town such as shops, schools, churches. It could also set out where developments are taking place and where factories are situated rather than each factory putting up a sign directing business callers to the factory which could be located on a side road.  The present situation could be improved if a composite sign were erected.</P>
      <P>Agricultural buildings were mentioned earlier.  I am against planning applications having to be submitted for such building but I feel there should be greater control of the causes of pollution, for example, silage pits.  Pollution of our rivers is becoming a greater problem each year.  I know there are controls under the Health Acts in regard to pollution but these do not go far enough.  I am not in favour of the general across-the-board application for every farm building but there must be greater control of the causes of pollution.</P>
      <P>I now want to refer to the redevelopment of the centre of Dublin. Deputies from Dublin are appalled at what has happened to the centre of our city.  There are large gaping holes on every road and street.  During the past 12 months one hotel after another has closed down the general intention being to replace them with office blocks.  I welcome the Minister's recent statement on this.  The centre of Dublin, as well as the centres of our major towns, should be alive.  It should not be an area in which there are just offices. At the moment the once proud centre of Dublin is being spoiled by office blocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree I am sure that this can only happen if Dublin Corporation give permission for those office blocks or if permission was already given before my time.  I will not give permission.</P>

      <P>I am talking generally about what is happening in the centre of Dublin at the moment. I pass Mountjoy Square a few times a day and I know the Minister also comes that way.  This area is an eyesore at the moment.  O'Connell Street has become an eyesore also.  Many other city areas which were not just visited during the daytime, but were night spots containing hotels and offering other amenities are being ruined.  I hope some sense will be displayed in regard to the question of life in the centre of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Again I welcome in general the principles enshrined in the Bill.  I feel the chairman of the board should be a judge and that the board should have a minimum of four members three of whom would be appointed by the Civil Service Commission on a permanent basis, and that they would be a town planner, an architect and an engineer.  Subsection (2) of section 5 with regard to the giving of directives should be watered down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to oral hearings as provided for in section 14, the Minister's intentions were right but he has gone too far.  I would ask him to water down that section because it is wrong to give absolute discretion to a board or to an individual to decide on whether to hold an oral hearing.  So far as protection for the disabled is concerned.  I would ask the Minister to alter section 33 (d) to give full protection and full rights to people who are unable to frequent public places because of physical disablement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the Bill because I regard it as essential.  All the rules and regulations of planning are to no avail if they cannot be enforced. <Col N="82" /> That is an important aspect of any Bill.  The enforcement of planning regulations is causing many problems for local authorities, especially in the poorer counties.  The ratepayers are finding it increasingly difficult to meet all the costs that are incurred.</P>
      <P>It should not be necessary for a ratepayers to have to protect himself from ruthless developers.  Where major development is concerned the people who will be the beneficiaries should pay all the expenses.  Frequently local authorities are obliged to employ very expensive consultants and experts.  We had an occasion where it was necessary to send people to Japan in order to assess the suitability of an industry and it is unfair that the ratepayers have to pay such costs.  The people who intend to establish an industry should pay the costs.</P>
      <P>I am not in agreement with the suggestion of the previous Deputy that the chairmanship of the board be a judge.  Planning is not a legal matter; in fact, the fewer legal people connected with it the better.  It is my opinion that an architect or a town planner would be a better choice. There is the danger that eventually all the matters will be tied up in legalities, that there will be much expense.  It would be better to have on the board solid, sensible people who have an understanding of planning matters.</P>
      <P>The board will have much work to do.  In order to maximise their efficiency I should like to see them attend at various centres.  It would be a good idea if the board were to attend for a number of days in each quarter in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway in order to hear appeals and give immediate decisions.  This would reduce the delays and the proposals submitted would not have to wait for more than three months.  In any case, eventually we may have to have separate boards for each area.</P>

    <P>With regard to the development of towns, a major problem is the speculators. I do not think this point has been sufficiently stressed.  They very shrewdly buy up property from people who do not realise its potential value and who allow it to lie idle.  If farmers allow land to lie fallow the Land Commission <Col N="83" /> are told and the farmers are not allowed to continue this practice for long.  The developers have been operating in this manner in many small towns.  In Cobh there are many ruined buildings that are in danger of falling; in fact, one such building fell on a dwellinghouse not long ago and we have not been able to trace the owner.  Obviously he intends keeping the site until it becomes a more lucrative proposition.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have powers to acquire these properties and they should use their powers.  I am sure they would get the full co-operation of the Minister in the acquisition of derelict sites.  When a derelict site is developed it means increased income for the area, it means a more beautiful town and it means people are not obliged to move out into the country. The previous speaker spoke about office blocks but in many of our small towns also people are moving out into rural areas.  Local authorities should be encouraged to acquire derelict properties and to build on them.  They have water and sewerage facilities and roads and electricity supply are available. In this way the small towns will be maintained and from the tourist point of view this is desirable.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give every encouragement to people who have the initiative and courage to provide their own housing.  Nowadays too many people are relying on local authorities and depending on somebody else to provide houses for them. People who have the courage to borrow money and to provide their own houses should be given every help.  In my brief experience of political life I have found that planning permission has been refused for the most trivial reasons.  In this Bill the Minister might facilitate these people; if they are not on a major road they should be allowed to build if they can provide their own water and sewerage facilities.  I do not think they should be prevented.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a special interest being shown in regard to housing and the acquiring of land by local authorities in areas in which there are <Col N="84" /> existing industries or it is proposed to establish industries.  We have the sad situation in the dockyard in Cobh that skilled workers are badly needed but because workers are no longer prepared to travel long distances they will not work in the industry in Cobh. There is a great deal of difficulty in acquiring sites for housing in the area and I would like to see more effort being put into the acquisition of land for housing estates designed to serve local industries.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an excellent one.  The new board should work extremely well.  It will obviously be a very busy board.  I have no worries about the board being partisan.  I believe they will do a very good job.  They will relieve the Minister of pressure.  There is too much pressure on him as it is. I think the board should go on circuit. I hate seeing everything centred in Dublin.  It will be easier to move the board rather than move the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister and I could not have as much in common on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill as we have on this Bill.  I agree with many of his ideas where planning is concerned and I welcome the Bill with certain reservations. The only fault I have to find with the Minister is the fact that he does not give enough credit to the man who preceded him.  His predecessor relaxed many of the planning regulations.  There is danger of our being planned out of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat worried about the qualifications of the members of the proposed board.  You could have a board of cranks who would think a great deal about preserving the countryside and nothing about the unfortunate people who need to be housed.  The members of the board should be just as interested, or even more interested, in people as they are in preserving amenities.  Planners at the moment treat people as if they were cattle.  They never ask the people where they want to go.  We were told in Galway the other day that it was proposed to build ten or 12 houses out in the country because there are certain people who want to <Col N="85" /> freeze five acres.  When I questioned this I was told by those, who know all about planning apparently, that there was no need to own the land; one could get someone else's land.  Who will freeze his land for anybody? That is the kind of codology one gets from those who are supposed to know all about planning.</P>
    <P>I am interested in people.  I am also interested in the countryside.  I drive through Connemara and there are areas in that region where a house would actually add to the scenery provided it did not interfere with the view of lakes or mountains.</P>
    <P>Certain qualifications will obviously be required of the members of the proposed board.  Actually I would prefer to leave this to the Minister because the Minister will have to go back to the people.  He is responsible to the people.  What kind of qualifications will the members of this board have?  I do not agree that they should be judges or that there should be too many engineers or architects.  Some of these people would be necessary but the ordinary people with commonsense should also be represented on the board.  I think three is too small a number.  I would prefer four and a chairman.  I have reservations about the board because of this question of qualifications.  The case can be made that the Minister will not make wrong decisions where his own constituency is concerned but he will not give a hang outside of his constituency. There is that to be said against the Minister making decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very stupid argument directed at either Deputy Molloy or me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan:</NameTxt>
      <P>But it can be made. The board will be vitally important. Deputy Molloy and I both voted against the plan for Galway on the last occasion because there was too much in it and it was impossible to interpret it.  I will not vote for a plan unless the local representatives have the final say when there is a difference of opinion between them and the officials.  It is the councillors who should have the final say.  The officials say that the plan is their's but, when <Col N="86" /> it comes to interpretation, they have no say at all.  Something can be interpreted in two or three different ways and the officials insist their interpretation is the correct one.  The proposed board will have this problem. Theoretically it is an ideal solution. Will it work out all that well in practice?</P>
      <P>Amenity comes up very often in planning.  If there is a crank on the board who never thinks of people at all he will put a stop to all building anywhere on the grounds of amenity. We had many plans turned down by officials on the grounds of their being &ldquo;out of character&rdquo;.  That phrase is used very often.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on Law Enforcement, which was set up following the <Col N="87" /> Sunningdale Conference, has been examining the proposals put forward at that conference for dealing with those who commit crimes of violence in any part of Ireland.  They have been asked to do this as a matter of urgency. Pending the outcome of the commission's studies, it would not be appropriate to comment.</P>
    <P>As regards the Government's position on the status of Northern Ireland, I would refer the Deputy to the statement I made in the House this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach whether in fact the interpretation of his statement this morning, in which he gives part reply to one of my questions, can be read only as according to the majority in the Six Counties an everlasting and indefinite right to make claim to the territory of the Six Counties to the exclusion of the remainder and the large majority of the Irish people?  Is that not what in effect the Taoiseach said today in his statement?</P>

But, even as late as December, there was a very substantial increase in the number of cows over December, 1972.  I did not want to give these figures because they are not confirmed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties at present being experienced by the glasshouse industry are due particularly to the rising cost of oil for heating purposes.  These difficulties are not unique to this country and until the position improves the consumer of glasshouse products at home and abroad can expect to find the rising cost of glasshouse production reflected in product prices.  I am keeping the situation under constant review.  I should mention that under EEC requirements unilateral introduction of new subsidies would not be permissable, especially in regard to tomatoes for which there is a common organisation of the market.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the farm modernisation scheme is not really in operation as a result of the dispute at present going on with the farm advisory services, perhaps the Minister might consider allowing the farm improvements scheme to continue until such time as the farm modernisation scheme gets off the ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking the farm improvements scheme ended some 25 years ago, in 1949, but I assume the Deputy is referring really to the farm buildings scheme, the water supply scheme and the land project.  I think Deputy Collins is probably aware that there has always been a backlog of applications of nearly a year.  Therefore, there is no question of a standstill.  There is an immense amount of work to be done on those schemes and all the applications in before February 1st are being dealt with in the normal way.  Even the new schemes are not being held up completely.</P>

I think what Deputy Collins meant was that, while awaiting settlement of this dispute, the old scheme could not be carried on, that is, the farm buildings scheme.  I know there is a backlog.

In addition, the farm must be capable at the end of the development plan of producing the full comparable income for at least one labour unit.</P>
      <P>These conditions do not apply to the transitional farmer and there is, therefore, no reason, even in areas where industrial employment is available, why such farmers who may continue to depend on farming for an important part of their income, should not receive the appropriate grants under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should know that liquid milk does not come under the common agricultural pricing system.  The French Minister could have increased the price of liquid milk in France by 26 per cent provided the people were prepared to buy it.  There is no contribution from FEOGA&mdash;that makes the difference.  He did not apply it to processing.  We increased the price of milk by 8 per cent and he increased it by 6 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows there has been a decision to make the price of milk for processing and the price for beef retrospective to 3rd March.  That is already fixed and whatever increase is agreed upon will go back to that date.  That can be applied to milk products but it cannot <Col N="102" /> be given retrospectively for liquid milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will amend the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1973 so that a salmon drift net licence may be issued to a person in County Galway (details supplied) and other fishermen from the Aran Islands who have not held a salmon drift net licence for the required two year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to making the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order 1973, I gave full consideration to the feasibility of making some special provision for island fishermen but, in view of the implications of such a provision and the urgent need for conservation of the salmon stocks, it was not possible to implement the proposal.  In the circumstances I do not propose to amend the order on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Parliamentary Secretary feel that by granting drift net salmon licences to the few fishermen who exist on the Aran Islands he will in some way seriously interfere with the salmon stocks in this country?  On what basis did he make that decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The position so far as the islands mentioned by the Deputy are concerned is that in the year in which my predecessor, Deputy Fahey, made his order two applicants from the Aran Islands were successful. In this present year we had seven applications from the Aran Islands and by virtue of the order I made the board were in a position to grant six.  Therefore, so far as the Aran Islands are concerned, we have trebled the number of licences.  There is only one unsuccessful applicant who seemingly had no merit at all in his application so I do not see what the crib is.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not correct in stating that salmon drift net fishing by Aran islanders was not practiced until last year.  Following a bye-law made in 1969 permitting drift netting for salmon in the Galway, Ballinakill and Connemara fishery districts, drift net licences were issued to Aran Island fishermen each year since 1969 and in 1974 six of the seven applicants from Aran were successful in obtaining licences.</P>
      <P>As the eligibility for salmon net licences in the Galway, Connemara and Ballinakill fishery districts is based on participation in salmon fishing in the years from 1969 to 1973, as compared with 1968 to 1973 for the other fishery districts, there is no discrimination under the order against Aran Island fishermen.</P>

    <Title>Redundancy Payments (Weekly Payments and Lump Sums) Order, 1974: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Redundancy Payments (Weekly Payments and Lump Sum) Order, 1974,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 11th March, 1974.</P>
      <P>My authority to make this order, following approval of the draft by each House, is contained in sections 19 (3) and 30 (3) of that Act.  The order I am putting before the House contains three proposals.  The first of these provides for an extension of weekly payments in the case of older workers and the second and third are relevant to certain provisions in the Social Welfare Act, 1973 and the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first proposal deals with the case of workers who become redundant after the age of 51 years, especially those who have given long service with the same employer and who often find it more difficult to obtain new <Col N="130" /> employment than a younger person whom employers might regard as more adaptable, more easily trained and even less susceptible to illness. To these practical difficulties may be added the adverse psychological effects of redundancy on the morale of the somewhat older worker.</P>
    <P>In order to help these workers who so often find it difficult to obtain alternative employment, I propose, as from 1st April, 1974, to extend the duration of weekly payments by adding one extra weekly payment for each year of service over the age of 51 years.  From that date a redundant worker will receive one weekly payment for each year of service between the ages of 16 and 41 years, a rate of two weekly payments for each year of service between the ages of 41 and 51 years and three weekly payments for each year of service after that age.  I estimate that this improvement will increase the overall cost of weekly payments by about 8 per cent. Deputies will appreciate of course that these payments are made from the Redundancy Fund which is sustained by statutory contributions from employers and workers.</P>
    <P>My second proposal contained in this order arises from the forthcoming operation of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973.  Under the present arrangements a redundant worker is paid weekly payments from the Redundancy Fund equivalent to 50 per cent of his pre-redundancy pay, the length of such payments depending on his years of service.  These weekly payments are made in addition to unemployment benefit or other Social Welfare benefits.  The law provides however that the total of all such payments must not exceed 90 per cent of the worker's pre-redundancy pay and the weekly redundancy payment element is reduced where necessary in order to keep the overall total payment within the 90 per cent limit.</P>
    <P>As from 6th April next a weekly pay related supplement will be paid by the Department of Social Welfare in addition to unemployment benefit, and in these circumstances the retention of the limit of total weekly payments from all sources to 90 per cent <Col N="131" /> of pre-redundancy pay would in many cases further decrease the redundancy element, especially in the case of lower paid workers with many dependants. As a counterbalance to this I propose to abolish the 90 per cent limit and to substitute a 100 per cent limit, in other words to get away from the previous limit of 90 per cent of wages before redundancy.  Deputies will appreciate that this proposal, in conjunction with the new Social Welfare pay-related scheme, will take us into entirely new territory and I cannot at present estimate accurately what increased cost, if indeed any at all, will fall on the Redundancy Fund over, say, the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>My third proposal arises from the effects of an order under section 12 of the Social Welfare Act, 1973, abolishing the £1,600 a year income limit for insurability for non-manual workers as from 1st April.  The basic situation is that the persons eligible for redundancy payments are those who are insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  This means that the abolition of the non-manual income limit for social welfare purposes will bring into the redundancy payments scheme a large number of persons hitherto outside the scope of the scheme.  The figure is estimated at around 35,000.  Many of these will be higher paid workers, possibly with long service, who will only now start to contribute to the redundancy fund, the rate being three pence a week for men and two pence a week for women.</P>
    <P>The contribution is a flat rate one, irrespective of income and the persons in question will be in benefit immediately they start contributing.  It could happen, therefore, that numbers of higher paid workers, if they become redundant, would cause a heavy drain on the redundancy fund by reason of their entitlement to large redundancy payments following very modest or almost token contributions to the fund.  It is relevant to mention here, that early last year it was necessary to borrow £295,000 from the Exchequer to keep the fund solvent.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that <Col N="132" /> this loan has been repaid as a result of increased contribution rates introduced last July and a downward trend in the number of redundancies in 1973, namely 7,504 in 1973 as compared with 10,159 in 1972 and 8,556 in 1971.  During the coming year, despite external economic difficulties, it is possible and I believe it will be achievable, that we will keep the rate of employment advancing and the rate of unemployment at a low level. Accordingly, I am proposing that that part of a worker's income exceeding £2,500 a year should be disregarded in calculating redundancy entitlements as from April 1st next. This cut-off point of £2,500 a year, is the same as the ceiling set for benefits under the social welfare pay-related scheme.</P>
    <P>I recommend the resolution approving the proposed Order to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome some of the proposals.  The Minister did not say to what extent the fund is in credit at present or whether any addition to the staff will be necessary as a result of the change in the payments which are being made.  He will no doubt tell us when replying if any increase is necessary.  The 1967 Redundancy Payments Act, which the first Minister for Labour, my predecessor, Dr. Hillery, brought in provided for a 50 per cent limit.  In the 1971 Amendment Act I raised that to 90 per cent.  The Minister, now, in order not to belittle the benefits of the pay-related benefits scheme, which I brought in when I was Minister for Labour, is arranging that 100 per cent will be payable under the various schemes.  If I remember rightly the <Col N="133" /> Act provides where any reduction was made in relation to the payments which brought one up to 90 per cent at that time, and now to 100 per cent, the social welfare payments were not to be reduced.  Therefore, it must be the redundancy payments that are reduced to keep within the 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>Will the 100 per cent limit that is now imposed only apply for the duration of the redundancy pay ments?  That may be a superfluous question to ask because when the redundancy payments stop the other payments must necessarily go on. They will not be reduced in any event in order to keep the person in question down to the 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>This can hardly be called a social welfare payment because it is administered by the Department of Labour under the Redundancy Acts 1967 and 1971.  Previously Ministers tried to avoid the 100 per cent payment because it was always thought that an unemployed person should not be as well off as he could be if he was employed. There was a very strong disincentive there for somebody drawing weekly redundancy payments, if he was receiving 100 per cent of his previous income, to accept employment if he was offered it.  It is not likely that a redundant worker would worry too much about securing alternative employment if he was drawing benefit of 100 per cent of what his previous payments were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a pessimistic view of human nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>These are things which require certain checks which would ordinarily be applied.  I was frequently reminded that the Government do not pay this money out of their own pocket, that they take it from the people paying taxes.  In this case they take it from the people who are contributing to the social insurance fund and the redundancy fund. The 100 per cent payment for the duration of the redundancy weekly payment, which is not very long because it is governed by the number of years for which the person was employed prior to becoming redundant, <Col N="134" /> is something which nobody will begrudge workers.  When I brought the limit of 50 per cent to 90 per cent it was considered very welcome.  The only reason why we did not bring it to the 100 per cent was that it was not regarded as socially desirable to pay in benefit 100 per cent of one's prior total income.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken quick action to ensure that all the people who are now insurable will not be entitled to redundancy payments.  He has set a ceiling of £2,500.  I do not know if that is a realistic ceiling.  I am sure many people, who realised they would become insurable when the £1,600 limit went, felt that one of the greatest benefits available to them was the redundancy payments.  There will, unquestionably, be more people disappointed to find there is a limit set and that they will not be in a position to secure anything.  Will those people over £2,500 income have to pay the redundancy element of the stamp which is paid in respect of the redundancy scheme?  It would not be fair to ask them to contribute to the stamp if they do not benefit from the scheme.  They would be paying into a scheme out of which they were not qualified to receive anything.  The Minister has not stated when one reaches that limit if the redundancy payment element in the stamp will discontinue.  The redundancy figure of 10,159 in 1972 was reduced to 7,504 in 1973.  It was very near to our estimate. The Minister will find that our estimate was a bit better.  He did not give an estimate for 1974 but he was hopeful that the redundancy figure would not be greater than the 7,000 for last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I brought the amendment to the 1967 Act before the House there was a surplus of approximately £1 million in the fund at the time. Deputies on both sides urged me to do much more with regard to improvements in the scheme.  We doubled the benefits available under the 1967 Act in that we reduced the qualifying period and extended the time for payment and the amount, particularly for those over the age of 41 years.  The Minister has now made special provision <Col N="135" /> for those over 51 years.  I think I am correct in saying a redundant worker is entitled to two weeks' payment for every three years worked in respect of a lump sum, and a person over 41 years is entitled to two weeks for each year which he worked over the age of 41.  The Minister proposes extending that to three weeks for each year worked over 51 years.  If a worker is rendered redundant when he is over the age of 51 years he is entitled to that extra payment and I welcome any improvements made in this matter.  At this point workers are rapidly moving towards superannuation benefits.</P>
    <P>One of the principal weaknesses in the Redundancy Act that was evident when we brought it in was that in certain cases it could be used to the benefit of the worker.  Many workers nearing the age of 65 would like to be made redundant when they are 64 years.  In this way they are able to draw redundancy payment and to get a pension in the following year.  If they work for the last year they are retired in the normal way with no redundancy money.  If the Minister checks on this matter he will see that a large number of workers become redundant at this point, thereby qualifying for both payments.</P>
    <P>Some of the workers I have in mind are those engaged in forestry work where there is considerable redundancy because less money is being devoted to forestry.  The Minister will find that much of the redundancy money paid at the moment is paid to forestry workers in rural Ireland, particularly round the western seaboard where employment is most needed.  In such cases, workers who have given long service and who are nearing the age of retirement are made redundant and can qualify for superannuation and redundancy payments.  When redundancies are inevitable consideration is given to young men with families who need to build up their contributions in order to qualify for payments later.  I am not deprecating the fact that the redundancy scheme may be &ldquo;abused&rdquo; in this respect; it is only fair that those who will suffer the <Col N="136" /> least hardship should be selected for redundancy.  However, it might be considered that the scheme is not being used for its original purpose and that the spirit of the Act is not being considered.</P>
    <P>The improvements for those over the age of 51 are welcome.  As the Minister pointed out, it will not involve much payment out of the fund. The fact that the pay-related benefit scheme is being added to the Principal Act is a necessary technical change and is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The fact that a limit of £2,500 has been set will be a disappointment to many who thought they would benefit under one of the best schemes we brought in.  I do not know if the Minister examined the position before he set the limit of £2,500.  I am sure he has done some costings on it but there are many people at that scale of salary whose family circumstances are such that they would not be very well off it rendered redundant.  To take part in the pay-related benefit scheme might be of great assistance to them but not to qualify for the lump sum under redundancy must be a big disappointment.  It is true these people have not been paying into the fund. I did ask the Minister if they would be excused the contribution necessary to qualify for payment out of the fund.  Apart from the £2,500 limit the other two changes are beneficial and an improvement on existing legislation, legislation of which I have always been very proud because I have seen the benefits of it in so many cases.</P>
    <P>As a result of our entry into the European Economic Community there are bound to be changes in industrial employment.  Industry will change and there will be a good deal of movement. Those concerned will be entitled to some benefit when they find themselves in a less suitable type of employment perhaps.  Under the Act they qualify for redundancy in most cases and that is the greatest protection any worker could have.</P>
    <P>I am sorry this is not being extended to those in the higher income bracket because if inflation goes on at the rate at which it has been moving <Col N="137" /> over the last year or so £2,500 will not be a very big income for a man with a family.  For that reason the Minister might review the position in a year&mdash;he or whoever replaces him&mdash;and, as the Act empowers him to do, extend the limit.  There is a vast difference between a single man with £2,500 and a married man with the same income and six or seven children.  The circumstances are very different.  There could be very grave hardship in the case of a married man with a large family.</P>
    <P>This is not a controversial matter. These improvements can be made under existing legislation.  There could even be disimprovements from time to time for that matter.  When the income limit was raised for insurability I was wondering what the Minister would do in this particular connection.  He has nailed the income at £2,500.  I hope he will have a look at that figure in the near future to see whether or not it is too low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the improvements. May I say the Minister has been too modest in not making available to us a copy of his opening statement?  It is very often easier to interpret the written statement and I hope that on the next occasion we will be treated with a little more courtesy.</P>
      <P>The limit is 51 years.  I am sure the Minister has good reasons for this limit but I suggest he might have another look at it because there is a kind of compulsory redundancy now at 40 years of age.  Many employers and most local authorities will not employ a man over 40.  Could the Minister give us an estimate of the cost of an extension?  We will not cavil at the money.  He should be honest with the people whom we intend to benefit and not just say to workers that here are certain improvements and then let them discover they have to pay for them. We should spell it out that we are giving new benefits and their fellow workers may have to pay for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this in line with EC policy? Does our legislation measure up to that of Germany, France, Britain <Col N="138" /> and the others?  I do not think it is right that the person on the £2,500 income should have to pay the full redundancy contribution each week but be denied the full benefit of the scheme.  This should be amended forthwith.  As a result of the recent agreement many workers will now be over the £2,500.  These will pay the same contribution as those under the £2,500 limit and they will be paying for something they will not get. Because inflation is so rampant&mdash;I do not blame the Minister for that&mdash; the limit should be very elastic.  I look forward to the time when there will be no limit.  Inflation makes a mockery of limits.</P>
    <P>How does the fund stand at the moment?  Is it being drained because of redundancies or is it in a healthy financial condition?  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that redundancies are not increasing and that the fund is in a sound position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary):</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore and, I think, Deputy Brennan raised a question about the solvency or creditworthiness of the fund at present.  One could say that the fund at present is something like £129,000 in credit; current account £54,000; investment fund £75,000. Obviously, one cannot give any absolutely accurate prediction about the state of the fund over the next 12 months in terms of the proposals made today in this order because the finances available to the fund and its general creditworthiness depend on factors outside the control of the fund.  It depends on the rate of employment, the rate of unemployment in the economy as a whole.  But, as I remarked in my opening brief, there is an improvement in the unemployment position as between this year and last year.  In 1973 we had 7,504 redundancies notified as compared with 10,159 in 1972 and, in 1971, we had 8,556.  Therefore, one could say there has been a downward turn but there are irregularities in that general trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the coming year there are external difficulties which we face as an economy related to increased commodity prices and the general crisis in <Col N="139" /> fuel and oil.  Many commentators remark on the fact that this year our rate of growth cannot keep pace with that recorded last year.  Obviously, this will have certain adverse effects on the employment potential of the economy. Certainly it will decrease the rate of growth in employment this year.  We must do everything possible in our power to ensure that even though these external factors may militate against increased employment we do whatever we can here at home to keep our rate of expansion proceeding satisfactorily even if it cannot be maintained at the same rate as last year.  There are these overall, global features relating to the world economy which will affect the employment capacity at home and which will in turn affect the solvency of the fund.  It is not possible for me&mdash; as it has not been possible for my predecessors&mdash;to answer accurately what will be the state of the fund over any future year.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputies opposite that this was a short three-proposal speech of mine.  I regret that they should feel they were in any way excluded from information I had for the House by not passing on a copy of the speech but there was no decision on my part to keep any information from them.  I had merely three simple proposals and these I put before them. But, in future, I certainly will ensure that copies of proposals are put before the relevant spokesman opposite before I make the speech.  Having been in Opposition for many years myself, I do appreciate that it makes for a better informed debate that Deputies opposite should be in possession of all information necessary for them to make a responsible contribution.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Brennan who mentioned that what the order I put before the House attempts to do is to improve the facilities in the fund. We improve the aims of the redundancy fund.  First of all, we improve the rate of financial help available to the worker over 51 years of age. I think it was Deputy Moore asked: &ldquo;Why 51?&rdquo; The problem one is faced with in any arbitrary age figure is that somebody can always say: &ldquo;Why <Col N="140" /> not another figure?&rdquo; There is no particular reason why we choose 51 other than that we felt, in general, the worker in his 50s finds it more difficult to secure employment when declared redundant.  I think most Deputies will agree that this is in accord with their own experience.  Therefore, we cushion the financial loss of his job to such a worker.</P>
    <P>There is, then, the provision of the 100 per cent grant.  The provision up to now was that payments to redundant workers must not exceed 90 per cent of the worker's pre-redundancy pay.  There have been changes in the social welfare pay-related scheme. Therefore, to keep pace with that scheme, we have arranged that workers in future will be entitled to 100 per cent of their pre-redundancy wage.  I do not agree with Deputy Brennan that a person being paid 100 per cent of his pre-redundancy wage would, therefore, be dissuaded from looking for alternative work.  It is really two different views of human nature.  The vast majority of mankind prefer to be in gainful employment. In legislating for the vast majority of mankind, I think it is wrong to think of a minority of malingerers who, in the minds of certain Deputies here, are reluctant to work. We should not let that minority situation govern our attitude in legislating for the majority.  The majority of mankind when losing one job are simply anxious to secure another satisfactory one where they may be gainfully employed.  In this interim when he is looking for alternative employment we believe that the maximum financial aid should be made available to him.  He may be innocent of any dereliction of duty.  The firm for which he worked may have decided to close down for reasons of extra profitability.  The shareholders may have decided that it was more profitable to go into another form of economic activity.  They may have closed down that business operation.  Therefore, through no fault of his own, he finds himself, in the prime of life, without a job.  Our conception is that the redundancy fund be made available to such a worker to the maximum effect over this period of financial <Col N="141" /> embarrassment for him and, more so, for his family.  He may have a school-going family&mdash;those who are not in gainful employment.  Why should that family be penalised over this period because the breadwinner is not in work?  We believe that the positive use of the fund is to see him over this lean period, to ensure that through the other agencies of the State&mdash;the retraining programme and so on&mdash;he is helped.  The whole purpose behind this legislation is to help the worker back to gainful employment with as little embarrassment and dislocation to his family life as is possible.  Knowing the mentality of the Irish worker, I have sufficient confidence that he will be anxious to return to gainful employment in the shortest period possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan mentioned a point about the £2,500 a year ceiling.  We have increased the area of help to redundant workers from a ceiling of £1,600 to £2,500.  It is not true to say that those earning in excess of £2,500 will not benefit from this fund.  Of course they will benefit but only up to a point of £2,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not say that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I misunderstood.  What I am saying is that over £2,500 he will not benefit but the worker who would be in receipt of a salary over £2,500 will gain from this fund.  He will gain up to the level of £2,500.  In the future, depending on wage patterns in the economy, we can look again at this and ascertain whether the ceiling of £2,500 is a just cut-off point for benefits.  Certainly, it is a vast improvement on the present closed point of £1,600.  It means that we can now move into areas of clerical employment which, up to now, have been closed off from any benefits from this fund.  I think most Deputies will agree that an increase of almost £1,000 in applicability, from £1,600 to £2,500, is a marked advantage to those who may be declared redundant in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible at this stage to give any answers to the whole question of <Col N="142" /> the solvency of the fund because that depends on the general employment potential in the economy in the coming year.  What we propose here is in line with what we brought into being early last summer when we changed the rate of contribution.  We made the increases sought last summer fall completely on the shoulders of the employer. We did not place those increases on the shoulders of the worker.  This is in accord with EEC practice where the employer has to pay a much greater amount in discharging his social obligations than the employer customarily pays in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite asked whether this was up to the mark and whether our proposals were up to the EEC practice. Often we say of our legislation that it is almost as good as that of others or that it has certain features that appear to be an improvement on similar legislation elsewhere.  I am glad to say in this case that our redundancy legislation is superior to most comparable legislation in EEC countries.  We have a great advantage over the comparable British legislation in that our payment schemes are divided between lump sums and weekly payments.  There are solid social advantages in our system of payment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that our redundancy payment is not seen to be another form of welfare payment. It is not seen to be any kind of adjunct to doling out cash to people in an everlasting flow.  We see the redundancy payment being given to people who are losing their employment because of technological changes in the economy and who are anxious to return to the work force.  In these circumstances nothing except the best financial aids available and a fund which meets those needs of the worker are good enough for the worker and his family in the interim period.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the pay-related benefit scheme considerably eases the demand on the fund?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was trying to give my ideas to the Minister about how important interpretation is in connection with planning regulations.  I was trying to explain to the Minister that we had a case of a planning authority applying for permission for a plan for the environment of Galway.  Suggestions were put up.  I would be afraid the Minister would get people like this authority on the board.  They planned to build villages or else ten or 12 houses in a certain area&mdash;a kind of tenement&mdash;and to service that area. Outside that, they said, you can build a farmhouse or a second family house, or freeze five acres.  There are many backroads 20 miles away from any city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what the planning authority wanted to include in our new plan.  Plans are being revised in every county at the moment.  Public representatives did not agree with this plan.  Ordinary country people want urban standards. If a man in the country has his group <Col N="144" /> water scheme and other services he can have all amenities while his house is still cheap.  Do we want to depopulate Ireland?</P>
      <P>Some time ago outside Galway city on the coast road a man applied for planning permission.  He applied for a plot of ground that was under the road, and between that and the coast there were trees about 20 feet high. All that grew on the plot of ground was thistles and nettles.  He applied for permission to build two bungalows which would not have been seen from the road.  The coast was not visible because of the trees.  His application was turned down because the building of the bungalows would interfere with an amenity.  I want a definition of amenity.  I was asked recently whether I wanted houses along the road.  I do not, but I want to keep people in the country and I want to make sure that there is good planning.  I want also to preserve the scenic beauty of the countryside.  I do not want it abused by planners who think they know all about it.</P>
      <P>There is the question of building along major roads.  I wish to express my personal view.  I have strong views about the traffic hazards, amenities and things which are out of character.  I like driving around the country and meeting things which are out of character.  I hate the sight of housing estates.  They are a blot.  They have been planned by town planners who have destroyed some of our towns.</P>
      <P>In Galway city there is a little old thatched house near the Regional Hospital.  Tourists take photographs of it.  It is completely out of character with the houses around it but the tourists love it and I love to see it myself.  Without variety the country will lose its tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>I want to compliment the Minister on the idea of shifting office blocks out of the centre of the city.  I am a countryman but when I come to the city I like to see life there.  Office blocks should be built outside cities. There should be people living in the centre of cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming now to the question of the man building his own house, he finds <Col N="145" /> the planners almost tell him how to paint it.  If a man is building a house in an amenity area he will be told the type of paint he must use and the type of roof he must put on.  This is dictation in a democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure about the roof, but it could happen that a man would put a green roof in the middle of a brown-roofed area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan:</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are a variety of people planning houses in a countryside they have a variety of ideas.  If one man with set ideas plans the whole landscape it is monotonous. I maintain that variety is better than having one man building houses which he has designed and which he thinks are the nicest.  Variety is better than a set pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be a little hard on the planners but I have very good reason for this because I have seen some of the things that were turned down and to me they were a common disgrace. As regards traffic hazards&mdash;these are private views; perhaps not many on this side will agree with me but I do not care who agrees or not I am putting them up&mdash;in regard to building along primary roads, there is the question of what is a traffic hazard here.  You are not allowed to build except for a second family farmhouse or a replacement house on a national primary road but if you go a mile up a by-road you may build.  When you want to come out on to the primary road you must come out from the by-road.  If the primary road is properly hard-shouldered and these houses are built along the road with good entrances well set back and if you are coming out to go with the traffic, almost ten cars could get into the traffic at the one time.  Admittedly, if they have to cross the traffic it could be difficult.  If, however, you had to cross the traffic coming out of the by-road, you would stick out the bonnet of the car and watch for a chance to get across.  The next car must move up and do likewise but if the houses were along the side of the road nearly ten of them could get in at one time.  To my mind the by-road <Col N="146" /> is a greater traffic hazard.  The suggestion that cars coming from houses along the side of the road would hold up traffic is wrong.  It is the duty of the man coming out to watch his opportunity.  The motorist on the national primary road has no obligation to watch the gate.  This is my personal view and it is a cod to say that if you put a man up a by-road you keep him off the national primary road; he still has to come out and I maintain it is easier for him to come out if he has a good wide entrance and if the road is properly hard-shouldered. I believe the worst traffic hazard is coming off a by-road on to the main road.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that a man should be charged any fee for applying for planning permission.  It would not be very well accepted in the country.  I do not think it is necessary to bring agricultural buildings within the planning provisions and I would not agree with it because in the case of any grants given by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries they make a fairly searching inspection of the site.  It is well checked and if there is any danger of pollution or other objection you will not get a grant and will not be allowed to erect a building.  Therefore, I do not think agricultural buildings should require planning permission.</P>
    <P>If we agreed on every measure, particularly on the constituencies, as we agree on this, I would have nothing but praise for the Minister.  I think he is a hardworking man doing a good job as regards planning.  I think it was the Parliamentary Secretary who said we should give credit where credit is due.  I hope I always do.  I ask the Minister to consider carefully what I have said.  I hope I am not being too hard on the planning officials, but I should like to have some sort of committee of public representatives&mdash;it might be too much to ask to have an all-party committee&mdash;to discuss what qualifications these men should have irrespective of who appoints them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in the main.  In this day and age when we are a developing nation and have the problems resulting from that development we should have pretty firm control over it.  Because of its complexities and of the inter-dependencies between the social, economic and physical fields it calls for the input of a great number of skills which can be supplied by many trained planners, engineers, architects, sociologists, psychologists and, I suppose, economists but, like Deputy Callanan, I am very much in favour of the sound good sense of the layman.  I do not think the Minister would disagree with that. I imagine that when he comes to appoint members to his board and to the back-up service that he intends them to have, he will not neglect the ordinary layman who in some cases has become very skilled in all planning matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little disappointed that he has eliminated members of local authorities from becoming members of the board or being involved in the working of the board because many of these men&mdash;and I can speak with a certain amount of knowledge of them having worked in Cork County Council with them and they come from every political party&mdash;have made a tremendous study of planning and given a considerable amount of their own time to making themselves <i>au fait</i> with planning and all its complexities. Perhaps it would not be a tragedy but certainly it would be a mistake to ignore the vast fund of knowledge that many local authority members have between them.  From a physical, economic and social viewpoint the erection of buildings is one of the important elements in the development of our society and of any man-made environment.  These buildings must surely represent our greatest investment. It is for that reason and because of the tremendous importance I attach to that form of investment I feel this is too big a job and too vital from the national point of view <Col N="148" /> to be left to mere professionals.  This is not to detract from the skills of the professionals of the necessity to have them available but the Minister should consider very carefully keeping some openings available for ordinary lay people.</P>
    <P>I represent a constituency which, I suppose, is one of the most beautiful in the country.  It has a considerable coastline.  The Minister's constituency also has a coastline.  My constituency runs from Kinsale almost to Castletownbere. There is no doubt that this is an amenity worth preserving. We have a considerable number of tourists who come there every year. The tourist industry is one of the most vital industries of the area.  There are cases of victimisation.  People living in areas which can only be described as barren soil were denied planning permission because they lived in such a sensitive tourist area.  They should be given some concessions. Even £1,000 or £1,500 for a site can make a tremendous difference to some of the small farmers in my area.  Because they might live in a place like Glengarriff, or between Bantry and Glengarriff, or in the area from Kinsale to Castletownbere, they will be differentiated against because they live in such a beautiful part of the country.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on several occasions at local authority level and in this House about the social obligations we have to those people.  Many of them are farmers with bad land.  Some could have up to 100 acres of land but might have only ten, 15 or 20 arable acres.  If they could sell one or two sites it would make all the difference to them between survival and non-survival.  When planning we cannot ignore the fact that we want to keep our people living in rural Ireland. We do not want the depopulation of the country to continue.  Such a concession would be a tremendous fillip and incentive, and in some cases it would be a necessity to enable them to continue to farm in those areas. After 12 months in office I am sure the Minister has heard all the stories about planning appeals and the sympathy which should be extended to certain people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley:</NameTxt>
      <P>They may be right. We should specifically insert a clause, similar to the clause we had in relation to the second family house on the farm, to enable any person in that category to qualify for one or maybe two sites.  We would be doing a tremendous social service to the people of rural Ireland if we could ensure that that was written in specifically and without any ambiguity. Planners are not their own bosses. They have certain terms of reference by which they must administer their departments.  They must operate within the scope allocated to them. Therefore we need to spell out <Col N="150" /> specifically what we mean and what we are trying to preserve, especially in relation to amenities.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Callanan said, &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; can mean anything to the person who is using it as a basis for turning down planning permission.  The education of the public is as important as the skills available to us in our planning departments. If the public are educated in the values of planning there will not be as many appeals and debates as we now have.  The best way of educating the public is to show them that everything is straight and above board.  My colleague, Deputy M.P. Murphy, and I fought this for a number of years. We considered that the files of all planning applications which were turned down should be available and if necessary should be published so that everybody can see why they were turned down, who turned them down and if any of the planning officers were in favour of planning permission in those cases.  Very often it happens that planning applications have been turned down on a majority vote. While that is a democratic way of doing things, the people should be made aware of how those decisions came about and what qualifications the men had who were for or against them and the reasons which led to those decisions.</P>
      <P>We have been fortunate in the people we have had in our various planning sections.  A number of our officers in local authorities quickly acquired planning skills and that is a great compliment to them and the people responsible for their selection. Many of them came into the county councils as clerks and suddenly found themselves as important officers in planning departments.  Without receiving any form of training they quickly acquired the basic skills necessary to process the vast number of applications coming before them.  We were fortunate in having so many people who could take the brunt of it when the pressure was really on.  Now of course there is a little more enlightenment about the whole thing but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no real fault to find with the Minister for Local Government.  He may not always be the best behaved Deputy in the House when he is in the seat opposite but that is no reflection on his ability as an administrator.  We realise very well that we must protect our amenities and develop our tourist and recreational facilities.  Because of that, planning must be of direct concern to all of us. Throughout the world there are governments, especially in the developing economies, endeavouring to protect their natural and historic heritage and to enhance the living environment of their people and, as in Ireland, to assist their natural economies by attracting tourists.  We should, in the main, endeavour to preserve all the amenities that attract tourists but I think we have been going about it in some cases in the wrong way.  The herding of people into towns and villages was a mistake.  I can see the economic justification for this very clearly.  You bring people to where the services are available.  However, nowadays when people are endeavouring to get away from the rat-race of the cities and go to the peace of the countryside, rather than discouraging them we should be encouraging them.  This is one positive way in which we could ensure that the population of towns and villages and the environs of those towns and villages are brought back to their former level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister speaks about Government policy and transmitting it to the board, he is touching a very important subject because we must have a coherent process of thought in dealing with a subject like planning which is very complex.  As the pressures grow, and no doubt the more we develop the more the pressures will grow, we will have calls upon our scarce resources of money and manpower so it is essential that we put that money and that manpower to the best possible <Col N="152" /> use.  I hope this Bill will co-ordinate and ensure that we have the best possible return on our investment.</P>
    <P>I was talking about the development of coastlines.  There are several ways of developing a coastline.  In such development we have an interest in preserving the amenities of the coastline for tourism.</P>

It is not the perfect answer, perhaps, to have a refinery in Bantry Bay but, nevertheless, it is very important for the people there that they have employment available to them instead of having it in the sewers of Coventry or Birmingham. I do not think anybody can deny that there can be a certain invasion of the environment but I think it is a calculated decision we have got to take.</P>

      <P>Members of local authorities have acquired a tremendous amount of knowledge and, more important still, they are in touch with people and are aware of what the people want.  That is what we should be doing here, looking after the interests of the people.  Some of our planners, and I stress some, have been so remote and removed from the feelings of the people that we have some monstrosities erected.  A local authority should also be subject to the stringencies of the Planning Act.  We have a monstrosity erected in Glengarriff between the sea and the road. It is a structure to house a water pump and it is situated opposite a hotel.  If any private individual attempted to erect such a house, even in the vicinity, he would be locked up in jail almost.</P>
      <P>I should like to see a situation coming about where local authorities would also be subject to all the controls that are on the individual.  Local authorities have, through their functions, many buildings to erect, a lot of road widening to carry out and a lot of other detailed type of developments but, nevertheless, they are not subject to the same controls as the ordinary individual.</P>

      <P>We have before us, during the passage of this Bill, an opportunity of ensuring the proper enactment of planning policy.  The Minister should spell out, first, the type of man he has in mind to act as chairman of the board and, secondly, details concerning the qualifications of members of the board.  As proposed, the Bill is vague in this respect.  I hope the Minister will assure us that conditions for appointment to the board will be more definite than they would appear to be at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it may be said that governments endeavour always to get money from every source possible, the section dealing with payments in respect of appeals discriminates against the less well-off members of the community. Between now and Committee Stage the Minister might have another look at this matter to see what can be done to tighten it up.  Big corporations and business will have no problem <Col N="160" /> in paying all the expenses involved in relation to appeals but the smaller man could not do so.  It would be wrong that a person would be forced, by reason of his circumstances, to withdraw an appeal.</P>

I welcome in general the whole spirit of the Bill and I hope that from now on there will be more planning in relation to development and that no longer will there be situations in which accusations are made from all sides against politicians.

The question of planning applications and appeals is one of which most Members of this House are familiar as are also members of local authorities.  Any amending legislation designed to speed up planning appeals especially is to be welcomed. The establishment of the appeals board, if it is to be an independent body, is very welcome.</P>
      <P>There are a few points I should like to bring to the Minister's attention in relation to the whole question of planning applications and appeals and I shall be grateful if he will reply to them.  First, I think the whole concept of planning development in local areas should be properly centralised in a local development plan for an entire area.  Such a plan would require to be started and amended every five years.  Development plans for urban areas particularly should be carefully undertaken.  The need for this is obvious when one considers rapidly expanding cities, such as the city of Waterford.  In such rapidly expanding urban areas, if development plans are not put down on paper and understood by everybody concerned, there will be bad planning and an even higher level of appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister's opening statement, 10 per cent of all planning applications are subsequently appealed by the planning authority or by third party appellants.  The intake of appeals is approximately 4,000 per year, a very high number, representing about 10 per cent of all applications.  This high level of appeals is probably the result of late planning at the development stage and I urge the Minister to ensure that when a local authority development plan is being reconsidered and amended, more attention should be given to examining the existing development plan and allowing it to be discussed not only by the local councils concerned but by outside bodies.  If there was consultation with <Col N="162" /> outside bodies before plans are amended there would be a significant contribution to the whole question of planning and a considerable reduction in the necessity for appeals.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure a proper development plan for an area and to see that planning applications are dealt with properly, there is a very good case to be made for improvements in planning staffs in county councils and borough councils.  These staffs grew up under severe pressure under the 1963 Act and existing staffs have been there since the beginning.  It is my belief that more expertise should be brought in by way of qualified personnel in local authority areas.  There is need for a better qualified expert in most local authority areas.  I do not say this because of any lack of respect for existing staff, but more qualified people would be welcome within the existing service.</P>
    <P>I also suggest there should be available in the Department a central consultancy service which local authorities could call on in relation to any of the problems they may meet. Generally speaking, Departments in Dublin do not want to take on problems that do not concern them directly &mdash;anything that can be dealt with locally, they feel, should be dealt with locally.  However, in relation to planning problems in general there is a case for a qualified consultancy staff within the Department of Local Government which would be available in cases where awkward problems arise. I hope the Minister will try to make such a service available.</P>
    <P>Most local authority planning applications are relatively of minor importance. Only 10 per cent could be considered to be major applications outside Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Drogheda.  All other applications are of a minor character and this in itself is a good reason why an information service should be available to applicants.  Small companies and farmers do not want to go to the trouble of employing solicitors and quantity surveyors or some such experts to deal with their minor applications. I agree that in most cases there would be no need to employ an <Col N="163" /> expert to handle such applications. For this reason the local authority should have an advisory service available. I do not think it would cost a great deal of money.  The service could be drawn from the existing local authority planning department on whom it would not be a great burden to give advice to applicants and to suggest amendments to applications before submission.  This would reduce the number of appeals enormously.</P>
    <P>One section of the Bill deals with vexatious appeals.  There is no doubt there are such things as vexatious appeals and I am glad to see the board will have adequate powers to deal with such things.  I regard the 10 per cent level of appeals on planning applications to be very high.  I do not think that one in ten applicants needs to appeal.  There is something wrong somewhere.  I would suggest that a five per cent level would be more realistic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the handling of the energy crisis and calls on the Government to inform the House of its future policy on energy.</P>
      <P>I should say at the outset that in setting down this motion for consideration by the Dáil I was not concerned to make political capital from the serious problems that have arisen as a result of the oil crisis.  Neither am I interested in making personal attacks on any member of the Government. However, I feel it is right and proper, because of the concern throughout the nation, that we should ensure that the fullest possible light is allowed into what has become for this as well as every other country in Europe the most sensitive sector in our economic wellbeing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ability of the Government to identify the problems, to deal with them and to lay the groundwork to ensure that we learn from them is of <Col N="164" /> the utmost importance to us all.  We have certainly gained a great deal of information over the past six months as a result of this crisis.  If you will bear with me I should like to highlight some particular events during this time.  Each and every event has had one ingredient, I regret to say, at least as far as the public are concerned, and that ingredient is confusion. People have been confused from the very outset and they are still confused to a great degree.</P>
    <P>In mid-November last a rationing of supplies was introduced by the companies themselves.  This caused confusion initially because of the retrospective element which was involved. People were told of a 10 per cent reduction in petrol deliveries, and yet the ordinary motorist was faced with garages open for only a few hours daily and no supplies at all over the week-end.  It is no exaggeration to say that on some occasions in this city these queues erupted into violence as a result of this confusion.  The public were bewildered by what was going on.  Many people were calling for rationing to regularise the position.</P>
    <P>There would have been no such confusion if they had been told the true implication at that time, which was that that 10 per cent cut would be nearly 20 per cent because of the increased consumption during 1973 over that of 1972; and because many of the traders had already, by mid-November, drawn their regular supplies for the previous year, this cut eventually became a 45 per cent for the second part of the last quarter of 1973.</P>
    <P>Immediately the Dáil recessed last Christmas the people of Dublin were confused further by the news that the Dublin Gas Company proposed to introduce rationing of gas supplies. It nearly brought them back to the wartime days of rationing.  What really happened on that occasion was, as far as I am aware, that one company who had contracted to supply the gas company for a period of seven or eight years or more had cut down supplies of naptha gas to the Dublin Gas Company because <Col N="165" /> their contract was not as profitable as continuing on with this naptha gas and refining it further into petrol products.  As I said, this caused tremendous confusion in this city, particularly among the more vulnerable people, the old people, many of whom are depending on the Dublin Gas Company.</P>
    <P>Rationing of course suggests that people are told that they may consume a certain amount of any product, and the person responsible for giving them this information would be the Minister.  It is probably unnecessary for me to say that no directive came from the Minister on this occasion.  All the people were treated to were curtly worded advertisements in the daily papers which were couched in very general terms, telling consumers that they would receive specific details of the rationing scheme at a later date.  Fortunately the rationing did not take place, but definitely the confusion took place.</P>
    <P>During this time the public learned, probably for the first time, that the oil supply to every section of this country was completely outside the control of the Government.  They also were to find out during this period that we refined only half of our total oil consumption, half of the five million tons which are required each year for this nation, and that we were considered as part of the British market for the remainder of the supplies.  From the end of December the public had to rely on the various newspaper correspondents to try and get some idea of what was going on in the oil world.  Countries that were supposed to be cut off from supplies, but although we were to be quite capable of getting adequate supplies, but although we were repeatedly told we were regarded as a friendly nation our supplies were severely cut back.</P>
    <P>It has been the pattern in many parts of the world to make the Arab people the scapegoats for this oil crisis.  I am not one who subscribes wholly to this.  The Arab people and the oil-producing nations were undoubtedly entitled to more than they were getting for their product, and <Col N="166" /> since it was their main revenue it was only natural that they would look for this.  It is quite understandable that they should decide to use it as a political weapon in order to further their own ends in the war with Israel.</P>
    <P>However, there were other people involved.  The multi-national companies of which we hear so much nowadays were very much involved and these same multi-national companies have approximately 80 per cent of our consumer market here.  I shall come to them later.  While I do not consider we have yet overcome this problem of supplies, we can at least be grateful that the weather has been kind to us recently, not only here but throughout Europe.  This has cased the crisis to a great extent.</P>
    <P>The costs of our staggering and childlike actions, as they were, had a more serious effect.  The decision to dismantle the price control on oil which was operating up to 5th of last December, was a grievous error.  I raised this matter in an Adjournment Debate here on 12th February last and I criticised this action in dismantling price control.  The case is a very simple one to understand.  It is of the utmost importance to establish once and for all that the Government have the sole responsibility for the price levels of all petrol products sold and consumed in this country.  Under the control mechanism now in operation these oil companies are obliged to give only seven days' notice of any further price increases.  This has been the case since the 5th of last December.  Once they give seven days' notice the proposed increases are permitted as long as they are in line with what is happening within the outer UK zone.  It is a great flaw in our price control system that this is permitted to these multi-national companies, who, as I have said, have approximately 80 per cent of the outlets for these oil products in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 12th February last on the Adjournment debate stated that the Prices Commission recommended this link with the outer zone of the UK.  On that occasion he quoted an oil company spokesman as confirmation <Col N="167" /> for the need for price increases. He stated that the Arab producers raised their prices on January 1st and that between that date and mid-February our stocks would have been exhausted.  This simply is not acceptable as an explanation.  Is the Minister aware that the price increase of 1st January, 1974, applied at the Gulf or Mediterranean ports of loading and not in the UK or in Ireland?  Stocks held at Whitegate oil refinery and other oil company owned installations amounted to almost 400,000 tons on January 1st.  We have confirmation of this figure from the Ministers for Transport and Power and Industry and Commerce when we were told that we had about 45 days' stock.  The stock levels in the UK at that time were 55 days.</P>
    <P>All these stocks had to be either in the form of crude oil or refined products costing below the price applying at the Gulf or Mediterranean ports on January 1st, 1974.  Allowing for time for loading crude oil into the tankers at the Gulf ports or Mediterranean ports, allowing time for tankers to reach the United Kingdom or the Irish ports with the crude oil, allowing for the refining of this crude oil into refined products, then a minimum of four to five weeks must have elapsed before any product refined from crude oil which had to bear the 1st January price increase reached consumers in this country.  During the period from January 1st to February 9th, 260,000 tons of refined products were landed in Dublin, half of which came from Whitegate and half from British refineries.  During the same period 230,000 tons of crude oil were landed at the Whitegate oil refinery.</P>
    <P>It would have been impossible for any of the refined product shipped into Dublin to have originated as crude oil in the Gulf subsequent to the price increase there on the 1st January.  It is also reasonable for us to assume, having regard to the procedures at Whitegate oil refinery for handling crude oil whereby some trans-shipment from stocks held at Milford Haven occurred that at least 25 per cent of the crude oil arriving <Col N="168" /> at Whitegate would have originated at the loading port prior to the 1st January.</P>
    <P>In addition it must be noted that storage facilities exist in places like Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Waterford, New Ross and perhaps a few other places.  Whilst they may not be large they could also have some stocks which were refined from crude oil shipped from the Gulf or Mediterranean ports prior to the 1st January. It is evident, therefore, that the price control mechanism in this country is not effective at the moment.  If you take the February rise of between £15-£20 per ton on all products you can see that more than 300,000 tons held in stock benefited from this increase. This is an undeniable fact.  I am not saying that supplies were withheld or that stockpiling took place; I am saying that because of these stocks £5 million or £7 million extra profits found their way into the multi-national oil companies because of these stocks and not because of any stockpiling elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have noted a report which has suggested that this increase resulted in a paper profit and that no extra cash could be taken from the business of one company because of the need to pay more money for the higher priced oil at the Gulf after the 1st January.  Of course, there was no increase in the price of oil bought after the 1st January if we are to accept that.  This is only a cash flow exercise on paper and has nothing whatever to do with what should be an ordinary profit and loss statement by such a company as the one involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the profits, there are many interesting disclosures which we can get from American statements by these multi-national companies.  First of all, we had confusion on availability and now we have even more confusion on the price situation.  I want to draw the attention of the Government to some facts which have emerged in other countries which I have already mentioned.  First, every major multi-national company is reporting massive increases in profits at the moment.  Some of these companies have subsidiaries trading in Ireland. One of them has reported an <Col N="169" /> increase in profits of no less than £400 million.  To lessen the reaction from consumers in the United States they are publicly advertising in the American Press the fact that the increase in profits took place outside America, particularly in the European zone.</P>
    <P>I suggest we are only one of these countries which were involved and exploited in this way by these multi-national oil companies.  <i>Time</i> magazine published a report on a Senate hearing in America, at which large oil companies were questioned about their profits.  During the last quarter of 1973, which roughly coincides with the Arab oil embargo, Esso's profits jumped by 59 per cent with a profit of $2.44 billion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is <i>Time</i> magazine of 14th February, 1974, page 34.  This is a statement made by Senator Ribbicoff.  While the consumer is suffering the industry seems to be receiving a bonanza all over the world. When questioned at the Senate hearing a certain oil company which operates here reported 83 per cent increase in profits from oil it bought and sold in Europe and only 16 per cent increase is reported from oil sold in the USA.</P>
      <P>This is what is happening in America.  Also in that country a gentleman called William Simon, who is deputy-secretary of the USA Treasury &mdash;according to <i>Time</i> magazine of January 21st, 1974, page 29&mdash;sent agents to audit the supply price profit and so on, of every refinery in that country.  Knowing the price paid per barrel of approximately $10.30 for Saudi Arabian oil the big oil companies can regulate price increases. The Treasury hope to have some control over this matter in future. Another interesting fact from <i>Time</i> magazine is that the chairman of the parent company of one of the subsidiaries operating here was paid no less than $596,000 salary last year. This is one of the companies that has a large slice of the market here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it can be bought for less and they are buying it for less from Exxon.  However, they are selling it at a good profit here. I quote these facts in order to throw some light on statements made by the oil companies with regard to their operations here.  They claim they are making little or no profit and one of the subsidiaries returned a profit of £15,000 over two or three years recently.  The data I have given is interesting information from the parent companies in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other countries are trying to take some steps to control profits.  For instance, Germany recently reported an alleged price manipulation to the EEC and Japan are endeavouring to control the situation with regard to increased profits to the multi-national companies.  Not long ago they refused to allow the price rises we allowed on 1st January to apply in their country until 31st March next.  Japan is totally dependent on oil, even more than we are, but they stood up to the multi-national companies.  This shows we should have taken some such action and postponed the price increases.  There is no reason to think <Col N="171" /> we would not have got away with it as Japan has done.</P>
    <P>The Government are examining the position in order to see what action they might take to help the sections of the community who are hardest hit.  I should like to draw attention to some matters that require immediate attention.  I refer in particular to people engaged in the glasshouse industry, particularly around Dublin, where there is a substantial investment. In the past these people received considerable grants and were given every encouragement to expand the industry.  This sector require immediate attention in the form of some subsidisation to alleviate the effect of the cost increases.  Countries such as Holland, Germany and Denmark have already acted and Great Britain is considering the matter in order to help people engaged in this industry. They are hard hit and risk the possibility of being put out of business. A long drawn-out investigation will not be of much use to them if immediate action is not taken.  I would impress on the Minister the necessity of giving serious consideration to this problem.</P>
    <P>I have been told that farmers who purchased tractors recently are having considerable difficulty getting their oil quota.  The Minister might look into this matter also.  It might be possible to make special arrangements for many sections in the community. The lessons of the past should guide our future actions.</P>
    <P>Last December I asked for speedy action with regard to extending and improving storage and refining facilities. The Ministers for Transport and Power and Industry and Commerce stated this matter would be dealt with. It is time we were told what action was taken and the result of such action.  I know that the Minister for Local Government consented to the erection of an oil refinery at Bantry, although I believe one Minister afterwards expressed some doubts whether the project would go ahead.  I understand that even if the project goes ahead it is designed for part processing of products for trans-shipment to <Col N="172" /> markets outside this country and that there is no provision in the proposed design to refine petrol.  If that is so, the refinery will not be of any great help to us.</P>
    <P>So far as oil refineries are concerned I am aware that there is a very emotional lobby with regard to environmental matters.  Surely it is possible for the Government, with the experience and advice available to them, to confirm that modern, conventional oil refineries need have no effect on the environment.  A public relations job is necessary in this matter.  I realise oil refineries cannot be hidden but the cost of not having sufficient refining capacity in this country is now being borne by every householder in the increased costs. We must tackle this emotional reaction to oil refineries.  They are necessary if we are to continue with oil as our chief source of energy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that in the short term we are in the hands of the multi-national companies.  This means the Government have identified the problem and it is time they told us what they propose to do in the matter. We use approximately five million tons of refined products, one million approximately being used by the ESB. It is said that this costs the ESB up to £40 per ton and the bill will be £40 million this year.  The average cost to the oil wholesalers is £50 per ton for the remaining four million tons.  We were told in January that the posted price for crude oil was $11.50 per ton but the posted price is not the real cost.  The real cost to the major oil companies for Middle-East crude oil is about 65-70 per cent of that amount and this translates into £20 per ton.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity to examine an industry which requires more than £100 million to transport crude oil, to refine it and to deliver the products to the wholesale trade.  This is something that would bear examination.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the question of storage.  I wonder has the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Transport and Power, whatever Minister whose bailiwick it is&mdash; taken any steps to ensure that further <Col N="173" /> storage is erected here by these multi-national oil companies.  They have fallen in for a bonanza of £5 million to £7 million to which they were not genuinely entitled and the least they might now do is erect more storage tanks.  They can well afford to do that. They cannot whinge about not having money because this money fell into their hands unexpectedly: I should say it was permitted to fail into their hands.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister spell out what the programme is with regard to the erection of refineries?  The people are entitled to know.  We refine only 50 per cent of our total oil requirements and there is no doubt but that we will have to erect more refineries.  Even if the oil comes in as plentifully as is reported we will still need the storage capacity.  I should like to hear from the Minister what is happening.  What has happened since the oil crisis began last November?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister also spell out whether or not we have made any direct approach to some of the Arab oil producing countries and tell us what the results have been with regard to the possibility of securing supply and possibly getting some form of participation in refining the crude oil? These people are said to have big cash reserves.  We might be able to tempt them to invest in refineries here to meet our needs.  What is happening from the point of view of a direct approach to countries like Kuwait and the other oil producing countries?  I understand the ambassador from Kuwait visited this country and had talks with members of the Government. We should like to hear the outcome of those talks.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would also spell out something about the oil finds off our south coast.  What plans are being made for further development by him, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for taking out this oil which is alleged to be there in such large quantity?</P>
    <P>We should also like to hear what the future policy of the Government will be with regard to the Electricity Supply Board which plays such an important part in all our lives.  He might be more specific about an increase <Col N="174" /> in turf production as a means of energy for the ESB.  He might tell us what plans the Government have in the pipeline in regard to the natural gas found off the south coast.  Is it intended that the ESB should be given access to some of this natural gas? Surely that would be a cheap method of producing electricity?  Or do the Government intend to let other interests develop this natural gas into other products?  As far as I know, the ESB would be very interested in having access to this natural gas for the purpose of producing electricity.</P>
    <P>I am sure everybody would like to hear what has happened since the oil crisis started and what plans are now taking shape to ease not only the long-term situation but also the short term situation.  There has been so much talk in the past about storage capacity I am sure some definite plans are now underway.  Storage tanks may be under construction.  As far as I remember our storage capacity was far below that recommended by the EEC.  Their figure was more than twice what our storage capacity was last December, or thereabouts. I expect some definite steps have been taken to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>What steps have been taken to erect oil refineries to ensure that instead of having only 50 per cent of our oil needs refined here we are aiming at having 100 per cent refined.  If that is done we will, like the French, have considerable control over our oil supplies. We could deal directly with the Arab oil producing countries for our crude oil.  We have been told over and over again that they are our friends.  We could buy below the posted price as some of the subsidiaries here buy from their parent companies in the Middle East.  In some cases they buy three dollars below the posted price.  If we had the refining capacity we could buy cheaper and refine the oil ourselves with the help of some State participation.  This is absolutely vital.  In France the biggest oil company has 50 per cent State participation and they are supposed to have over 50 per cent of the market.  They have succeeded in securing their crude oil and they have the <Col N="175" /> refining capacity.  Admittedly we have not got the resources of a country as vast and wealthy as France, but we could aim at refining the other 50 per cent of our total oil needs.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves of the handling of the energy crisis and urges the Government to develop its future energy policy in the light of the experience gained&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of having this debate, though it is perhaps a little bit soon to have it since plans to deal with the energy crisis have not yet been fully formulated. It will take months, possibly years, to bring some of the plans to fruition. I do not think it would be in my interest, the interest of the House or the interest of the nation to say what the plans are at the moment.</P>
      <P>I did not follow some of the figures Deputy Barrett produced.  I hope however that when I see them in the Official Report I will be able to analyse them and see whether or not they make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say something now about the oil refinery.  That is one of the Deputy's points I picked up.  He said one Minister&mdash;I presume he was referring to me&mdash;said he had doubts about whether or not this would be built here.  What I said was that the situation had changed since permission was sought to build a refinery in Bantry and the time the permission was granted in December or January or whenever it was.  The environmentalist lobby in America is as strong as it is here.  For a number of years, because the American Government were squeezing the profits on refineries and because there was this environmentalist lobby there objecting and making it difficult to get permission to build refineries, the American companies, <Col N="176" /> the majors, the multi-nationals, the manipulators of the oil scene, as Deputy Barrett said, were building refineries outside that country and shipping in.  When he says that 100 per cent of the products coming out of Bantry were not destined for Ireland, he is quite right.  In fact none of them was for Ireland.  When it was decided to build an oil refinery there, when planning permission was sought, it was with the idea of supplying the American and the fact that the oil companies and refinery owners complained that the American Government were squeezing their profits so that it was not profitable to refine oil there.  That situation has changed in the last four months.  The environmentalist lobby in America is not as concerned now because they have experienced a shortage of oil.  The panic in America in the buying of petrol and of oil for home heating has been considerably greater than here and lasted considerably longer even though the shortfall in supply was much less than in this country.  It was for that reason I said that the promoters of the oil refinery may now be having second thoughts about it. It may not be as profitable now.  I think I saw in some paper that they intend to make the decision before the end of this month.</P>

      <P>The position, as I understand it, is that they will make a decision before 1st April whether or not they will go ahead.  But I would think they would look at it again in the light of a changed situation from the time they applied for planning permission and received it earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made no change in the oil situation in this country since last March.  The same companies operate here; they operate under the same conditions; anything they are doing now they have been doing for a number of years.  The profit set-up, the company structure, the refining, is exactly the same as it has been for years.  I should have said that before I started.  Whatever the position is now about the price and the availability of oil, there is no doubt that on 16th October, 1973, the organisation of Arab oil producing countries decided they would turn off the tap as regards oil products and, at the same time, try to raise the price.  That is not something I dreamt up or read in the papers.  That is a fact.  They decided they would use the oil weapon.  I do not think I would disagree too much with Deputy Barrett when he says that the price they got for oil up to then was not as high as it should have been.  That may well be so.  But to pretend that this had no effect on us and that we did not have to pay these oil prices just because we are friendly with the Arabs is not being realistic.  The fact is that on October 16th last they deliberately <Col N="178" /> decided to curtail the availability of their oil to consumer countries and put an embargo on the supply of that oil to America and Holland.</P>
    <P>The major oil companies&mdash;there are seven of them in the world&mdash;are extremely complex, multi-layered, multi-national concerns that control the oil from the hole in the ground from which it emanates right to the nozzle of the petrol pump going into the car. They control every stage of the production, transportation, refining and distribution of oil products in many countries of the world.  They decided openly&mdash;they have admitted it&mdash;that even though Britain, and we are part of an integrated market with the United Kingdom, was a favoured nation and should get 100 per cent of her supplies, they would &ldquo;spread the misery&rdquo;&mdash;as they said&mdash;and that they would take non-Arab oil, Syrian, Venezuelian and other non-Arab oils, and give them to the embargoed nations, America, Holland and other countries in the neutral zone which were not getting as much.  They would take this supply from the friendly nations who should get 100 per cent of their requirements and give it to those on whom the Arab nations had imposed an embargo.  There was nothing any nation in the world could do about this.  They had to learn that they had not enough clout to belt the major oil companies.  That was the truth of the situation.  The oil companies made no excuse for this.  In fact they considered they were morally obliged to look after their customers; to see that their American and Dutch customers would get the same level of supplies of fuel oil or of oil products as those countries considered to be friendly to the Arab nations.  We, as part of an integrated market with England, suffered from this shortfall or this &ldquo;spread of the misery&rdquo; as the oil companies called it.  In December, our availability of supplies was down by 15 per cent.  I think Deputy Barrett said that the oil companies took it upon themselves in November to cut supplies of petrol to garages.  If that is what he said it is not true.  On the 16th November I made an order which restricted quantities on a base period from October, <Col N="179" /> 1973 to March, 1974.  This restricted the amount of products that could be given to distributors, wholesalers, garages, or to industry.</P>
    <P>I have been accused&mdash;and Deputy Barrett repeats the figure here&mdash;of making a 45 per cent cut.  Of course, that is nonsense because, as early as the middle of October, I had warned that this situation would arise and that there would be a shortage.  I warned also that anybody who stockpiled, whether it be a garage, distributor or individual, would find himself affected by the orders I introduced and would not be allowed reap the benefit of his stockpiling while other customers would have to be cut in the latter half of the period.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have to defend the decision not to introduce petrol rationing, which has been continually requested.  I think the rest of the world would agree that, in the countries in which it was introduced, it produced far more chaos and panic than it did over roughly three weekends, confined mostly to Dublin.  If any Deputy opposite cares to go around garages or consult the Irish Motor Traders' Association, they will recent endless instances of people coming up demanding petrol, saying they were extremely short and had to visit their sick mother down the country but, when the nozzle was put in their tank, it took only 15p or 20p worth.  Every single garage in the country can recount instances of that nature, of selfish, greedy people who would not leave the petrol there, for essential users of this product and who brought about a situation where doctors, nurses, commercial travellers and so on, found themselves at the end of extensive queues with their day's work ahead of them unable to reach the forecourts of garages. Nobody would disagree that I did the right thing in December in not rationing.  If rationing had been necessary it would have been possible to introduce it.  Certainly the ration books were distributed.  Perhaps an indication of what people felt about rationing was that 70 per <Col N="180" /> cent only of the people entitled to coupons applied for them; of the number of cars and commercial vehicles for which coupons were available only 70 per cent applied for them.  In other words, 30 per cent of the people decided that this situation would not last, that there would not be petrol rationing and they did not bother applying for coupons. That, in a way, is a reflection of the fact that at least 30 per cent of the people felt the decision not to ration was the correct one.</P>
    <P>I said there was sufficient petrol, sufficient oil products in the country and if properly conserved and used, if people cut out unnecessary journeys, if an effort was made in industry, agriculture and horticulture and in every other sector of the community to save specific amounts of fuel then we could get over the hump.  That has been proved to be the right decision. There was sufficient oil for everybody provided they did not waste it.  The price increase of all fuel products and of all energy which has come in the last few months will have its own rationing effect.  It will be much dearer now to drive a car.  The central heating for houses will cost much more.  The cost of running an industry will increase.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of not making available the same allocation of fuel oil as Britain did.  Our allocation was exactly the same as that in England.  In December we both had 85 per cent of what the normal requirements would be.  A number of different products were involved in each case.  The way in which the 85 per cent allocation was used in each country was different.  The prime concern of this Government was that jobs should be preserved and that as many people as possible should keep their jobs for as long as possible.  This was the motivation of the whole Government.  They were anxious to see that people did not lose employment because of the energy crises.  We were successful in that.</P>
    <P>In England a different system was adopted.  They gave a 90 per cent allocation of the petrol used last year Initially we did the same.  A number <Col N="181" /> of associations approached us and said this was causing confusion and asked us to express the percentage as a drop in the availability for the quota period of this year.  One gentleman repeated, even though he was told at least twice, even though he knew the figure was wrong that Britain was getting only a 10 per cent reduction and we were having to suffer a 17½ per cent reduction.  He must have known he was wrong, because it was at that request of his organisation that we related our 17½ per cent to this year, where the British cut of 10 per cent was related to last year and did not allow for an increase in the meantime.  Both allocations worked out the same.</P>
    <P>We gave 100 per cent allocation of oil where it was a basic raw material to manufacturing industry.  That was with the idea of conserving jobs in industry.  We could only do that by cutting down on what other people were using.  We did this in the area of home heating where the restrictions were more severe than those in Britain. We decided people could more easily bear some hardship in the home if a saving in oil in that sector was used to preserve their jobs or those of their neighbours.  This was the correct decision to make.  There were exceptions to the restrictions.  The Ballymun flats were an exception in the area of home heating.  In a number of local authority areas through the country houses have been built without any fireplaces.  People had to be given an adequate supply of oil to heat such houses.  They never got as much as they wanted.</P>
    <P>Last July, when the energy crisis was beginning to be noticeable and people were getting a whisper of an energy scarcity, the Minister for Local Government reserved a decision which had been in operation for a number of years and stated that every local authority house would have to have at least one open fireplace.  There were many houses in the country which were dependent on central heating in one form or another&mdash;gas, oil or electricity. Such heating was based on the use of oil.  These people have to be catered for.  The Minister's decision <Col N="182" /> will mean that if there is a scarcity in the future people will not be so badly off.  When there is a scarcity of heating oil people buy other forms of heat and as a result these other forms become dearer and scarcer.  For many years the demand for coal has been dropping by 7 per cent per annum.  There has been a steady decline in the use of coal.  The coal merchants placed their orders for this winter on the basis of that 7 per cent decline.  When the oil crisis came central heating oil became scarce and people tried to switch to the use of coal fires.  This created a scarcity of coal and raised the price.</P>
    <P>The Polish coal exporting board&mdash; or the Russians, from whom the ESB buy oil&mdash;were not slow to take advantage of the world scarcity of oil and coal.  They increased the price of coal. The Polish exporters have had a contract for a fixed amount per annum until 1980.  They increased their price this winter.  We received an extra shipment in January and that is why coal supplies did not run out.  The price of coal went up by 75 per cent because of the scarcity of oil.  The position about ESB oil is peculiar.  For many years the ESB had had a policy of buying in the open market.  We have had the benefit of that purchasing policy.  The price of electricity in this country has been at a level which was lower than that in many other European countries.  They bought about 50 per cent of the oil they use from the Russians.  They got the oil at extremely competitive prices up to last October. Once the oil became scarce, as businessmen the Russians increased their prices because they obviously could get much higher prices.  The world wanted oil in the last three months of 1973 and the first two months of 1974.</P>
    <P>I spoke on the 11th of December. I had got news that throughout the importing countries for oil products there was considerable confusion and people did not know the position.  The producing nations changed their minds weekly about what they would do. At one stage they announced cuts of 5 per cent per month; at another stage an increase of 5 per cent per month was announced; in December <Col N="183" /> they announced they would double the cut for January.  It was a confused situation.  Information one had one day would be out of date the next day. One could not see further ahead than the next week.  One did not know what price would be asked or what quantity of oil would be available.</P>
    <P>It has been said that I had only the oil companies as a source of information when I spoke in December. That is not true.  I get most of my information from the oil companies because they have 85 per cent of the oil between the three companies in this country.  Eighty-five per cent of the oil products in this country are handled by the three companies and I get information from them.  A member of the Irish Embassy staff in London is in daily contact with the Energy Department in London.  Every week officials from my Department have meetings in the EEC and in the OECD in Brussels.  I have been to London myself to talk to the previous Minister there about the situation.  He was as concerned as I was, and also unable to see into the future about oil supplies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Where was he getting his information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>From the EEC and the OECD also.  They have representation also in the Middle East.  We have not any representation at the moment there.  We have not representation in any of the Arab countries. The British have that further source of information.  When I spoke on the 11th December I said that the information I was getting was that by January the shortfall in supplies would be about 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The order we proposed and which fortunately did not issue&mdash;again Deputy Barrett criticised me for this and said that people do not know until the last minute; that is the way it must be, when information changes so quickly &mdash; for January would have shown a 30 per cent cut.  But on Christmas Day, as many Deputies heard on the news, the Arabs decided they would not make any cut in <Col N="184" /> January.  This was six days before January came.  They decided to double the price.  We were then faced with the choice of continuing with the order for a 30 per cent reduction because we would not get the increased production into our system until the first or second week of February or, taking a gamble, run down our stocks and make the order less severe than it would have been.  That is what I decided to do, to run down stocks, take a gamble and bring in a reduction of only 20 per cent.  Again, this proved to be the right decision.  Our stocks ran down to a very low level at the end of January but have now come up again. We were in a fairly critical supply position at the end of January.</P>
    <P>A further complication in our case arises because half our oil supplies come from the United Kingdom.  One would normally expect that part of the back-up for that half would be held in the United Kingdom, but because that was a foreign country even though in an integrated market we had no way of checking whether these stocks were held for us.  The oil refinery here produces 50 per cent of Irish requirements. They do not make profits here. There is no way of checking on their profits because even though the company is registered in Ireland it is wholly foreign owned.  the Irish refinery is paid a commission to refine 2½ million or 3 million tons of oil every year and give it to the majors. It does not matter what the price of oil is; their profit is exactly the same. If oil prices treble it would make no difference because they would get the same commission for handling the same quantity of oil.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the company to which Deputy Barrett referred to earlier.  For a number of years they have been returning the same minimal amount of profit.  They are not a profit-making company. They act on commission and have no stocks here on which they take profit if the price goes up.  They are owned by the parent company in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I thought I had another seven minutes.  In the case of that company, unless their commission rate changes, if they are putting through the same amount of oil in 1973 as in 1972, their profit remains the same.</P>
      <P>I did not realise it was so late and as I have so little time left I want to quote from page 49 of the National Prices Commission Monthly Report, No. 23 of November, 1973.  The commission is composed of Professor Ryan, Professor of Political Economy; Mr. Liam Connellan nominated by the Confederation of Irish Industry; Mr. Peter E. O'Brien, nominated by the Federation of Trade Associations; Mr. John F. Carroll nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; Mr. Harold O'Sullivan; also nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; and Mrs. Mairéad Allen, nominated by the Irish Housewives' Association. These are the people who decided how oil prices should be fixed in the future.  Their report says in paragraph 77:</P>
      <P>In our view, the aim of price control in present circumstances</P>
      <P>&mdash;this is in reference to oil and petrol prices&mdash;</P>
      <P>should be to make sure that the Irish consumer does not have to pay more than is necessary to ensure the maintenance of supplies.  If the maximum prices were fixed at levels which were too low, petroleum products would not be supplied to this country but would be sold in markets where more lucrative prices could be obtained.  On the other hand, if no control were applied in a situation of scarcity when consumer resistance was low, prices could rise to levels at which Irish consumers were being exploited.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 78 then says:</P>
      <P>We believe that the best arrangement for the coming months</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" />&mdash;I want Deputies to note those words&mdash;</P>
    <P>would be to link the maximum prices of petroleum products in Ireland to those charged in the outer zone of the UK.  We therefore recommend...</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f) on page 50 says:</P>
    <P>that the operation of the recommendations at (a) and (e) above</P>
    <P>&mdash;these are the recommendations I have quoted&mdash;</P>
    <P>should be reviewed by the commission at three-monthly intervals and that during the currency of the proposed new arrangements the companies should provide the Minister with such information as he may from time to time request from them.</P>
    <P>There is a built-in safeguard for the Irish consumer in regard to the price of petroleum products guaranteed by the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>The most conclusive proof I can give the House of our successful handling of this crisis&mdash;it makes the Opposition argument sound extremely hollow&mdash;is that in every single week of 1974 up to last Friday the number of people unemployed has been lower than in the same period in 1973.  In other words, despite the energy crisis &mdash;I do not know how many other countries have been able to do likewise; I should like to know&mdash;in every single week in 1974 fewer people have been unemployed than in the same period last year.  That is proof that we handled the crisis correctly.  It is the final proof of the correctness of our policy of seeing that where oil supplies are available they should be used as far as possible to keep people in employment.  There is the proof that we were successful in that aim.  There will be two other Government speakers later and I shall ask one of them to deal with the future.  I am sorry I did not realise the time had run out.</P>

      <P>I could sacrifice some of my time but the more I listened to the Minister&mdash;and I do not say this facetiously&mdash;the more I was convinced that a motion of this kind was necessary. The longer I listened the less I knew about the reason for all the panic and trouble we have come through and about the future position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall begin by referring to the Minister's final statement.  While there was little change in the employment situation during the crisis I do not think the Minister did anything that would avert serious unemployment. The price rise intervened in time to make supplies sufficiently plentiful. You can get McGreedy roses with oil again.  The price is high enough to justify it.  I see the signs out on some petrol stations today.  We had reached the stage where nobody knew what was happening.  How the Minister can claim that he took any action that did anything to allay the anxiety of a panic-stricken public during that time beats me.  You pulled in at petrol pumps and waited for hours.  Some said they would have petrol now; others said they would have it again. You went away and you found that somebody coming an hour afterwards got petrol.  I saw people engaged in fisticuffs in this city at 8 o'clock in the morning when they had been queueing from 6 o'clock.  Many of these people were private motorists who had nothing to do but go out for the weekend. Supplies for them were not essential.  At the same time, industry was told to cut down.  In spite of what any other country may have done, I do not accept that it would not have been a good thing to introduce rationing here.  The Minister should have ensured that essential industry got its full share to enable it to keep going full-time, irrespective of what the private motorist might say.  He could have stayed home for the weekend and one weekend out of four would have been sufficient for him to visit the golf club.  It was more important <Col N="188" /> to keep the wheels of industry turning.</P>
    <P>I saw boats tied up at Killybegs pier.  I wrote to the Minister's Department and was told that the fishermen should get in touch with the local petrol company.  That was all the information I got.  There were thousands of pounds worth of herring in the sea and the fishermen could do nothing but hope that something would happen the next day which would enable them to get fuel.  We were on the verge of a crisis which was averted only when the oil bosses met in Europe and said that things would improve.  They did but the oil bosses made sure that they would not lose any money on the transaction. Somebody would suffer but it would not be the go-between.  What did the Minister do to ensure that there would not be any exorbitant profits on the charges between the producer and the consumer?  This sort of thing aggravates the consumer.</P>
    <P>As the Minister admitted, at one time the situation looked very serious.  The front page of every national and provincial newspaper carried headlines about a coal shortage, a gas shortage, an oil shortage, oil prices rising and coal prices rising. Machine-won turf was not available at one time.  Everything was collapsing. I expected legislation to be introduced and a state of emergency declared, tax reduced on petrol and VAT removed.  I also expected that the tankers going around the country advertising different companies would be put together as one company, to do one service and one delivery, that petrol would be rationed and coupons given to those who had bought petrol in the past.</P>

      <P>The public are agitated about this and have not yet got any answers.  They blame us <Col N="189" /> because we did not elicit the necessary information as to what happened. There were people who did not get their supplies.  Others tried to run on short time.  The Minister stated that there was no significant reduction in employment.  A rise in employment was bound to take place as a result of the increased number of factories attracted to this country. We have not reached the target which the IDA set for us.  We still have 65,000, 75,000 or 80,000 people unemployed. It is incorrect to say that the handling of the oil situation had something to do with that.</P>
      <P>There are a number of things which could have been done and can yet be done.  At the beginning we were all prepared to accept that the Minister was caught on the wrong foot and knew nothing about supplies, storage, distribution and the quantities we were importing.  We were prepared to accept that as a new Minister he had no experience.  The public were left in ignorance of what the fuel situation was.  Surely enough time has passed and enough petrol has been pumped into the tanks of many vehicles since this shortage began, for the Minister to know better than to tell us that he saw a report in a newspaper recently about something which will happen.  Every Department which has anything to do with energy &mdash;coal, turf, fuel, industry, the provision of oil&mdash;should co-ordinate their services and spell out in black and white what future requirements will be.  If there is a crisis coupons should be issued immediately in order to ensure that essential industries get their supplies.  This has not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against the advice of the economist in the ESB we insisted, for social reasons, on building turf-producing power stations at Arigna.  It had social, national and confidence values for the areas which were being denuded of their population.  We pointed out that there could come a day when we would be glad to have a station using native fuel even though at that time it was less economical.  The day of the roses, medals and so forth at petrol stations could not last forever. The time had to come when somebody would discover that there was more <Col N="190" /> money in oil than was being taken out of it.  The people who produced it saw that they were not getting enough.  Nobody could blame them for that because what they were getting and what we were paying were two very different figures.  When the multi-nationals got together during the shortage they saw an opportunity and exploited it.  It was interesting and revealing to read the evidence of the committee held in Washington which put the multi-national oil bosses in the dock and questioned them.  Out of this catastrophe the only person who was hurt was the consumer.</P>
    <P>We have almost reached a stage where we are made believe that we would be very lucky to get oil at any price.  It could be got under the counter if you were willing to pay enough.  Controls were removed so that the price could be raised without notice.  Then price fixing began and the shortage declined.  Now one can pull in to a garage and ask to have the tank filled.</P>
    <P>What is being done in places like Donegal, Mayo and Kerry where there are ample supplies of peat?  This is a fuel which can compete with any other.  No extra money is being provided for bog roads.  We are told that the price of oil will rise further.  Some of the money could be taken out of oil and used as grants for bog roads. Then our people could get the turf from the bogs.  This would give employment as well as providing a cheap native fuel.  The Minister has not given an undertaking that anything will be done about this.  He spoke about how carefully he manipulated and took a chance with existing stocks and that when the stocks were exhausted we were lucky to get some more.  We were told on a previous occasion by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;in this House, I believe&mdash; that the stocks were allowed to run down so that the dearer fuel would all be coming in at the same time as far as possible and that the cheaper stuff should be exhausted first.  The Minister tells us today that he took a chance and let the stocks run down.</P>

      <P>Many aspects of the crisis were revealing.  I thought the arrangement the ESB had for the purchase of oil was a rather slipshod one. They had no guarantee except some sort of price clause which would permit the suppliers to increase their prices with the shortest possible notice. They had no bulk or quantity guarantee over any period and storage seemed to be lacking.  It is hardly necessary to ask the Minister whether he has put these things right.  I am sure he has.  I am sure he has seen to it that they have three times the storage they had and that their contracting system has been changed, that as far as possible the people who have this valuable contract will supply them, and that we will not have frightening notices to the public. I would have liked to have heard the Labour Party on this side of the House if we were over there when it was announced that ESB charges were to be doubled almost overnight.  There <Col N="192" /> was not a cheep out of one of them. Everything was O.K.  There was nothing to complain about.  I do not think the public will take all this lying down unless they get some better explanation as time goes on.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna, or the Minister or somebody on their behalf made an announcement recently that they are to invest several million pounds in expansion.  I should like the Minister or some other Minister to tell us from what source the money is to be derived. Will it be a public issue?  Are they committed to raise capital from the European Bank or from any other international fund?  When will work get under way?  To what extent will there be expansion and where will the new sites for development be? We are most interested in those things.  Those of us who are not ashamed to come from that part of the country which has some native fuel are interested to know to what extent an urban-minded Government are interested in the affairs of the west of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I would be glad to get it, particularly with regard to the date and the cost and when extra production will be available.  I should like to know whether there will be any further ESB power stations established using Arigna coal.  I have been asking that of people who I thought would be in a position to know and I got the amazing reply that any further stations to be built could not be in Arigna, that they would have to be nearer to Dublin.  I hope <Col N="193" /> that is not correct.  I was told that in order to feed into the national grid they would have to be sited somewhere near this over-expanding capital where you are attracting the people from the west of Ireland to live in poor housing conditions and leave their houses vacant at home.  We would prefer to see industries being provided for them in the places they are leaving.  This is an opportunity to establish further power stations in addition to those in Mayo, in Donegal and Leitrim.  These stations were established thanks to the wise judgment of Seán Lemass and contrary to all the advice available to him at the time from the economists of the ESB.  We would like to have three or four more of these and not to be depending on the Arabs or any of the multi-national magnates to supply us with fuel.</P>
      <P>This motion tabled by Deputy Barrett is a very useful one and may succeed in eliciting some of the information we want.  I am completely disappointed that up to the present no formal approach or no real organised effort has been made to deal with one of the biggest crises that this Government have been called on to meet&mdash;and have failed to handle&mdash; since they came to power just a year ago.  I have occasion to do a good deal of motoring.  We do not like drawing unfavourable comparisons these days between here and Northern Ireland but I could frequently depend on getting my supplies there whereas here you got 50 pence worth and had to drive from one station to another.  At one stage I had a man in Virginia, County Cavan, pleading with me to ask the Minister to introduce rationing because their lives were becoming intolerable.  If they gave only a little petrol, it was no good; but if they gave none at all, it was even worse.  Then suddenly we find that so long as it is dear enough we can get as much as we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with regard to coal came at a very bad time.  There was some explanation given at the time by some of the biggest importers.  I do not think the Minister made any pronouncement on the coal situation at all.  Some of the big importers <Col N="194" /> pointed out that the oil restricted countries had grabbed bulk shipping at prohibitive rates and shipping space was not available except at almost prohibitive cost with the inevitable result of rising prices.  We suffered in Donegal.  In one case the nearest place to which shipping could be got was Galway and the cost of bringing it from Galway to Donegal had to be added to the price of the coal.  Some of the most respectable and best-run business organisations in the county were involved.  There was no question of black-marketing.  They were actually doing with a smaller profit than they had before.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already welcomed the central aspect of this Bill which will speed up the consideration of planning appeals.  This is a very welcome development and the way in which it is being done is very constructive. I have pointed out that the power of the board as regards vexatious references or appeals, in other words the power of the board to deal with what are, in effect, irrelevant or semi-irrelevant appeals, is considerable.  I hope this is used in order to eliminate what I consider to be an unnecessarily high level of appeals in relatively minor applications.</P>
      <P>Section 17 which deals with expenses of appeals is a different matter, and while I would not like to see small groups taking on large combines on appeal, I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the expenses of appeal would not be great.  I should like the Minister to spell this out in more detail.  A valid point has been raised in relation to this.  Nevertheless, by including a monetary aspect in relation to appeal it may help towards eliminating unnecessary appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested earlier that the central element in local planning was the development plan.  I note here that the Minister has referred to this in detail <Col N="195" /> It is my own opinion that if a proper development plan is established and is discussed properly, not only by the local authority but by outside interests before it is amended, this will reduce the necessity for appeal in a number of cases.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased to note that the board, while keeping itself informed in relation to certain policies and objectives which the Minister establishes, national objectives, will maintain a good balance allowing the local development plan to be the central aspect under the Planning Act.  This is a good thing.</P>
    <P>The matter of oral hearings is dealt with quite firmly in this Bill, especially in relation to what one might call minor appeals when an oral hearing is unnecessary.  I was pleased to see that under section 14 of the Bill the board has absolute discretion in this matter.  I take it that the objective of the section is to eliminate oral hearings on what, in effect, are minor appeals.</P>
    <P>The section which deals with the High Court prohibiting unauthorised development is a good one.  There has been unauthorised development, some of major consequence.  I hope the planning authorities will use the High Court in a proper way.  I hope the planning authorities will not hesitate to go to the High Court in relation to a major unauthorised development. Either we are going to have the Planning Act working properly, and being seen to be working properly, or we are not going to have a good Planning Act.  This device of the High Court is a good one if it is used properly.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the limit of duration on planning permission.  Section 25 which deals with this matter allows for a five-year period but I wonder if this period is too long.  It should be borne in mind that the development plan in all areas is revised every five years and if permission is granted and it is not carried out within five years it is possible that developments in that area would have altered the situation. I suggest that the Minister consider a period of three years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> I hope the Minister will consider the question of providing an advisory service at local level and the availability of a highly-qualified consultancy service in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most Members, I welcome the Bill because the previous Act is ten years old.  Living in this age of development, it is natural that any Act which is ten years old should be looked at in the hope that we can improve it.  I should like to pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor for his work during his term of office which was a period of great development.  I am sure the term of office of the present Minister will also be one of development.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his preamble, has adopted a reasonable attitude towards the Bill and what he would like to see himself.  We can all join the general atmosphere on Second Reading of what we would like to see in the Bill ourselves or what we expect from it.</P>
      <P>Any Planning Act, or control, is interpreted by developers, even the man putting an extension on to his house, as being somewhat repressive. He feels it should not be there.  Yet, on reflection, one must agree that unless we have wise planning laws there will be absolute chaos.  Planning laws affect every facet of our living, house building, the erection of offices, the environment and the preservation of green spaces.  Therefore, we should give planning serious consideration so that we can fashion an instrument for good planning and worthwhile progress.  With the experience we have had over the past ten years, we should be able to eradicate many things which were wrong and improve where possible.  Having done that, we should ensure that the laws will be applied fairly and effectively. We can then save ourselves from the mistake which has been made in other countries.  Even though they had planning legislation in other countries there has been a growth of frightful development in major cities. Beauty spots have been ruined because of man's selfishness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first incident of planning control was in the erection of the tower <Col N="197" /> of Babel.  Since that time planners, developers and elected representatives have had to contend with problems arising from and out of planning applications, rejections and approvals.</P>
    <P>It is only right that in the preparation of this Bill the Minister should have placed so much emphasis on the planning board.  From past experience we are all aware that although the laws are just there will be plenty of appeals against them either from those involved in development work or from objectors in the various sections of the community.  I hope this Bill will result in the speedy solution of appeals.  That is the intention but whether the result will be as intended is another matter.  This measure may also have the effect of eliminating appeals being made by people who in many cases are merely being awkward.  It may also prohibit a developer who has been granted approval for a project being in a position, either through ignorance or prejudice, of ignoring the plans and proceeding to carry out the work in his own way.  These, then, are some of the major points of the Bill.  In the age in which we are living the question of planning is of great importance. We are living in the era of the giant motorway and of a fast increasing population.  Our population figures may never reach what they were, say, 150 years ago, but they are growing rapidly.  Therefore, our planning laws must be designed so as to cater for all these developments. Mistakes have been made in respect of road construction, especially in the newer suburbs of this city where the roads are very narrow.  At some time in the future a lot of money will have to be spent in widening them because they will not facilitate the increasing volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider having one planning authority for the greater Dublin area and also for such places as Cork, Galway and Limerick.  At present the position in respect of Dublin is that if the corporation wish to build houses in the county council area they must apply to the county council for permission. These other cities I have mentioned <Col N="198" /> will also expand rapidly in the future.</P>
    <P>Regarding the planning board, perhaps the Minister would spell out more clearly, first, the board's terms of reference and, secondly, the qualifications that he has in mind in respect of the personnel to be appointed to the board.  I am not suggesting that there should be only architects or engineers on the board.  The important point is that the members should have practical experience.  Of course, the local government laws provide that a member of a local authority cannot be appointed to any such board, at least not for some years after retirement, but we must ensure that people of experience are appointed to the board and that these include a person who has had some experience of local authority work either as an official or as a member.  Now that so much emphasis is being placed on the question of equality for women it would be a good idea to appoint to the board a woman so that her point of view could be brought to bear on development, particularly on development in urban areas.  The mother of a family would be aware of the amenity requirements in her area.  She would be in a position to put forward her views on what would make for a better environment both for mothers and for their children in so far as playgrounds and so on are concerned. Priority should be given to the preservation of open spaces and to the provision of playgrounds.  It would be difficult to make a planning decision that would not draw unfavourable comment from somebody but we must do our best.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see more than three members being appointed to the board.  I would suggest also that as a gesture towards decentralisation the board, should not sit all the time in Dublin but be more like the Circuit Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The board will have to be enlarged in the future because of the number of appeals that will come before it.  If the economy remains buoyant there will be more development and, consequently, more appeals.  In order to speed up these matters it will be necessary to consider a diversification of the board's activities and to consider also their location.  To have the board located in different areas would help to convince people of attempts being made towards decentralisation.  We must realise that Dublin is not Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now is the time to consider very seriously this question of the board and their activities so as to ensure that there will be no weak link in the part of the legislation that we are endeavouring to strengthen.  The only reservation I have regarding this board is the question of whether it is possible to have a national planning policy when the Minister does not have complete control over the functions of his Department.  It may not be in the best interest of the nation in the long-term that the Bill should be passed as it is now before us.  It may well be that if it is passed in its present state it will result in damaging the national planning policy.  The board that the Minister is proposing to set up will be very powerful.  Unless the personnel appointed to it are selected very carefully, the board could be the cause of grave miscarriages of justice.  If we do not ensure that this board is manned by people of high integrity and ability, it could turn out to be a Frankenstein in planning matters.  I am glad to see in sections 21 and 22 that the Minister is taking power to stop unauthorised development.  The bane of our lives in recent years has been the people who would flout all planning regulations if they could.  I refer to the grave suburban problems <Col N="200" /> caused by the conversion of good family single dwellings into multi family units, with up to nine people living in bedsitters in houses which were designed to accommodate three or four people.  This has meant the destruction of entire suburbs because families left behind, grossly affected by noise and all-night parties, have been selling out at cheap rates and moving elsewhere.  There has been a consequent destruction of entire suburban communities and there has been, as well, a general deterioration of property.  This new way of life has been affecting English towns and cities and we have a lot to learn from it.</P>
    <P>Local authorities must have sufficient trained personnel to enable them to stop this blight.  I appeal, therefore, to the Minister to provide for more planning staffs for local authorities.  In this city we have always seemed to be short of competent planning officers and the men we have are completely overworked. With our population approaching one million, there is a great need for more inspectors, not as punitive officers but as advisers on good planning. We need them particularly to see to it that there is no unapproved development.  As I have said, we do not need these people to act as policemen but as experts who will give advice.  This, in turn, would lead to greater development in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>So far I have concentrated on housing because it is so basic to good planning.  Planning is also needed to preserve the amenities that we have or that we had up to a few years ago Because of industrialisation and less emigration, greater strain has been placed on our seaside resorts.  You have a type of person who wants to build a house on the foreshore.  The previous Minister ensured that there could not be development between a coastal roadway and the sea front.  On the other hand, we must ensure complete freedom of access to the sea shore in every coastal area and we must safeguard private individuals against arbitrary actions by feudal lords and feudal laymen who would <Col N="201" /> try to bar our people from access to the sea or charge them for that access.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have moved with Wicklow County Council to ensure that there will be free access to the sea in County Wicklow where the mass of Dublin people go for re-taxation. Now with our people becoming more affluent and having more leisure, it will be necessary to conserve further the open spaces in our countryside so that the natural beauty of our island will be preserved for the benefit of our people whose quality of life will thereby be immeasurably improved.</P>
    <P>It may sound grandiose to be talking like this but I should point out that most of what has happened in the matter of bad planning has taken place in the last ten years.  Up to the introduction of the 1963 Act it was difficult to stop people destroying an area or a street.  The 1963 legislation did tremendous work and the Bill before us now is a measure to amend and to improve on the earlier Act. Through this Bill we can retain the best parts of the existing Act and add to it or amend it as necessary.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems facing us is the disposal of city refuse.  As city populations increase, the disposal of domestic refuse takes on massive proportions and the problem is whether it can be solved by incineration. I am glad to say that in the city here many of our old quarries which used to be death traps for young people have been converted into playing fields but we do not have an unlimited supply of these places.  The local authorities, looking at their planning proposals for the future, will, in the next ten or 20 years, until we find a sophisticated way of destroying litter, have to plan to contain this rubbish somewhere. It is another headache which an affluent and developing society gives to us.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in our local planning offices and by direction of the central authority, we should try to educate people into the higher concepts of planning.  If we are going to have <Col N="202" /> beautiful cities and towns and a beautiful countryside, this is probably the biggest problem facing society today. We may have a housing shortage but housing development has by no means been on a small scale.  At least we have got rid of most of the slums in cities and towns.  Although we will have a housing shortage for many years, the standard of housing is a lot better than it was up to this.  Housing alone would keep any planning authority with enough work but housing is only one part of living.  While it is a very basic need, we must ensure that planning will be of the highest order and strive not to create a lot of asphalt jungles but suburbs and towns of real beauty.</P>

      <P>People will look at this and say that, in the last analysis, the Minister has the power to do this.  As Deputy Molloy has said, we are reviewing the 1963 Act and our cities are growing so fast that, as I am sure the Minister realises, we shall have to put the very best into our planning legislation or else we will be ashamed in a few years' time that we did not take the opportunity of correcting some of the abuses such as unapproved development.  If our legislation does not aim at the stars, then I cannot see the developers raising their standards very high.</P>
      <P>I think the few points I put forward bear examination and possible rejection but the Minister should at least have a good look at this planning board before this Bill is finally adopted.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to congratulate the Minister on the directive he has already sent out to planning authorities which has made things easier for a person who wishes to provide a house for himself and his family.  I hope there will be an overall plan for development in rural areas.  In some places the requirements for a man who may wish to build his own house seem to be somewhat different from those in other places.  A person may have available to him a cottage plot belonging to his father, a large part of which is waste in modern times because it is not economic to use it for farming as in former years when horses were used to till the land.  Therefore, the land which is lying idle is made available to a son or daughter who in the normal course of events would be expected to look for local authority housing but who, by means of local authority loans, is prepared to provide his or her own house.  Our planning laws should be designed to facilitate the obtaining of planning permission in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> The health authorities come into this matter of planning permission in rural areas in connection with septic tanks and so on and we find there are different criteria in every area.  If people have the normal space in the plot in which to place a septic tank and if they conform otherwise with the regulations for grants and so on, they find that sometimes the medical officer or the health inspectors may be looking for half an acre for the house.  This puts the ordinary person in the position that he cannot build on the site which has been so easily provided.  In many cases this is unrealistic and unfair.</P>
    <P>Enough cognisance is not taken of the fact that this person is building a house and is complying with the various regulations laid down by the Department about the distance his septic tank should be from that house and any other house.  This man finds that a medical officer states that he must have a half acre of land for proper septic tank drainage.  The type of drainage in the land on which this house is built is not taken into account.  I wish to thank the Minister for all he has done in this direction. He has tried to get it across to local authorities that these applications should be looked at in a favourable light and that the regulations should not be made impossible for those people.  We should bend over backwards to assist the person who builds his own house.  We should ensure that a fair criterion is used in applying planning legislation and that we will not have people looking for half an acre for septic tank drainage in one case and a quarter of an acre in another case.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but the Bill we are dealing with is seeking to establish a planning board which will deal with appeals.  It will not take from local authorities the functions they still enjoy in the matter of planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point, Sir, but I submit that many of the people I have mentioned come to appeal at this stage.  I believe this is <Col N="205" /> one of the reasons the Department is cluttered up with appeals.  I welcome this section which sets up the board to deal with planning appeals because, no matter what political party the Minister for Local Government belongs to, he can be accused of political favouritism if he has the sole power in regard to appeals.  Clear directives should be laid down with regard to these matters so that a person will know when he is likely to win an appeal and when it is useless for him to appeal.</P>
      <P>Something should be done about the case of a developer who goes into an area and gets permission under certain conditions to erect houses but after ten or 15 years we find that that area is not completed and the people who bought houses in the early stages of that development find they have no redress because the development is not completed.  They are left for a long time without the amenities which originally were to be part of this development.  People should have the right to force the developer in such a case to finish the scheme and provide the amenities to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>When a person goes to an appeal board it is like going to a court of appeal.  If it was a legal battle you would know if you had a chance of success.  When you go to a planning appeal board you should also know if you have a chance of success.  I have a feeling that planning applications are not dealt with on an even basis throughout the whole area.  Therefore many appeals come before the Minister which would not be necessary if we had a standard set of rules governing planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle which the Minister has introduced into this Bill to provide for an independent board to hear planning appeals.  It states at the beginning of this Bill that it is a Bill entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>an Act to make better provision in the interests of the common good in relation to the proper planning and development of cities, towns and other areas, whether urban or rural <Col N="206" /> and for that purpose to establish a body to be known as An Bord Pleanála and to define its functions and to amend and extend the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 and to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>I am a bit confused about that because I understood this measure was primarily to deal with appeals and not the overall planning of the country.  What I read out would suggest that this board would be armed with powers to make for more comprehensive planning for the whole country.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with that point when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I share the feelings expressed by previous speakers about the necessity of the Minister and the Government making appointments to this board which are free from all political coloration. When one has regard to appointments made by the present Government in other spheres one has an uneasy feeling that the appointments the Minister may make may not be in the best interests of the country as a whole and perhaps may be subject to ministerial direction.  The Minister should have defined the qualifications of the people he proposes to appoint to this board.  He has mentioned three people but it is strange that he should say that the chairman of the board would be appointed by the Government and that the Minister would later on appoint two other people.  Perhaps names could be submitted by members of the Cabinet.  We do not know because it has not been spelt out in this Bill.  There could be public disquiet about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is entitled to his opinion, as I am entitled to mine.  I agree in principle with the formation of an independent board but I should like clarification from the Minister on the matters I have mentioned.  It is not stated specifically in the section that it relates only to appeals; it relates to developments generally and in my view the rest of the Bill is in conflict with that.  When making appointments to the board I hope the Minister will go outside the sphere of political influence and patronage and seek the highest qualified people. Perhaps he would consult some of the foremost legal and planning experts to ensure that those appointed are fully qualified for their task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board have taken on a lot.  The Minister has mentioned he is dealing with 4,000 appeals.  He does not tell us whether the greatest proportion comes from Dublin or other areas. Between now and Committee Stage he might consider setting up a regional appeals board which could <Col N="208" /> communicate with the board he intends to appoint, thus expenditing the hearing of planning appeals.  The entire planning appeals system is being centralised in the Custom House, or whatever office may be designated, and this puts an unfair burden on people from the provinces who may have to travel to Dublin to give evidence at oral hearings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not spelled this out in the Bill.  He is concerned merely with setting up the board.  The Minister has not indicated what staff will be needed.  Is it envisaged that a new planning appeals department will be set up and, if so, how will it be staffed?  Whatever planning authority are responsible for Dublin city, some of us are distressed at the mutilation of the city, at the featureless buildings being erected which take away from the traditional architecture.  Whoever is appointed to the board should be skilled in planning and architectural science and they should have a cultural tradition that would ensure the preservation of what is best in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention one matter in the proposed legislation that disturbs me.  I am happy the Minister has introduced the Bill and I am content with practically everything contained in it.  The point I shall make may seem strange in that I am on the record of this House as having advocated that there should be a fee for planning applications. I remember saying that if a person must pay a fee for a passport or for a birth or baptismal certificate I thought it strange, having regard to the amount of time and the expertise involved in planning applications, that no fee was charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that it may seem rather peculiar that I shall now refer <Col N="209" /> to section 17, under which it will be possible for the board to direct that a person who lodges an appeal against a planning permission may be required to pay the costs of the appeal.  I am thinking of a working-class man who might find himself in a position where a powerful operator, a speculator or a developer, had got planning permission for a development which deprived him of his rights.  If he wishes to appeal he will know that if the appeal runs for a certain length of time and if the developer, as he is entitled to, engages the best and most expensive expertise the man in question might be obliged to pay the total cost.  Provision for that is made in section 17.  I know the section says the board may decide that the appellant must pay the cost. That is bound to be very inhibiting in the case of a prospective appellant who could be reminded of the financial risk he was running if he dared appeal against a permission which has been granted to a company like Guinness, Esso or some other big monied company.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the reputation of being concerned for the individual rather than for big business so I would appeal to him to have a second look at this section and to strengthen in some way the right the board will have to waive the collection of costs in cases where they regard the objection as <i>bona fide</i> and made by an individual who felt his rights had been trangressed, not just made out jealousy, annoyance or frustration. We all know the power of the dollar and the power of the pound and there is an obligation on us to ensure that a man's inability to pay will not deprive him of his constitutional rights.  Section 17 appears to me to weigh in favour of the person who has the capacity to pay rather than in favour of the person on whose side right exists and I am suggesting to the Minister that he should reconsider the content of that section.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer the Minister to a communication from his Department directed to local authorities. <Col N="210" /> It is dated 12 Samhain, 1973.  It refers to what are described as planning control problems.  The Minister in his customary industrious fashion was apparently concerned that in his office there was an accumulation of appeals.  He was also mindful of the fact that the fashion had grown up in local authorities where, if there was any element of doubt, they rejected the application and informed the applicant of his right to appeal to the Minister and, because of that, there was an accumulation of appeals which could, perhaps, have been avoided.  I wonder, however, if that justified what the Minister indicated as his policy in the document to which I refer.  If planning refers to anything, it refers surely to the maintenance of high standards, not just high standards in high places but high standards in every place.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of this age in which we live seems to be an almost chronic anxiety to reduce everything to the lowest common denominator. I think that it is even happening in the case of religion.  Whether the maintenance of the correct standards causes a certain botheration to a Minister, an individual or a public representative, the fact is that the price that has to be paid for the maintenance of high standards is never cheap and it would be unwise of us here to accept that we should at any time sacrifice perfection or high standards for speed or any other consideration.</P>
    <P>I would be happier if on occasion the Minister came before the House and was accused of having before him thousands of undischarged appeals and he made the honest defence that the delay arose because of his concern that there should be no departure from the high standards to which local authorities and his Department aspired and that he was adamant that there must at no stage be any departure from them.  If the Minister does not aim at the highest, there will always be the danger that those who might be regarded as his subordinates will adopt much lower standards.  The local authority to which I have the honour to belong have already indicated to the Department that they <Col N="211" /> should not, whatever the consequences, be asked to lower standards.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to make &mdash;and I do so very mindful of the fact that I may be foolish in inviting comment from you that I may be out of order&mdash;is to say how disappointed I am that this legislation does not contain provision for a matter which years ago may not have been regarded as directly affecting planning but which, to me today, should be included in any legislation aimed at preserving, protecting and raising aesthetically the standard of our environment.  There are certain roads in every part of Dublin today, and roads on the perimeter of the city, where there is indiscriminate and scandalous dumping which, more than the worst type of planning application that might be allowed, tends to destroy that aesthetic appearance we would all like to achieve.</P>
    <P>Again, Sir, I am glad you anticipate that I am not anxious to do any more than comment on it.  I know too, that the Minister, as he journeys into the city, may have noticed the appalling situation obtaining.  I suggest that perhaps some morning as he drives in, whether it be the Navan road or the Ashbourne road, he might turn right or left and travel a mile or two of the secondary roads to see what is happening to the surroundings and environment. Perhaps he intends catering for it.  under some other legislation.  Perhaps in this legislation he might give power to the local authority for the moment and, later, to An Bord Pleanála to deal with all people, individuals and firms, guilty of this appalling practice in a fashion which would prevent its recurrence, its growth and, above all&mdash;apart from appearances sake&mdash;safeguard the people of this city and of other areas where it occurs against the inherent dangers in the matter of good health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully):</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Members of the House who took part in the debate for the way in which they dealt with the various items, whether or not some of them <Col N="212" />&mdash;like the last made by Deputy Tunney&mdash;were slightly away from what I would consider to be normal planning.  I am not blaming him; I abhor as much as he does the practice of indiscriminate dumping. Again and again I have called upon the local authorities, who are directly responsible for dealing with this matter, to give it their earnest attention.  Many of them have done so.  As a matter of fact, Deputy R.P. Burke some time ago rather abused me at a meeting of Dublin County Council for having the temerity to suggest that that council were not doing everything they could about this sort of thing, that they did not need any direction from me.  Deputy Tunney has just said&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;not alone do Dublin County Council, but many other local authorities require reminders that they are solely responsible for seeing that this sort of thing is looked after. As a result of what Deputy Tunney has said I hope to send a further reminder. Coming into the summer we do not want to have a continuation of this.  I apologise for dwelling on it but, since it was raised and is an important matter, I merely wanted to make that comment.  I am not objecting to the fact that Deputy Tunney raised it because it is very important.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Timmons adopted the line which he did adopt. He was the only Deputy who did so.

      <P>One deals with general criticisms but one does not read section 1, section 2, section 3, section 4, and so on, as was done by some Deputies who went through it in this manner as if they were dealing with it on Committee Stage.  I am not objecting.  In most cases, the criticism was constructive. But it would have been better for all concerned had they made general comments and left points they felt they would have to make again on Committee Stage.  Some of the points were very valid.  Most of the criticism centred around the board and fell into three main headings: provision was not made for a large enough minimum membership of the board; the qualifications of the members of the board and particularly of the chairman; and the independence of the board.  Deputy Molloy said that the Minister should consider having a minimum of four members.  He said that if one of the members of the board of three was ill the two left could be swopping each other's recommendations.  That is not very complimentary to the members. The Deputy meant that if two members were left they could say to each other &ldquo;If you let this one through, I will let your one through&rdquo;.  I do not think they would do that.  The Deputy also made the point that in the case of small boards one member might be dominant.</P>

A board of four or possibly six members was advocated by Deputy R.P. Burke.  He also said that he did not think it right that two people should control the development of an area.  Let me repeat something I said.  This does not take away from the right of the planning authorities to decide on the planning applications in their own areas.  From what a number of Deputies said it appeared that they felt that the board would deal with all the planning applications.  They will deal with planning appeals.  Anyone who came in and heard that being said might get an idea that that was so.  Deputy R. P. Burke was here all the time.  Perhaps I misunderstood him.  By no <Col N="216" /> stretch of the imagination could two people be dealing with the whole development of an area.  The board would be dealing only with appeals.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy thought that the Minister should make provision that the qualifications of the various members of the board should be regulated at least by regulations made under the Bill.  He referred to the qualifications which the Minister lays down for managers.  Deputy R.P. Burke thought that members of the board should go before the Civil Service Commission.  Deputy F. O'Brien and Deputy R.P. Burke thought that the chairman should be a judge.  Deputy Callanan did not share that view, but turned his face against faceless people deciding people's appeals.  Deputy Callanan would prefer a Minister who would be responsible to the people.  This view, which seems to be on all sides of the House, shows that the Bill was being approached by each Deputy as he saw it.  I would like to hear comments because this is the way to ensure good legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore thought that the board should include a woman whose outlook on urban development might be useful.  Her outlook on any development might be useful.  Deputy Timmons found something wrong with the suggestion that the chairman of the board should be appointed by the Government while the Minister would appoint the members.</P>

      <P>Deputy Timmons does not know that every board like this since the State was founded has been appointed in that way.  This is the normal practice.  There is no ulterior motive in the wording of this section. It is like the wording in many other Bills which I have introduced, where I fell back on Fianna Fáil wording and Deputy Timmons did not find anything wrong with that.  I believe the wording is right.  The decision of the last Government, the present Government and future Governments to do things like that is correct.  The wording in future Bills will probably be &ldquo;the chairman will be selected by <Col N="217" /> the Government and the members will be selected by the Minister&rdquo; if the Minister has that right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I have invited them.  I will try to keep it on a one-man basis from now on.  The Minister is responsible to the House for the appointments.  There are many boards which I do not want to mention which have quite an important effect on the living standards of our people and they have been appointed in this way. The most recent was the board concerned with nuclear power.  That Bill went through without criticism.  It only happens to be wrong here because Deputy Timmons says it is wrong.  It was said by various Members that sections 4 and 5 took away the independence of the board.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney referred to changing standards.  With the exception of Deputy Molloy and Deputy Tunney, everybody else thought that the circular of the 12th November was the greatest one that had been issued with regard to planning since the Planning Bill was introduced.  Deputy Tunney said I had lowered standards. If the Deputy reads the circular he will find that no effort was made to lower standards.  The circular suggested that common sense should be used.  This was not the first circular which went out from the Department of Local Government.  My predecessor, Deputy Molloy, and his predecessors had written to the local authorities suggesting that there should be a relaxation of the way in which they were dealing with planning applications and no attention was paid to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I followed up my circular by having county managers, planning officers and county engineers up to the Custom <Col N="218" /> House where we had a frank discussion of what they thought was the proper way of handling this.  They agreed that the circular was something they needed.  The instructions they got were something they had been waiting for and have been carried out.  Far from lowering standards the opposite is the case.  In certain cases people who were getting away with things have been prevented from doing so.  The planning officers know where they stand.  There is no ambiguity.  Instead of preventing some fellow who found it difficult to get a site and for some flimsy reason turning him down, they can now give permission.  They understand that is so. If a big developer attempts to put 120 houses where he got permission for 100 houses he will not be allowed to do so.  The circular told local authorities what was expected of them.  They were glad to get the information and have acted on it since.  The results are there for all to see.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty spoke about the need to help people provide homes for themselves and a number of other Deputies, including Deputy Callanan and Deputy Crowley, made this point also and they, in fact, welcomed the circular.  I thing Deputy Molloy was being a little inconsistent when he queried the words &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; in section 14 which gives the board absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing on an appeal.  He thought this deprived people of their rights and that the board should not be able to discriminate between one citizen and another. Without committing myself in any way I should point out that practically every decision of the board will be a decision as between one citizen and another or between one citizen and the local authority.  However, the Deputy's point will be examined.  I think he was having an each-way bet and I would again point out that there is no question whatever of doing what he says. If instead of putting in &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo;, we say that the board should have the right to decide whether an oral hearing was necessary, or something like that, I am sure Deputy Molloy would agree this would be quite reasonable but because the words <Col N="219" />&ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; are there he feels perhaps this was a stronger way of putting it and going a little too far. I do not think it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the section is too open as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have a look at it; I do not think it is.  I believe the section, in fact, allows the board to decide whether an oral hearing is necessary or not.  As Deputy Molloy must remember&mdash;and as I know now &mdash;many times people will appeal, particularly in the case of third party appeals, and when it is almost at the point of decision the third party will ask for an oral hearing for no reason except to hold up the appeal.  There are cases on record, even in my short time of 12 months, where people having asked for an oral hearing at the last minute when the oral hearing was set up, did not even turn up.  But they effectively prevented a decision on the appeal for periods of up to 12 months.  If we have a decent board, as I believe we shall have, they should have the right to decide, if something like this was happening, whether or not to allow an oral hearing.  It occasionally happens that one business man wants to do something and another also wants to do the same thing and appeals in an effort to prevent the first fellow from getting a head start.  This occasionally happens. In the case of housing, it is not unusual to find if there are two housing schemes in an area, one scheme having got permission, an appeal from a third party arrives, a third party who appears to have no connection with the matter at all.  He is entitled to make an appeal and can ask for an oral hearing and at present can hold up the whole scheme for an indefinite period although he has no right to interfere, having no connection with either one scheme or the other and in many cases does not even live in the district.  This is a sharp practice that should be abolished and I believe this is the way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy R.P. Burke did not seem to share the views of other Deputies <Col N="220" /> as to the independence of the board He thought there should be control over the board by members of the Oireachtas and asked me to provide for this by amendment of the Bill and perhaps provide that there should be an annual debate on the work. Instead of the power of the Oireachtas actually to fix the schedule which gives the Government power to remove a chairman and provides that it must lay before each House a statement in writing of the reasons for the removal, Deputy Burke thought the removal of a chairman should be debated on a motion before the House.  These are the divergent views of Members even on the same side of the House.  It is well that these views should be expressed and I have no objection to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I expressed fairly similar views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not exactly. Deputy Molloy suggested that there was too much control by the Minister and that he could interfere because of the way in which it was framed.  Deputy Burke said the direct opposite, that there was not sufficient interference by the Minister and that the Minister should have no authority and that the House subsequently should have the right to debate the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore thought the board might turn into a Frankenstein dominating the lives of the people and he spoke about the national planning policy.  That policy will, as always, be laid down by the Government and will be carried out without interference by this board when it is set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another Deputy said he had listened to the speeches and was surprised that they merely dealt with the setting up of a planning board.  As I said in my opening speech, and as any body who read the Bill will understand, the Bill falls into three main amendments of the existing Act, those relating to the establishment of new machinery for dealing with planning appeals and similar matters; those for strengthening the provisions of the Act of 1963 relating to unauthorised <Col N="221" /> development and miscellaneous amendments some of a relatively minor nature.  The amendments relating to the establishment of machinery to deal with planning appeals are the most important part of the Bill.  This is what I said at the beginning and this is so.  It is not true to say the Bill simply dealt with one aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of people suggested different qualifications for membership of the board.  I have an open mind on this.  It has been suggested that the chairman should be a judge and it was also suggested that he should not be a legal man and that if we had too legalistic an approach we might spoil the whole idea.  I have laid down that Members of the Oireachtas or members of local authorities cannot be members of the board.  I think this is right and that they should at least have that freedom.  But some Deputies have asked that ordinary people with a knowledge of local authority work should be included and somebody referred to the possibility of using ex-members or ex-employees of local authorities.  I should like to hear this matter debated further on the Committee Stage.  We want a Bill that will work and when it becomes an Act do the job it was intended to do.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I was not here for it, but I think Deputy Molloy did say that this was his Bill.  At least somebody said that this was the Bill which Deputy Molloy had prepared&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should read what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest I misquote the Deputy, I myself afterwards heard him say that he was criticising the Bill; obviously, it was not one he prepared. I should like to put on record, because I think it is important, that in 1967 a Private Members Bill-I think it was a Fine Gael Bill&mdash;was before the House.  It was withdrawn on the promise of the then Minister for Local Government that he was about to bring in a planning Bill to amend the 1963 Act.  He was there for a considerable time afterwards and was followed by Deputy Molloy but no Bill was debated.  This day 12 months ago I <Col N="222" /> became Minister for Local Government. That may seem a long time ago but the Bill is now before the House and while a considerable amount of work had been done on it in 1967 and 1968, after that nothing was done until last year when I asked to have it brought up to date.  Portion of the Bill now before the House was, in fact, dealt with by a previous Minister but it certainly is not Deputy Molloy's Bill and a Bill was not introduced, as it could have been many times over the last four or five years.</P>
      <P>Suggestions have been made from time to time that in some way we are at present rushing planning appeals and because we are dealing with a big number&mdash;nearly 600 as against 120 which was the average a few months ago, or certainly less than 12 months ago&mdash;that we are rushing to get some out before the appeal board was set up. As far as I am concerned the planning appeals coming before us are being dealt with as quickly as possible. There were far too many there when I took office.  For some extraordinary reason appeals, some difficult, some not so difficult, were left to one side and were not finalised.  We are trying to clear this up and when the new board are set up we will be able to hand over a reasonably clear sheet. When the board come into being any appeals still outstanding in the Department will be handed over to them.  I assure the House that any planning appeals are being dealt with on their merits and I am sure the new board will continue to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crowley suggested that evidence should be available as to why planning appeals were turned down and that the new board should continue along those lines.  The law says that reason must be given for refusals.  I assume that this will continue to be so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Callanan asked for a definition of &ldquo;amenity&rdquo;.  There is no statutory definition of &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; in the planning code, but the Third Schedule of the Planning Act, 1963, indicates what is meant by &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; for the purpose of the Act.  This is rather technical but if anyone likes to go through it he will find that it is covered fairly well there.</P>
      <P>I have covered as briefly as I could the various items mentioned by Deputies. I am sure there are a number of points which were mentioned which I have missed out.  A number of Deputies repeated what others have said earlier.  Firstly, I believe the Bill is one which can be improved on Committee Stage.  Secondly, I will welcome amendments by Deputies from any side of the House.  If Deputies feel that their amendments will improve the Bill we can debate them.  Thirdly, the setting up of the board is a very serious matter.  Serious consideration should be given by every Deputy as to what he thinks would be the ideal board and the way in which they should work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise also, that this is a Bill setting up a board and it is not interfering with the existing power of the planning authorities at local <Col N="224" /> level to carry out their work.  In fact, it gives them more power.  I was surprised that this point did not get more attention from Deputies.  From time to time, people have complained that there were no teeth in the 1963 Act and law breaking was not being dealt with in the proper way.  We are putting teeth into this legislation and are suggesting fairly harsh penalties. Deputy R.P. Burke felt that a £100 fine was not enough.  He omitted to say that it was £100, or six months, or both, and I think this is a substantial penalty.</P>
    <P>I will deal with fees for applications and appeals.  I envisage that fees would be nominal.  The opinion held by a number of Deputies is that there should not be any fees.  If this is debated in the House and it is the opinion of the majority, I am prepared to accept it.  I believe it would help if there were nominal fees included.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney referred to the payment by somebody who makes an appeal, particularly a frivolous appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney:</NameTxt>
      <P>A serious appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>A serious appeal does not matter.  There is no danger whatever because this is provided for.  Section 17 deals with frivolous appeals. Section 18 of the 1963 Act deals with the same matter.  That provision has not been used very much, if at all. When that Bill was going through the House, Deputy Blaney who was then Minister for Local Government, made the comment that he felt sure that if there was any reasonable approach made by somebody who had an appeal in, he would not be stuck for damages as suggested.  The same applies here.  When we come to Committee Stage we will see that this is not a Draconian section which was put in to punish the small man who is having &ldquo;a go&rdquo; at the big man.  I would deplore that very much and will do what I can to ensure that that cannot happen.  There should be some way of dealing with frivolous appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my time I have seen too many cases coming before the Department in which the appellants do not bother to turn up when the appeal is being <Col N="225" /> heard.  They have wasted the time not only of the people they are appealing against but also of the Department and the officials.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore and Deputy Timmons mentioned moving the board around as is done with the Circuit Court.  At present appeals are heard in convenient places.  They are not all heard in the Custom House, as Deputy Timmons thought; they are heard there for the Dublin and surrounding areas because it is a convenient place.  If it is convenient for the people from the country to come, as they often do, to Dublin, then the appeal will be held in the Custom House.  Appeals are held in various centres throughout the country.  If the number of appeals continue as they are, we could find that we would need more than two or three courts until they are cleared.  This would be very expensive.  This matter will have to be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Again, let me thank the House for the manner in which they have dealt with the Bill.  I hope the discussion right through to the final stage will be on the same level as it has been today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few questions to ask the Minister.  He made no reference in his reply to the points I raised about the special consideration to be provided by way of amendment to this Bill for development in Gaeltacht areas.  Why did the Minister not consider this worthy of inclusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy must know that this will be dealt with in the development plan for the Gaeltacht areas.  The Department of the Gaeltacht has been discussing with the Department of Local Government certain changes which will be in operation very shortly.  Deputy Molloy can be assured that the matter is being well looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at that because I understand that the only legislation controlling development is the Planning Act and that we will need to amend the Planning Act if special consideration is to be given <Col N="226" /> to the Gaeltacht areas.  I do not see how any Gaeltacht development board or any arrangement between such a board and the Department could overcome the difficulties that we foresee unless there is provision made for it in the Planning Act.  If they are planning matters surely they come under the aegis of the Planning Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy is again missing the point.  Galway County Council, for instance, have responsibility for the Gaeltacht in the Galway area.  They are entitled in their planning and development to make their own arrangements and this is not a matter, any more than what is going to happen in Meath or Dublin or anywhere else, to be dealt with specifically in this Bill, which is a national Bill. The planning authorities have the authority to do this and will, in fact, be able to deal with it.  Deputy Molloy must be aware that there was no reference to the Gaeltacht in the portion of the Bill which was in the Custom House when I took over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is wrong again on that point.  I do not know what they showed him but that is wrong.  I am not satisfied with the reply.  Obviously the Minister does not understand the problems that can arise.  I will have to raise it on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Another point I raised to which the Minister has not referred is whether or not he considered including certain types of agricultural buildings under the provisions of the Planning Act, especially in view of the serious water pollution that has been caused by certain agricultural developments such as silage pits, slurry pits and intensive pig production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's first point, I do not want to have linguistic matters dealt with in this Bill.  I do not think they should be.  With regard to the second point, we are discussing this aspect with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  We feel, as I am sure Deputy Molloy does, that the complete freedom which has allowed slurry pits to run straight into <Col N="227" /> streams is entirely wrong.  Many other matters relating to agriculture and the absence of the necessity for permission have got to be tightened up.  I propose on Committee Stage to go very fully into this.  There is the question that was raised by Deputy Burke of whether local authorities and, indeed, State boards should be completely free to do what they want without any reference to the planning for their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Minister intends to bring forward an amendment to deal with this problem which arises in regard to certain agricultural buildings? He will have our support if he also brings in an amendment to bring, in some way, to the notice of the public the intentions of local authorities and public bodies in development.</P>
      <P>Another point I expected the Minister to refer to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this is a matter which I would prefer to deal with on Committee Stage but I would like to make one thing very clear.  I believe that over the years proper provision was not made for open space when building local authority housing schemes and I believe that local authorities and, indeed, private builders have been getting away with murder by simply saying they were providing X number of acres of open space and in many cases it turned out to be little corners at the end of schemes.  In a number of cases that have come to my notice builders were allowed to use land which they did not even own as open space.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very complicated provision in the Bill dealing with this matter and if it is worked properly it will do what Deputy Molloy suggests.  On Committee Stage we can discuss it very fully and if he thinks it has to be altered and if we are satisfied that that is correct, then we are prepared to alter it.  I think the provision being made will meet the requirements.</P>

      <P>Although grants in respect of this scheme were allocated by my Department on 13th June, 1972, I understand that work has not yet commenced.  In the circumstances the payment of grants does not arise.  I am informed however that the group recently ordered the required materials and it is hoped that work on the scheme will commence very soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that a ballroom in Bray, County Wicklow, which is to be sold could be made available for community purposes; and if his Department will make a contribution to enable the people of Bray to acquire it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the suggestion that the ballroom in question be acquired and adapted for use as a community centre.  Community centres come within the scope of the amenity grants scheme and it is open to the Bray Urban District Council to use the funds available to it under the scheme as a grant towards any such project.  I understand that this would represent a relatively small proportion of the cost envisaged but there are no other financial sources available to me from which a grant could be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce why, in section 85 (14) of the Customs and Excise Tariff Schedule, a duty of 8 per cent is charged on loudspeakers which have a diaphragm not exceeding 12 inches in diameter and an impedence of not less than three ohms or more than five ohms if imported from the UK, whilst on others there is no duty charged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating):</NameTxt>
      <P>Loudspeakers <Col N="127" /> have been subject to duty since 1926. The form of the duty was revised in 1963 so as to limit protection to the range of loudspeakers then being manufactured in Ireland.  In fact loudspeakers are no longer manufactured here and loudspeakers within the range referred to may be imported, under licence, duty-free from the UK, and on payment of a duty of 5 per cent from other countries.</P>

      <P>In the normal course statistics of this kind which relate to just one of a whole range of summary offences would not be available and I would not feel justified in asking the Garda Síochána to compile the figures.  As it happens, however, the Garda have the figures for this particular offences for the period indicated.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,241 prosecutions have been or are being taken by the Garda for breaches of the general speed limit of 50 miles per hour detected between 24th December, 1973, when it was introduced, and 28th February, 1974.</P>
