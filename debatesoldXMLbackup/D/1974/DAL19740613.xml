      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> In discussing the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs it is important to consider the vital role this Department plays in the life of the nation.  Before examining the workings of the various sections within it, we must consider first the manpower employed by the Department. Without the proper co-operation of staff in any Department or any industry, it would be impossible to achieve proper production or ensure proper performance.  In dealing with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, we are speaking about a Department which has approximately 53,000 employees.  In itself, this contributes a major part to the economic and social life of the country.  Therefore, the standards which obtain within the Department and the relationship between the Minister and his employees are of vital importance.  We have been fortunate in that Department over the past 12 months in relation to labour relations.  We have been bedevilled with so many strikes that we can be thankful at least that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has been functioning satisfactorily. The maintenance of the close relationship between the Minister and the various sections within the Department is of vital importance to the smooth functioning of such a vast Department.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the staff of the Department who, in my opinion, have carried out their duties over the past 12 months in an excellent manner.  I should like to sympathise with those people injured in the Marlborough Street bombings.  I know that some employees of the Department were injured at that time and others suffered other damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, we must acknowledge that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and their services have a bearing on all our lives, be it the postal service, telephone service, the broadcasting service or Post Office saving service.  All of these services have a very important function.  It is important to examine their functions and see how they have been carried out over the past 12 months.  As regards <Col N="1065" /> the post office and postal service, there is very little criticism we can level against them.  The postal service throughout the country &mdash; and I can speak particularly for Dublin &mdash; has been very satisfactory.  At one time I thought it a mistake to discontinue the Saturday postal delivery service even if it meant paying overtime to keep it going.  But, because of the new five day week and the various concessions which would be involved, that was not possible.  Nevertheless, postmen deserve credit for the difficult role they have to play.  I often wonder how they can adjust themselves so speedily to new housing schemes and deliver post where, quite often, there are not even names on roads.  It is evident that they can acquaint themselves very quickly and efficiently with them.  Nobody can say that the service has not been satisfactory.  I believe it has been and there is very little we need do to improve it.</P>
    <P>I heard a Deputy speak here last week about the volume of post and especially postal parcels.  There is quite an amount of large packages sent through the post.  These often present a problem to the postmen having to deliver them through the various letter boxes in the city.  The Department of Local Government should initiate some regulation as regards the size of letter boxes in order to make the postmen's task easier. This could effectively be done at least in local authority houses.  One often notices in estates letter boxes at the very bottom of the doors.  One can imagine how difficult it is for a postman delivering post or parcels, especially if he is advanced in years.</P>
    <P>Sub-post offices have grown considerably in numbers over the years. The volume of work they have to undertake increases every year.  They are handling more and more of the social welfare work.  We are trying to encourage them also in the savings bank field which has been their practice over the years.  The Minister did state that we have one of the highest number of sub-post offices in the country in comparison with any other country in Europe.  This may be true but I often wonder whether <Col N="1066" /> these sub-post offices are spread evenly in proportion to the population. I do not believe such an examination would stand up very well in Dublin if we considered some of the large new housing schemes and calculated the proportion of post offices we had per 1,000 of population.  In a few housing estates I have in mind there is not adequate Post Office service. This situation has obtained for a while but, I believe, has been remedied to some extent.  It is important that there be adequate sub-post offices and facilities.  Generally speaking, these sub-post offices are very small &mdash; usually a shop in run in one part of the building and the post office in the other.  These should be encouraged to expand and offer more facilities, especially to the Post Office saving section.</P>
    <P>We should encourage this section as much as possible so as to channel small savings into the Post Office. Only by doing this will the State be able to fall back on these savings.  If we discourage this saving we shall have to move more and more towards the type of loans about which we read in this morning's papers, more foreign borrowing.  At present this is welcome but in my opinion it is not a good sign.  We should be able to borrow from our own resources and every effort should be made to encourage people to make small savings.  We must remember that quite often people who began with small savings have become some of our biggest industrialists and businessmen. It cannot be said that some of our big industrialists and businessmen inherited their capital; this is not true. They built up their businesses on a small basis and quite often had their beginnings in Post Office savings.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to be making any effort to encourage people to realise that even by small savings they can achieve big things.  Inflation is a hindrance and a discouragement to saving.  The rate of interest on deposits is not encouraging when you see inflation running at 11 and, perhaps in the coming year, 15 per cent.  Anybody with a sense of finance is discouraged from saving in a small way for 8 or 8½ per cent while <Col N="1067" /> inflation runs at 14 or 15 per cent. Some type of investment should be available to them where they could see their capital growing.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that one of the worst deterrents in recent times is not the White Paper on capital taxation which is a complete discouragement of saving and investment.</P>

      <P>That is hardly relevant on this Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am not dealing with the White Paper itself, only with the effect it would have on Post Office savings.  A man who spends his money will never be subject to wealth tax but if a man who can save £300 or £400 a year at the beginning takes the White Paper seriously he sees the philosophy running through it and says: &ldquo;If I save the State will tax me if I succeed in accumulating sufficient wealth and starting a business.&rdquo;  That would be the intention of many people.  Even at the low level of Post Office savings these people must be encouraged but when we establish that it is wrong to save and when we discourage saving we will, I believe, have to fall back more and more on foreign borrowing which we should avoid at all costs.</P>
      <P>I do not have to spell out the disadvantages of foreign borrowing; we know the difficulties that arise if we resort too much to it.  It is necessary at times to advance our capital budget, necessary for the Minister to promote the telephone undertakings that he has in mind, but we should avoid it as much as possible and encourage small investors into Post Office savings.  That would be a good day's work and would encourage us to become a thrifty nation, helping ourselves by helping the State in saving this money.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the White Paper on capital taxation not only in regard to Post Office savings but in regard to all types of savings.  We must be sure we keep the money within the country and that people will not be forced to invest it abroad, which I greatly fear is happening now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that a considerable number <Col N="1068" /> of new telephones were connected last year, about 30,000 of them.  This is certainly welcome but unfortunately we still have very great problems with telephones in Dublin.  I live in Terenure and even there although a new system has been installed there is still great delay in getting the dialling tone and quite often it is embarrassing to find a conversation is going on when you pick up the telephone.  You can plainly hear such conversations.  If at all possible we must get rid of this trouble which would cause the public to lose confidence in the telephone system.  It often struck me that if I can hear other people's conversations it follows the same may happen in my own case.</P>
    <P>The service is certainly in need of vast improvements but there is no use installing too many telephones if the back-up service is not available or if we are overloading cables.  I can see a disimprovement in the service generally in the case of people who have got telephones over the past few years. I do not know whether the extra 30,000 telephones provided last year have caused overloading in different parts of the city.</P>
    <P>It is important, from the tourist and industrial points of view to have a good telephone service.  The population of the seaside resort where I go on holidays is about 900 people and during the off-season I am sure the telephone service is perfectly adequate. But there may be ten times as many people there in July and August.  It is frequented by many Dublin business people and if one wants to ring Dublin in the mornings one may have to wait for one-and-a-half hours.  I mentioned this last year.  I complained about it two years ago.  It is not good for any tourist resort.  The service was improved slightly last year; another assistant was put in I understand.</P>
    <P>I was glad of that but it is important for tourist resorts to remember that there is no use improving amenities and standards of accommodation &mdash; I agree that these are important &mdash; if they do not also consider the telephone service.  The majority of those who go to these resorts have to ring their homes or businesses.  Any tourist resort wishing to expand should consider <Col N="1069" /> the telephone service during the peak period as well as the other amenities.</P>
    <P>I do not think the three-minute period works effectively.  I have had many complaints of people making calls being in the box for ten minutes. That is most frustrating for somebody waiting outside.  If the three-minute period worked effectively the waiting, especially in the case of public telephones, would be reduced.  I have often seen even in the case of public telephones in business houses that the three-minute limit does not work.  I do not know why this is so but the limit should be made effective.  Perhaps it may be a question of a defect in the mechanism but I always understood a person was allowed three minutes for a telephone call.</P>
    <P>In normal business practice it is possible to check accounts against a delivery docket, an invoice or some other document; an ESB account can be checked against the meter reading or if oil is received from the oil companies it is possible to check it against the meter. However, this practice does not apply to telephone accounts.  I have frequently wondered if it would be practicable to install meters on telephones. I am not questioning the integrity of the accounts section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but there is no system whereby I can check my account and the only course open to me is to write to the Department and query it.  Possibly the Department have a mechanism whereby they can carry out checks and certify that the accounts are in order.  This is the only service for which the public pay where there is no visible way of checking their accounts.  Several people have asked me if it is possible for other people to abuse their accounts.  I hope it is not but it is a question that has crossed the minds of many people, including myself, especially with regard to trunk calls. The obvious solution would be to have a meter installed so that people could check their accounts but I realise that it may not be possible to do this. Frequently people are dissatisfied with their accounts and are convinced they could not have made so many telephone calls and a certain amount of <Col N="1070" /> suspicion is thrown on the Department. It is quite possible that the owner of the house may not be aware of the telephone calls being made, perhaps by children or others, and for the sake of accuracy it would be desirable to have some system whereby he could ascertain by checking the meter all the telephone calls that were made.</P>
    <P>During the years the telephone section of the Department has practically always paid its way.  There was always a reasonably good return on capital expenditure but on looking through the returns we see we have reached the lowest rate.  In 1963-64 there was a return of 6.6 per cent, in 1969-70 the rate was 8.9 per cent and now we are down to 5.2 per cent.  I am not sure how this situation has developed but I suppose we will not get the same return on capital employed on the telephone service as in former years. Having regard to the long waiting list for telephones, I am not sure that the service should not be made pay its way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has major plans in mind for the telephone service and it is important that the schemes be proceded with, especially in view of our entry into the EEC.  Industrialists have regard to certain factors when they are considering establishing industries; they include political stability, labour relations and an efficient telephone service. When an application is made for telephones by an industrial concern there should be no delay because it is impossible to run a business without them.</P>
    <P>In the financial accounts there was an overall deficit of £1,442,000 in 1972.  A provisional account for 1972-73 shows an overall deficit of £3,509,000 but it is stated that a reliable figure for the different services for 1973-74 will not be available for a considerable time.  However, the present indications are that the overall deficit for the year will increase to about £4.5 million.</P>
    <P>About eight years ago we had a deficit of more than £3 million for CIE and it was said the organisation would pay their way shortly.  We know what was the subvention to CIE this year and I hope we are not embarking on the same course with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  A deficit <Col N="1071" /> of £1 million may appear large but it is small in comparison with a deficit of £8 million.  I think we are building up to the same kind of deficit in the Department and this should be avoided if possible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Broadcasting is one of the most sensitive areas in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and this is quite right. Television is a most powerful medium; it enters all our homes and its influence for good or bad can be of vital importance to the nation's wellbeing. The role of television is to inform people of current and international affairs.  It must also entertain but its objective must always be to improve and uplift the standards and morale of the country.  This objective must be kept in mind always.  I know it is difficult to do this because there are outside pressures at work but it is the duty of the State to ensure that our television service does not lower its standards.  It can play an important role in putting forward ideals for the people.  We must consider the kind of programmes presented and examine our approach to open broadcasting.  We must consider if open broadcasting will be detrimental. These questions must be answered. Are RTE giving us the proper material?  Can their programmes compete with foreign programmes?  What effect have multi-channel programmes on the Irish people on the east coast? Have they lowered their standards as compared with the rest of the country? It will be the duty of the Minister to decide on those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should try to have programmes on RTE which would be of benefit to the country generally.  I am not saying that all programmes should be of <Col N="1072" /> an abstract nature.  This just would not work.  I would like to see a programme, perhaps, at six or seven in the evening explaining the social welfare code.  There are many people, especially old people and people dependent on social welfare, who are not aware of their entitlements.  It should not be necessary for them to come to any public representative.  I know these things are explained in the newspapers. Indeed, on this occasion the Department of Social Welfare have explained them at great expense to the Exchequer.  Even so, I should like to see such programmes explaining those things in a simple way.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a programme which would show the average householder how much he can spend on hire purchase.  Many people have overcommitted themselves to hire purchase. There could be a programme explaining the undesirability of obtaining money from moneylenders.  I should like to see a programme encouraging people to join credit unions. I should like to see a programme for the people of Dublin explaining the housing lists.  People often waste their time going to Dublin Corporation when they have no hope of obtaining a house.  Such programmes would be constructive.  I am not finding fault with Telefís Éireann for their performance. I think they have done quite well and we must consider the question of finance but it would be helpful if they expanded their programmes in the social field.</P>
    <P>There are some excellent children's programmes from some of the foreign stations.  There are also programmes like &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo;, &ldquo;Midweek&rdquo; and &ldquo;Travel&rdquo;.  If we could have the best of these programmes through a second channel I do not think we would be damaging our culture.  I do not for a moment decry all the multi-channel programmes but there are a few which I dislike.  They would have no effect on me but I object to them where my children are concerned.  They are available in Dublin at present so we have no choice.  Anybody who has young children knows how hard it is to control television viewing.  Each child seems to have a different choice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> I believe the Minister has a second channel in mind.  I hope he will keep it under his own control.  He certainly can get many useful, enlightening programmes from the BBC or UTV.  He evidently has BBC 1 in mind.  It is very difficult to keep foreign programmes from coming into this country having regard to our close integration with the people of Britain and with emigration. Our people are bound to come up against those programmes in England anyway.  We have a flow of people between Ireland and Britain so the damage which would be done to our people if it was completely free is a question which we must consider seriously. I would not say the rest of the country is not entitled to outside broadcasting.  We have it in Dublin anyway.  The Minister has now sanctioned a channel for Waterford.  I wonder how far the Minister will go. I remember the Minister returning from London, I have not got the exact date, and predicting that there would be completely open broadcasting in this country within a short time.</P>

    <P>We should ensure that our broadcasting system is run on a level that will bring up our standards and our ideals.  We could have programmes on <Col N="1075" /> civics.  We see the vandalism in the city.  Vandalism as regards telephones is getting progressively worse.  We could have programmes to show the parents of those young people the terrible damage they are doing.  Television is the most important instrument in our lives today and we must ensure it is channelled in the right direction.  Whether we would lose revenue if we had outside broadcasting is problematic.  Industry has had to meet the challenge.  If it comes to RTE it must meet it too.  If the material is right people will always turn to their native channel.</P>

People turn to the Irish newspapers because they are interested in Irish news and local news.  We must also try to impress on Telefís Éireann that they should show more Irish news as the people are more interested in that even though they have other channels.  Very seldom do people in general turn to English newspapers before Irish newspapers. We must give the people Irish material so that even when they have other channels available all over the country they will turn to Telefís Éireann.  Telefís Éireann are capable of being more locally involved.  I do not want them to get too parochial because they must have programmes of a national nature which are interesting to everybody.  The television and broadcasting systems of this country can be of vital interest if they have programmes for the good of the nation.</P>

      <P>I should not like to let this opportunity pass without paying a tribute to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and making a few comments.  It has been a year of progress and advancement on all fronts in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. When the present Minister took over this Department it was hopelessly under-capitalised and he <Col N="1076" /> immediately set about rectifying the position.  The results in the short term may not be very great but there is a solid basis for further development and advancement especially since this House voted £175 million for capital investment.  A total of 30,000 new telephone lines have been introduced, 68 new motorised road delivery services and 101 additional postment have been provided.</P>
      <P>I join with the Minister in commending the efforts of the National Savings Committee, particularly in the schools.  I should like them to concentrate further on the schools and, if possible, give greater incentives to youth to inculcate in them a love of saving and the need for it.  If something in the nature of the voluntary health contribution system could be introduced whereby weekly deductions from salaries could be made this would encourage saving.  The larger firms and Government Departments could take part in such a scheme.  The savings would be taken from the employees before they got their pay packets.  They would be able to save without feeling the pinch.</P>
      <P>Before the National Coalition Government took office old age pensioners were penalised for saving but since the easing of the means test an old age pensioner can have a weekly income of £5 and still be entitled to the full pension.  This must encourage saving.  Formerly if an old age pensioner had savings in either the post office or the bank he was not entitled to the full pension.  I hope the Minister can make other concessions, such as tax free concessions, to encourage savings at all levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has instructed the stamp design committee to replace our definitive stamps.  These have remained the same down through the years.  They have been unimaginative. There has been a lack of flair and colour in them.  I would like the whole series scrapped and a new one introduced.  Perhaps we could look North and have some scenes of historical importance from Northern Ireland for our new stamps.  The Minister should not confine the commemorative stamps to seven.  There are many <Col N="1077" /> more items of national interest that should be commemorated.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister also on the very happy relations that exist between himself and his huge staff of 25,000 people.  I congratulate the staff too.  They have upheld the long standing tradition of service to the public. True, they work long hours, as the Minister rightly pointed out, and I hope they are properly recompensed for having to work these hours.  Political rights have now been granted to many members of the Minister's staff.  Hitherto they were deprived of the fundamental right of offering themselves as candidates in elections. The change is a welcome one and some members of the Minister's staff have now availed themselves of the opportunity of going forward as candidates in the forthcoming local elections.</P>
    <P>Initially, the Post Office was a place in which one bought stamps, postal orders, money orders, sent telegrams and so on.  With the development of social welfare the staffs now, especially those on the counters, have to be authorities in social welfare and I would like to pay tribute to them for the help they give to the old and to those who come to them for forms, helping them to fill up the forms correctly and advising them of the different benefits and entitlements.</P>
    <P>Telephones have been dealt with very adequately but I should like to stress that 30,000 subscribers have been connected in the past year.  This is a very welcome advancement. There are, however, still 41,000 awaiting connection.  That shows the volume of work that has yet to be done.  I quite appreciate that the Minister is aware of the urgency in pressing ahead with telephone development and I should like to remind him again of how frustrating it is for business people when they experience undue delays in getting telephone connections.  It would be interesting to know how much time is wasted in this somewhat futile exercise, time which could be put to much better advantage.</P>
    <P>I represent a rural constituency and I know that the farming community <Col N="1078" /> are now more alive to the need for having a good telephone service.  It is very important from the point of view of getting in touch with the AI station, the veterinary surgeons and so on.  There are a thousand and one things in relation to which a telephone is a tremendous advantage to a farmer.  I urge the Minister to give rural connections attention.  Farms must now be developed as businesses following on our entry into Europe.</P>
    <P>I want now to express the gratitude of the people of Clonmel for the new 2,000 line automatic exchange there. People have expressed their delight to me and their pleasure now in making telephone calls.  The exchange was hopelessly overloaded.</P>
    <P>There are two areas requiring the Minister's attention.  The first is the Ballyporeen/Mitchelstown line.  Complaints are still coming in about delay. In Ardfinnan then there is a new industrial complex and I would urge the Minister, as others did who petitioned him, to grant this complex out-of-area phones.  This is essential for the new industries about to be established there.</P>
    <P>In Tipperary town a site has been acquired for a new post office.  I commend the Minister and the Board of Works for holding an architectural competition for the design of this post office.  This is a new concept in Government thinking.  It is to be commended.  Many of these old post offices were built at the beginning of this century and are no longer suitable for the type of business transacted in them today.  The new post office will be a modern building designed to suit every need.</P>
    <P>The Minister opened a new post office in Nenagh with ample parking space and the staff and public are very pleased with it.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister in his comments on the report of the Broadcasting Review Committee.  The report is useless since it does not fulfil the object for which the committee was set up.  There should have been an in-depth study of RTE.  They failed to make such a study.  They <Col N="1079" /> also failed to lay down guidelines. Admittedly, mistakes have been made in the past and these should have been pinpointed so that similar mistakes will not be made in the future. No attempt was made to spell out the kind of programme best suited to the nation's needs and interests.</P>
    <P>Where broadcasting is concerned, I think there has been a failure down through the years to fulfil its proper function.  It had great potential for both education and entertainment, but it failed to develop properly.  It also failed to mould public opinion. Programmes were shoddy on the whole.  They failed to bring home to the people the richness of their heritage. In the years ahead I hope RTE will live up to its responsibilities and help to mould our real traditions, both Orange and Green, and demonstrate to the nation that we have more in common than we have in divisiveness. Discussions should be objective, impartial and unbiased.  All sides should be heard, though it is not always possible to have this, but that should be the object at which to aim.  Sensationalism, bias and sectarianism should be avoided at all costs.  This is a tremendous medium of communication because it gets to every fireside and into every home.</P>
    <P>The chairman and the members of the RTE Authority have a tremendous responsibility.  Through television we can best achieve that unity of heart and that understanding which we are aiming to achieve.  I should like to see films about Northern Ireland's scenic beauty, films about industrial Belfast and films about Armagh and Derry.  I should like to hear discussions between people of all shades of political thinking in the North so that we down South can get a fuller understanding of the mentality, the thinking and the outlook of our fellow-Irishmen in Northern Ireland. There is a tremendous responsibility on RTE to use this potential and to help to mould a good, healthy, solid public opinion.  RTE should be an institution like the BBC, if I may say so.  Unfortunately, to date we have not achieved that.  I would ask <Col N="1080" /> the Minister to devote his attention, if possible, to having RTE fulfil the role it should fulfil in the entertainment world and in the educational field and in the moulding of a new Ireland.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his great achievements.  I thank him for the notes he has given us so that we can understand fully the working of his Department.  This has been a year of progress and advancement.  I am sure that, when we come to debate this Estimate next year, he will have further improvements to report and that he will be able to show us that it has been a year of great advancement.</P>

Nuair a bunaíodh Radio na Gaeltachta bhí sé i gceist againne a bhí sa Rialtas ag an am féachaint chuige nuair a bheadh an rud go léir bunaithe, trealamh cumarsáide a chur ar fáil don Stáit uilig.

Níl an trealamh á úsáid don chuid is mó den lá agus d'fhéadfaí é úsáid ar bhealaí éagsúla.  B'shin ceann de na bealaí a bhí i gceist againne.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to certain matters which were mentioned in the Minister's speech introducing this Estimate. The first thing I want to refer to is the sentence which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The most critical and sensitive aspect of broadcasting perhaps at any time, and certainly in a disturbed and eventful period, is the handling of news and current affairs.</P>
      <P>I presume that what the Minister had in mind there was the danger that news and current affairs programmes might be slanted, wittingly and unwittingly, to project a particular point of view without regard to the facts.  One of the most outstanding exponents of this technique is the Minister himself.  When I say this I am not referring to the Minister's now notorious leaks and off-the-record briefings to the news media, or, indeed, to the foolish and dangerous nonsense in which he indulged at the Sunningdale conference with his leak to the Press which caused such antipathy among the other participants.</P>
      <P>Rather am I referring to the particular kind of technique which the Minister uses and of which we have some examples in his speech.  For instance, if we refer to page 37 of the Minister's speech as delivered in copies to Members of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not catch that last remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am distinguishing between the copies of the Minister's speech which were delivered to Members of the House and the Official Report where, presumably, the reference <Col N="1082" /> would be different.  In referring to one aspect of the Report of the Broadcasting Review Committee the Minister said:</P>
      <P>In this respect what the report really said is that, while the capacity to view British television might be increased in certain areas, through the expanding use of cable, the introduction of it into other areas would transform the country as a whole into &ldquo;a provincial region of Britain&rdquo;.  I cannot see on what logical grounds this proposition can be defended.</P>
      <P>I sometimes feel that what underlies this rather peculiar attitude is not really so much an objection to our people watching British television as an objection to admitting that they watch it.</P>
      <P>It may be interesting to know what the Minister sometimes thinks or sometimes feels.  Presumably when he said that it means that sometimes he does not feel what he says there. Either way it may be interesting. What he says there is, of course, simply an assertion.  He does not advance one iota of evidence to support that assertion.  But having made that assertion he goes on to build up a case based on that assertion for which he has no proof and which is something he sometimes feels.</P>
      <P>This is the kind of technique which this Minister, more than most, indulges in and it is one that is unfortunate to say the least because it can lead to a great deal of misunderstanding. I have no doubt that when the Minister goes on to build up his case based on these kinds of things he believes fully what he is saying but it is not good enough for him to build up cases on matters that are of considerable importance without getting his basic facts right.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Thus the same people who hold the theory that Divis is as Irish as Kippure, think that none the less what is broadcast from one mountain should be seen throughout the island and what is broadcast from the other should not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> The Minister does not advance evidence to support that.  It is a neat phrase which describes a certain kind of attitude and the Minister attributes that attitude to some people in this country, not just members of the Broadcasting Review Committee.  He goes on to build up his case on that. That is not good enough unless he can show that people believe what he says here, that people maintain that attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I can show that from the debates in this House and I will do that when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will attempt to do so in the future but up to now he has not shown it. Not alone has he not shown any basis for this, in fact, apart from a very limited number of people there is no basis for it, but he has done this in order to support and bolster up a theory, or rather a prejudice, which he himself has.  I should like to remind the Minister that a purely Northern Ireland programme, whether it be on radio or television, reflecting the views and aspirations of the people of Northern Ireland is one thing but a British programme with a small colouring of Northern Ireland items is quite another matter.  The Minister has given the impression that he thinks these things are synonymous but they are not.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that selected programmes from the BBC, UTV or any other foreign television station which accord with public taste in this State should be shown.  It is desirable and laudable that they should be shown here.  That is one thing but the surrender of our airwaves is quite another matter.  The surrender of those airwaves not for the purpose of showing to the rest of the country programmes reflecting the aspirations and interests of the people of Northern Ireland but rather programmes which would be almost totally related to and reflecting the aspirations and interests of people of a foreign country is not a matter that most people in this country would find acceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of Question Time yesterday I put a number of supplementaries to the Minister but because it was Question Time and because of the limitations which apply at Question Time it was not possible to pursue in any depth what emerged. However, I found what the Minister had to say quite ominous.  He was answering a question in regard to progress or otherwise on the concept of open broadcasting. The Minister said that a good deal of progress had been made on one aspect of it which was the arrangements for the making available in this State of programmes from the North of Ireland. He has not, to the best of my knowledge, spelt out that these are to be the programmes which relate to Northern Ireland but he also said that some progress had been made in regard to the transmission of RTE programmes in the North.  He said there was more difficulty there because of the understandable burdens now placed on the shoulders of Mr. Merlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. All of that is quite understandable.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister will recall that I asked him whether he intended to insist on reciprocity in this matter and he refused to give any such undertaking. What is more he went further and said that he thought this would not be helpful because the people with whom he was negotiating were thinking in quite different terms.  I may not be quoting the Minister's words exactly but this is the impression he created in my mind.  It should be quite clear to everybody that open broadcasting means nothing unless there is reciprocity. Therefore, if the Minister is talking about open broadcasting nothing can be gained by his refusing to make it quite clear at the outset that this is what is involved and that unless we can have reciprocity there cannot be open broadcasting.  Therefore, the Minister must insist on reciprocity unless he has it in mind that we should accept BBC or UTV programmes not specifically related to Northern Ireland at all, without RTE being seen in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> I do not know what the Minister has in mind but if that is not what he has in mind I can see no reason why the Minister should not make it crystal clear in this House, to the public of this State, and to those with whom he is involved in negotiations that that is what his aim is.  I regard it as ominous because it recalls to me the negotiations in which the Minister was engaged at Sunningdale.  The Minister will recall that I have said in this House on a number of occasions, and specifically in relation to Sunningdale, that I believe it is a grave mistake in any negotiations where there are fundamental matters involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I am concerned as to how Sunningdale can legitimately be brought into this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a passing reference to Sunningdale because of its similarity but what I am proposing to propound now is a general proposition in relation to any negotiations in which fundamental matters are involved and this includes negotiations in which the Minister may be involved in regard to the implementation of his concept of open broadcasting.  In any such negotiations it may be more difficult but it is far more fruitful in the long run to start out making one's position clear and getting the other party's position clear also, so that no formula which attempts to gloss over fundamental differences can be successful.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that in the negotiations in which he is involved in this matter he will cause a great deal of difficulty and of misunderstanding unless he makes crystal clear what he is aiming for.  If he is aiming for a reciprocal arrangement let him say so clearly to everybody involved, including the parties with whom he is negotiating.  On the other hand, if that is not what he is aiming for let him make that clear and, then, we shall all know where we stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has taken a particular view of the effect of Irish history on current political developments and attitudes.  He has made it clear that <Col N="1086" /> in regard to the operations of RTE he considers this to be a matter of some importance.  But, again, we find a clear example of the Minister building up on an assertion and not on a stated fact a case to support a theory of his, or to describe it more accurately, a prejudice.  If the Minister doubts what I am saying in this regard might I remind him of a lecture which he delivered some time ago, which was reported in the newspapers and in which he is reported to have dealt with this matter and to have stated in the course of his remarks &mdash; he went on to base his case on this &mdash; that Parnell was unacceptable and denigrated in the Republican tradition because he was not a physical force man.</P>

      <P>I have referred to the Minister's statement in regard to news and current affairs, to the critical role which can be played and is played by television and radio at this time.  One cannot examine the role played by radio and television in this country at this time in relation to news and current affairs without having some regard to and some knowledge of the factors which influence attitudes today to what is going on in the North of Ireland.  What I am suggesting is that the Minister has tried repeatedly to suggest that those who were engaged in the War of Independence and, subsequently, in the Civil War here, were people who did not have any regard for the democratic process, that they believed only in physical force and that they had no regard for a constitutional approach.</P>

I shall be brief on this.  The only point I wish to make is that if the Minister will examine what actually happened he will discover that, for <Col N="1089" /> instance, during the Civil War situation &mdash; I have no wish to argue the merits one way or the other of that &mdash; there was a grave concern, almost an obsession, one might say, by both sides with establishing that they had a legitimate mandate.</P>

      <P>If the Minister would look back he would realise that, for instance, there was grave argument about one incident concerning the production of a constitution on the morning of a general election.  The Minister will remember the argument of the pact election and what were the implications of that.  The only reason I am referring to this is to draw attention to the fact that both sides were concerned vitally to establish that they had the mandate of the people.  It is no help to the institutions of this State for the Minister or anybody else, since the Minister is not the only one who does this, to try to suggest that the people calling themselves the IRA today can be equated with the real IRA, with the people who operated under the authority of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about one side or the other.  I am simply trying to establish the fact that there was <Col N="1090" /> concern to establish whether they were right or wrong and that they had a democratic mandate.  It is not in the least helpful in present circumstances for anybody to try to suggest that those who, not alone have not a democratic mandate but are contemptuous of a democratic mandate, should be in any way equated with those who, whether one agrees with their activities or not, did at least try to establish and therefore show their concern that they should be seen to have a democratic mandate.  I will get away from that point now, Sir, you will be glad to hear.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister referred to new legislation which he proposes to introduce.  He said:</P>
      <P>In general it is my intention that the new legislation, while fully guarding against the danger of the use of broadcasting for subversion of democratic institutions and incitement of violence shall also provide proper safeguards against abuse of statutory powers in relation to broadcasting for party-political purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very laudable.  Could the Minister explain his thinking in this regard?  He is aware that the existing legislation has provisions designed to prevent the abuse of power in relation to broadcasting for party-political purposes.  Before he became Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, on foot of a contract with RTE, he took part in a series of programmes &mdash; I think three &mdash; in which he delivered what purported to be historical lectures but which, he will recall, consisted in great measure of party-political abuse, abuse of Fianna Fáil, and sneering references.  The audience was loaded with his then friends &mdash; they are not friends of his any more.  All the &ldquo;lefties&rdquo; and the &ldquo;pinkies&rdquo; could be seen on the screen applauding him. Under existing legislation there is provision to prevent this.  The Minister was the main party in that example of either a breach of or a getting around of the statutory provisions. When talking about introducing legislation on those lines I should like him to give some thought and <Col N="1091" /> explanation as to how he proposes to devise such legislation which will prevent the kind of abuse in which he was engaged as the principal party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a copy here. I am raising this point because it was dealt with at Question Time on 28th March, 1974.  Because of the limitations of Question Time, it was not possible to follow it as fully as we should have.  As reported at column 1142 of Volume 271, No. 8, I asked a supplementary question of the Minister as follows:</P>
      <P>An bhfuil sé fíor gur thug an tAire agallamh do nuachtóir i ndiaidh an óráid a thug sé i bPortláirge inar dúirt sé go raibh polasaí RTE i leith na Gaeilge &ldquo;domineering&rdquo; agus &ldquo;overbearing&rdquo;?  Má dúirt sé a leithéid, cén fáth nach bhfuil sé chun an polasaí sin a atlerú?</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>Ní dúirt mé a leithéid.  Bhí earráid ag tuairisceoir amháin san <i>Irish Independent</i> agus chuir me correction amach mar gheall air agus is féidir leis na Teachtaí&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle intervened and I asked a further question:</P>
      <P>An bhfuil sé fír gur chuir an tAire litir chuig an páipéar an lá dár gcion, mar adúirt sé, ach nár dhúirt sé sa litir sin nár shéan sé gur úsáid sé na focail sin?  Ní shin a bhí in a litir.  An bhfuil sé ag rá anois nár dhúirt sé sin agus go raibh dul amú ar an tuairisceoir a bhí ciontach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>Is fíor gur úsáid mé na focail &ldquo;domineering&rdquo; agus &ldquo;overbearing&rdquo; ach ní mar gheall ar fhoireann RTE ach mar gheall ar pholasaí Fhianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>There were further exchanges, Sir, but what is relevant is contained in that.</P>
    <P>On the front page of <i>The Irish Independent,</i> 25th February, 1974, a report with a large headline conveyed, among other things that the Minister had described the policy of RTE in relation to Irish as &ldquo;overbearing&rdquo; and &ldquo;domineering&rdquo;, and no longer acceptable.  That was not a report of the speech he made in Waterford but rather a report of an interview which he gave subsequently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in reply to a question.  He also attempted to convey that he had denied the accuracy of this in a letter to <i>The Irish Independent.</i> It is necessary for me, Sir, to read the Minister's letter of 26th February, 1974, to <i>The Irish Independent</i> in order to get this right:</P>
      <P>Sir,</P>
      <P>Your front page story on my statements at Waterford is headed &ldquo;Irish lobby at RTE lashed by Minister&rdquo;.  It refers to me as making &ldquo;a bid to break the power for the militant Irish lobby in RTE&rdquo; and says that I &ldquo;labelled RTE's Irish language policy as &lsquo;overbearing, domineering and no longer acceptable&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very serious misunderstanding here.  Both in my public statement at Waterford, and in <Col N="1093" /> subsequent interviews, both televised and with the Press, what I was attacking was a certain approach to the Irish language and national culture reflected in the wording of the present Broadcasting Act.</P>
    <P>I was not attacking &mdash; directly or indirectly or by implication &mdash; the RTE Authority, or any of its members, or any of the RTE staff.</P>
    <P>You will note that so far there is no word from the Minister to say &ldquo;I did not use those words you purported to quote me as using&rdquo;.  He is giving a meaning to the words he said but he is not denying that he used the words quoted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not use those words about that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was quoted in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of the previous day as saying:</P>
      <P>The policy of RTE in relation to Irish...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry. That is incorrect.  I was not quoted as saying that.  The part in quotes was the predicate &mdash;&ldquo;domineering&rdquo;, and so forth.  That was a direct quote, actual language used by me.  The subject which they attached to it was not the subject. I had in mind people like the Deputy and some of his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister is mistaken in his recollection.  Let him look at it again and he will find that that is not what appeared and that this purported denial was very carefully worded to give the impression that he did not say those words.  He did not positively deny it because he could not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is over-straining the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  I will proceed with the letter.  So far, the Minister has not denied that he used the words attributed to him, but rather the meaning of them.  The letter goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Authority, appointed by me last June, reflects in its composition the diversity of approaches which I consider appropriate to broadcasting in Ireland, and consequently <Col N="1094" /> it includes several members who are active in the Irish language Movement.  Some of these might well not agree with the general philosophy in my statement, but it was certainly not my intention to attack them or others with the same views on the staff of RTE itself, as a &lsquo;lobby&rsquo;, or a pressure group, etc. To do so would have been in my opinion both ungracious and unjust. The whole point of my speech was that Irish is an important part of our culture but it is not the totality of our culture.</P>
    <P>I again draw attention to the fact that nowhere in that letter, cleverly worded as it is, does the Minister deny the accuracy of the words attributed to him which were as I have stated.  This goes further.  Under the letter as published, there is a reply from the reporter concerned, Michael Brophy, <i>Irish Independent</i> newsroom.  It was published in the form of a letter to the Minister:</P>
    <P>Minister &mdash; First of all may I thank you for the interview on your attitude to the Irish Language Broadcasts on RTE.</P>
    <P>But may I point out that even a casual reading of my report would, in my opinion, fail to conclude that you were attacking the RTE Authority as a body.</P>
    <P>As for attacks on individual members, it is common knowledge that a minority of the Authority and several senior Executives at Montrose are totally opposed to your views on Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act and your attitude to the station's language policy.</P>
    <P>As for your reference to &ldquo;an Irish lobby&rdquo; you must be aware, Minister, that your reply to my questions on the existence of an Irish Lobby was toned down considerably in the interest of balanced reporting.</P>
    <P>It simply is not good enough for the Minister, when he is caught out &mdash; I do not know why he was caught out because he confirmed the following day that he used the words &mdash; to try to give the words a different meaning. Once he has adopted that attitude it <Col N="1095" /> is up to him to try to justify his stand. It simply is not good enough for the Minister to come along subsequently to try to make out that what he was talking about was Fianna Fáil.  Nowhere in the report and nowhere in his letter do Fianna Fáil appear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the reply from the reporter, Mr. Michael Brophy, we are asked what was the Minister toning down.  There is the reference to an Irish lobby.  Was this an Irish lobby in Fianna Fáil, an Irish lobby in RTE or was the Minister talking about an Irish lobby on the moon?  Would the Minister stop trying to cod us and would he face up to his responsibilities? If he tells a newspaper reporter that he regards the RTE policy in relation to Irish or the policy of people with any influence in RTE as &ldquo;overbearing&rdquo;, domineering, no longer acceptable&rdquo;, would he stand over it and not be running away when he is faced with the consequence of what he is saying?</P>

I am inviting him when he is replying to the debate to make it crystal clear &mdash; no clever letters or phrases in this simple matter &mdash; does he think that the policy of RTE in relation to Irish is &ldquo;overbearing, domineering and no longer acceptable&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The real point of all this is that the attitude of this Minister in relation to RTE and to the people who disagree in any way with the views which he expresses on many matters, some of trivial importance and some of major importance, is totally inappropriate to <Col N="1098" /> any Minister in any Department but particularly to a Minister who has responsibility for an area such as radio and television.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from section 31 of the Act and the knight-in-shining-armour image which the Minister is trying to adopt &mdash; a rather tarnished image, unfortunately &mdash; the reality that comes through in relation to this Minister and his attitude to people who disagree with him is one that confirms our opinion that the Taoiseach, from his own point of view was probably not mistaken in appointing this man as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and giving him charge of the Government Information Service, because in the short term the Minister is, as I have tried to demonstrate, quite clever with words; he is, in fact, a very intelligent man, but, unfortunately, despite his various poses, he is a man without tolerance for those who disagree with him.  He may say he has tolerance; he may even think he has tolerance for them, but he has not.  This emerges quite clearly, and nothing demonstrates it more clearly than the kind of words he used there in Waterford in relation to whomever he used them.</P>
      <P>It is very unfortunate that a man of that kind should be in charge of such a critical area as the Minister is at the moment.  However, all this is, thank God, short term.  The Minister's stay in those particular positions, fortunately, will not be too long.  My only concern is that, in the interval which remains while he continues to occupy those positions, undue damage will not have been done to the national interest.  As far as we are concerned on this side of the House, we have allowed this Minister a good deal of rope.  He has so far tightened the noose himself very suitably, but I want to give him notice that the matter is becoming much too serious now in the national interest. Therefore, the Minister may find that we will not in future allow him, competent as he is, to tighten the noose himself; we may give it a little chug ourselves.</P>

I do not think Fianna Fáil should be kept up late at all because it does not suit them.  Deputy Colley did not touch the Estimate at all in his contribution.  All he was doing was trying to have a go at the Minister all through.  One would think he was outside the church gate.  There is too much money involved here to be wasting the Minister's time.  I congratulate the Minister on the way he has handled his Department since he took office.  There is a lot to be done and we have the right man in the right place.

      <P>I was at a function the other night where there was quite a big crowd.  Actually, it was outside a church gate.  I challenged them to tell me who was the last Minister for the Gaeltacht.  In the Gaeltacht they could not tell me, but they know who the present Minister is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>This is the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been going around the country, and surely I am entitled to go a few yards off the beam.  They did not even know Deputy Colley was Minister for the Gaeltacht, and they did not know he had a Parliamentary Secretary.  They know who the present man is, Deputy Tom <Col N="1101" /> O'Donnell.  As far as Deputy Colley's defence of the Gaeltacht or the fáinne group is concerned, it was a poor effort.  I know the Minister will not give way to any lobby, be it from the fáinne brigade or elsewhere.  When there is an insurrection the first thing the insurgents try to take over is the broadcasting station in order to put their point across, in order to have the people under their thumb, and to give false information.</P>
      <P>I would like now, having been diverted by Deputy Colley, to go down through the Estimate.  The Minister, in taking up his portfolio, inherited a great backlog of telephone applications. In my own area of Galway, which is growing fast, there is a great demand for telephones.  I know there are certain priorities in dealing with applications, but the Minister should give a special concession in my area in order to enable business to carry on. In regard to public phones, there are vast new areas, new housing estates.  At times people are told that the volume of business does not warrant the provision of a telephone kiosk.  The Minister should consider the provision of such phones where people are away from a centre; it may be a matter of life or death.  I appreciate that lines are overloaded, and it is not easy to make people understand that they cannot have a phone when the wire is passing their door.</P>
      <P>On the question of the postal service. I should like to see us getting back to the old system whereby letters were franked with the motto &ldquo;See Ireland first&rdquo;.  Many people here in Dublin have not seen the west of Ireland or County Kerry.  They have been in Spain because it is the thing to do, but that is a slave mentality.  By stamping this slogan on envelopes going through the post people would be made to realise that there is something to see in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of free postage for Members, many of the previous Ministers were at a great loss last Christmas. We recall that 200,000 Christmas cards had been posted at the expense of the taxpayers of this country.  I am glad to see that that has ended and the handful of cards sent out now are the <Col N="1102" /> ordinary run of the mill ones the Ministers may have to send.  That meant nothing to Fianna Fáil in votes anyway.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before the question of telegrams.  I should like to see a little imagination being used in the Department in regard to the congratulatory type of message, on the occasion of a marriage, christening or similar occasion. Perhaps some from of telegram could be issued for that purpose.  I was told it would not pay but, if one type can be printed, why not another? But, at the moment, one receives the same type of telegram sending a message of sympathy as of congratulation. Perhaps something could be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate the necessity for privacy in post offices in the transaction of one's business.  I know they have done something in this regard in my town; some sort of a screen has been put up to allow a person some degree of privacy.  I should like to see that done throughout the country.  The lack of such privacy can cause a great deal of loss of business to the post office.  We have many people like &ldquo;Minnie&rdquo; of &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; breathing down people's necks in post offices and, if a poor unfortunate woman puts five shillings into savings, it is publicised over the whole village; or, if she receives a few pounds from her son, again the fact is known all over the village.</P>
    <P>On the question of television, I should like to congratulate RTE. However, I would issue one word of warning; do not try to please everybody; you cannot.  And, if we get piped television, we will not please everybody either.  Some people tend to sit all day watching television &mdash; addicts &mdash; and, unless something drives them out to circulate their blood, we shall have very poor health specimens after a while.  I congratulate RTE on &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;.  Some of us condemn the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; but I repeat what I said before &mdash; we are always breaking our necks to see it.  Although we might not agree with it, it must have something to offer.  I should like to congratulate RTE on its treatment of the recent bombings; there was a degree of maturity about it.  They were very <Col N="1103" /> helpful on that occasion keeping people in touch, and I hope this permeates throughout all the programmes.</P>
    <P>On the question of open broadcasting, I should like to congratulate the Minister when he said, on page 23 of his introductory remarks:</P>
    <P>This network will provide the necessary transmission facilities irrespective of what programme service is to be transmitted.  The decision to start work on this is an earnest of the Government's intention to provide a choice of programmes as quickly as possible, particularly for viewers in the single channel areas who have access to RTE only at present.</P>
    <P>We are spongers in Dublin of the English lines.  But let us do it above board and have the whole country entitled to what they have in Dublin.</P>
    <P>At times people may feel they would like to censor the type of material coming in.  But if our emigrants are exposed to all of this, surely we here can stand up to anything being inflicted&mdash;if that is the correct word to use&mdash;on us.  Perhaps I am not &ldquo;with&rdquo; it but, in regard to some of the programmes transmitted I feel the guitar features too largely. I should like to hear more music both on television and radio rather than this &ldquo;bang bang&rdquo; stuff.</P>
    <P>Recently some top camera men in RTE were injured in a 'plane crash. These are men we cannot afford to lose and I wish them a speedy recovery to full health.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more programmes being transmitted on the subjects of civics, first aid and do-it-yourself. People find it very difficult now to get men to do work for them. These &ldquo;do-it-yourself&rdquo; programmes have been transmitted on the English channels and have been very successful. We have had some lessons on first aid recently.  I should like to see them continuing and being extended. Also, I should like to see the hours of broadcasting of Radio na Gaeltachta extended.  During the playing of our national anthem at night we see some nice scenery but we see the <Col N="1104" /> same thing every night.  Perhaps some sub-titles could be inserted to show the names of these places.  Perhaps also the scenes could be changed from time to time which would be an opportunity of helping our tourist efforts.</P>
    <P>Again I should like to stress the importance of extending the telephone service to the people who need it.  I know the question of priorities enters in here but, in the case of a city such as Galway with a growing demand, this question is becoming more and more urgent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank those who contributed to this debate&mdash;beginning with the Opposition spokesman on this subject&mdash;for having made it, on the whole, a very constructive and positive discussion.  With just one exception now, almost all Deputies who contributed discussed this Estimate in a general and constructive way.</P>
      <P>I should like to acknowledge the tributes paid from both sides of the House, the many tributes, to the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. These are a feature of this debate each year and I think they give considerable and well earned satisfaction to the staff of the Department to know that their efforts and dedication are appreciated and that that appreciation finds expression where it should, through the representatives of the people in this House. This it particularly so when, through no fault of their own but through an enormous expansion in demand for certain services&mdash;I am referring to the telephone service in particular&mdash; these services cannot for the moment be fully satisfactory, giving ground for difficulties both to the public and to the staff.  Even in these trying circumstances the fact that Members of this House have shown their appreciation of the services of the staff of the Department is, I think, a very good thing.  It reflects well on the Department and, if I may say so, also on the House.  Many Deputies also paid tribute to the courtesy shown by the staff of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This quality has been shown over <Col N="1105" /> the years and my sole concern as Minister in that area is that these high standards shall be maintained during my period of office.  Some Deputies also paid tribute to the high standard of labour relations which has prevailed in the postal services. Here, tribute is due both to the unions and associations involved and to the officials in charge in this period of time of the often delicate and complex negotiations with the staff. One hesitates to cheer too loudly. One wants to express satisfaction for what has been achieved but there is always a danger in labour relations that some difficulties may arise in the course of time and one cannot afford to be complacent about what has been achieved so far.  However it is in itself something to be welcomed and we must hope it will continue like that.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested occasionally outside the House and once or twice, but not often, in it, that as Minister I have shown myself much more concerned with what has been described as the more glamorous aspects of my Department's work, those arising in connection with broadcasting, and not enough concerned with the bread and butter services, as they are described, postal services and telecommunications.  I think and I hope this is not true, but I can understand how it arises.  The broadcasting aspects of my Department's work are more suited to discussion in terms of ideas; they lend themselves more to discussion than do the more prosaic work connected with telecommunications.  People in general do not want to discuss the ideology of telephoning at any length; they just want the Department to get on with the job of providing telephones and maintaining the standard of service.  That also is what I want. But broadcasting does lend itself to controversy and discussion&mdash;that is its nature.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact that broadcasters and other journalists have a very strong&mdash;and professionally&mdash;a healthy interest in broadcasting.  They are more interested in what is said about that than in what is said about other things.  For example, in my introductory <Col N="1106" /> statement on this Estimate I think I gave about half the time to discussion of the postal services and telecommunications but the published accounts of the speech and the broadcast account concentrated very much more on what I said about broadcasting.  For the reasons I have mentioned I am not complaining about that; it was quite natural.  So, the public could easily have the impression that the Minister had been talking only, or almost only about broadcasting and had been neglecting his other functions.  I do not think that is so; I think I have given, as I ought, as much of my time, activity and thought to the question of postal services and telephones as any of my predecessors.</P>
    <P>In replying to this debate I hope to be forgiven if I do so at some length. In dealing with the debate regarding an Estimate which involves such a great amount of public money and which has such important implications for the public in general including the business community and such implications for economic development, I think it is important that I should try to answer as best I can the points made in the course of the debate.  Perhaps I was wrong last year in making a rather short reply.  It might be better to reply at a length that might be found excessive rather than be too skimpy.  I propose to follow that in future years, as long as I am Minister in charge of this Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to proceed by first answering as best I can the points made by Deputy Brugha as spokesman for the Opposition.  I should like to take those points as a chapter in themselves, as it were, because he speaks for his party in this matter. Then I should like to consider points made by individual Deputies about first, postal services, then telecommunications, then broadcasting.  I should then like to deal with an aspect on which Deputy Colley touched, the cultural aspect involving the concept of the national culture as set down in the Broadcasting Act and the implications of that concept.  These are very widespread and stretch in many directions in our life.  When other Deputies <Col N="1107" /> referred to this I intervened&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle showed signs of limiting the discussion on the cultural aspect&mdash;and I made a point, while Deputy Colley was speaking, of expressing the hope that some latitude would be afforded to Deputies in discussing the concept of national culture contained in the Broadcasting Act.  I believe some latitude was accorded and I hope when I come to deal with that aspect I shall receive the same consideration.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to come to the question connected with that of culture but at the same time distinct, the question of the Irish language and its role in broadcasting.  I shall try to take into account the main points made here.  I shall strive to deal with all the points raised particularly on the Opposition side, as I think is usual.</P>
    <P>I should first like to thank Deputy Brugha for the constructive way in which he opened the discussion.  He set a keynote for the debate which made it a very useful one in respect of the contributions of all those who were there to hear what was said.  I shall now take up the various points he made.  First he suggested the engagement of consultants to examine the operations of the Central Sorting Office and he expressed a wish to see the system in operation there.  The Department considered from time to time the employment of consultants to examine mail handling operations but decided against that course.  The matter is under consideration again now.  I am impressed by the point made by the Deputy and I shall try to ensure that the consideration given to this matter shall be as sympathetic as possible.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that the Department are unceasing in their efforts to find more efficient and more economic methods of mail handling and distribution.  The Department keep in touch with postal developments in other administrations with a view to their adoption if they appear to offer advantages.  This practice will be kept up and is encouraged by the Deputy's comments.  I will have great pleasure in making arrangements for the Deputy <Col N="1108" /> to visit the Central Sorting Office at his convenience, or to visit any other postal installations or installations falling within the ambit of the Vote for Posts and Telegraphs which he may wish to visit.  It is most important for the continuity of development of the postal services that the spokesman for the Opposition shall be kept in the picture as fully as possible and I will try to do that with Deputy Brugha so long as both of us remain in our present respective positions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha suggested the issue of a commemorative stamp in connection with the bicentenary of the American Declaration of Independence.  That suggestion has been noted for consideration when the 1976 stamp programme is being drawn.  Personally I think it is a good idea and I believe it will be acted on.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to developments in satellite communication in connection with open broadcasting and said that as the satellite system advances nobody will worry about what station anyone is looking at in Ireland.  My Department's information is that the possibility of direct reception in people's homes of television programmes broadcast by satellite is some years ahead.  The estimate I am given is that it is probably at least ten years. In any case these would be additional, not duplicated, channels.  A special roof top dish aerial would be needed and the television sets available at present would not be capable of receiving such programmes.  Although all this has certainly a bearing on the subject, it is rather in the middle rather than in the fairly near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha remarked that there was considerable public feeling about the potential cost of television licences and he raised the point as to whether the financing of RTE would continue to be based entirely on licence fees and advertising or whether a subsidy might have to be introduced to enable RTE to cope with external competition.  On the whole it seems reasonable that as far as possible the costs of the television service should be borne by the users rather than the taxpayers.  Viewers are prepared to pay much more than <Col N="1109" /> the cost of the present licence fee for hiring sets and for a piped television service.  The possibility of providing a subsidy to RTE at some stage in the future is not ruled out.  If the alternative to a subsidy was to permit a deterioration in the services as a result of competition, thus affecting the livelihood of the performers as well as the quality of our life and our culture, I would be prepared to recommend the Government to ask the Dáil for a subsidy in this area and I am sure support would be forthcoming. As long as we can get along with the licence fee plus advertising revenue, it seems prudent to continue to proceed in this manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha referred to the high cost of collecting licence fees&mdash; a very valid point&mdash;and suggested that the possibility of engaging a body such as the ESB to collect the fees should be investigated.  The cost of collecting licence fees is now of the order of £500,000 per year and represents about 11 per cent of gross receipts.  The grant-in-aid paid to RTE is equivalent to the licence fee receipts less the collection costs. Quite rightly RTE are concerned about this matter.  The Broadcasting Review Committee consulted the ESB about the possibility of collecting the licence fees with the board's accounts but the difficulties put forward by the board seemed at the time to make this impracticable.  I am aware that the authority have been in touch&mdash;whether formally or not I do not know&mdash;with the ESB in this matter and they are continuing to explore this possibility.  I do not know whether it will prove to be practical, but if it does prove to be practical I am very much attracted by it.  Anything that will enable the licence fees to be collected efficiently at less cost is something which any Minister, as well as RTE, would welcome.</P>
    <P>RTE propose that responsibility for collecting the licence fees should be transferred to the authority and the Broadcasting Review Committee recommended that this be done; this is without prejudice to the ESB matter if that works out.  The recommendations <Col N="1110" /> of the committee are being considered at present.  It is not at all clear that RTE or any other body would necessarily be able to collect the licence fees at a lower cost than the Department.  The Department are now in a better position to deal with the problem of licence evasion because of information which television dealers must supply under the provisions of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1972.  This information would not necessarily be available to RTE or to another body charged with the collection.</P>
    <P>The possibility of securing more efficient collection by computerisation of the system is being considered.  A feasibility study of computer processing of licence fee collection work is in progress to establish if any significant savings would accrue from computerisation.  Any such savings would be passed on to RTE.  The position at present is that we are trying to improve the efficiency of licence fee collection within the present system in the Department but we are not ruling out <i>a priori</i> other methods of collection. These are being explored by RTE and our door will always be open to consider any reasonable suggestion made in this regard.  It is a question of finding the most efficient method of collecting the fees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha expressed agreement with my intention of encouraging the idea of local broadcasting, both radio and television.  I am sure RTE will bear in mind that this idea or concept, as far as it proves feasible, has the support not only of the Government but of the Dáil and therefore it may be regarded as a permanent direction of policy.  The actual developments which follow from this direction of policy will depend on the extent to which actual support for local broadcasting emerges and we are testing that in Cork at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha asked for additional information on the programme for improving reception of our TV service and inquired if the improvements covered the whole country. The improvements will be throughout the country; the larger areas where <Col N="1111" /> reception will be improved are portions of Tipperary, Longford, Cavan, Roscommon, Leitrim, Donegal and Monaghan.  RTE also intend to provide 40 to 50 low power transposers to improve reception for smaller communities where the geographical features of the areas result in poor reception.  These areas include districts in Cork, Kerry, Donegal, Waterford, Wicklow and Clare.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that grants be made available to local community groups to enable them to erect their own transposers to improve television reception in their areas.  I understand that when RTE's programme is completed there will still be some small pockets throughout the country where, because of the nature of the terrain and the small population, the provision of special facilities to improve reception would be very difficult and the cost per household prohibitive.  A recent estimate puts the cost of a low power transposer at between £2,000 and £3,000.  It may be that some local communities may be able to improve reception in their areas at reasonable cost by providing a communal aerial system and RTE would, no doubt, be prepared to give them the help they gave to the people of Leap, County Cork, who provided a system of this kind.  I should like to see that kind of development go ahead and that it be brought to the attention of local communities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha referred to my comments on the report of the Broadcasting Review Committee and he thought they might have been trenchant on some of the committee members.  I sought to indicate that what I was commenting on was certainly not any of the members but what struck me as a large lacuna in the report.  I pointed out that this might have resulted from a certain failure to agree among the members which led to unanimity with a gap and I thought that was a pity.  I did not intend to reflect in any way on any of the members personally and it would be very wrong for me to do so.</P>
    <P>Referring to the action taken under <Col N="1112" /> section 31 of the Act and the dismissal of the authority by my predecessor, he was sure that anybody looking at the recent events in this country would certainly not be left in any doubt as to the possible consequences of and irresponsibility of allowing on television and radio newscasts people who can inflame society.  The Deputy's remarks are regarded as indicating support for the retention of the directive until new legislation is passed to replace section 31 and I accept them as that.  It is not necessary at this stage to go over past events.</P>
    <P>One of the more important comments which Deputy Brugha made was that he did not support the establishment of a broadcasting commission and an RTE management board as recommended by the Broadcasting Review Committee.  I think he added in his opening remarks that at that stage he had not consulted his party on the matter but I would infer from the fact that no one who spoke in this debate supported the idea of a broadcasting commission and RTE management board that on this matter we also have consensus and I am glad as always of that.</P>

      <P>I quite understand that.  He supported the legislative declaration proposed by the Broadcasting Review Committee in lieu of section 17 of the Act of 1960. As I said in my opening statement, I am in sympathy with the general idea that the wording used in section 17 needs to be widened to go beyond:</P>
      <P>restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture.</P>
      <P>I welcome the general direction of the phrase used by the Broadcasting Review Committee which is:</P>
      <P>safeguarding, strengthening and enriching the cultural, social and economic fabric of the whole of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying I am committed to that exact wording but I want to go <Col N="1113" /> in that direction and I shall have quite a lot more to say on that subject later in this closing statement.</P>
    <P>What I did question in my opening statement in this area is whether it is desirable that there should be a legislative declaration on the purpose of broadcasting in Ireland.  It can be argued that it would be undesirable to lay down any fixed formula for the purpose, however comprehensive, since the flexibility required by broadcasting is best served by the freedom of the authority acting as public trustees.  The matter is one which will need to be examined closely before a decision is reached and, of course, is of its nature a matter which we will have occasion to discuss here in debating the legislation which I propose to introduce on broadcasting later in the year.</P>
    <P>On the question of open broadcasting Deputy Brugha considered that there is quite a difference between providing a complete external channel here and allowing cable television services to distribute external programmes. I agree that open broadcasting and cable television are not the same thing.  However, there does seem to be a basic contradiction between the recommendation of the Broadcasting Review Committee that cable television should be allowed full freedom to develop and bring British programmes to Dublin and perhaps 30 other cities and towns and its objection to open broadcasting of British services.  Again this is a matter to which I shall return at a later stage of the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha suggested that the true concept of open broadcasting if it is to be outside Ireland should relate not alone to Britain but to Europe.  I would agree.  In fact I would agree that ideally it should apply and maybe will apply some day not only to Europe but to the world but in practice, of course, with the present state of technology and other difficulties in communication there are all sorts of practical difficulties which seem for the moment to rule out open broadcasting within Europe. There are language problems, the small number of television broadcasting channels available, the <Col N="1114" /> limited range of present television transmitters&mdash;about 60 miles&mdash;the prohibitive cost of importing TV signals from distant countries by microwavelength or cable and so on.</P>
    <P>I have tried to stress again and again, but the message does not seem to be received, and that is no doubt my fault, that open broadcasting is really a limitless horizon, a direction in which we want to go, if that is what we have made up our minds to do, but that there will not be any morning in which we wake up and say open broadcasting has now been achieved unless that is a moment when anyone any place can tune in to any station in the world.  On that day we will be able to say open broadcasting has arrived.  I want for the moment to achieve progress in a variety of choice, a real and acceptable variety of choice.  I will come back to that again also.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha expressed concern at the possibility of handing over a television channel to a foreign broadcasting corporation.  I hope I can set the Deputy's anxieties, which I appreciate are real, at rest.  There is no question of handing over control of a television channel.  The Government, whatever happens, will retain ultimate control of all the Irish broadcasting network.  There will not be interference from the day to day programme schedule if BBC is rebroadcast here but the Government will always retain the right to reallocate a second channel if something more central to our needs comes along.  That will always be kept open and that has been made clear to those with whom we are negotiating in this area.  There is no question of handling over control to anyone outside this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha urged me to plan ahead with a view to providing through a new channel as wide a choice as possible to all regions of the country and of providing, if possible, RTE with alternative means of programme. He said the great disadvantage from which RTE suffer is the fact that they are restricted to one outlet only.  I appreciate they are restricted in having only one television <Col N="1115" /> service and I also appreciate that their concern to have more than one is dictated by quite legitimate professional considerations and the desire to carry out better than they can at present the tasks entrusted to them.  However the difficulty is that representations from the single channel area indicate that providing a choice of programme by means of a second RTE service would not be as acceptable to the majority of viewers in the single channel area as the rebroadcasting of a Northern Ireland programme.</P>
    <P>I understand the fact that that is so is disappointing to RTE and I also appreciate they will try to persuade people that that is the way we ought to move.  They are perfectly entitled to do that, but for the moment I as Minister have to accept what I believe to be the facts, that a second RTE service is not as acceptable to the majority in the single channel area as the rebroadcasting concept which I am exploring.  It is, therefore, necessary to explore fully the possibility of providing a choice of programmes by rebroadcasting a Northern Ireland television channel.</P>
    <P>The decision taken last autumn to provide a network of transmitters and microwavelengths for a second service will mean that time will be saved when all the information needed is available to enable the Government then to decide between rebroadcasting a Northern Ireland service and providing a second RTE service.  I think those are the main points raised by Deputy Brugha.  As I say, in relation to the more important points, and many of them were important, I shall be coming back to them later.  I am now dealing with subject headings.</P>
    <P>The first subject heading I wish to consider is the question of the postal services and the points made on these by various Deputies.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy John Kelly, in the course of a very useful intervention here, suggested that our network of post offices should be used as a kind of makeshift banking system in the event of another long bank strike.  I think he has in mind something like the Giro system <Col N="1116" /> which is at present operated by the British Post Office and by postal administrations in many other countries. This matter is primarily one for the Department of Finance, although it also affects my Department, who would be consulted in any development here.  The Post Office have so far taken the view that until there is a strong demand for the Giro service and a clear indication that this would pay its way the matter cannot be given a very high priority in view of the many demands on the resources of the Department.  I do not say this as excluding consideration of this idea.</P>
    <P>This idea deserves and will receive continued consideration both in the Department of Finance, which is the Department primarily concerned, and my own Department.  It would not be possible to introduce a Giro system quickly and for obvious reasons there could be no question of introducing it as a temporary arrangement during another bank strike.  That will not be done; and I think Deputies on reflection will see for themselves why it cannot be done and why it should not be attempted.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach seems to have misunderstood something in my opening statement. Perhaps I did not formulate it sufficiently clearly.  I did not say that the Universal Postal Union would be meeting here shortly.  In fact, no such meeting has been arranged.  He asked why it is proposed to replace the present series of definitive stamps. Consideration of the replacement of the present series is one of the tasks that has been given to the reconstituted Stamp Design Advisory Committee. Although there is no fixed international convention as to how often a definitive series should last periods of currency of less than ten years are common in other administrations.  If a series is current for too long important elements of originality, freshness and relevance tend to be lost.  For these reasons it is desirable that the Department also issue new definitive series from time to time.  There are changes in our society and our culture &mdash;I shall be talking about these&mdash;and I think it is appropriate for these <Col N="1117" /> reasons that we should not adhere fixedly to one set of symbolic designs.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary obviously had considerable affection for the earliest stamps of this State.  It was decided to replace them and if we are operating on a basis of replacing them we should continue to do this from time to time, not just change it once.  Other people who spoke in this debate, among them Deputy Griffin from this side, showed that among many people there was a welcome for something new, a change in our definitive series from time to time.  I believe that point of view will probably be more widespread.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to the change of the colour of official vans on the adoption of a new Post Office symbol.  I think he is temperamentally conservative and he does not like people to change the colour and design of things.  I understand that feeling but I think other people feel differently and they have a right also to be considered.  The decision to alter the colour of vans was taken in the interest, more primarily, of road safety.  The new colour, known as marigold yellow, was selected following consultations with the Kilkenny Design Workshops.  Tests have proved that yellow shows up better under different lighting conditions than any other colour.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the change in colour it was also decided to adopt a new Post Office symbol in monogram form, which would be more in keeping with modern trends than the outmoded and rather clumsy &ldquo;P and T&rdquo; which was in use for so long.  The Kilkenny Design workshops were also responsible for the design of the new symbol.</P>
    <P>I should mention here that I have appointed the Chairman of the Kilkenny Design Workshops, Mr. W.H. Walsh, as head of the new Philatelic Committee but I hope to associate Kilkenny, through Mr. Walsh, even more closely than in the past with my Department in connection with questions of design.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also suggested that the use of sealing wax in connection with the registration of <Col N="1118" /> post be done away with.  There is in fact no requirement that sealing wax be used in making up packets for registration.  Various other methods of sealing or fastening may be used provided it is not possible to remove any part of the contents of the letter or parcel without either breaking or tearing the case, wrapper or cover, forcing two adhesive surfaces apart or breaking the seals.</P>
    <P>He also suggested that the Department should take steps to ensure that halldoor letter boxes are of adequate size.  The staff of my Department inform me that they have no evidence that postmen are encountering special difficulty in effecting delivery of letters because of the size of letter boxes in use.  While that is my Department's advice most Deputies will have experience in this area of going around pushing various types of data into letter boxes when canvassing.  I certainly have experienced difficulty sometimes and I know that some letter boxes are far too small.  I think we should have a look at the question of whether, in relation to new buildings, anything can be done to have a more satisfactory standard which would make life more easy for postmen and politicians.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon suggested that, in order to avoid duplication of street names, the Department should make representations to local authorities in the matter.  The Department do this as soon as they learn that a name assigned to a new road is similar to that in use elsewhere in the same town or city.  Generally speaking, the proposed new name is introduced by the local authority despite the postal objections.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling expressed the hope that I would introduce industrial democracy in the Department, thus enabling workers to participate in the decision-making process in the Department. There is already consultation with the staff over a wide area of the Department's activities and in so far as any proposed changes are likely to affect the interests of the staff&mdash;that applies to any change of any magnitude&mdash;the changes are very fully discussed with the staff representatives <Col N="1119" /> and are agreed with them where possible.  Already, in a large concern such as ours, a considerable measure of industrial democracy in a practical sense already exists.  The position in the Department is different from that in a semi-State body or a large commercial undertaking where there is a board of directors who take the major decisions affecting the undertaking.  There is at present, at any rate, no board in my Department and the major decisions affecting the activities of the Department are taken at ministerial or Government level and industrial democracy in the sense in which Deputy Dowling has used the term does not seem to apply completely. But, as I have said, the reality of industrial democracy to a large extent applies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Moore suggested that a scheme of grants be introduced to brighten sub-offices.  The Department already afford financial assistance to postmasters in connection with alterations to sub-office premises which improve the facilities for the discharge of Post Office business and the appearance of the office.</P>
    <P>One matter in which the sub-postmasters' union approached me was in connection with having a standard sign designed to show where the particular post office is.  I asked the Kilkenny Design Workshop for designs and I have, in fact, approved a design which will come into use and serve, I hope as well as the convenience of the public, to improve in a small way local post offices.  Many of our sub-post offices are inevitably rather old and worn and I agree that as much as possible should be done to improve their appearance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore suggested that unemployment pay orders should be cashable to post offices in Dublin. These orders are cashable in post offices in areas in which there are no employment exchanges and any change in the present arrangement would be a matter in the first instance for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan raised the question of delay in the delivery of letters posted in the Dáil to provincial areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> Correspondence posted in the Dáil before 4 p.m. on Mondays to Fridays, inclusive, is included in night mail dispatches and should get delivered throughout the country on the next working day.  On Saturday the mail is collected at 11 a.m.  While there may be some instances of delay due to unusual or exceptional circumstances there is no good reason to believe that the standard of service in general is not being achieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan and Deputy Gene Fitzgerald suggested that new motorised delivery services should be expedited.  The policy of the Department is to use motor vehicles whenever and wherever the opportunity arises to use such vehicles economically.  Their use involves the amalgamation of two or three posts so that one man can deliver mail over an area previously served by two or three postmen.  In order to avoid the displacement of postmen such services are introduced only when vacancies occur and this naturally slows down the speed at which such deliveries can be introduced. Another factor is the fact that large numbers of postmen are too old for driving duties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney spoke about the queues in certain post offices in Dublin on children's allowance day, the first Tuesday of every month.  He believed the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Social Welfare should introduce a form of payment which would eliminate what he described as &ldquo;this scandal&rdquo;.  Unfortunately if large numbers of people desire to get payment around the same time on a particular day each month, some delay is inevitable.  On the first Tuesday of every month sub-post masters in busy offices usually increase their staff.  Neither the sub-postmasters nor the Department could be expected to provide staff on the scale expected to meet a big demand on one day in every month.  Some form of standard payment would be required to reduce that big demand to an acceptable level, but that might inconvenience those who are in receipt of children's allowances and wish to cash them.  It seems very difficult to solve this problem.  If any Deputies have suggestions I shall be very glad to consider them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> Deputy Power asked who designs our stamps.  The subjects for stamps are decided by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the question of recommending designs for the subjects chosen is then entrusted to a special committee of outside experts. The committee advises on the designers to be commissioned.  Most of these have been Irish.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power also referred to the purchasing of Irish goods as far as possible. I quite agree with this policy and Deputies may be interested to know that in 1973 the Post Office Stores Branch placed contracts to the value of £18 million and the cost of articles assembled in the State accounted for £10 million of that amount.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power also spoke about the need to ensure the encouragement of a policy of saving both in primary and post-primary schools as well as factories and other places of work.  A great deal of work is being done in this field under the National Savings Committee established by the Minister for Finance.  Savings schemes have been established in hundreds of schools and factories and a large volume of literature aimed at encouraging saving has been and is being distributed.</P>
    <P>There were a number of complaints, quite naturally and properly, about services in local areas.  Deputy Blaney complained that for some years past letters posted in the GPO after 6 p.m. do not secure delivery in Donegal the next morning.  If the Department had not been compelled to introduce routing changes in December 1971, because of violence in Northern Ireland &mdash;that was the year of the aggressive campaign by the IRA&mdash;the standard of service to Donegal would have been maintained and items posted after 6 p.m. in Dublin would have secured delivery the next morning.  The effect of the routing changes is that the time available in Dublin for the dispatch of night mail to Donegal has been reduced and correspondence not posted until the late afternoon occasionally fails to secure dispatch until the next day.  The possibility of securing full clearance of such mails is being especially examined at the <Col N="1122" /> moment, but I do not see much chance of any major improvements in the situation while the violence which necessitates the re-routing continues. Violence, as well as having major tragic consequences also brings in its train minor inconveniences, of which this is one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins suggested Tramore should have a departmentally staffed post office instead of a sub-post office. The sub-post office works well and is particularly suited to places like Tramore.  Places of equal, or greater, importance are satisfactorily served by sub-post offices.  The position in relation to Tramore was fully explained to a deputation of Waterford County Council, Tramore Town Commissioners and a number of local Deputies on 27th March last.  Steps are being taken to fill the vacancy of postmaster in Tramore post office.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon suggested an afternoon delivery should be introduced in Tallaght, particularly to the industrial estate there.  There is a second delivery every day in Cookstown and Ayrton.  As a general policy second deliveries are not extended to newly developing areas because the cost would be out of proportion and it is consequently not intended to extend the second delivery in Tallaght.  People living in areas not served by a second delivery can call to the local post office and pick up their mail there without any cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins mentioned the proposed office block in Waterford city to house the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and other Departments.  The original project included accommodation for the Revenue Commissioners as well as the Post Office.  Sketch plans were approved last year.  The Office of Public Works subsequently decided that the site of the proposed development was insufficient to meet the expanding needs of both Departments and they intend to secure a new site to cater for the Revenue Commissioners' requirements.  The existing site will be used for the post office. Sketch plans are at present under examination; they provide for a new telephone exchange and improved <Col N="1123" /> facilities for postal work.  The Office of Public Works are unable to forecast when the building will be ready but every effort is being made to expedite matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon expressed concern about the adequacy of the new post office premises in Tallaght.  It has been recognised for some time that accommodation there for counter services is inadequate.  After many fruitless attempts to secure alternative accommodation the Department finally succeeded in securing St. Dominick's Hall and the work of adapting and equipping it is expected to be completed in a matter of months and the counter services will be transferred there immediately afterwards.  It is believed that the accommodation in these premises will be sufficient to cater for local needs for the next few years.  As the area develops, the question of providing whatever additional offices are needed will be considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon also raised the question of providing relief for overloaded posts in the Tallaght area. Delivery arrangements in the area <Col N="1124" /> were revised on 20th May when appropriate relief was provided for overloaded posts.  The staff are satisfied with the new arrangements but the position will be kept under regular review and further adjustments made whenever necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any connection between the Executive Commission's recommendation that we should apply for this help to offset our balance of payments problem and the fact that this morning it was announced in the papers that the Government were floating a very big loan on the international market?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe there is.  It states here that the net capital inflow in 1974 is expected to be in excess of £200 million.  This would more than cover the expected current deficit in the balance of payments of £160 million, of which about £100 million is attributable to the effects of higher oil prices.  Included in the expected capital inflow is foreign borrowing for the Exchequer amounting to approximately £125 million.</P>

      <P>As the reports of the National Prices Commission referred to by the Deputy have stressed the cost of soft drinks brought for domestic consumption is much less if packed in returnable bottles rather than in non-returnable containers.  One would have hoped that a cost-conscious public would have forced the greater use of returnable bottles but so far this has not been the case.  The great variety of sizes, shapes and prices of containers and the nature of outlets would make it difficult if not impossible to prescribe rules about the return of returnable bottles.  I should certainly wish to encourage the increasing use of returnable containers and I shall ask the National Consumers Advisory Council if they can make any suggestions as to how best this could be done.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is desirable that people should be encouraged to return them not alone from the costing point of view but from the disposal point of view afterwards. It amazes me how disposable bottles are got rid of and I feel sure local authorities have quite a problem in collecting this refuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is a desirable that returnable containers should be used as much as possible but many goods are sold through supermarkets and self-service outlets nowadays and these people are very space conscious. The space occupied by an empty <Col N="1134" /> bottle is the same as that occupied by a full bottle and for this reason they are not keen to promote the sale of goods in returnable bottles.  This is part of the problem.</P>

      <P>It is the statutory function of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to determine whether or not any particular person is entitled to receive a medical card.  Before issuing a medical card the chief executive officer must establish whether the applicant is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself and his dependants.  It is therefore necessary to examine the applicant's means.</P>
      <P>Where an applicant is in receipt of social assistance following a means test he is normally regarded as being entitled to a medical card without further assessment.  Thus a person with a non-contributory old age pension would get a medical card without a further means test.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that &ldquo;multiple structural defects&rdquo; have not been detected in the Ballymun flats or elsewhere where the Balancy system of construction has been used, and that there is no question of &ldquo;imminent danger&rdquo; in these flats <Col N="1136" /> as alleged by the Deputy.  During routine inspections, in the course of normal maintenance, officers of the corporation discovered that, in a small number of the flats at Ballymun, there had been slight expansion and contraction of the concrete, probably due to temperature variations. The position was investigated first by the corporation's technical officers and later by these officers and expert structural engineering consultants.  The experts concluded that these movements did not pose any danger to the residents but decided that the nature and extent of the movements should be monitored scientifically over a period of time, to establish if the movement is continuing and what are its causes.  The corporation are making the necessary arrangements in conjunction with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to have this done, and have detenanted a small number of flats to enable the necessary delicate instrumentation to be installed.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the detailed scientific investigations which are proposed by the corporation are the proper method to deal with the present situation, and that it would be entirely unnecessary and inappropriate to hold a public sworn inquiry.  The Deputy can rest assured that if any action is found to be necessary, as a result of the detailed investigations now being put in hands, it will be taken by the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Question Time break I had been discussing the section of my reply which deals with the postal services.  I had almost completed that except for one local matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney pressed for the provision of a post office in the Tolka Valley area of Finglas on the grounds that the distances to be travelled to the nearest post offices were a cause of hardship.  So far as I can ascertain, the distances to the surrounding post offices are no greater than in any other comparable area in Dublin. These post offices are regarded as catering adequately for local needs. As development in the area is still taking place, the need for additional facilities is being kept under review and another post office will be provided if and when it is found to be warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pass to that section of my statement which deals with telecommunications.  I can understand the impatience that has been expressed in this regard, in reasonable terms, by some Deputies, an impatience that undoubtedly reflects the sentiments of the constituents.  However, there is no point in my expressing <Col N="1140" /> impatience in relation to this aspect of my Department.  My job within this Government is to try to bring about an improvement in this area and this has to be done primarily by securing and sustaining an adequate capital inflow.</P>
    <P>This year we have brought about a 73 per cent increase in capital inflow compared with last year.  That is a satisfactory or, one might say, almost a dramatic increase in this area.  Certainly it is no more than is required.  Telephones pay for themselves. Therefore, this scale of capital intake is justified.  That is the primary aim.  The improvement of the efficiency of the structure.  To get that capital inflow working to the maximum effect is also a matter for which my Department are responsible.  The present state of the telephone system reflects a partial failure in the past to realise adequately the need for adequate capital inflow.  During the past two years from, say, 1972 on, beginning under the previous administration, there was the begining of a sustained movement forward in this area but this movement came a bit late. The direct effects of the major cutbacks that occurred in the 1970-71 period were still being experienced when I took office and their indirect effects are being experienced yet.  This is an area in which there must be planning ahead.  The effects of what is done do not manifest themselves for between two and three years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley came in to speak on this Estimate today.  I had hoped that he would have said something to us about telephones.  However, he confined his remarks exclusively to broadcasting.  I say this because if any man bears responsibility for the heavy arrears and difficulties in connection with the telephone service, that man is Deputy Colley, who, has Minister for Finance, failed to give any attention to the very strong representations which, quite properly were made to him by his predecessor, Deputy Collins who made the then Minister for Finance aware of what would be the effect of the cuts he intended to carry out.  So far as I can ascertain, the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="1141" /> did not as much as receive a reply to his representations, at least not in writing.  Those admonitions and warnings are now, unfortunately, being fulfilled.  I may have criticised Deputy Collins as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs but I should like to place on the record my recognition, as his successor, of his having done his best to discharge his main task in relation to telecommunications, that is, the sustaining of an adequate capital inflow.</P>

      <P>I should like now to consider some of the more detailed suggestions made in the course of the debate.  Deputy Edward Collins wondered whether the Department telecommunications services should not be handed over to a private corporation. He is of the opinion that, perhaps, this would result in an increase in efficiency and, consequently, in the provision of a better service.</P>
      <P>The Public Services Organisation review group concludes that it was not feasible to separate the postal and the telecommunications services and they recommended that the Department, like other Departments, should be reorganised on the Aireacht executive agency basis.  The reorganisation of Departments along the lines recommended by the review group are being tried out in selected Departments and the position of the Post Office will be kept under review in the light of the experience in those Departments.  I should add here that the Post Office Users' Council which shall be coming into being shortly &mdash; certainly before the end of the present year &mdash; shall be able also to offer views in regard to that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy G. Fitzgerald asked for details of the major improvements carried out in the telephone service.  I do not quite understand this request because not only did I mention a number <Col N="1142" /> of the more important major improvements in a fairly long list in my opening statement but also in the notes for Deputies which I circulated, particulars of the development of the telephone service in 1973-74 are given in some detail on pages 17, 18 and 19.  It is clear that there have been major improvements as there should be and as this House and country have every right to expect in relation to the money being expanded.</P>
    <P>Many difficulties which were the subject of frequent complaint last year in areas such as Rathmines and Balls-bridge in Dublin, and Clonmel and Dungarvan in the provinces, have been removed as a result of the installation of new exchange equipment.  Some Deputies have acknowledged this in the course of the debate, for example, Deputy Griffin in relation to the Clonmel area.  It is not the case that improvements in the Dublin area are being made at the expense of development in the provinces.  I submit with respect to some of the Deputies concerned, that this is not the type of point which should be made in a debate of this kind.  It is an irrelevant piece of point-scoring.  People in the provinces want a good service in Dublin.  They often have to call Dublin and go through Dublin.  They cannot say &ldquo;forget about Dublin&rdquo;, because that would be wrong.</P>
    <P>The improvements in the service in the Dublin area are important not only for the Dublin local subscribers but also for the large number of trunk calls made to Dublin from the country and abroad.  This is a matter in which there is not a real clash of interests between urban and rural areas.  Subscribers in the rural areas have a right not merely to accept, but to demand improvements in Dublin.  Dublin is one of the areas which has had the greatest difficulty in this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney and others referred to abnormal delays in answering at the Dublin exchanges.  Again, this reflects the phenomenon to which I have just referred, that is, that rural Deputies are as concerned about the Dublin exchange as Dubliners.  These abnormal delays, which I very much <Col N="1143" /> regret, were due to a number of causes, the principal being difficulties in the automatic system which result in abnormal demands being made for assistance on the manual exchange. The result is that with the staff and numbers of switchboard positions available, it is not practicable to answer many calls without delay.  The very steep growth in the numbers of international calls has also been a factor.  Most of the work of one of the four existing manual exchanges is now devoted to handing international calls.  There is ground for hope for a real improvement here in the fairly near future.  I do not want to exaggerate the extent of the improvement, but I hope it will be quite presentable.</P>
    <P>When the new international exchange, with more sophisticated equipment, is open to take over this work later this month&mdash;indeed, I think I am due to open it next Saturday&mdash;we hope that the service from &ldquo;10&rdquo; will be improved.  However, until the manual exchanges can be relieved of quite a lot of work which should be handled automatically by equipment, it is unlikely that it will be practicable to give the kind of prompt answering service which we would like to give at all times.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney made a strong plea for the reintroduction of the &ldquo;call-back&rdquo; procedure for trunk calls.  We would like to be able to meet his request in this regard, but in the conditions prevailing, with operators fully occupied in trying to answer calls and to connect them to the numbers required as quickly as possible, it is just not practicable to do so.</P>
    <P>On the question of adequate staffing of exchanges referred to by Deputy Blaney, I should like to repeat that some 1,250 telephonists have been recruited throughout the country since last summer and some 200 are at present at training in Dublin alone. There is, therefore, no question of cutting back on staffing requirements. Quite the opposite.  The difficulty is that in a number of exchanges we have not got the accommodation at present to enlarge the existing switchboard equipment.  Again, we are trying to cope with that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> Suggestions were made that additional groups of applicants should be included in the priority categories of applications for telephones.  At present, priority applications approximate to about 40 per cent of total demand, which is really remarkably high.  Any increase in this proportion is considered undesirable.  In regard to the point made by Deputy Power, applications for telephone service where priority is claimed on grounds of disability, are especially considered.  The priority categories are reviewed from time to time with a view to ensuring that generally they represent the classes of persons for whom the telephone service is essential.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes suggested that the priority system is being abused.  I do not think it is.  I would welcome from any Deputy who thinks it is being abused any evidence to that effect and I will certainly consider it and communicate with him in any particular case.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon referred to the need for the Department to cooperate with other organisations providing underground plant to reduce as much as possible the dislocation caused by road or pathway openings. My Department keep in touch with local authorities, developers and other bodies, for example, to lay new duct lines when new roads are being constructed and we are endeavouring to develop these contacts as far as possible. Road or pathway openings made by the Department in the course of their essential work are re-instated in as satisfactory a manner as is possible as soon as completion of the work in hand permits.  Local authorities usually carry out the permanent reinstatement work and as soon as possible after the telephone works are completed, my Department request them to have this reinstatement work done.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon also said he had complaints from people in the Tallaght area that telephone applications in that area are not dealt with in chronological order.  I referred to this matter before.  Priority applications are, of course, taken out of the queue and given special attention.  That is <Col N="1145" /> what we mean by &ldquo;priority&rdquo;.  Apart from this, applications which it has been necessary to defer, are generally dealt with according to date of application but this is in all cases, subject to availability of plant and equipment. Provision of underground cabling in new housing estates, for example, is dependent on development of the estate and it may well be that cable becomes available for a later applicant before it can be provided for an earlier one.  It is this structural difficulty which accounts for most of the complaints which one hears on this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Kelly, Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, asked for an assurance that unauthorised interception of telephone calls&mdash;telephone tapping&mdash;was not taking place.  We would be very concerned indeed if there were evidence or reason to believe that unauthorised interception &mdash;that is, interception not duly authorised by the Minister for Justice was occurring within the telephone system.  My Department now, as in the past, are prepared fully to cooperate with the Minister for Justice in what might be required in this area. For obvious reasons, however, we are not in a position to give the kind of assurance sought, that is, that unauthorised interception will never take place.  Nobody can guarantee that.</P>
    <P>Apart from officers of the Department who have in the course of their work immediate access to exchange lines, switchboards, trunk lines, and so forth through which calls are made, it remains technically impossible for any person with the necessary skill and means who has or can gain physical access to the system throughout the country&mdash;whether within or outside telephone buildings, in subscriber's premises or by interfering with wires and cables&mdash;to listen in to calls.  This applies to telephone systems all over the world and is a factor which in common prudence all of us who use the telephone system should be aware of.</P>
    <P>Apart from taking certain precautionary measures, one must rely to a large extent on the integrity of telephone staffs not to engage or cooperate <Col N="1146" /> in unauthorised interception of calls.  Crossed lines and some other faults in the system usually associated with congestion may and do cause accidental overhearing.  Because at present there is an acknowledged state of congestion in the telephone system, we hear so many complaints about crossed lines.  This is very regrettable and undesirable but it can only be eliminated by eliminating the congestion which causes the problem.  That in turn can only be done by adequate investment.  This is something which no telephone organisation has succeeded in eliminating but we hope that the cause which gives rise to it will be eliminated as improvements are effected.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said the Department should, on aesthetic grounds, take down their overhead plants in towns. The objections to poles and cables are appreciated and an increasing proportion of the Department's plant is now being put underground. In new housing estates most of the cabling is placed underground. Arrangements are made with the builders to lay ducts at the building stage.  However, while we have such huge arrears of construction work to be done to meet public demand, we cannot afford, apart from cost considerations, to devote as much effort as we should like to taking down overhead plant purely on aesthetic grounds.  I think the public would understand such a system of priority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly also referred to the possibility of ineffective calls being metered as effective calls.  The meters are designed to start a call only when a person lifts the instrument at the called end.  The meters used by the Department are supplied and installed by reputable contractors.  They are manufactured to a high standard of quality and accuracy.  Meters will, of course, record if one dials a wrong number.  There is no immediate remedy for this other than to claim a refund.  The Department readily meet this and other kinds of <i>bona fide</i> claims in relation to telephone accounts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan referred to delays in completing installation of the telephone service and mentioned an applicant <Col N="1147" /> who had been offered a refund. As I mentioned in my opening statement, the severe storms last winter necessitated the diversion of staff from insulation work to the repair of the widespread damage caused.  This seriously disrupted the installation programme and caused heavy delay in the provision of service for many applicants. In these cases, refunds of advance money paid were offered, with collection later when the Department would be in a position to start installation work.  The provision of service in these outstanding places is being accorded the highest priority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power asked whether I had satisfied myself as to what had occurred in relation to the restoration of telephones to the fire brigade and ambulance service in Maynooth.  As I already advised the Deputy by letter on 12th March last, I had full inquiries made in the matter.  There was a conflict of evidence and it was not possible to establish beyond doubt when the lines were restored.  In my letter I renewed my assurances to the Deputy that the telephone service to the fire brigade and ambulance service would be given top priority for maintenance. I should like to thank Deputy Power for his courteous references to the manner in which his representations were dealt with by the Department and by myself.</P>
    <P>Mhol an Teachta Geoghegan líne telefóin a thógáil díreach idir Cor na Móna agus an Mám.  Ar an ngnáthbhealach, ba chosúil gurbh ionmholta é seo ó thárla gan an dá áit seo ach cúig mhíle go leith ó chéile.

    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> Deputy Blaney asked that consideration be given to the introduction of timing on local calls.  This is one of the aspects of the telephone tariff structure which comes under review periodically.  Timing of local calls is not considered practicable at present &mdash;the installation of additional equipment at every automatic exchange throughout the country would be necessary.  In present conditions this suggestion, if adopted, would cause operating difficulties at many manual exchanges.  However, the matter is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney also referred to a number of recent telephone interruptions to the west and the north-west. These were mostly caused by damage to the western coaxial cable by road works.  The Department have tried to eliminate or at least greatly reduce this kind of interruption by seeking the co-operation of local authorities and roadwork contractors, in particular by asking them to advise the Department in advance of their proposals so that a post office engineer could attend to ensure that damage is not caused to cables.  However, it has proved very difficult to get roadwork contractors to take sufficient care in regard to potential danger of damage to telephone cables because of the use of bulldozers and so forth.  Our efforts in this regard are being renewed.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government referred to the problem of providing a telephone service for the people of the Black Valley in Kerry.  This problem has been extensively considered on a number of times by the Department but there does not, unfortunately, appear to be any way of providing a service that would not be prohibitively costly.  A solution by using a short wave air link would not be considered feasible both because of the high degree of interference and because a short wave system is not considered technically suitable for connection to the public network.  If cost of the order required to give service to the relatively small number of households were incurred in this case, it would be difficult to resist demands for the provision of kiosks in other <Col N="1149" /> remote areas, regardless of the cost involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley also asked when an automatic service would be available in the Kerry Gaeltacht.  It is planned to convert Dingle exchange to automatic working in about four years. Conversion of the other smaller exchanges in the area will follow as soon as possible afterwards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney suggested that kiosks were not provided on a uniform basis and that he believed his constituency had not been treated as well as the rest of the country.  Uniform criteria are used for providing kiosks for rural areas.  There are approximately 1,800 kiosks outside Dublin and of these 97 are located in County Donegal.  The same Deputy suggested that kiosks are provided in rural areas only where they are expected to be self-supporting.  This is not the case, as has been explained several times. In urban areas, kiosks are provided only where they are likely to pay their way, but in rural areas they are being provided on an increasingly subsidised scale according as the facilities are being extended to areas which show lower and lower use of existing public telephones.  If there is any question of discrimination here, it is in the urban areas that are discriminated against.  We realise the demand in rural areas and we are trying to meet that as far as it can be met without involving the State in altogether excessive expenditure in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputies McMahon and Dowling mentioned the problem of kiosk vandalism.  The Department has had this problem under constant examination. Various measures have been taken to make public telephone kiosks more resistant to damage by vandals. These include the fitting of steel plates to secure the coin boxes, the introduction of specially strengthened coin boxes which has recently begun, and the inclusion in the mechanism of some kiosks of alarm devices.  The question of publicity is also being considered. The need to do everything practicable to curb wanton damage to telephone kiosks is fully recognised, and any help or suggestions towards this end will be welcomed.  Deputy Blaney mentioned a particular difficulty <Col N="1150" /> with the 2p coin slot.  His problem in this regard is probably due to vandalism.  Jamming the coin slot with foreign objects is, unfortunately, a frequent occurrence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher suggested that national schools serving areas of 70 to 80 houses could be taken as suitable sites for kiosks.  It is most unlikely that this criterion could be accepted as it would involve provision of kiosks which would be very little used.  As indicated already, the present system of determining priorities will continue until a better system can be devised and, in any event, until the current year's programme, which is full, has been completed.  This whole matter is being considered at the present time and the Deputy's suggestion will be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power and other Deputies referred to the telex service.  There is generally very little complaint regarding the quality of the telex service.  A large new exchange is at present in service under test conditions.  This will cater for more subscribers and a big expansion in international telex traffic.  Plans for the future include the expansion of the telex service to about 60 other countries or areas later this year.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government referred to a dispute that affected a number of telephone exchanges in parts of the south west of the country on two week-ends recently, and he expressed the hope that there would be an early settlement of the dispute. He also said that the Department should have advertised locally and nationally that there would be inconvenience and that the names of neighbouring exchanges that were open should have been given.  The action taken by the postmasters concerned was unofficial and has since stopped.  Negotiations on the subject matter of the dispute are to take place shortly between the postmasters' union and the Department.  It was not possible to advertise in advance the names of the exchanges that would be open and the names of those that would be closed, as the Department had no definite information about what exchanges would be affected by <Col N="1151" /> the closure.  The Department regrets very much the inconvenience caused to the public by the unofficial action of the post masters concerned. Deputy Power said, and I quote from column 565, Volume 272 of 5th June, 1974 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>...there is a political influence at work which could provide a telephone more quickly for somebody who did not need it as quickly as an earlier applicant...</P>
    <P>and at column 566 he said their was evidence of people getting telephones in his own area through political pull.  Nothing is known to support the Deputy's statement.  It is suggested that he should be asked, and I do ask him, to produce the evidence mentioned in his statement.</P>
    <P>The arrangement for cutting off automatic time on local calls from coin boxes was first introduced during the war in 1944 in the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire areas.  It was later extended to the few automatic areas outside Dublin.  It was decided in 1959 not to place further orders for extensions for the arrangement because of cost consideration, the greatly increased numbers of kiosks and rented telephones, and the fact that the purpose of the facility was being circumvented by arrangements whereby the call parties rang back the kiosk. This decision not to go on with this was confirmed in 1963, I believe, when Deputy Hilliard was Minister. On this as on some other matters, perhaps naturally, members of the Opposition call on the Department to do things which they, while in Government, decided to desist from doing, and I shall not make too much of a meal out of that one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Griffin drew attention to delay in telephone calls between Ballyporeen and Mitchelstown.  The principal reason for this is shortage of trunk circuits in Mitchelstown, and the situation is expected to be remedied in the course of the present year.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Fitzpatrick, Dublin, has suggested that telephone meters should be provided in subscribers' premises enabling them to check their telephone accounts in the same way as ESB meters are provided.  A meter can be <Col N="1152" /> provided on a rental basis to record the number of local call units recorded in respect of dialled local and trunk calls.  The meter in the exchange would have to continue to be the one on which accounts are based.  For the information of any Deputy and members of the public who may be interested, the rental is £1.20 a quarter and the connection fee is 15p.  Those who want to have the facility of checking their accounts&mdash;and I appreciate the Deputy's point, which is an interesting one&mdash;should note the existence of these facilities and decide whether they wish to avail themselves of them.</P>
    <P>I would now like to come to the subject of broadcasting about which a number of points were made.  I would like to consider broadcasting under three heads: First, points made about broadcasting in general as a subject of the debate which covered quite a wide range; I think at least half the debate, although I have not checked the figures, was devoted to broadcasting, and about half of my own remarks also, perhaps a little more, will be devoted to the same.  Then I would like to consider the very broad concept of what is called the national culture in relation to broadcasting, and finally the relation of the Irish language, part of the national culture certainly but also to be considered distinct.  Those are the three areas I would like to consider.</P>
    <P>On broadcasting generally, a number of Deputies commented either critically or in a complimentary way on various programmes on RTE.  I think the House understands it is the usage that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on particular broadcasts and especially not on particular broadcasters, but I know that the authority and the broadcasters themselves take careful note of what is said during this debate.  I would only like to make the general point that I was interested in and impressed by the very general support which exists among Deputies, presumably their constituents also, for what is being done in radio.  I think comments in relation to radio tend to be, on the whole, more favourable than those on television.  Perhaps this has something to do with the nature of the medium.  I do not know.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" /> Deputies Moore, Dowling and Blaney suggested that extra money should be provided to improve RTE's existing services, and that if there is to be a second channel it should be operated by RTE.  None of these Deputies comes from the single channel area, and the information available to the Department would suggest that the viewers in the single channel area would not regard a second RTE channel as giving them a real choice if the BBC service can be provided instead.  It is agreed that RTE should be enabled to continue to develop and, in particular, to provide more locallyoriginated material irrespective of what programme service is transmitted on the second channel.</P>
    <P>As I have said in this debate, I am interested in defending the standard of service provided by RTE as against outside competition.  I believe also in permitting more outside competition.  I agree that it increases the financial burden on RTE.  I think the State should meet that burden in order to support not merely present standards but an improvement of the standards. I also believe that the natural and proper way for RTE to meet this competition&mdash;the way in which it can in fact serve its natural audience even in competition&mdash;is by extending the number and improving the quality of home-produced programmes.  I personally would like to see the emphasis on development in RTE go on to that. I do realise that it takes money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha on the open broadcasting concept, which I mentioned at the outset, drew a distinction between relaying the BBC by cable and relaying it by means of transmitters.  He opposed the idea of handling over a television channel to a foreign broadcasting corporation.  There seems to be some slight confusion here.  The actual network of transmitters now being erected&mdash;and this is not just an idea; it is something which is going ahead&mdash; would, of course, remain under State control.  This Government favours using this network to transmit BBC 1, Northern Ireland or UTV.  If, after a few years, the people decide they do not want this type of programme, or if a future Government were to decide that the second network should be <Col N="1154" /> used for something else, then they would, and must, be quite free to take such a decision.  No control would have been lost and nothing would have been handed over.  I hope this will become very clear as a result of this discussion.</P>
    <P>However, the distinction between relaying the BBC by cable and by transmitter, made later in the debate by Deputy Power, expresses a view certainly held by some Members of the Opposition.  Deputy Power said, at column 575 of Volume 273, No. 4 of Wednesday, 5th June, 1974:</P>
    <P>It can be said that the BBC programmes are being beamed to the people in the eastern part of the country at the moment, but there is no official recognition of that. What the Minister has in mind would be likely to give official recognition to that.  The effect would be that we would lose our identity still more.</P>
    <P>In other words&mdash;and this is what I said at the outset in a phrase to which Deputy Colley took very strong exception&mdash;I said that we objected not to listening to the BBC or viewing BBC but to admitting that we listened to and viewed BBC, or that some people did.  Of course, that is exactly what is in that statement by Deputy Power on the record of this House.  In other words, our identity is threatened, not by a certain fact but by the recognition of that fact. I am afraid this attitude is still all too frequent in what used to be called the party of reality.</P>
    <P>For my part, I do not share in the general sense of insecurity about the Irish identity which seems to affect some Members of this House.  I do not feel, as does Deputy Blaney, that we have been weakening as a people for quite a considerable time.  I think we do our best service to the national identity by having the confidence to live our own individual lives in accordance with our own varying tastes and opinions&mdash;and they are varied&mdash;and I shall come back to this matter later, if you will allow me, Sir, in a much more extended way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore urged that the advertising of drink on RTE should be stopped.  This is an interesting <Col N="1155" /> point and I know there is rather widespread feeling to that effect.  The Minister's statutory function in relation to RTE advertising is limited to section 20, subsection (3) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, which lays down that the total daily time fixed by the authority for broadcasting advertisements and the distribution of that time throughout the programme is subject to the approval of the Minister.  Advertisements for spirits&mdash;hard liquors&mdash;are not taken by RTE.  The advertising of other alcoholic drinks accounted for about 7 per cent, £287,000, of RTE's revenue from advertisements in 1972-73.  For some years past there have been criticisms about drink advertisements.  Following joint consultations between the Department of Health, RTE and the Post Office about advertising of alcoholic drinks on television, the authority introduced a stricter code for such advertisements in November, 1973.  The question of advertisements for alcoholic drink on radio and television must be considered in the context of the general question of advertising in all the media.  A complete prohibition on radio and TV advertisements might merely result in diversion of the money formerly spent on these to advertisements in the other media.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore suggested that RTE radio and television transmitters should be increased in power so that they could be received in Britain. RTE television is not receivable in Britain, apart from Wales into which our signals go with much the same effectiveness as Welsh signals come in here along the east coast.  The normal range of a television transmitter is about 60 miles.</P>
    <P>In radio, reception of Athlone transmissions on 530 metres stretches broadly to areas west of a line from Bristol, through Leeds to Edinburgh. The distance at which reception of Irish programmes may be obtained depends, to an extent, upon the sensitivity of receiving and aerial equipment. The Athlone transmitter is being replaced by a more powerful one and this should give improved reception of RTE radio in Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> On the question of colour, Deputy Dowling complained that old age pensioners and veterans of the War of Independence who have colour television sets have to pay for colour television licences.  The Departments of Social Welfare and Defence administer the television licence schemes for certain old age pensioners and veterans of the War of Independence. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs acts as agents for the Departments in operating the scheme.  With the introduction of the special colour licence fee of £15 on 1st October 1973, the Departments of Social Welfare and Defence decided that they would pay for the monochrome element only, £9, in the new fee.  Eligible pensioners with colour television sets are obliged to pay the difference between the cost of a colour licence and a monocrome licence, £6.  Any amendment of the conditions attached to the operation of the scheme is a matter for the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>The question of a shortwave station is something of a perennial.  It was raised by Deputy Dowling and Deputy Blaney also urged that our programmes be beamed outwardly towards Europe.  The Government, in July, 1945, decided that a high power shortwave broadcasting station should be established to serve North America, Australia and the South Pacific, Europe and South America.  Equipment was purchased and some work was done on the project but it was eventually abandoned in the early 1950s.  The reason for not proceeding with the station were (1) the difficulty of getting a suitable wavelength; (2) the negligible amount of shortwave listening throughout the world because of poor listening conditions; (3) the general absence of shortwave bands on radio sets in America, and (4) the appeal of television which was likely to reduce radio audiences in general.  I am satisfied that these reasons were sound; that they have not been weakened subsequently and in fact some of them have been strengthened.</P>
    <P>There is still no international shortwave allocation plan.  While there is a <Col N="1157" /> procedure under the International Telecommunications Union to be adopted in connection with the use of high frequency wavebands there is no compulsion on administrations to stick to a particular frequency.  In practice many administrations change their frequencies to suit actual propagation and interference conditions in order to achieve a satisfactory service.  There is no evidence of any significant increase in the number of radio sets capable of receiving international shortwave broadcasts.  Because of the technical difficulty and the practical drawbacks the Broadcasting Review Committee was not satisfied that there was sufficient justification existing for the provision of a shortwave broadcasting service. The provision of such a service at this stage would be very expensive. The cost of equipment alone would probably be in the region of £500,000. I am fully satisfied that such an expenditure would not be justified.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney complained that, as far as the broadcasting of news and views on the Six Counties problem was concerned, there has not been a fair deal given to a point of view other than the point of view of the Establishment, whether this Government or the last. Deputy Blaney suggested here, and let me quote from Volume 273, No. 3, of the Official Report of Thursday 30th May, 1974, at columns 424-5:</P>
    <P>...but is a real effort on the part of one person out of 144&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>He is referring to himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>who does not hold the same views as the majority&mdash;I might add that the shame is on the House that this is the situation.</P>
    <P>The shame is on the House that not everybody agrees with Deputy Blaney.</P>
    <P>One Deputy does not hold the views of the other 143, if one considers the odd statements made by the respective leaders.  Because I am only one out of 144, this does not mean that I should be allowed only a 144th part of the time given to news of our national problem and on the problem of the Six Counties generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> Then I interjected: &ldquo;Why not?  The Deputy gets much more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Blaney: I am trying to explain that it would be totally wrong to hold that because there is only one out of 144 in discord with others on such an important matter he should be allowed only 144th part.  It is the other side of the story and, disproportionate though it may seem, it should be entitled to almost as much or equal time as the Establishment or those holding the bipartisan approach so far as the national broadcasting system is concerned.</P>
    <P>So, Deputy Blaney is asking for equal time on broadcasting to the whole rest of this House.  I think that is a highly exaggerated claim and I think the House and most people will think the same.  I agree that where there is a minority view it not merely ought to, but will be likely to get an amount of time disproportionate to the number of people actually holding that view.  It is reasonable that it should. But, in fact, Deputy Blaney gets more than average coverage; he gets more coverage than any other non-front bench TD.  The fact is that when Deputy Blaney speaks there is felt to be a sort of whiff of blood about his remarks and that tends to attract the media.  That, also, is an unfortunate fact but an existing one.  He has no legitimate complaint whatever about not being adequately covered.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kelly, suggested that section 31 (2) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, should be used to put across messages on social problems about which, broadly speaking, there is consensus.  Essentially, this suggestion concerns day-to-day programming which comes within the bailiwick of the RTE Authority.  The authority will no doubt consider the desirability of putting on programmes dealing with the type of problems the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind. When the broadcasting authority was being established the intention was that it should have the maximum freedom in programme matters and matters of day-to-day administration. The power given to the Minister in <Col N="1159" /> section 31 (2) is limited and does not cover the type of thing the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind.  It is felt that the scope of the subsection should not be widened.  The subsection provides that the Minister may direct the authority in writing to allocate broadcasting time for any announcement by or on behalf of any Minister of State in connection with the functions of that Minister of State and the authority shall comply with the direction.  In practice the authority broadcasts public service announcements on behalf of Government Departments without charge and without a direction from the Minister. Messages like those of the Department of Health concerning smoking are, however, charged for as advertisements. It is not my present intention to change that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald asked why RTE's advertising revenue declined towards the end of the last financial year and why this state of affairs was continuing.  Advertising income is very sensitive to movements in the economy generally.  The advent of the power strike and the three-day week in England towards the end of last year severely hit RTE's advertising sales. The former buoyancy has not returned following the easing of the energy situation and the return to full working in England.  RTE informed me that because of the general, worldwide economic uncertainty advertisers continue at present to be reluctant to make any long-term commitments on advertising expenditure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley made a number of points some of which related to broadcasting specifically and some related to the concept of national culture.  At this stage I should like to take his comments specifically affecting broadcasting. He made the point that broadcasting time not being used by Radio na Gaeltachta should be available for other purposes.  I agree, and this is being done.  We are in fact giving, as listeners throughout the country will have noticed, much wider choice&mdash; stepped up, I think from something like 20 to 150 hours in which choice is available&mdash;on radio.  I am in favour of stepping that up with more effective <Col N="1160" /> and more economic use of present equipment and facilities to perhaps 1,000 hours, moving in the general direction of a second radio channel. That would be an economic use of what we have and I see more merit in it for the moment than I do in a second television channel.</P>
    <P>He then spoke about the open broadcasting concept and about taking of foreign service from Northern Ireland which did not reflect the aspirations of the people of Northern Ireland.  The situation whereby the services that come to us from Northern Ireland are linked to British services.  ITV and BBC, exists because the majority of the population of Northern Ireland have wanted it that way.  You cannot therefore say that these services do not reflect the aspirations of these people if that is the way the majority of them have wanted it, unless you say at the same time: &ldquo;We know what all the people of Northern Ireland should aspire to and when they aspire to that we shall listen to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact is that we must take account not only of what the minority there want&mdash;although we should take account of that&mdash;but also of what the majority want.  It may be that will change and that the majority in Norther Ireland will, after a given time, no longer want this and the situation will change.  In those conditions, if what we would be hearing would be something that did reflect the aspiration of the majority in Northern Ireland and although it were a Loyalist aspiration couched in Loyalist language would the gentlemen opposite be all that keen to hear and see it?  Personally I think we should be prepared to hear and see it.</P>
    <P>These are the difficulties: It is no use just saying: &ldquo;This is a British service; it reflects nothing about Northern Ireland.&rdquo; It is there only because a majority of the people of Northern Ireland want it.  We are constantly dodging that point because we do not like it but we should concerntrate our minds on it.</P>
    <P>He then spoke of how I should insist on reciprocity whenever I am negotiating with Merlyn Rees or with <Col N="1161" /> Roy Jenkins, I should say: &ldquo;By the way, one of these ideas is tied with the other and you cannot have one without the other.&rdquo;  The fact is that the British, as such, do not particularly want either: they do not particularly want us to have BBC 1 and they do not particularly want the inhabitants of Northern Ireland to receive RTE.  It is from us that the push comes on both of these, not because of some little idea of my own but because a very sizeable minority in Northern Ireland want to be able to receive RTE, and because a very sizeable section of the people in the south and west want to receive BBC. It is as simple as that and I am merely expressing that dual wish.  I wish to express it as effectively as possible, not by making debating points or striking attitudes about how I must have reciprocity&mdash;to which I would get the answer: &ldquo;Too bad, we do not care whether you get reciprocity or not&rdquo;.  All I want to do is to get progress on both these fronts.  The fact is that some gentlemen in this House are more interested in striking attitudes about British than in getting results in negotiations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Plenty of motives have been attributed to me and it cuts both ways.  I am sure the Deputy will allow me to make my own speech.  I appreciate the points raised by him and this is exactly what I am anxious to meet.  I am anxious that everyone in Belfast who wants to receive RTE, both radio and television, will be able to do it.  I want to pursue my discussions in a way that gets to that end and also ensure the other <Col N="1162" /> possibility for people in the south and west.  I want to be allowed to proceed in my negotiations in the way I think most likely to be fruitful.</P>
      <P>The Deputy wanted evidence of the attitude to which I have referred, the opposition to open broadcasting I have encountered here.  He might consult the Official Record and read the speech in Irish made by Deputy Tunney not long ago when Private Members' Time was given to a discussion of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.  At that time Deputy Tunney opposed the idea that the people in the south and west should be exposed to what he called telefís na Bainriona, the Queen's television. As I have put on record here already, no Deputy from the south or the west has said that, and Deputy Tunney when speaking in English in this debate did not say it either.</P>
      <P>Let me be clear about this.  If we want to keep out British television and radio, it is possible to do it.  It is possible to jam it, and it is certainly possible to check its spread and to rule out cable television.  If the people who are taking this line are serious about turning Ireland into a provincial region and so on, they would be suggesting the extension into this sphere of the mentality behind the original working of the old Censorship of Publications Act, to get that into broadcasting and make Ireland a little Tibet.  They are not suggesting that.  They do not dare do so because the people do not want that, and they know it.  None of the Dublin Deputies who groused here about BBC being made available in the south and west is prepared to ask me to cut off cable television in their own Dublin constituencies to protect their constituents from becoming British provincials, as they affect to think.  If I say this campaign is hypocritical, I think the people can make up their minds on that subject and I will be content to leave it at that.</P>

      <P>I agree it is disorder of a relatively high quality. Deputy Begley, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, complained about Radio na Gaeltachta's coverage of Glór na nGael and on Caidreamh Scríbhneoirí and alleged that the station had snubbed the Minister for the Gaeltacht. RTE say with its obvious limitations in terms of staff and facilities Radio na Gaeltachta cannot give the attention which may well be due at any given time to public events.  This service may also be at fault occasionally in its judgment of priorities. Although I would not normally express an opinion on this subject, I think it was at fault here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> In the specific cases mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, Radio na Gaeltachta devoted half an hour to the occasion on which Clochán Bhréanainn received the Glór na nGael award.  It was of necessity a prerecorded feature.  This was followed by a news bulletin coverage.  The march by Cearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta through Connemara was covered in a news bulletin report. Radio na Gaeltachta has apologised to Comharchumann Forbartha Chorca Dhuibhne for failing to give adequate attention to an Caidreamh Scríbhneoirí.</P>
    <P>Deputies Begley and Geoghegan urged extension of the hours of broadcasting of Radio na Gaeltachta. RTE say that an extension of broadcasting hours is being considered at the moment and is under discussion by Comhairle Radio na Gaeltachta but priority is being given to improving the service within its present hours, particularly in the area of local news and news follow-up.  In the autumn it is planned to transmit daily from Monday to Friday a half hour's news service of local news from all Gaeltacht areas as well as national news.  It is hoped this development will be accompanied by a small extension of broadcasting hours.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I do not have that information, but I will find out for the Deputy.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Begley, asked that the possibility of giving free television licences to those in receipt of disability pensions be examined. The television licence scheme for certain old age pensioners is administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs merely act as agent in operating the scheme.  Any extension of the scheme would be a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy E. Collins asked if the Minister would carry out a survey in Dublin to ascertain how many people look at RTE as opposed to BBC 1. <Col N="1165" /> BBC 2 or ITV and how many hours they spend looking at RTE as compared with the other stations.  RTE engaged TAM (Ireland) Ltd. to assist in their audience research work.  The latest figures available from this source relate to the month of March, 1974.  They indicate that during the month of March, on average about 52 per cent of the sets in use in the multi-channel area were tuned to the RTE programme.  The TAM figures do not break up the balance, 48 per cent, as between the different stations but RTE are slightly ahead.</P>
    <P>I am not allowed to comment generally on programmes.  However there is one aspect on which I must comment because it concerns suggestions made by some Deputies, notably Deputies Dowling and G. Fitzgerald, to the effect that there is party political interference with broadcasting in the interests of the governing party. If that were true it would be a very serious accusation, and as it has been made by Deputies in this House I have to take it seriously and to comment on it.  At column 346 of the Official Report, dated 30th May, 1974, Deputy Dowling said:</P>
    <P>The situation is that party political broadcasts, as such, are not allowed by the present Government. There is no face to face confrontation with Members of the Opposition as there was when Fianna Fáil were in power.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>That is not true.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling stated.</P>
    <P>We have now the situation where Ministers are protected when being televised.</P>
    <P>Further on he said:</P>
    <P>Is it not time that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs saw to it that they could stand on their own feet?  The set-up is protection&mdash;protection for Ministers on RTE.</P>
    <P>He went on at column 347:</P>
    <P>We hope the day is not far distant when the Minister will feel free to <Col N="1166" /> return to the open situation we had before.  What we have now is closed Government, closed television for the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>That was the material part of what Deputy Dowling said.  Deputy Fitzgerald also touched on the subject. It was touched on to a lesser extent by Deputies Blaney and Tunney.  Deputy Fitzgerald complained about former Government Ministers not getting fair play:</P>
    <P>The Government are cracking up.</P>
    <P>In a quaint sentence at column 659 he said:</P>
    <P>With the help of the Minister and of RTE we are not being given the impression that we have a Government that is tottering at every level and in every Department.</P>
    <P>If it is my duty to give the country the impression that we have a Government that is tottering at every level and in every Department, I would not accept that that is what I am supposed to do.  The thrust of all these remarks is that the Government have been interfering to keep the Opposition off.  There are several things to be said here.  First of all, as regards the question of confrontation, it is up to any Minister or any Deputy to make the decision for himself whether he is prepared to broadcast with others on a panel on any particular occasion or whether he is not prepared to do so. Under successive Governments these options have quite naturally been exercised even by individual Ministers in different ways.  There were times when Fianna Fáil Ministers were prepared to go on the air with their opposite numbers, principally, I think, at election times, and there were times when they were not.  For example, I recall during the arms trial crisis, Deputy Garret FitzGerald and myself were anxious to engage in debate with the then Foreign Minister who was Deputy Hillery.  Deputy Hillery exercised his right&mdash;we criticised his exercise of his right but all this was fair game on both sides&mdash;not to appear with us.  He said: &ldquo;I am not going to appear with you.&rdquo;  What he did was to listen to what we said and then <Col N="1167" /> he had the privilege of commenting on that on the air.  One might perhaps object to that as a mode of dialogue because he had it easy.  He could comment on what we were saying and we could not comment on what he was saying.</P>
    <P>Since the Government changed Ministers have decided, as in the past, whether or not they wanted to go on the air with their opposite numbers.  As many people know for my part I have always been willing to appear, provided I am free, with my opposite number.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>A more serious charge is the general suggestion that the Government as such as distinct from Minister's refusing to appear with their opposite numbers.  If the Opposition like to object to that let them object.  It is a fair point and the country will take whatever point there is in it.  For myself I think the Ministers have a perfect right not to appear with the Opposition if they want to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this suggestion that we are trying to keep the Opposition off the air.  It is a fact, and Deputy Colley alluded to it just now, that under the previous Government there was a policy of keeping a very jealous eye on broadcasting to ensure that members of the Opposition and in particular certain members of the Opposition did not appear on television except in party political broadcasts, that their talents, such as they were, were not to be drawn upon.  Thus in August, 1969, the then Government informed the authority that they disliked my being called on to participate in a programme about the possibility of calling on the UN for some kind of help in relation to the then developing Northern situation. RTE, I take it, wished me to participate because of my UN experience. The Government made it known that this was not liked and this, of course, was a Government which had the power to remove the whole authority at any time for no stated reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly in 1971, and Deputy Colley referred to this, the then Government objected in writing to the authority about my services being used in connection with a set of cultural programmes called <i>&ldquo;We, the Irish&rdquo;</i>.  You could, if you wanted to defend that practice to some extent I would even agree that in the cultural programme in question I did not refrain from making political points and I can understand that the Government of the day would be annoyed. I think, however, it would have been well for them to swallow their annoyance because for a Minister to warn an RTE authority that he does not like a member of the Opposition appearing on television is very like telling the authority: &ldquo;You had better <Col N="1169" /> take it easy on coverage of the Opposition altogether&rdquo;.  For this reason in order to clarify that this attitude no longer survives, that this Government have no objection whatever to the Opposition appearing on television in any capacity in which they may be asked to appear, I have clarified that with the authority.  I have informed them in writing that I want no restrictions at all in this area.  I quote from my letter of 2nd May to the chairman of the authority.  I said:</P>
    <P>In case, however, the ministerial communication in question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am referring to the earlier one&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>should have led to any kind of restrictions on broadcasting by members of the Opposition it may be well for me to make it clear that I do not wish or seek to impose any limitations whatever on any broadcasting by Members of the Oireachtas, irrespective also of the capacity in which the station may require their services, and they be prepared to provide them.</P>
    <P>How, in the face of that, anyone can reasonably claim that this Government are trying to keep the Opposition off the air.  I do not know and I do not know frankly why we should try to keep the Opposition off the air.  I am quite happy to have them broadcast at any time on any subject in any capacity. As to whether Ministers themselves broadcast, that is their decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley made a number of points.  He came in late in this debate.  He did not discuss the Estimate in general.  He made some points directed against the Minister and, of course, that is legitimate on this Estimate.  He accused me of intolerance and arrogance.  Perhaps I have been guilty of failures in tolerance and humility.  I am sorry if I have been.  If I choose to study tolerance and humility, as I hope I will, I do not think I would go to school to Deputy Colley.  I would choose Deputy Brugha, who is opposite me.  I agree he could teach me a lot about those excellent qualities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley also accused me of engaging in assertion not in proof.  If everything that was said in the course of political discussion had to be proved with the rigour which is expected in a court of law our debates would be briefer than they are.  When we say things in political debates publicly we are submitting them to a test, that is the test of public opinion, of people who know in general what we are talking about, who can test what we say against their own observations of the situation and make up their minds. If we are wrong, if we are saying things that do not seem convincing or proper to the people we are addressing it is their verdict that prevails and that is the end of our political lives. That applies to all of us so in a sense our argument goes before the highest political jury, which is the jury of the people.  In relation to everything I have said I submit it to that verdict and I accept that verdict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley claimed I made false statements and then drew lamentable conclusions from these.  When asked for an example of a false statement he said that in a lecture I had said that the late Charles Stewart Parnell was denigrated by the republican movement.  I asked him for the source of this extraordinary statement and he was unable to provide it.  His recollection has misled him because I made no such statement.  I could not have <Col N="1171" /> made such a statement.  As a historian I specialised at one time in Parnell. I have written about him and I have been interested among other things, in the relation of subsequent generations to him and to his myth.  I know the relationship of Parnell to the republican movement.  I had to discuss this simply because it was raised as an example of my supposed wrecklessness with facts by a gentleman who did not know what he was talking about.  The fact, in relation to that, may be briefly stated.  During the divorce crisis Parnell became a hero to the republican movement.  They saw in him, first, a potential martyr and then an actual martyr and they used that martyrdom, as is their habit. There was certainly no question of the republican movement denigrating Parnell after his death.  During the part of his life from 1882 to 1890, when he took a position the republicans did not like, he was denigrated by the Fenians, as they were commonly called then.  To say that he was denigrated by the republican tradition is completely false and I never said it.  If Deputy Colley is driven to that kind of misrepresentation to show that I am not in the habit of telling the truth he must be pretty desperate.</P>
    <P>He said that both sides in the Civil War respected democracy.  I think that is odd.  If democracy means the counting of heads the losing side in the Civil War did not respect democracy. They introduced distinctions which I think most of us, in historical retrospect, would regard as quibbles, to justify a position they took up, which I agree was a position different from what they would regard as patriotic but to say it was taken on democratic grounds is to distort reality.</P>

      <P>The question of making the issues of the Civil War extremely complex is something of a speciality of the gentlemen opposite and I do not think I need plunge too deeply into that.  Deputy Colley went on at rather tiresome length about an interview which <i>The Irish Independent</i><Col N="1172" /> printed of what I was supposed to have said after my Waterford speech. As he went on at length about it I should say something about it.  He ascribed great cleverness to me about this.  I was not being particularly clever but was just saying what happened. The fact is I made a statement in Waterford, which was circulated to the Press, and afterwards an interview attributed to me was printed in <i>The Irish Independent.</i></P>
      <P>The interviewer said: &ldquo;He labelled RTE's Irish language policy as overbearing, domineering and no longer acceptable.&rdquo; The point is I used those adjectives but not about the people I am said to be using them about in <i>The Irish Independent</i>.  I used them about what one might call the gaeilgeoirí of the republican movement, in its widest use, including both the gentlemen opposite and both Sinn Féins.  I accept that the reporter in question must genuinely have misunderstod me when I referred to an Irish lobby as referring to the Irish lobby in RTE.  I did not do that and I did not say that.  I am correctly quoted in relation to the adjectives I used but the presentation of my view is incorrect because it linked adjectives I used with a subject which was not the subject of those adjectives. I tried to make that clear to Deputy Colley.  I think he is a very nice man in private life but when he gets on his feet in this House he tries to sound nastier and more obtuse than he really is because I think he understood the distinction.  It is a fairly clear distinction and I think he made far too much of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the wider aspects which arise on this Estimate through the important connection there is between broadcasting, our culture and our shifting concepts of our culture which are concepts affected by our political philosophy, which necessarily, as all things do, also involve changes.  In my opening remarks I referred only briefly to the question of the cultural responsibility of broadcasting.  This is a question I had discussed outside the House and that discussion led to some controversy and I felt that, rather <Col N="1173" /> than develop the discussion further in my opening statement, I would wait to hear what Deputies had to say on the subject and consider their statements before making any further contribution on this most difficult subject and, of course, a number of Deputies did seriously question my attitude on this.  Deputy Power, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and Deputy Tunney questioned it while Deputy Colley attacked it in somewhat intemperate terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach did criticise my attitude, and I am coming to that, but he did not do so intemperately.  The situation is at present deemed to be governed by the Broadcasting Authority Act of 1960, which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In performing its functions the Authority should bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
      <P>The Broadcasting Review Committee recommend that this section be replaced with a legislative declaration which would contain the following points:</P>
      <P>Broadcasting should be concerned with safeguarding, enriching and strengthening the cultural, social and economic fabric of the whole of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Broadcasting system should provide a service which is essentially sIrish in content and character and which, in particular, encourages and fosters the Irish language.</P>
      <P>This service should:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  be a balanced service of information, enlightenment and entertainment for people of different ages, interests and tastes covering the whole range of programming in fair proportion;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> (2)  be in Irish and English with appropriate provision for other languages;</P>
    <P>(ii) actively contribute to the flow and exchange of information, entertainment and culture within Ireland, and between Ireland and other countries, especially her partners in the European Economic Community; and</P>
    <P>(iv) provide for a continuing expression of Irish identity.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening remarks, I would favour change in the general direction indicated by the Broadcasting Review Committee though I would not necessarily adopt the precise phraseology suggested by them there but the House will, of course, have an opportunity at an early stage of discussing the wording I shall be proposing to it.</P>
    <P>I was interested, very interested, to note from the debate that no Deputy objected to the committee's recommendations in this area or to my own declared legislative intention of moving in the direction indicated by the committee.  I was here for almost all the debate except for a brief absence at a Government meeting on one occasion.  I have since read the debate and I can see nothing in the debate that I can interpret as an objection to that.</P>
    <P>Let us now look at the matter a little more closely and consider the significance of the proposed changes and let us then consider the problems we must face in formulating a new approach.  From a negative point of view, considering the significance of wording in the present Act which, it is considered, must now be dropped, the most significant features are the dropping of any reference to &ldquo;the national culture&rdquo; and also of &ldquo;restoring the Irish language&rdquo;.  I shall return later to the question of the Irish language, which is very important and which I want to consider at greater length.  At this stage I want to consider only this general concept of what our culture is, what elements it contains, and so on.  The committee speaks in chapter 3 of recognising <Col N="1175" />&ldquo;the diversity of elements which combine to establish Irish identity&rdquo;. It seems, though this is not explicitly stated, that the term &ldquo;the national culture&rdquo; is to be dropped because it does not sufficiently recognise that diversity.  I think this will be a step in the right direction.  Unfortunately it will be a belated step and it will be unfortunate also if we failed to make explicit the reason why a change is needed.</P>
    <P>The report of the television commission, 1959, on which the Broadcasting Act of 1960 was to some extent based, said in chapter 9:</P>
    <P>...one of the main duties of the Authority will be to ensure that the national outlook and culture is adequately reflected in television programmes.</P>
    <P>It went on to say:</P>
    <P>...the national outlook and culture can best be reflected in television programmes broadcast by people who themselves are imbued with that outlook and culture. Given the goodwill other people may, however, succeed in producing suitable programmes if given positive direction.</P>
    <P>Note that very precise wording of the commission&mdash;&ldquo;national outlook and culture&rdquo; abbreviated in the Act itself into &ldquo;national culture&rdquo;.  Apparently &ldquo;outlook&rdquo; was felt to be the same as culture.  Neither the report of the 1959 commission nor the Act of 1960 gave any indication of what was meant by &ldquo;the national culture&rdquo; or &ldquo;the national outlook&rdquo;.  It seemed to be taken for granted that everybody knew what was meant by these expressions. Certainly this House seemed to take it for granted because, on the Committee Stage of the 1960 Act, there was no debate whatever on section 17, none, dealing with the national culture.  The assumption that we all knew what a phrase like &ldquo;the national culture&rdquo; means can, in our situation, have very dangerous consequences.</P>
    <P>The main problem at present, though by no means the only problem, about the concept of the national <Col N="1176" /> culture in Ireland is whether Ulster Protestants as they actually are, and not as we would like them to be, are deemed to share in this national culture or whether they are not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If they do belong the &ldquo;national culture&rdquo; would have to be defined in very broad terms indeed, so much so as to lack almost all specific content.  It would certainly have to exclude what are often described as the national aims of the political unification of Ireland and the restoration of the Irish language.  I think even Deputy Wilson will agree that the majority of Ulster Protestants do not subscribe to these aims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

      <P>In performing its functions the Authority should bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of these aims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those aims do seem to be rather associated with the idea of a national culture.  It is quite clear that the Dáil in passing the 1960 Act and in other policies at that time, had a much more specific idea of national culture in mind and that the 1959 commission, when it referred to &ldquo;persons <Col N="1177" /> imbued with the national culture and outlook&rdquo;, would not have included most Ulster Protestants in that category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>What, then, were we doing when we made this claim, which is still embodied in our law?  As the word &ldquo;we&rdquo; is used with a confusing and shifting varieties of antecedents in our cultural situation I should make it clear how I am using it here in speaking to this House now because we all use this word &ldquo;we&rdquo; in different degrees and with different emphasis.  I am using it here to mean the Dáil itself and those whom the Dáil represents&mdash;that is, the electorate of the Twenty-six Counties.  I do not think we should purport to speak, as we have sometimes&mdash;too often in the past&mdash;purported to speak for and on behalf of people who have not given us any mandate so to speak for them, namely, the people of Northern Ireland.  We have a right to hope to be united with them one day but we have no right to claim that we already represent them, for we do not do that.</P>
      <P>When, in the past, we made these claims about national culture, combining it with a demand for unification, we were in effect telling Ulster Protestants that they were to be incorporated in, or rather placed under the rule of, a nation in whose culture they had no real share.  No doubt we did not mean to tell them that, but that certainly is how they have, to the general misfortune, understood us, and it is very understandable that they should have so understood us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How could we ever have thought that such a claim, could be anything but a source of bitterness and strife in <Col N="1178" /> this island?  There were and are only two methods by which that claim could conceivably be made good: by persuasion or by force.  Persuasion&mdash;an effort to bring 1,000,000 Ulster Protestants within the scope of the national culture as defined, or not defined, by us&mdash;was never seriously tried and would almost certainly not have worked if it had been tried.</P>
    <P>Over the years, millions of words were certainly poured forth, in speeches and articles, setting forth the reasons why Ulster Protestants should agree to unite with us.  These speeches were heard and these articles were read by those who agreed with thm. These did not include the population to which the arguments were nominally addressed.  Nor would it have made much difference if they reached them.  There is not any sign that that population would respond more favourably to such an appeal than most of us would respond to an appeal to rejoin the United Kingdom and be loyal to the Queen.  As persuasion is out, and the objective is one to which we are said to have an inalienable right, it can be very plausibly argued that we have a right to use force to attain this objective.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley in his remarks just now accused me of failing to distinguish adequately between the villainous IRA of today and the heroic people of, say, the 1922 period and of playing into their hands.  I take his point but I think the continuity is considerably greater than he would accept.  The traditional ideology of his party from the 1922 period&mdash;I am using the words &ldquo;his party&rdquo; there very broadly; he will understand me I hope and not pull me up&mdash;has, through the years, fed this movement. We cannot adequately combat this movement in the minds and hearts of people, and, in particular, young people unless we fight that ideology. If we say about what was done in 1922: &ldquo;That was great and OK and what you are doing now is terrible&rdquo; the only impression we make on our hearers is one, I am afraid, of hypocrisy.</P>

      <P>Having traced the progress of Irish political activities under Parnell's leadership, Dr. O'Brien said: &ldquo;In the republican perspective of Irish history&mdash;which so many of us are conditioned to regard as being the sacrosanct substance of Irish history itself&mdash;these years of Parliamentary leadership are regarded as a discredited period of national torpor and ignominy.</P>

      <P>That is right &mdash;which the Deputy translated into &ldquo;that the republican tradition denigrated Parnell&rdquo;.  Let me answer that. What I was talking about there was the Parliamentary tradition.  The republican tradition exalts the Parnell of (a) the semi-revolutionary period when he was supposed to be more or less outside Parliamentary politics up to 1881 and (b) from the divorce case to his death in which case he was engaged in wrecking a Parliamentary movement.

      <P>I said, &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We have then asserted, at least implicitly, a right to use force in this area.  Our continued assertion, even implicit, of the existence of that right has encouraged others to exercise it and they have exercised it with terrible consequences.</P>
      <P>We then say to those who take it upon themselves to use force to unify Ireland that they have no mandate from the people to use such force. They ask, in turn, what mandate had the men of 1916 and 1922?  We have no ready, honest answer to this, since the cult of 1916 is also a part of the national culture, and 1922 is a part of a large part of the national culture, as it has been officially expounded.</P>

      <P>We are quite right to say, and we do say, that the years of systematic discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland, which were years also of British indifference towards that systematic discrimination, were among the sources of the present terrible, menacing situation there.  But we have been less willing to say that our own concept of the national culture and our talk of its inalienable rights were also among the sources of these troubles: firstly in that they could be used to justify the system of discrimination itself, seen as necessary for defence, and second in that they tended to legitimise a violent response.  It is for these reasons that we need to take new stock of our conceptions of what our culture is and can be.</P>
      <P>We need to take urgent stock of these matters now.  It is clear that past patterns of behaviour, north and south, have brought us near the brink of disaster and I do not mean disaster for Northern Ireland only.  It should have always been clear that the attempt to unify Ireland by force, and the various ways in which so many of us condoned that attempt, could not possibly bring about unity, but would be certain to provoke a major sectarian backlash.</P>

      <P>I made a point while the Deputy was out and I am glad to have the opportunity of repeating it now.  My point was that the Deputy in his personal life outside <Col N="1185" /> this House is a very nice and courteous gentleman but he seems to make a point when he comes into this House of seeking to appear both nastier and more obtuse than he actually is.  If he will listen to what I have to say, he will recognise a good&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to what the Minister has had to say and I am now waiting for the logic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a fair amount to say and the Deputy, at the conclusion, should be able to decide whether I have been logical or not. No doubt he will be able to answer me if not in another place certainly during a suitable other debate here.</P>
      <P>By now at least the scale of the backlash and the danger it represents should be clear to most of us.  This is not the proper occasion on which to discuss the full range of what these dangers are, or how they should be met.  I shall note here only that an early withdrawal by Britain would under present conditions be succeeded by Loyalist rule in most of Northern Ireland and by a situation far more menacing for the Catholic population there than anything that has been known in the present century, or in the last century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is tempting and easy to put all the blame for the situation on others, on the British Government and on the Northern Unionists.  These certainly have a heavy share of the responsibility; so do we, and we shall show our maturity and our capacity to respond to the situation adequately if we recognise our share of responsibility, and are prepared to review our attitude accordingly.  Among the ways in which we have helped to create the Frankenstein monster in the North are our conceptions of our national aims and culture and the ways in which we have pursued these aims and imbued our young people with that culture.  I should like to say something in that connection about one of the saddest events in modern Irish history: the disintegration after less than six months of the first power sharing executive in Northern Ireland.  Power-sharing went against the grain of the political culture <Col N="1186" /> of Northern Ireland, and so was in danger from the start.  It had, however, significant chances of success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Catholic community it was welcomed for the most solid reasons: that they who had so long been excluded from all power would have a share in power, which their gifted leaders in the SDLP were well capable of exercising.  In the Protestant community a sizeable section, possibly even a majority, were prepared to accept power-sharing on the grounds mainly that it would put the affairs of the Province on a more secure base and give a better prospect of peace.  Many of these same people were also prepared, though with greater reservations, to accept a Council of Ireland, expressing the Irish dimension of the Green Paper but with the proviso that the council was to be a means of co-operation between the two parts of the island and not a step on the road to unification. The co-operation of this section of the Protestant community, and the maintenance of the strength of that section, were absolutely vital and indispensible to the success of the Sunningdale arrangements and of the first attempt at power sharing as they would be to any attempt at power sharing in anything like present conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is that these arrangements were as affected in a certain way by our concept of our national culture.  The Loyalists and extreme Unionists sought, of course, to win away the Protestant supporters of Sunningdale by claiming that these arrangements meant capitulation to the IRA and entry into a united Ireland. The IRA for their part struck deadly blows at the Sunningdale arrangements, precisely at the weakest points.  The main appeal of Sunningdale, perhaps the sole appeal from a Protestant point of view, had been that it seemed to hold out better prospects of peace.  The IRA were in a position to prove, by stepping up <Col N="1187" /> their car bombing campaign that at least in the short-run this agreement would not provide peace.  But also public opinion here in the Twenty-Six Counties greatly helped the Loyalists to hammer home their message about the Council of Ireland.  Many people here were by no means content to accept the council as being no more than what moderate Protestant opinion was prepared to accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I hope to contribute to it and I hope the Deputy will also.  I am dealing with the application of culture to our problems and I think I have the right to do that.  The Deputy who referred at length to these problems as a high proportion of his rather brief intervention has no right to object to my doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer to any of these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pretty sure the Deputy did.  A section of our Press which has long been the prey of a kind of lunatic optimism about a united Ireland being just round the corner proclaimed in chorus that the Council of Ireland did, indeed, represent just what the Loyalists said it represented&mdash;a long step towards unification.  In this way the conceptions of national aims and national culture which for so long have been instilled amongst us helped to complete the ruin of the most rational arrangements yet proposed whereby people of different traditions and aspirations might have been enabled to live with one another, in peace and justice in this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One element in our culture, which distinguishes it from some others is the considerable element of fantasy which enters into it.  This is by no means entirely a bad thing.  On the contrary, it has helped to shape Ireland's contribution, which has been out of proportion to our numbers over the years to the arts, especially to literature, and most especially, <Col N="1188" /> perhaps, in poetry and drama.  It enriches also our daily living with the interplay of wit and humour.  These are valuable parts of our culture and I should like to see them reflected even more than at present in our broadcasting.  This is where culture is all one interacting field.  However, when that element of fantasy enters into our politics it gets us into very serious trouble and that is what we are in at present.  The idea that the unity of Ireland is at hand, the idea that policy should now be directed in pursuit of this unity, are products of fantasy.  They are harmful fantasies because they hinder us&mdash;and I mean, again, this whole Dáil and those whom we represent&mdash;from assessing the situation adequately and from coping with it as well as possible.  We ought to be able to say, as a united Dáil, to the representatives of the Ulster Protestants: &ldquo;We know that you do not want to be incorporated in one State with us and as long as that is the case there is no point in even talking about unity.  But we are interested in better relations with you.  We are interested in co-operating with you and we are interested in fairplay for the minority in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  Such an approach could be of real and lasting value if it were seen to be made on behalf of the Dáil as a whole and supported by the great majority of those whom we represent. The illusory assertion that we must have unity at all cost, on the other hand bedevils the situation.  It provides justification or pretext for discrimination against the minority, and threatens them today with even greater evils.  In this respect our political culture needs urgently to adjust itself to reality.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, differences of opinion, and in emphasis of opinion, between Deputies on all sides in this matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach for example, in his very interesting remarks on this subject, showed himself to be at variance with my own opinion, or with my own emphasis.  I believe that on any practical decisions which come to be taken in this area&mdash;for example, in amending the Broadcasting Act&mdash;the Parliamentary <Col N="1189" /> Secretary and myself would find ourselves in agreement.  But there are certain differences in philosophical approach to the question and it is entirely healthy that these should find expression here.  I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary, both for the tone of his own major contribution and also for some interventions of his when another Deputy was speaking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, inadvertently I am sure, misrepresented my own position on certain matters&mdash;this was in my absence at a Government meeting&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary intervened to correct the misunderstanding. I appreciate this, especially since the Parliamentary Secretary was defending against misrepresentation a position with which he is not in full sympathy. The Parliamentary Secretary expressed the hope that I would take his remarks in a friendly spirit. I most certainly do and I am quite sure that he also will take in the same spirit my own comments on those parts of his statement in which he dealt with the general question of culture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary agreed with Deputy Blaney in the opinion that Irish nationality was weakening as compared with 60 years ago.  It may be so.  The sense of nationality, the feeling of belonging to a nation is a difficult thing to measure. For myself I see no convincing signs that those whom we represent feel themselves any less Irish than their ancestors did.  They may take their Irishness a bit more for granted than some of the preceding generations, and that may be no bad thing.  The evidence which the Parliamentary Secretary adduced in support of his contention did not convince me.  He said among other things:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin middle-class use terms like &ldquo;It was only fantastic&rdquo;. That is not an Irish turn of speech. A lower stratum of the population write on walls &ldquo;Boot boys rule <Col N="1190" /> O.K.&rdquo;.  That is not an Irish turn of speech.</P>
    <P>Well of course as we use the English language, which is an international language, we are likely to use those idioms of that language which correspond to the mood of our own age, group and disposition.  Persons of a different age, mood and disposition are likely to find these idioms uncongenial and to deplore them as not rightly belonging to our culture.  I share Deputy Kelly's distaste for these expressions but I cannot see them as being the grave portents which he appears to take them for.</P>
    <P>It may be indeed that we are less nationalistic than we once were. This is not exactly what the Parliamentary Secretary means but I am quite sure it is what Deputy Blaney means and the Parliamentary Secretary has said he agrees with Deputy Blaney.  Even in this sense, I am not quite certain that the statement is true.  It is customary, in the rhetorical tradition to which Deputy Blaney belongs, to compare the majority in the present with a minority in the past and find that it fails to pass the test of living up to that minority.  The majority in any past period hardly lived up to the minorities in question or indeed wished to do so.  However, I would agree, even allowing for that factor, that there probably has been some diminution of nationalistic feeling since 1914.</P>
    <P>I think also that the nationality of every European country has weakened since 1914.  That, after all, was a time of very intense nationalist feeling in almost every European country, small and large.  It was the time of an idolatrous cult of the nation&mdash; state&mdash;and of nationalities aspiring to be states.  It was an era which culminated when a shot fired by a Serbian nationalist fanatic precipitated the orgy of nationalist mass murder which is known to history as World War I.</P>
    <P>If the sense of nationality, here as elsewhere, has weakened since 1914 I for one am not prepared to say that I regret that fact.  After World War II, western European countries, determined to do everything in their <Col N="1191" /> power to avoid a repetition of that disaster, established the European Economic Community.  In 1972 the people of this Republic, by a very large majority, decided to adhere to that community.</P>
    <P>Neither the establishment of the community nor the adhesion of Ireland to it could have happened, I think, without a certain weakening of the sense of nationality.  The decision to concede a part of national sovereignty would not have been feasible had a sense of nationality existed at the same pitch as in 1914.  My own party asked for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in that referendum.  The Labour Party's decision was taken on economic grounds, some of which now stand out more clearly than they did then, and I make no apology for that stand. Others, however, who campaigned on the same side made their appeal to nationalistic emotion.  I must confess that when the results came in, my chagrin at the fact that my party's reasonable appeal had not been heeded was very considerably mitigated by the thought that the nationalistic trumpetings of Sinn Féin had also fallen on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, who agrees with the sentiment of Deputy Blaney on this matter, is by no means in agreement with the conclusions to which Deputy Blaney's sentiment has carried him.  I am glad of this because political conclusions are matters of more precision and practical importance than general sentiments, and therefore the Parliamentary Secretary and I can sit happily together on this side of the House while Deputy Blaney sits out yonder.  But I am afraid that since Deputy Blaney sets his conclusions in line with his sentiment, he is being more consistent than the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>The sentiment that our nationality has been weakened, and that it is terribly important to strengthen it, is central to what is called the Republican movement: that is the two wings of the IRA and their various fringes and fronts.  The Parliamentary Secretary sincerely abhors that movement <Col N="1192" /> and has eloquently and courageously attacked it.  So I think when he finds himself in agreement with Deputy Blaney, who appears to be an aspect or emanation of the Republican movement, he might pause and reflect.  It is true that he makes a distinction between what he calls &ldquo;Irish nationality&rdquo; and &ldquo;the idiotic chauvinistic inflation of Irish nationality&rdquo; and I suppose, without any personal discourtesy to any Deputy, this may serve to mark off his position from that of Deputy Blaney.  But the demarcation line is not altogether easy to define, especially when one is speaking of a weakening of nationality.</P>
    <P>I believe that much of the Irish nationalism which prevailed in the First World War period was like nationalism elsewhere, idiotic, inflated and chauvinistic and that therefore the weakening of it is no bad thing. I agreed fully with the Parliamentary Secretary when he said &ldquo;the prevention of Irish people ever being ashamed of what they are, of the way they speak, of where they come from and who their parents were and where they were born&rdquo;.  It is true that a certain inferiority complex has been part of our culture, and that it ought to be diminished and eradicated.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that a kind of prickly nationalism is not an alternative to this inferiority feeling, but is an aspect of it, and even tends to exacerbate it.  Those who most intensely urge the Irish not to be ashamed of being Irish often urge them&mdash;almost in the same breath&mdash;to be ashamed of not being Irish enough, of not being as Irish as a speaker deems himself to be or feels he ought to be.  A professor of Irish, on television the other day, stated plainly that the Irish people as a whole should be ashamed of themselves for not speaking Irish.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his speech implied that we ought to be ashamed of ourselves for not being worthy of John Redmond and Patrick Pearse.</P>
