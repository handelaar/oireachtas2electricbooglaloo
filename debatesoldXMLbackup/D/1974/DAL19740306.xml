    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the document known as the Sunningdale Agreement has been or will be laid before Dáil Éireann in accordance with Article 29.5.1º of the Constitution; and, if not, why.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any charge on public funds is involved in the Sunningdale Agreement; and, if so, when Dáil Éireann will be asked to approve of the terms of the agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any part of the Sunningdale Agreement will become the domestic law of the State; and, if so, whether steps are being taken to have the matter determined by the Oireachtas in accordance with Article 29.6 of the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5 together.</P>
      <P>The issues to be dealt with at the next meeting of the Sunningdale participants are set out in the agreed communiqué, copies of which were presented to the Library last December.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the requirements of the Constitution the formal agreement provided for in the agreed communiqué will be laid before this House for approval and proposals relating to the incorporation of the agreement in the domestic law of the State will be submitted to the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach whether or not it is anticipated that such an agreement, if and when arrived at and duly entered into, will be an international agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is stated in the communiqué that it is proposed to register it at the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach indicate whether any agreement that may be registered at the United Nations can be regarded as a result as an international agreement?  Does the registration at the United Nations actually confer international status on any such agreement registered there, or does the agreement have to be of an international character and so registered in order to carry the appendage &ldquo;international&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any agreement which, under the terms of the Constitution the Government are obliged to bring before the Dáil will be brought before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite what I am trying to ascertain.  I am trying to find out whether or not what is proposed or what is envisaged so far as the Sunningdale Communiqué and that contained therein are concerned, comes within the terms of Article 29 of our Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it comes within the terms of Article 29, it will be laid before the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is to be expected that, in a matter of such importance as this, the Government and the delegation from the Government who arrived at what agreement they have arrived at, issued in the Sunningdale Agreement, must be aware and must fully have considered whether the terms of any such proposed agreement come within, infringe upon or are subsidiary to any Article of our Constitution.  Article 29 is a very obvious one in relation to any international discussions which have taken place as they have done in Sunningdale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why it is being brought before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be brought before the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach whether it is not most likely that the agreement that will be made following the Sunningdale Communiqué will in fact, involve expenditure from public funds and, that being so, the agreement must come before Dáil Éireann for approval?  May I ask him in that connection whether the agreement will be brought before Dáil Éireann before it is signed for approval and, if not before it is signed, before it is lodged with the United Nations for registration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not normal to bring an agreement before the Dáil before it is signed.  As the Leader of the Opposition understands, any consequential financial matters will, of course, be the subject either of legislation or an Estimate, as the case may be, and that will be brought before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>A final supplementary from Deputy Blaney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle will appreciate that there are five questions each asking for a specific answer and on none of which I have got a specific answer.  In Question No. 1, I am asking whether, in fact, Article 29.5.1º will be adhered to in the case of the agreement proposed to be signed, that is, that it will be laid, according to that Article, before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have so said in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understood the Taoiseach&mdash;I am sorry if I have taken him up wrongly&mdash;he said that what would be required to come before the Dáil would come before it, but he has not indicated in answer to Questions Nos. 1 to 5 whether this proposed agreement is international or national or whether it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the second or third last supplementary question the Taoiseach replied to the effect that the matter would have to come before the Dáil if public funds were involved in order to pass the necessary Estimate.  Is it not a fact that, irrespective of that procedure, if the agreement in itself involves expenditure from public funds it must come before the Dáil, of itself, irrespective of subsequent activities in relation to passing Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy and the House appreciate, the agreement will come before the Dáil in accordance with Article 29 of the Constitution.  Consequential legislation or Estimates may be required to implement the agreement.  They could still come before the Dáil as a separate matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the delay and the cause of the backlog are due to the fact that all these children have in the past been taken to Dublin for what is quite a simple operation and will he assure the House that the arrangement now being made will obviate the necessity of having patients taken from Donegal to Dublin for simple tonsil operations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to now there are, I think, about four such operations carried out in respect of Donegal children in St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin and in the eye and ear hospital also.  As I pointed out to Deputy Brennan, while a surgeon has been appointed, he has not yet taken up duty.  It is hoped that, when he does take up duty, the waiting list will be cut down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that several primary schools in County Donegal were not visited under the school medical scheme in 1973; and if he will make a statement on the rapid decline of this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not the intention, when the revised school health services were introduced in 1971 that all national schools would be visited each year.  The aim was to have the larger schools visited annually and the smaller ones visited once every two years.</P>
      <P>I accept that during the past three years national schools in Donegal have not been visited by school medical officers as frequently as hoped.  The major reason for this is that the North Western Health Board has been unable to recruit its authorised number of medical staff.  The board is, however, continuing its efforts to recruit such staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that so few have been visited, particularly in the last year, the public have come to believe the scheme is no longer in existence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the position, the trouble has not just occurred in the last year.  As I explained in answer to the previous question, there is a shortage of staff.  It is hoped to recruit more staff.  The authorised number of medical posts is six, comprising one chief medical officer and five assistant chief medical officers, one of whom is temporary.  For the past two years the figure has been only four and this has caused delay in examinations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not just a problem related solely to the medical profession but to other professions as well, with all due respect, where Donegal is concerned.  It is difficult to induce members of the medical profession to go to Donegal.  The Local Appointments Commission advertised recently and I am informed that the posts advertised were not filled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem has not arisen in just the last 12 months.  I would like to ask the Minister would he, because of the difficulty in obtaining medical staff in Donegal, consider recommending to the North West Regional Health Board that dispensary doctors and nursing personnel available locally should be drafted in to carry out these very necessary examinations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy any definite information about the medical officers, but public health nurses undertake certain limited examinations in regard to vision, posture and cleanliness.  They are not complete.  There are difficulties in recruiting the necessary staff to ensure that the maximum number of examinations is carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that what the Deputy has in mind is the Government's undertaking to augment the German compensation for Irish thalidomide children.  As I explained in a press release of 11th January last, I am not in a position to be more specific until I have a detailed picture of the requirements of each child.  The expert medical board appointed by me in October last do not expect to be able to let me have these detailed reports before April.</P>

As far as finality is concerned, I can only repeat what I told the Deputy in reply to his question. I have not received a final report and will not receive such a report until after a meeting has been held by the medical board on the 28th April.

      <P>Inquiries have been made from suppliers and hospitals and in general the supply position as respects surgical sterile gloves appears reasonably satisfactory.  Shortages have occurred in some areas however and in a few instances supplies were slow to arrive at certain hospitals. One particular brand of such gloves, especially the popular size, is stated to be on short supply at present.  I have asked the Hospitals Joint Services Board to do what they can to meet any difficulties experienced by hospitals in obtaining supplies of these gloves.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 to 25, inclusive, together and, as the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, to circulate it with the Official Report.  The information in the statement relates to the 31st January, 1974, which is the latest date for which it is available.</P>
      <P>The main conditions for the granting of an allowance for the domiciliary care of a severely handicapped child is that the child be normally living at home and be aged between two and 16 years; the child must have mental or physical handicap such that he or she requires from another person constant care or supervision substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age and sex.  The handicap must be present at the time of application for the grant, have been present for at least six months prior to that date and be likely to continue for at least one year.  Children who have means of their own in excess of the amount of the allowance&mdash;£25 per month&mdash;are not eligible.</P>
      <P>The determination of eligibility for grants in individual cases is primarily a function of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. Applications however are processed and assessed by the chief medical officer of the area in which the child resides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that in general the scheme is being implemented in full by the health boards.  The Deputy <Col N="2165" /> may be referring to cases on which a decision is still outstanding.  Health boards are continuing the assessment of these cases and I have asked them to make a special effort to deal with all arrears.  In any event payment of the allowance will be from the date of application where a child is considered eligible.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the cost of the scheme will be £900,000 per annum and funds have been made available to health boards on this basis.  Health boards have indicated that funds allocated <Col N="2166" /> to them are sufficient for the current operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In notifying health boards regarding this scheme in September last I indicated that it would be reviewed periodically and that I proposed that the initial review would be made in April, 1974, in the light of experience in operating the scheme.  For the purposes of the review health boards will be submitting to my Department detailed information and comments regarding the scheme for the six months ending 31st March, 1974.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there are constant complaints from the parents of children who are severely handicapped that they are unable to get any benefit under the scheme even though they appear to qualify under the conditions which the Parliamentary Secretary has read out?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary take steps to see that the parents of such children will get the grants as soon as possible and that they will be paid retrospectively to the date on which the scheme came into operation originally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in the reply that the health boards continually assess these cases.  I have asked them to make a special effort to deal with the arrears.  I also indicated that if a child is eligible the allowance will be paid from the date of application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the CMO of the Eastern Health Board in my county indicated that the sum allotted for this scheme was not sufficient to cater for all the applicants?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary concerned that the statistics available to him did not give a proper idea of the number of handicapped children?  Could he indicate whether applicants who applied in time and who are now found to be qualified will get payment retrospective to October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy and the House that in all cases found to be eligible payment will be made in full.  There is no shortage of funds to meet those demands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there is no degree of uniformity regarding eligibility for these allowances?  In one case a health board has rejected a case while a similar case has been accepted by another health board.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider advising health boards to set up an appeal body to which the parents of children affected can make an appeal if the CEO has rejected their application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know why in view of the fact that a national survey was made by the different <Col N="2168" /> regional health boards those boards did not get a complete feedback of the number of handicapped children until such time as the Minister for Health introduced the scheme?  We found in our area that we had three or four times more handicapped children than were in the area when the Minister for Health introduced the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Faulkner, I want to assure him that in any case where the chief executive officer decides the case is eligible for the scheme, the person will get the allowance.  The chief executive officer, of course, works the scheme in conjunction with the chief medical officer of health for the health board there.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that unemployment assistance of 5 pence per week is being paid in some cases by his Department; and if he will now arrange that a realistic minimum weekly rate of assistance will be paid which would warrant the administrative expenditure of making such payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the rate of unemployment assistance payable can, due to the statutory means test applicable, be as low as 5p a week in exceptional cases.  The existing arrangements in this regard are designed to achieve full equality of treatment between beneficiaries and under them the appropriate maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance applicable, due regard being had <Col N="2176" /> to the applicant's marital status, number of dependants and area of residence, is reduced by 5p for each 5p or part of 5p of his weekly means as assessed for the purposes of the Unemployment Assistance Acts.</P>
      <P>The administrative cost of making small payments has no measurable impact on the cost of administration of the unemployment assistance scheme as a whole.  If it had there could be justification for fixing a minimum level of payment.  To do so, however, would, in the case of unemployment assistance react against applicants in other ways.  Certain other advantages accrue to recipients of unemployment assistance, however low the amount, such as, for example, being given preference for work under State-aided employment schemes and in the circumstances no change in the present arrangements is contemplated.</P>

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not think that it is ridiculous to expect somebody to cycle twice a week to Kilcullen in order to qualify for 5p payment and a voucher for two pounds of butter which he cannot afford?  Is it not expecting too much of any deciding officer to expect him to assess an income from a farm in these days of fluctuating farm incomes as closely as 5p per week?  Even an expert like the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would find it very hard to assess it that closely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will permit the payment of reduced rates of unemployment benefit and disability benefit to persons who are in receipt of those benefits in conjunction with other pensions but who cease to qualify when they reach pension age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment benefit and disability benefit are short term benefits designed to cover the contingencies of unemployment or sickness during the working lives of insured workers and they cease at pensionable age.  After that age, when workers are no longer insured and would in the normal course have retired from work, there is provision for payment of the long term retirement and contributory old age pensions.  This distinction between short term and long term benefits is a fundamental feature of social security systems.</P>
      <P>It is also a generally accepted principle of social insurance that an insured person qualifies for only one insurance benefit at the same time.  An exception to this principle was, however, allowed under the Social Welfare Acts in favour of insured widows in whose case unemployment or disability benefit can be paid at a reduced rate concurrently with widows' pension.  This concession in favour of widows was further enhanced when provision was made in last year's Social Welfare Act that a widow pensioner when working is exempted from paying the employee's share of the social insurance stamp.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the situation where some persons in the transition to pensionable age may suffer a reduction in the amount of social welfare payments being received.  The matter is a complex one, however, and examination of the problem has revealed that it is difficult to find a solution that would solve the existing anomaly without, at the same time, giving rise to similar anomalies over a much wider field.</P>

I wrote the amendment, signed my name to it and Deputy Molloy also signed his name to it.  I approached the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who was in the Chair in the course of the debate.  I handed the amendment to him and told him that it was an amendment to section 6.  After consultation with one of the officials of the House, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle beckoned me to approach the Chair again and told me: &ldquo;You cannot put it in at this stage.

      <P>If the Chair would refer to column 1770 of the Official Report the Chair would find that the matter was discussed there.  It is possible that the Ceann Comhairle was in the Chair at the time because it was approximately 10.29 p.m. when I got that far on the night of Wednesday, 27th February, 1974.  While I am precluded by the rules of the House from formally moving this as an amendment I think it is no harm, with regard to the section generally, to draw the House's attention once more to the fact that the wording that Deputy Molloy and I suggested would clarify considerably the section which at present is under consideration.</P>
      <P>After I made the suggestion that the wording in the Act should be changed and the wording suggested by Deputy Molloy and me substituted, the Minister agreed that in his view, speaking as he emphasised as a lay man, the wording we suggested was superior to that in the Bill.  Shortly afterwards however he went on to say that notwithstanding his own satisfaction that my proposed wording was superior the advice he had received was that no change should be made because, as it was put, the existing wording had stood the test of time and had been used in previous Bills and in previous Acts.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that.  The Minister in his intervention inquired why the Opposition spent such a lot of time debating this Bill so fully.  If permitted I could go some of the way to enlightening the Minister in regard to this.  The Opposition find this Bill was brought in by the Government for one purpose only&mdash;to try to keep themselves permanently in power notwithstanding the wishes which will be expressed by the people at the next election that they should no longer be in power.  Because that is the purpose of the Bill, we in the Opposition feel, that in fairness to everyone concerned every line of this Bill should be thoroughly analysed, gone into, parsed almost, and discussed fully in this House.  If the Oireachtas in the future see fit to pass this Bill into law at least the people of the country will be in a position to know what the Bill is about, what it sets out to do and, from the Government's point of view, what it hopes to achieve for them.</P>

      <P>Section 6 is one of the sections in this Bill which sets out to try to keep the Coalition Government permanently in power.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 deals with what are described as temporary arrangements with respect to the register of electors.  We set out at some length the last day the changes we feel are desirable in this section.  The Minister was good enough to agree with one set of changes which we proposed but on subsequent advice from his officials he decided against accepting these recommendations even though he was satisfied they were in order.  Apart from the suggestions Deputy Molloy and I made in that regard Deputy Dowling made it clear that the wording of subsection (2) was virtually absurd so far as this section was concerned.  I had hoped that in the interval of one week which had elapsed since the House last considered this question the Minister would have seen fit to bring forward an amendment of his own which would make the wording of subsection (2) somewhat less absurd than it is and would tighten up the wording of sub-section (1) on the lines suggested by Deputy Molloy and me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unhappily neither of these things has taken place and I am only led to the conclusion that the Minister does not greatly care what the wording in this section is like or that he is not worried whether proper terminology and clear drafting are used in this section as long as the Bill, and particularly this section, fulfils the political purpose which he and most of those who support him wish it to achieve. I do not think I can put the matter any further than I have.  I should like to express the wish, and the hope, for the sake of this House and for the sake of parliamentary democracy generally, that the Minister will be led by the views of the Members of this House and by his own views rather than to fall back behind the bureaucrats <Col N="2188" /> who decide on a particular thing and apparently constrain the Minister to stick to it whether he wishes to do so or not.</P>

      <P>I have not said one word against any official of the Department of Local Government or otherwise in this debate either today or the last day.  I referred simply to the fact that, after Deputy Molloy and I had made suggestions for alternative wording to subsection (1) of this section the last day, the Minister said he agreed that that wording was superior in his view as a layman and that he thought it was preferable to the wording used in the Bill.  After further discussion had taken place the Minister repeated his view that in his opinion the wording Deputy Molloy and I had suggested was superior but that he was advised by his officials that he should not accept it and should stick to the wording in the Bill.  I then said &ldquo;Fair enough, that is the advice given by the officials&rdquo;.  I said I thought it was wrong that the Minister should not follow his own instincts and use his own judgment rather than allow the passage of a Bill through this House to become in effect a bureaucratic act.  I do not think that is an attack on any individual, official or any group of officials.</P>

      <P>I said the last day that as a layman I considered the wording which was suggested to be a better way of putting it than the Bill but my officials, who know why the original wording was put in, advised that the wording which had been put in&mdash;not by me but by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government, backed by successive Fianna Fáil Governments and passed through this House every time they brought in an amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy please stay quiet for a few minutes? When he is up he cannot say so much so let him please stay quiet when he is sitting down.  Where is the thing which Deputy O'Malley suggests will cement the Coalition Government in office?  This is the section which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) Where a polling district or part of a polling district is situate in a constituency specified in the Schedule to this Act which is identical in area with none of the constituencies existing at the passing of this Act, the Minister may by direction provide for the entry of the name of that constituency in respect of the polling district or part of the polling district, in every draft register, list of claimants, register of electors and list of corrections <Col N="2190" /> prepared under Part II of the Electoral Act, 1963, and published by a registration authority before the dissolution of Dáil Éireann which next occurs after the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2) Where a constituency specified in the Schedule to this Act is identical in area with none of the constituencies existing at the passing of this Act, a postal voters list or lists shall be prepared in respect of it by the registration authority or registration authorities concerned as soon as may be after such passing.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley claims that there is some type of peculiar arrangement in those words which will give such support to the National Coalition Government that he and his party will be wiped out.  It is the same section, word for word, as was introduced by Fianna Fáil away back in the 1920's and has been included in every similar Act which has passed through the House since.  I am prepared to agree with Deputy O'Malley that when the next election comes the National Coalition will be returned.  I will agree with him on that.  His suggestion that this will have anything to do with it is too ridiculous to bother replying to except that I want to place it on record and to clear up once and for all the way in which he has been attempting to suggest that there was something more under discussion. With regard to the amendment which he suggested he was going to put in, no amendment was put in.  I suggested that if he felt so strongly about it he could do it on Report Stage or it could be done in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>As far as this section is concerned it has been debated up to today for five hours and 25 minutes.  This Bill has so far taken as many days as the entire Electoral Bill the last time it was before the House.  As Deputy O'Malley is aware, there is a way of dealing with the sort of stuff which we have been getting from the Opposition the last few days this Bill was debated and which we are getting again this afternoon.  If the Opposition continue to make the rather foolish sort of speeches which they are making for <Col N="2191" /> the reason which Deputy O'Malley has spelt out&mdash;that they want to prevent this Bill from passing through the House and therefore they feel free to delay every section and every word as long as they can&mdash;then on this side of the House we shall take the necessary steps to pass the Bill through.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just made a comment should not be kicking up a row.  He is quite happy with what is happening so there is no reason for him to start kicking up a row.  Deputy Dowling, the last day, <Col N="2192" /> assisted by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy, proposed an amendment which they thought should be brought into section 6.  They suggested something which would have the exact opposite effect to that which is proposed by the section and which is, in fact, the law at the present time.  I do not want to hold up the House but I want to make it very clear that the shenanigans which Fianna Fáil have been carrying on here are not gaining them any support in the country.  People are a little bit fed up with those antics which they are carrying on like a crowd of children. Because they are not in charge of the game the game cannot be played at all.  If they have anything sensible to say about it I am prepared to listen.  I am not prepared to listen to a lot of nonsense which they have been carrying on with here for over six hours.</P>

      <P>I am greatly surprised at the statement which we have just heard from the Minister for Local Government.  Any person who makes a preliminary study of the legislation that has come before this House since the Minister and his Government took up office on the 14th March last year will see that the Government have received quite a generous amount of support from the Opposition Party in the legislation that has been brought forward.  The Minister knows the Bills that were brought forward by him dealing with matters appertaining to the Department of Local Government were fully and frankly discussed here.  We completely refute all of what the Minister has said in making an accusation against the Fianna Fáil Party of being anxious to delay all legislation, or being anxious to stop the working of this House, of some form of grievance which he insinuates Fianna Fáil have due to the fact that they are not in office.  Any examination of the record of the House will show that the debate on all of the Bills that have been brought before the House up to now has been constructive and in general those Bills have received the support of the Opposition Party.  I challenge the Minister to deny that.</P>

We will not be deterred in any way by threats of the guillotine by the Minister who has not his seat warm on that side of the House before he starts issuing threats. We want to show the Minister why we are querying section 6 and why we are dissatisfied with it.  The Minister's response to our arguments has been nil but we will continue to argue until we get some indication from him that he is prepared to accept we have a point. He accepted in an off-hand manner that we had a point but in obstinacy he is refusing to agree to amend the section.  There is a positive anomaly, clear to any child, in the manner in which this section is drafted.  Subsection (1) states that the Minister may by direction provide for the entry of the name of a constituency in respect of the polling district; in other words, a change required under subsection (1) may be done by direction of the Minister but a change required under sub-section (2) can be done by the registration authority concerned.</P>
      <P>We claim there is a positive and definite anomaly between the mechanics used in both subsections and we challenge it.  The fact that it was not challenged before is due only to the lackadaisical attitude of the then Opposition who did not query the wording of this subsection when it came before the House previously.  It was debated in the House and was accepted without a murmur by the Coalition parties when they were in Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) provides that a certain thing can be done by direction of the Minister whereas in subsection (2) a certain matter can be done by the registration authority. We are suggesting it is not necessary to include in subsection (1) that the Minister is the person who must give a direction.  What is involved is written into the record and there is no need for me to elaborate on it.  We have stated quite clearly this should be changed.  Some minutes ago Deputy O'Malley submitted an amendment stating that in subsection (1) the words &ldquo;the Minister may by direction...&rdquo; should be removed and replaced by &ldquo;the registration authority...shall as soon as may be at the passing of the Act...&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At column 1644, Vol. 270 of the Official Report, dated 27th February, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>...even though the direction is not given until the Dáil is dissolved, the authorities who are drawing up the registers do make the necessary preparations immediately and, therefore, have the registers ready waiting for the direction to be given so that they can be distributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2196" /> At column 1721 of the Official Report of the same date the Minister stated in reply to our argument:</P>
    <P>I am advised that the effect of the amendment suggested by Deputy Molloy before 6 p.m. would be that every local authority responsible for drawing up a register would have to immediately draw such a register whether it was needed or not.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister is saying that if we were to accept the amendment we proposed we would place the obligation on a local authority of having to draw up a register immediately. However, in reply to another question, at column 1644, the Minister had already informed the House that the register would be drawn up immediately. I wonder if the Minister knows what he is talking about?  At one time he states there is no need for it because it will be done immediately but at another time he says if he accepted our amendment we would be placing an onerous obligation on the registration authority to do something immediately which he has already told us will be done.  There is a direct conflict here.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  We suggest this is loose legislation, and we have suggested that the words should be removed.  If the Minister agrees to this we can move on to the next question.  The attitude of the Minister to date has been that he has the votes, that he will march this Bill through the House knowing that it is a distasteful Bill so far as the community is concerned.</P>

In one case it deals with the general register and in the other with the postal register.  The Minister has indicated that the registration officer would be allowed in the case of postal voters to compile the register immediately.

      <P>If the Minister could indicate to me any more apt way in which I could describe the sounds we have heard in the last five or ten minutes then I should be happy to take his wording on it.  I want the Minister to answer two questions.  One is in regard to section 6 which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Where a polling district or part of a polling district is situate in a constituency specified in the Schedule to this Act which is identical in area with none of the constituencies existing at the passing of this Act,...</P>
      <P>I want to ask him whether or not the constituencies indicated in the Schedule have been designed by area and, if so, what was the operation which could indicate to us the area of a constituency.  If the Minister will answer that question, I shall proceed with my second.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The second one, briefly, is: instead of speaking in negative terms here, referring to something identical in area with nothing else, why was it not possible to be more positive and precise and say: &ldquo;a constituency which is not identical with any other.&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Schedule defines electoral areas or divisions which are recognised areas.  This has been the <Col N="2206" /> practice all along.  It has been accepted as being the proper way to do it and no difficulty has been found in its operation.  If we want to change for change's sake I am advised that the way in which it is done is the best way.  Therefore I can see no reason why I should change it because some people are doubtful about whether or not it is the correct way.  The section as laid out appears to have worked well and will continue to do so.  For that reason I do not propose to change it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney has asked two reasonable questions and I have given him a reasonable answer.  The reason given by some other Deputies on section 6 was that it was part of the plan to prevent the Bill being passed in this House, which is a different thing altogether.  It is a different thing altogether when we find people who try to prevent the section being passed so that it will prevent the whole Bill from being passed.</P>

      <P>I have been here since the debate started.  I have said neither &ldquo;yes&rdquo; nor &ldquo;no&rdquo; to either side of the House.  I have looked at the section.  I am endeavouring, as is required of every member of this House, to indicate where I foresee there may be ambiguity leading to bother later on.  I respectfully suggest that this is the purpose of our being here.  While the Minister has given an answer to the questions I posed, I suggest there is wording which would be more appropriate to indicate that which is intended here rather than using the term &ldquo;which is identical in area with none of the constituencies ...&rdquo; because, I submit, that can be taken, either now or later, and contested. When we talk about areas being identical, I suggest we are talking of length multiplied by breadth and getting the area.  If we put here parliamentary areas, electoral areas, then I suggest that the ambiguity or <Col N="2207" /> dangers I fear might not arise.  I would urge again on the Minister that he and his officials have a further look at that section.</P>

We would expect the Minister to give a full and adequate explanation to the House as to why the parliamentary draftsman felt it could only be worded in this way.  We would consider that full explanation, but we cannot be expected to accept that just because a person in the backroom says: &ldquo;This is the way to do it,&rdquo; that there is no other way.

      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister replying to Deputy Tunney and indicating that this section had been drawn up by a parliamentary draftsman.  The Minister said he would accept it fully because the Minister does not draw up the Bill. The Minister must be aware that parliamentary draftsmen drew up other Bills which were found to be unconstitutional.  In relation to section 6 (2) which states:</P>
      <P>Where a constituency specified in the Schedule to this Act is identical in area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is, the same as or similar to,</P>
      <P>&mdash;with none of the constituencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2209" />&mdash;with none of the constituencies existing at the passing of this Act, a postal voters' list or lists shall be prepared in respect of it by the registration authority or registration authorities concerned...</P>
    <P>Assuming it is identical with nothing, does that mean a blank postal voters' register will be compiled and presented? The Minister has accepted one particular point of view.  The Minister has indicated that he is completely in the hands of the Civil Service and accepts everything they say.  We now see the Minister in his true colours: he has no mind of his own.  The Minister has clearly indicated that he is prepared to accept what he is told, but we are not prepared to accept what is in the Bill without question.  I feel, as I felt on the last occasion, that this subsection reeds to be amended.  The Minister will have to come up with a better explanation than the one he gave Deputy Tunney in relation to the point about where it is identical in area with nothing.  This is a peculiar type of subsection.  Because a parliamentary draftsman says an area is identical with nothing the Minister accepts it.</P>

      <P>Where an existing constituency corresponds with any one of the constituencies set out in the Schedule to this Act...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2210" /> The Minister should look at these words and use words to ensure that there is more suitable wording than his in this subsection.  Other Deputies have expressed concern about the sub-section. I see no reason why it should pass in its present form.  The Minister has given no valid reason why sub-section (2) of section 6 should be retained in its present form.  If an area is &ldquo;identical with nothing&rdquo; that does not mean a thing.  I have some doubt about whether the Minister consulted the parliamentary draftsman.  This wording was probably embodied in a previous Bill, but if the Minister consulted with the parliamentary draftsman he might come up with more suitable wording which would be in keeping with the desire of the Minister. The Minister should have another look at the subsection to see whether he can formulate wording which would be more in keeping with the view he wishes to express.  The minister should not rely on parrot-like repetition.</P>

      <P>We do not deem the subsection suitable.  On the last occasion the Bill came before the House it was not questioned but on this occasion it is being questioned.  If there is a flaw in the section it should be amended.  The section should convey what the Minister wishes it to convey but not in a negative manner, as is being done at the moment.  An area identical with nothing could mean that the registrar would have a blank postal voters' register.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling was not here on a previous occasion when I spoke on this point.  The suggestion which Deputy Dowling made the last day and which was subsequently put into words by Deputy O'Malley for him, would have the opposite effect to what is proposed in the subsection. Possibly Deputy Dowling might look at this and notice that he has made a bad error.  If Deputy Dowling is identical with none of his colleagues in Fianna Fáil, can we take it that he <Col N="2211" /> considers he is identical with nothing? The same thing applies if a constituency is identical with no other constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Deputy Tunney has recognised what it means is that it is not identical with any of the others and, therefore, it does its job. For the purpose of having it different Deputy Dowling wants us to change it, but Deputy Tunney admits he knows what is meant by this subsection which is that the constituency is not identical with any other.  Deputy Dowling will, I am sure, take Deputy Tunney's word for it that the subsection is all right and, therefore, does not need to be changed.</P>

      <P>This is important legislation.  Section 6, subsections (1) and (2), is very important.  The subsections deal with temporary arrangements with respect to the register of electors.  As elected representatives of the people, we on this side of the House, have a right and a duty to examine every piece of legislation brought before this House.  We asked the Minister for an explanation as to why the wording is in this form in section 6 (1) and (2).  The Minister's reply is the normal reply of the Minister: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil did it&rdquo;, and &ldquo;What did you do for 16 years?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was always the fact that it was drafted by Fianna Fáil.  That is the one reply the Minister <Col N="2212" /> gives.  The second reply is that it was the parliamentary draftsmen who drew it up and whatever they say is fine.  We have a right and a duty on this side of the House to question the style and the wording of section 6 (1) and (2), particularly because the two subsections are contradictory as to who should have the powers at any one time.  In section 6 the power is vested in the Minister.  However, section 6 (2) says:</P>
      <P>Where a constituency specified in the Schedule to this Act is identical in area with none of the constituencies existing at the passing of this Act, a postal voters' list or lists shall be prepared in respect of it by the registration authority or registration authorities concerned as soon as may be after such passing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 is vitally important because it is dealing with voting by the public at a general or local election.  It is important that we in this House should set out wording that will be clearly understood by the electorate.  We suggest that the present wording is ambiguous and needs clarification.  We have asked the Minister to consider certain suggestions, but the Minister on all occasions has refused to clarify the wording or to set it down in a form that could be better understood by the man-in-the-street.</P>
      <P>There was an amendment put forward by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy which the Minister, prior to Private Members' Time last Wednesday, admitted was an improvement on the wording of section 6 (1).  However, he said that as a layman he would have to get further advice on it, but he did not come back to explain to us why, when he got the further advice, he was not prepared to accept the advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in all walks of life, not just lawyers or barristers, will be interested in this Bill.  Therefore, the wording should be as clear and as easily understood as possible to everybody who buys a copy of it.  The wording <Col N="2213" /> in this section is very foggy.  Section 6 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Where a polling district or part of a polling district is situate in a constituency specified in the Schedule to this Act which is identical in area with none of the constituencies existing at the passing of this Act...</P>
    <P>Surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility for the Minister and his advisers to re-draft that subsection to make the wording more easily understood by the public and generally to tidy up the wording of section 6.</P>
    <P>There is, then, the contradiction in regard to the powers taken by the Minister in sub-section (1) and the powers given to the registration authority or registration authorities in subsection (2).  We feel strongly on this side of the House that the Minister should not be taking powers onto himself where this is not necessary and that he should be doing the same thing in subsection (1) as he is doing in subsection (2) and handing these powers to the registration authority or registration authorities.  We know from bitter experience of the order signed by the Minister in the last number of weeks with regard to local electoral areas, that we have to be decidedly wary of orders made by the Minister. There will be another occasion to discuss the changes in the local electorate divisions made by the Minister, but they are, to an extent, relevant here today.</P>

      <P>For the information of the Deputy, there are certain people on the register who do not vote in a general election.  They do not vote in a general election but they have a vote in a local election.  I understood Deputy Donnellan was aware of that.  This section requires to be examined again by the Minister, his advisers and draftsmen.  I should like him to give a clear statement why he feels the advice as to wording he is getting from his parliamentary draftsmen is better than what is suggested on this side of the House.  The Minister has said that he will not change subsections (1) or (2) of section 6.  He said he saw certain merit in the suggestion put forward by Deputy Molloy and Deputy O'Malley previously when this Bill was debated but he was not prepared to explain why he was accepting the advice of the parliamentary draftsmen and advisers. I understand the Minister has advisers and that there is little point in having them unless you take their advice; but we want an explanation from the Minister as to why they feel and he feels the wording as proposed by the draftsmen is better than the wording suggested on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the sections are the same as sections in a previous Electoral Amendment Bill and for that reason were put in again.  He said it worked in the past and why should it not work in future.  This is not a valid argument.  The fact that the Opposition of the day did not see their duty as we see it to contest these sections and seek clarification of them on behalf of the electorate is no justification for leaving the wording as it is, if it is found wanting.  We believe it needs clarification, needs tightening up.  The Minister would be wise to tell the House his reasons for not accepting the proposed amendment instead of threatening the guillotine on this debate in regard to something which concerns every voter in the country.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in consultation with his officials, might have thought it advisable to define what really is meant by the word &ldquo;area&rdquo; in section 6.  It should be made clear that what is meant is not the normal interpretation of the word &ldquo;area&rdquo;.  In my opinion this is very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the good faith of Deputy Tunney from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  It has been accepted by everybody, except the Fianna Fáil Party today and the last few days, that the area referred to is the area covered by a constituency.  The Schedule names the particular areas covered by each constituency.  Anything plainer than that would be very difficult to find.  Deputy Dowling referred to Dublin South-East and Dublin South-West.  The clearest way to define the word &ldquo;area&rdquo; is to refer Deputies to the Schedule.  The area referred to in section 6 is the area covered by a particular constituency. When a constituency has not been changed it is identical to the one which was there before, and therefore this does not apply.  If there has been a change, even if it is only a very small change, it is not identical and certain things have then to be done.  I cannot understand how anybody cannot grasp that.</P>
      <P>I studied this Bill before it came into the House and since with my officials.  I am satisfied that subsections (1) and (2) of section 6 are worded in the best way for the job they were meant to do.</P>

This is open to various interpretations of what is meant by &ldquo;area&rdquo;.  If one wanted to argue the legal definition of the word &ldquo;area&rdquo; one could arrive at various conclusions.

      <P>That type of reference to square footage has been used in previous debates when discussing the 1969 Bill.  This could, in fact, be interpreted as meaning something vague in relation to square footage.  This is definitely on.  The Minister indicated at one stage that he agreed with the arguments we were making and it is incumbent on us to persist in those arguments until the Minister agrees to take the appropriate action.  We have no way of amending any of these subsections under section 6 other than through argument and convincing the Minister to do such a thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has informed us on many occasions, he has the majority of the votes in this House and he is the only one who can with that majority make any changes.  This Bill is totally abhorrent to us in the Opposition and the Minister has wrongly used the powers vested in him to draw up these constituencies in such a way as to benefit his own party.  It is a bit much for the Minister <Col N="2221" /> to expect us to sit down meekly and let him have all the sections.  We are examining this Bill line by line and we find a definite anomaly.  We are seeking a reasonable explanation as to why what we are suggesting is not adopted but we have not been given such an explanation.</P>
    <P>We have been told that certain persons employed in the parliamentary draftsman's office have stated that this is the way it should be done but they have not always proved to be absolutely correct in the past, something which has been pointed out by many speakers today.  Their handiwork has been changed on the floor of this House on occasions too numerous to elaborate.  There are many precedents for the changing of wordings which were originally drafted by parliamentary draftsmen.</P>
    <P>The final imprimatur is the House and we are debating that.  We adamantly maintain that there is a positive anomaly between subsection (1) and subsection (2) of this particular section. We see no reason why subsection (1) should state:</P>
    <P>... the Minister may by direction provide for the entry of the name of that constituency in respect of the polling district or part of the polling district, in every draft register, list of claimants, register of electors and lists of corrections prepared under Part II of the Electoral Act, 1963 ...</P>
    <P>While subsection (2) which deals with the postal voting list which is used for the very same purpose as the register of electors states:</P>
    <P>... a postal voters' list or lists shall be prepared in respect of it by the registration authority or registration authorities concerned as soon as may be after such passing.</P>
    <P>The postal voters' list can be done immediately the Act is passed by the registering authority but the register of electors can only be done by the direction of the Minister.  The Minister has informed the House that his direction will issue on the dissolution of the Dáil.  We suggested that the words there should be removed and replaced by the words suggested by <Col N="2222" /> Deputy O'Malley and I.  It should be the same body who make the changes in relation to the register of electors as is authorised under subsection (2) to make the changes under the postal voters' list.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in reply to our argument, stated that if he was to agree to that it would mean that the registering authorities would be obliged to do this immediately and, by some insinuation, claims that this obligation would be an onerous one on them, it would be a waste and should not be done. However, on a previous occasion the Minister stated that this direction which can be given on the dissolution of the Dáil is only a technical thing and that, in fact, once the Bill is passed this work of entering the name of the constituency in respect of the polling districts <i>et cetera</i> shall be done by the registrative authority.  Therefore, we have a direct conflict, one where the Minister is refusing to change the sub-section and to put in the words which we suggest would regularise the situation and he is retaining these words whereas, in fact, he has informed the House that the practical operation of this is that the registering authorities will do it anyway and will do it immediately after the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has used this as an argument against accepting our proposed amendment, and, yet on a previous occasion, he informed the House that they would do such a thing anyway immediately after the passing of this measure.  If, as the Minister said originally, that the preparation of the polling districts and the entering of the names are to be done as soon as possible after the passing of this Bill anyway without any authority, then we feel this position should be regularised. It should be written into the sub-section and provided there specifically that the registration authorities have the authority to make these changes.  It is only similar power to what is being given to them in relation to the drawing up of the postal voters' list. Frankly, we feel that the Minister has been less than co-operative with us in explaining his reasons for refusing to accept that amendment from us or even indicating to us that he would <Col N="2223" /> be prepared to accept it.  Originally he said that he agreed with us as a layman but that his advisers were telling him that this could not be so and that because they have told him that he was not going to accept our proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>If these people have told the Minister that this is the way it should be and that the words in the section must be retained while the registering authority is allowed to do it under subsection (2) in relation to postal voters' lists, the Minister should tell us why the parliamentary draftsmen, or these experts he is quoting, have told him that these words must remain and that our amendment could not be accepted.  We would like to know what bad effect our amendment would have and why it is so absolutely essential to retain the wording of the subsection.  There is something in this which we cannot see and which the Minister has not explained to the House.  It is for this reason that we are seeking an explanation of the matter from the Minister.</P>

There is nothing wrong with it but I am satisfied that the section as it is at present worded is perfectly able to do the job for which it was intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy has changed feet from the question of the area to the question of wording of who should do what.  When the changes take <Col N="2224" /> place, as they will very shortly, each local authority will draw up a list of postal voters which is small and will also have a list of registers which will be broken into subsections and which will not be sent out until such time as the next general election is declared.

      <P>When the debate was adjourned yesterday I said that <Col N="2225" /> it would be in the interest of many small farmers to fertilise their land and grow grass as they did last year but they were unable to do so unless some assistance was provided for them to purchase fertilisers and manures. Credit should be made freely available, interest free, from some source to enable smallholders in particular to keep their stock of calves and young cattle.  It was disgraceful on the part of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to decontrol animal food on the 20th December last.  The Minister stated this was done on the advise of farming organisations.  It was the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, on the advice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who called in the farming organisations and advised them if they accepted it this way they would do better.  Both Ministers have reneged their responsibilities to the farmers by decontrolling the price of animal food.  It is far better to have some control than have no control at all.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the increase in the price of fertilisers was handled was disgraceful.  The manufacturers, the compounders and the importers must have known in advance they were going to get an increase because around Christmas, when many farmers tried to buy in some fertilisers and manures, they could not get them because the merchants and the co-ops did not have any in stock.  Once the increase was announced, CIE were kept very busy supplying all the merchants and the co-ops throughout the country.  There was a lot of stockpiling. Many of the merchants and the co-ops are fed up with the way in which this business was handled.  It will take a tremendous effort to restore confidence if the small farmer is to produce cattle and pigs at a desirably high level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot allow prices like this to develop again.  The pig industry is in a very bad state.  Things are so bad that thousands of sows in young are being slaughtered weekly because the price of feedingstuff has gone up so high.  It is uncontrolled <Col N="2226" /> and no new markets are being opened up for bacon.  I suggest a few ways to the Minister by which he could improve the situation.  The EEC and the banks should be asked to make more money available to farmers. Rate collectors should be asked to go easy between now and the 31st March particularly in relation to the smallholders. The Minister should ask his colleague to give back to the small farmers the medical cards which were taken from them last year.  The dole to small farmers should be increased. Interest free loans should be made available to enable farmers to provide feed for young and unfinished cattle and also to enable them to rear bonhams.</P>
    <P>The Minister should do something positive about opening up an export market for calves.  A special case could be made to the EEC for subsidies. Other countries have done this and we should also be able to do it.  Some form of assistance should be made available immediately for the small farmers.  Unlike big farmers, they cannot hold out under the present depression in their industry.  The Government should make available the additional money coming in under VAT particularly in relation to the substantial increases imposed on farm feedingstuffs.  Last night the Minister said that we should get away from insularity of outlook and realise that we are now a remote island on the perimeter of Europe.  I cannot understand the Minister's statement here.</P>

Now that we are one of the nine countries in the EEC and a small island we must watch our people's interests more than ever before.  I believe the Minister must act now in the interest of the small farmers.  I do not care whether or not they outnumber <Col N="2227" /> the big farmers but the Minister must act on their behalf now if they are to survive.  Those people have to maintain their homes and families out of the income they obtain from their small farms.  They cannot survive if they cannot get good prices for their cattle and calves.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister stated that farmers were getting a good price for their milk.  They want every penny of it.  We look forward to farmers getting more money for their milk this year than they ever got before.  The Minister should do something about it.  He can do something about the situation because where there is a will there is always a way.</P>

      <P>Today is the 6th March and it is not too many days since the 26th February.  While we all welcome a motion dealing with our main industry, agriculture, I wonder what kind of dialogue exists between the present Fianna Fáil spokesman on agriculture and his leader, Deputy Lynch?  At a meeting in Cork, as reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> of the 26th February, 1974.  Deputy Lynch addressed himself to our main industry, agriculture.  In his statement, as reported in <i>The Irish Press</i>, he said that 1973 was an exceptionally good year for farmers, that £34 million was the profit margin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I must say that I am in agreement with Deputy Lynch and not with the ologoning of Deputy Collins and Deputy O'Leary last night and tonight who are endeavouring to undermine confidence in our main industry.  A few months ago I read in a newspaper what Deputy Lynch, the Leader of the Opposition, said at a constituency meeting in Waterford.  He thought farmers were sufficiently well off now <Col N="2228" /> and that it was about time they came within the income tax net.</P>

      <P>It would be reasonable to assume that if Fianna Fáil had continued in office and if Deputy Lynch continued as Taoiseach, we might be discussing this question which he posed to his followers in County Waterford, that is, the question of taxation.  I do not propose to labour that point any further but if Deputy Fitzgerald visits the Library he will find the relevant information.  Deputy Collins put forward a vaguely-worded motion deploring the decline in farm income.  All of us deplore a decline in the income of any section of the community. We would like to see prices for pigs and calves continue at the 1973 level.  The Deputy is trying to show how concerned he is about the farmers' welfare and, by implication, he is attempting to assert that the <Col N="2229" /> Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries are not taking adequate steps to safeguard the interests of the farmers.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to throw bouquets at the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries but it has been acknowledged by farming organisations and newspaper commentators that he is doing an excellent job for Irish farmers.  I have no doubt he has their confidence. As the Minister mentioned last night, when he went before farmers in a constituency favourable to Fianna Fáil where they got two Deputies out of three, that decision was reversed and the confidence of farmers in County Monaghan in the Government contributed to the result of the election.</P>
      <P>I have contributed to many discussions on agriculture during the years and I am satisfied, as I am sure are Deputies Collins and O'Leary, that the Minister is doing everything he possibly can to help the industry both in and outside the country.  We know that because of our membership in the EEC he is frequently outside the country fighting the cause of the farmers. He has an exceptionally difficult task in Brussels.  When Deputy Gibbons was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries he said that once we got into the EEC the farmers could sit back and the money would roll in, with increased prices for milk and pigs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy indicated that so far as farmers were concerned the EEC was all roses with no thorns.  There are a few thorns and I am sure everyone appreciates that <Col N="2230" /> fact.  I am not reflecting in any way on our membership of the EEC but when Deputy Gibbons was Minister did he not foresee that if prices for our milk products and for beef increased there would be a corresponding increase in inputs?  It is clear he did not but that is what has happened. In fact, it would have happened on a larger scale if Deputy Gibbons were sitting on the seat occupied by the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins referred to the fact that cattle numbers had increased but that fodder stocks were not adequate to meet the increased demand.  He wondered why we did not advise the people last year to sell cattle.  The Minister answered that last night: he indicated in early autumn that it would be advisable to sell surplus stock.  I remember Deputy Gibbons and Deputy Crinion last June or July raising the question of selling young cattle which were fetching very good prices then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not much foresight shown by Deputy Gibbons or Deputy Crinion.  In this House they advised the farmers not to adopt this course and they implied that prices would continue to increase. In addition, not being satisfied with answers given them at Question Time, they thought the matter of sufficient importance to raise it on the Adjournment.  As a result, some people who might have sold their calves did not do so and, consequently, they suffered a loss. Shortly afterwards there was an EEC directive that had something to say about the export of calves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that the prices in any of the EEC countries for calves or weanlings at the moment do not compare with prices obtaining last year.  There is nothing the Minister, <Col N="2231" /> the Government, or Fianna Fáil can do about that.  It is something we must accept, we must make the best of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the lowest prices for beef and calves in the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary said we should try to find a market for calves at enhanced prices.  He imagines this is available in any of the EEC countries and that it can be done at a charge of 12½ per cent but this is not the case.  The Deputy seems to think that we need pay only a little more than £6 for a calf which will subsequently sell on the export market for £50 but that is not so.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary comes from a constituency somewhat similar to west Cork.  He said the Minister will abolish farm building grants, water grants and other benefits to the farmers but that is not so.  The Minister had to fall in line with EEC policy with regard to aids and helps to farmers to develop their holdings, for example, the installation of water supplies and the provision of outoffices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have all the available rates here but time does not permit me to give the figures.  I advise Deputies like Deputy O'Leary who seemingly did not take the trouble of getting the memorandum setting out these grants and aids to do so without delay.  The Deputy has no case on the question of farm building grants.  He will find in the memorandum the grants that are now available. It would take up too much of <Col N="2232" /> the time at my disposal to give the figures but they are there.  I hope that if he has misled any of his constituents through his lack of information he will give them the correct figures.</P>
      <P>I accept that the prices of our young cattle are not too good at present.  I also accept that every effort is being made by the Government, through the Minister, to get the last possible penny for our stock on the export market.  That is being done. The same position applies in England; it applies in the Northern part of this country; and it applies in all the EEC countries.  We know the fight the Minister has to make to get price increases in the Common Market.  We know there are member states in the Common Market who are not too favourably disposed towards increasing the price of agricultural products. We knew that, or should have known it, before we joined the Common Market.  That was a self-evident fact.</P>
      <P>In Western European countries with a proportionately high population so far as the consuming public are concerned as against those in production, particularly in agricultural production, naturally the pendulum would be swinging towards trying to keep prices as far down the scale as possible. I am assuming that is happening and I am also assuming that our Minister is doing excellent work to try to get the pendulum swinging the other way.  Instead of decrying him, as the new shadow Minister tried to do last night, in a situation such as this the Minister should have the support of the combined farming community and of Members of this House who are interested in farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the milk question last night.  It can be accepted that milk prices are reasonably good.  Deputy Gibbons was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and I know the problems the farming organisations had with him and his predecessors in trying to get an increase of 1d. or 2d. a gallon in the price of milk.  We all know that 1d. or 2d. at that time was not nearly as much as 1p or 2p today, <Col N="2233" /> taking decimal currency into account. The Deputy should not laugh.  People closely associated with him spent days in Upper Merrion Street in the wind and weather trying to get the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;who, now in Opposition, are claiming to be so mindful of the farmers and farming interests&mdash;to meet them.</P>

      <P>I am sure the farming community will accept that in the present Minister they have somebody who excels Deputy Gibbons and his predecessor, to put it mildly.  At that time it was very difficult for representative members of the farming community and for delegates of the farming organisations to meet the Minister.  The present Minister told us last night that he has discussed the agricultural position again and again with the heads of the farming organisations and other interested bodies.  That is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very different from the time when Fianna Fáil were in office.  Another question in which the country at large are very interested and which causes us a great deal of concern is the question of pigs.  I am trying to select the issues which it is vital to discuss at present, whether they are palatable or otherwise.  I am well aware that pig production is not showing very much profit this year as compared with last year.  Possibly it is down £3 or £4 per pig.  It may be said with justification that there is no profit at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down through the years I advocated in this House the desirability of strengthening our pig industry in any way possible and particularly by enticing, if that term is appropriate, our small farmers, our cottiers and others to get into that industry.  What is <Col N="2234" /> happening at present?  What could Fianna Fáil do if they were on this side of the House?  We have to sell our bacon at surplus prices, mainly across the water to Britain.  There is not much demand for bacon at a big price at present.  Unfortunately it is down to £620 this week.  I appreciate that that is a small price having regard to the cost of feedingstuffs.</P>
    <P>We had lengthy discussions here over the past weeks at Question Time and on other occasions on the price of feedingstuffs.  It was reasonable to assume that farmers growing grain and cereals would be entitled to increases the same as other sections. We know that the price of barley has increased and that grant prices have increased to a level of possibly up to 100 per cent.  We know this was the great question towards the end of 1973.  So much so that it was felt that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should not impose any control at all on the prices of feedingstuffs but let them find their own level through fair competition.  In decontrolling the price of feedingstuffs the Minister was acting in accordance with the united voice of the farming organisations and of most Deputies, particularly, as I understand it, those who are supposedly the main spokesmen on agriculture in the Fianna Fáil benches.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that exorbitant profits are being made.  We have facts and figures in the Department.  We know there is a divergence in prices varying from one part of the country to another.  The Minister dealt adequately with that last night when he indicated the prevailing average prices here, in England, and in Northern Ireland.  I accept that the problem of the pig industry is a difficult one. I hope people who are in pig production will continue in it because I have not got the slightest doubt that there is bound to be an increase in the price of bacon in the not too distant future. It must come, of necessity, by virtue of the fact that our complaint here is similar to the complaints of pig producers in Britain and pig producers on the Continent.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to bear in mind also, <Col N="2235" /> the fact that another matter having an adverse effect on our selling powers is the increase in production by continental producers.  I understand production in the former Six Members of the Community has increased by more than 6 per cent and in Germany alone the increase is of the order of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>I believe I can say, without fear of contradiction, that so far as the pig industry is concerned it is engaging the special attention of the Minister. Time, possibly, did not allow him last night to emphasise that point.  At home and abroad every possible step that can be taken is being taken to safeguard the industry and bring back profitability.</P>

      <P>The manoeuvres of Fianna Fáil, and particularly those of the new shadow Minister, will not gain any credibility in the country.  This motion talks about deploring prices and implies that the Government are responsible. I stressed before and I stress it again now that there is no justification for that assertion.  This Government, Labour and Fine Gael, are mindful of the interests of our main industry.  We are anxious to see that our agriculturists get the same treatment as other <Col N="2236" /> sections of the community.  I said at the outset that they are getting that treatment through the increases obtainable since this Government took office.  We must bear in mind&mdash;I said this in the last Dáil&mdash;that we are not the sole managers now so far as agriculture is concerned.  We are sharing management with the other eight Members of the Community.  We have to try to make the Community work. It could not be made to work if the Minister were to agree with the suggestion made by Deputy O'Leary or Deputy Collins to use the power of veto.</P>

      <P>I felt like applauding when the Parliamentary Secretary sat down.  I thought the Minister performed with remarkable hard neck last evening but he has been, of course, completely outshone this evening by his Parliamentary Secretary.  I never in my life listened to such a load of brazenfaced misrepresentation. Deputy Collins's motion in my opinion, and I offer my opinion with becoming modesty, is one designed by someone who is himself one of the people we are talking about; he is a farmer.  It is always entertaining to hear the opinions of shopkeepers and people in other walks of life about how we, the farmers, are getting on and all the money we are making.  If we were to take the Parliamentary Secretary at his word, we have never done so well.  However, it is my opinion, as a farmer, that we are in a very serious position indeed and Deputy Collins's motion is no more than a statement of the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the Minister's amendment is tendentious and misleading <Col N="2237" /> when he says it recognises there have been cases where individual farmers have suffered losses.  By the Lord Harry, the Minister never said a truer word in his life.  His amendment would seem to suggest two, three, 50 or 100.  How many farmers in Monaghan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;or Cavan, or west Cork, where the great proportion of our pigs are produced, would endorse that argument?  Every man-jack is in serious trouble.  Even the Parliamentary Secretary, whose confidence in his Minister is, shall we say, almost incredible&mdash;it has to be seen to be believed&mdash;did allow himself to say that those who are feeding pigs at the moment are not making any money.  He went on to say there was nothing he or anybody else could do about that and the Minister was doing all kinds of clever things here and in Europe to alleviate the situation.  I asked him by way of interjection&mdash;I hope he forgives my rudeness&mdash;what things the Minister was doing.  He did not tell us.  He described my question as a simple question.  It was a very simple question.  I asked what are the great things the Minister is doing for the pig producers.  I do not know and I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary knows.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to what the Minister said last night.  He seemed quite happy and quite smug.  Someone in the Department took out a percentage, a vital statistic, for him preparatory, I suppose, to this debate and told him there had been an increase of about 32 per cent in farm incomes during the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to analyse this in a minute but I want to remind the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary that the year prior to that there was an increase of 38 per cent in farm incomes, an all-time record, and I would like the Parliamentary <Col N="2238" /> Secretary to make a note of that because it is a useful piece of information.  When the Minister was giving out the laurels, mostly to himself, he dwelt with great pleasure on the fact that there had been a substantial increase in the price of milk supplied to creameries.  He monopolised all the credit for this himself. Then he went on to talk about other areas in farming production&mdash;pigs, beef and sheep.  In these areas he ascribed their condition to reasons other than his own cleverness.  Everybody in the sheep business, including myself, knows that what kept the sheep market open last year was the comparatively competitive position of sheep meat in the European market as against other forms of meat.</P>
      <P>When the Minister went on to discuss beef production he had the effrontery to say&mdash;not for the first time, mind you; I have heard him say it before&mdash;that the farmers had only themselves to blame.  They spent their money foolishly in the year.  They bought their cattle too dearly and, worse again, they failed to provide fodder for the cattle they had bought. What the Minister was telling those farmers was that they were incompetent, bad managers and incompetent, bad managers have no place in Irish farming today.  If you extend that argument further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Those are the people who lost all that money in the cattle trade in the last six months especially.  They are in the wrong job.  They should get out of farming altogether.  The implication was almost that if they had been competent and clever they would not have lost the money at all.  The cruel fact is that since the 8th of May last year until quite recently, when the grass began to improve again, there was a steady dropping away of live weight prices per hundred weight at every single market which took place in this country.  I do not think we have ever seen in the history of this country such a calamitous drop in the price of cattle, certainly not in the last 30 years.</P>

      <P>He told the House that, whereas farmers in 1972 were getting about £27 or £28 a ton from the combine for barley, the condition this time was that they were getting about £44.  I would put it somewhat less&mdash;£42 or £43, certainly in the south Leinster area.  That is a very good increase.  What escaped the Minister's attention and what I tried to get some information about from his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce but failed, is this.  How does it come about that the barley going into stores&mdash;possibly with as low as 14 per cent to 15 per cent moisture &mdash;can be coming out at 65?  We are told by the Government that nothing can be done to get the price of pig feed down.  Surely this is the greatest nonsense.  Surely if the Minister is so active on behalf of the pig feeders of west Cork and the other pig feeding areas in this country, that area could have been investigated.  There was not a single gesture about it and there is no doubt at all that there has been very serious profiteering in this area.  The profiteering is being carried out at the expense of the people who can stand it least, the small farmers operating in poor land who cannot readily turn to any other line of production. I was talking about land of differing quality in the Counties Cavan and Monaghan and in west Cork. They happen also to be areas where there is a very large proportion of our pigs produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have done a grave enough job in dressing up the terrible facts but the facts are very terrible. There is nobody denying that people in milk production, sending <Col N="2240" /> milk to creameries, have been enjoying a rising standard of living and it is about time too.

      <P>Oddly enough, I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that even the people who are getting a satisfactory price for milk are losing heavily in the prices they obtained for their calves.  Many people who are in concentrated milk production do not keep calves.  I sincerely hope that the trade will rally.  I believe it will rally because I have the feeling that the Commission in Brussels will take certain steps which will remedy the situation in the beef area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before concluding, I want to recommend certain other courses to the Minister for his consideration.  There is no denying the fact that even milk producers, who are at the top of the income scale, acre for acre, suffered very serious losses as a result of the drop in calf prices.  As late as the other day you could buy calves for £15 and that is a far cry from the prices going 12 months ago.  Even the Parliamentary Secretary, with his infinite craft and brazenfacedness, could not say anything but that people who are in pigs, at the present time are losing money.  You need not be a great mathematician to work out the celebrated problem known as the hogcorn ratio and deduce from that, even if you were unfortunate enough to be involved in pig production yourself, that all those people are in very serious trouble.  Thousands of them have nothing else to which to resort.  It is no good for the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2241" /> to be bleating about the tough conditions in the British market. Things were never easy in the British market.  In fact, as members of the EEC, the weapons we have now, to improve conditions in the British market are better than we ever had before.  The cattle trade and the people involved in it are in a very bad situation.  However, I am confident it will rally.</P>
    <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary or some other member of his party suggest that it is our purpose to weaken confidence?  Why should we want to do that?  Surely our biggest national asset is our cattle herd.  A very significant pointer as to the prosperity or otherwise of that cattle herd are the price of calves and of young stock generally.  Surely confidence has been shattered in recent weeks and it is through no fault of this party or anybody in it.  That is not what this party exists for.  This party was created to improve this country, build it up and that is what we have always turned our hand to with remarkable success.  We are not ready yet to accept lectures on how we should conduct our affairs from the Parliamentary Secretary or anybody else in the Fine Gael or Labour Parties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a document here which was circulated in my constituency 12 months ago.  It was of a kind supplied to all constituencies.  Photographs of the candidates were sent to the electorate. There was a picture of the Taoiseach and the policy statement included the statement that one of the economic aims of the new Government would be to stabilise prices.  It was said that Fine Gael in Government would immediately introduce strict price control.  The statement also said that small farmers would be helped and that people other than farmers would not be allowed to speculate in land.  A vigorous land <Col N="2242" /> reclamation programme was mentioned and it was said that long-term leasing of land would be encouraged at low interest rates.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about these very solemn promises.  The promises were expressed very emphatically by speakers on behalf of what are now called the National Coalition.  There was a firm undertaking given to everybody, including farmers, that prices would immediately stop rising. In the history of this country no one ever saw such a calamitous escalation of prices as has occurred in the past year.  The use of fertilisers, possibly even vital fertilisers like phosphates, will decrease because they cost too much.  That will react unfavourably on farm production and on the farmers' confidence about which the Parliamentary Secretary is so worried.  I am pleased to note that the Parliamentary Secretary is worrying about me and the other farmers.</P>

      <P>In the history of Irish politics there never was such a cynical promise made.  This promise has been cynically betrayed.  It affected housewives in Dublin, but most of all it affected the farming community.  The most important national asset we have is our cattle herd.</P>
      <P>There are some very serious obstacles in the EEC to the alleviation of our present situation.  The demand is on the Commission for better guide prices. This move is being led at present by the French Minister who is, I understand, holding out for a 17 per cent increase.  He will be opposed by the Germans and the British who will try to deal with the Commission's 10 per cent as a maximum figure, if they do not fight that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be that as it may, outside total monetary union we will never really have a satisfactory and stable situation in the cattle trade.  There are certain measures that should be adopted. Commissioner Lardinois speaking in Strasbourg seemed to suggest that certain restrictions on the dumping of frozen beef into the EEC should be contemplated.  He made another very <Col N="2243" /> important suggestion to me personally. Except for one colleague I was the only Irish person present when he spoke.  It was at the time when our other colleagues departed at the crack of dawn to take up their positions here when there was panic about a division.</P>
    <P>I will attempt to paraphrase what M. Lardinois said.  He said that certain action was open to the Irish Government in the monetary field which would guarantee the Irish farmers very substantial increases in their incomes and that these increases would be produced very quickly.  I took him to mean the introduction of a device which the Italians have benefited from for some considerable time.  I took him to mean the introduction of the green £1, the green púnt, the Irish £1.  I accept that this is an extremely complicated question. I do not pretend to understand all its implications.  I am absolutely convinced that since the Commissioner was not speaking lightly when he spoke in the Parliament and since he did speak to us Irishmen we would do well to examine this as a matter of great urgency and possibly to accept the recommendation which he made. I urge this very strongly on the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he did not say that.  I suppose the Minister is going to claim he did so?  Clever man. What is material&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and important is that the incomes of the people in farming other than in milk production have suffered very severely in recent years.  If this measure can give them an increase in their incomes it should be adopted.  It is as simple and as brief as that.  The quantity of frozen beef imported into the EEC from third countries in the last 12 months approached one million tons. <Col N="2244" /> Obviously this is having serious effects and producing distortions in France and in this country.  It is producing more distortions in this country than anywhere else because nowhere within the EEC has the price of cattle dropped so much below the intervention price as it has in this country.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was saying that the situation was the same in Great Britain.  It is not.  In Great Britain they are breaking even at intervention price.  We are at 89 per cent of that price, and that is 11 per cent less than the British.  This is nothing to be smug about.  It is significant that the Parliamentary Secretary should so lightly dismiss this extraordinary circumstance.  The fact is that because of the distortions set up in the European market by the peculiar monetary situation we are being driven back again, willy-nilly, to the British market which we had thought to break out of to some extent at any rate, although I do not say we should abandon it forever.</P>
      <P>We were all confident and are still confident that we can establish ourselves in the mainland markets again, but effectively we have been driven out of those markets since the introduction of the scarcity regulations last August.  When one contemplates the vastly increased size of our herd, we realise that something must be done urgently.  Britain will not be in a position to absorb a large number of stores, such as we normally send them.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said, somewhat sanctimoniously, that we should all be on the side of the Minister in his negotiations for this country in Brussels.  We are.  We accept that he is a Minister of the Irish Government acting for the Irish nation, and he will have all our support while the work he is doing is productive. We have to be satisfied that this is in fact the case.  When I invited the Parliamentary Secretary to say in one area, the area of pigs, what exactly the Minister was doing, the Parliamentary Secretary was evidently unable to say.  May I inquire how much time I have left?</P>

The farmer has to pay for the delivery of that barley.  He has to pay for its delivery to his door and he has to pay for its delivery from his door.

      <P>What we have been discussing here yesterday evening and this evening is what could be termed real farm incomes.  It is very difficult to qualify the income of a farmer for one week or one month, no matter what type of farming he is doing.  The only thing we can do is to assess the farmer's income for the year gone by and to consider briefly what is in store for 1974.  Like the last speaker, I am a farmer myself, being involved in dairy farming and mixed farming. I claim that 1973 was the best year the Irish farmer ever had.</P>

      <P>He has just come into the House.  The motion here before us, which was put down by the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Agriculture, is not sincere, because it is criticising the Minister who was Minister for Agriculture in 1973, the best year the Irish farmer ever had.  Let us take dairying over the past year.  I was amazed when I heard Deputy Gibbons says that during the Fianna Fáil term of office the dairy farmer got the biggest increase ever in 50 years for a gallon of milk.  Last year the price was increased by 4.5p.  It is not long since people delivered milk to the creameries for that price and lower.  4.5p is almost a shilling a gallon increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Calves last year were making between £50 and £60, which brought a considerable cash benefit to the farming community.  If the Opposition Deputies who spoke here were sincere they would accept that, because it is a fact and it is accepted by the farming community.  It is not so long since in Deputy Collins's own constituency the farming organisations and the farming community <Col N="2248" /> there congratulated the Minister on the job he was doing.</P>
      <P>The price of beef was also at a very high level last year and brought a considerable income to the farming community.  I am glad that at long last the Irish farmers are being rewarded for the energy and effort they put into their way of life.  It is our major industry and we should all take pride in the fact that 1973 was a good year.  The farmers themselves were the first to admit it.</P>
      <P>However let us deal with what is going to happen in 1974.  While it has not yet been announced, I expect that in May, 1974, there will be a further increase in the price of milk.  This is very necessary and will be very welcome. What the Minister should be doing is encouraging as many people as possible to go into the dairying industry because, as is generally accepted, there is a good future for dairying in the context of the EEC.  I have no doubt that the natural advantage of our cheap production costs will benefit the dairy industry considerably. Therefore any of those who have left dairying are preparing to go back into it because they can see a good future in it.</P>
      <P>In regard to beet, there is a price increase from £7.70 to £9.20 for 1974. This was a very favourable agreement which was accepted by the Beet Growers' Association and by the farming community.  I am glad this means an increase to the beet growers and the farming community generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also an increase in respect of vegetables and horticulture in 1974, in some instances as high as 20 percent and this is a big increase for the farming community.  Admittedly, the cost of production has gone up but at least they have got an increase in the price of their products and this is what matters.  There is a big increase in the case of malting barley and a favourable deal has been negotiated with which the farming community have expressed satisfaction.  I am informed that just now in mid-spring quite a lot of preparation is being made, given favourable weather, for sowing grain and early potatoes.  No effort by the Opposition will undermine <Col N="2249" /> the confidence of the farmers. For that reason I say this motion is not sincere.  The co-ops which are owned by the farming community are in a very healthy and strong financial position.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the previous speaker spoke of the pigs and bacon industry.  What the Parliamentary Secretary said is true.  At this stage the profit from pig producing is very little, if any.  This is a tragedy.  I blame the people who are now crying aloud about it.  If we could confine the pig and poultry industry to the small farming community, we would solve much of the small farmer's problem. It is well to examine what happened in the fifties and sixties.  We encouraged big combines to take over the poultry industry which is now completely taken over.  In the case of the pig industry, for example, we grant-aided people who had no connection with farming and were not involved in it.  We helped them to take over the pig industry and take the livelihood from the small farmers.</P>

      <P>As far as the pig industry is concerned the people who put down this motion have much to answer for.  I have been almost nine years in the House and I have seen Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries who tried to divide and conquer the farming community.  Because of their attitude down through the years they have succeeded in organising the farming community and I have no doubt that the industry is safe in the hands of the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened attentively to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who, I gather, has spoken for only the second time in this House on agriculture over a period of 12 months and has only done so now because the motion on behalf of Fianna Fáil made him do so, I am more convinced than ever that the Labour-Fine Gael Government, <Col N="2250" /> this Dublin-based Government have no real sympathy or understanding for the farm families.  Surely the Minister's contribution in this too-short debate confirms that it is an urban-minded and union-dominated Administration and that it is totally unaware that 80 per cent of our farmers are engaged in an increasingly grinding struggle to win a livelihood from small farms which are barely economic.</P>
      <P>We heard charges of insularity against me because of what I said, because of my fight for the small farmers I represent here.  As a matter of interest and education for the Minister, I would have more small farmers in the smallest parish of my constituency than the Minister would have in all the Dublin constituencies put together including his own.  These charges, made because of my effort to stand up and be counted, are positive proof that the Labour-Fine Gael Government are not fighting or dedicating themselves to fighting the case of our small farmers in the EEC councils or anywhere else.  If one looks at the composition of this political alliance of Labour and Fine Gael, could one expect otherwise?  On one hand we have Fine Gael, commonly known as the ranchers party, described publicly as the big farmers party by no less a person than their leader, when he made his last speech on agriculture. One need only look at the Fine Gael Deputies and see how many of them would be eligible for classification under the new farm modernisation scheme as small farmers or transitional farmers, as we now call them.  It is obvious that well-to-do farmers have always been catered for by Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that they always gave their support to Fine Gael.  But let there be no mistake about it, the small farmers have not forgotten the present Taoiseach's philosophy of the 100-cow farmer.  On the Labour side of the House, which is, unfortunately, empty, it is fair to say that we might have one or two <Col N="2251" /> members with a genuine interest in the small farmer but he&mdash;or they, if there is more than one&mdash;must be submerged by urban-based colleagues who dominate the party, these so called trade unionists who never did anything and at present have no intention of doing anything to protect the rural community which is based on the small farm community.</P>
      <P>That being the situation, it is no wonder that Labour and Fine Gael representatives in the European Parliament are poles apart.  Fine Gael are allied to the Christian Democrats and the Labour Party representatives shelter under the umbrella of the Socialists whose avowed aim, as we know, is the destruction of the common agricultural policy as we know it and upon which our existence as an agricultural community depends.</P>
      <P>My motion states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the serious decline in farm income which has been aggravated by the enormous increases in farming costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, his Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I am sure he will not take offence if I liken him to &ldquo;His Master's Voice&rdquo; after his performance tonight&mdash;and his backbenchers must recognise that, despite what their representatives said during this debate, the position of Irish agriculture today is as stated in my motion.  I presented my case in this involuntary debate&mdash;involuntary so far as the Coalition Government are concerned&mdash;in a fair and forthright manner.  It is now on the records of this House.  It was not challenged by the Minister or any of the speakers who came after him.  It is very interesting to note, again from the record, that the Minister who had 30 minutes to make his case against my motion, which he knows to be a true and genuine one, spent 20 minutes out of his 30 precious minutes haranguing me about many things, including the Monaghan by-election. This election is a thing of the past. However, as it was mentioned, I should like to say that the Coalition <Col N="2252" /> candidate struggled home by a short head&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have this eight-month-old Labour-Fine Gael Government, this self-styled all-star Government, asking the electorate for another chance.  They got their man home.  I do not deny that fact.  They would not have got him home but for the fact that they got help from various sources including the Communist Party and Aontacht Éireann. As the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is in the House let me add that they barely got their candidate home despite the tremendous efforts of the Minister and those working with him.</P>
      <P>I will treat the personal allegations of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries against me with the contempt they deserve by ignoring them. Let him not think that the smoke-screen he tried to raise will cloud the dismal picture which unfortunately exists in agriculture today.  The fact that he deliberately wasted two-thirds of his debating time in an old-fashioned and outmoded style of harangue will be interpreted widely by the farming community for what it was.  It was nothing other than dismal failure on his part and on the part of his Government to use their time wisely and intelligently in bringing benefits to the many who have their backs to the wall and who are ruing the day that this country was yoked to yet another Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is trying to blame, directly or indirectly, the farming organisations for the Government's panic actions during and after the Monaghan by-election when they decontrolled the prices of feedingstuffs. The ordinary farmer blames the Government, and particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for allowing the situation to develop as <Col N="2253" /> it did.  Of course consultation is very important and the Minister seemingly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Consultation is wise.  One should seek opinions and advice.  Having done that, the manly thing then is to make one's own decisions and to be prepared to stand over them.  The Minister's actions in this regard have been most unwise and many people will suffer.  He seems to have a fixation about consultation, and it is right that he should.  I respectfully suggest to him and the Government that we and the public at large should know that consultations should begin in this House.  That is why this institution is here.  Let those elected to speak on behalf of the people have the opportunity of saying what they want.  The Minister is once again being less than honest with Dáil Éireann if he expects us to accept his interpretation of consultation.  In November last the Minister did not consult Deputies in regard to what their views might be on the decontrolling of prices of feedingstuffs.  If he had done so he might not have made, in conjunction with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that grave and most harmful blunder.</P>

He could not find time to condemn the merchants who made a profitable racket out of the sale of beet pulp.  He could not find time to say a word about our glasshouse industries which have their backs to the wall.</P>

He could not find time to say anything about the price differential in feedingstuffs of up to £25 per ton which we all know exists.

Despite the incompetence of the Government Fianna Fáil still have great faith and confidence in the ordinary commonsense of the Irish farmer and we believe that the many insurmountable problems they are faced with today will be overcome by them despite the unintentional <Col N="2255" /> efforts&mdash;and I will be that reasonable with the Minister&mdash;of the Government to thwart them in every way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. a.1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1) (a), line 20, after &ldquo;districts&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 provides:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a polling district existing at the passing of this Act is not wholly situate within one of the constituencies specified in the Schedule to this Act, the appropriate officer, after consultation with the returning officer for the constituency concerned, shall, with respect to the part of the polling district situate in a constituency so specified&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  join it or parts of it with any adjoining polling district or districts,</P>
      <P>We submit that the phrase &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo; should be added to subsection (1) (a) of section 7 as it is not clear from the way in which the section is presently worded where exactly the adjoining polling district is or the adjoining polling districts are.  The wording is loose. This is an attempt to deal with the situation where a polling district crosses boundaries.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that</i> 20 <i>Members were not present; House counted, and</i> 20 <i>Members being present.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was suggesting that the words I mentioned be added in order to ensure that the section would read into the record clearly what is intended.  The subsection refers to a polling district existing at the time this Bill comes into law which is not wholly within one constituency, that is, in any of the constituencies mentioned in the Schedule to the Act and that a polling district in such a specified constituency should join, or parts of it, with any adjoining polling district or districts.  We submit to the Minister that&mdash;as the section reads&mdash;the polling district or districts to which it should be attached is not clear.  It is not clear whether those districts are in the same constituency or in another.  There could be a situation where the boundaries of three constituencies came together, with adjoining polling districts on either side which were in different constituencies.  I should like the Minister to comment on the suggestion in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position about Deputy Molloy's amendment is that it does no harm but it does no good. If it were put into the Bill it would make no material change.  The situation as it stands is adequate for the purpose.  Perhaps the point which Deputy Molloy is missing is that no polling district can straddle a constituency. Therefore, the county secretary or city manager&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2265" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It could straddle two constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot straddle two or three, as Deputy Molloy said a moment ago; it cannot straddle the constituency boundary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It can adjoin it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is either in one constituency or the other.  People who are living in one constituency cannot vote in another.  Therefore, the city manager or county secretary cannot make an order except one which lays down that they shall vote in the constituencies in which they live.  It is as simple as that.</P>
      <P>A polling district may be made up of one or more district electoral divisions or parts of one or more district electoral divisions.  Some polling districts may be split between two or more of the new constituencies.  The section enables the county secretary or city manager, as the case may be, to make temporary polling arrangements for these split polling districts. He will have power to make each part of a split polling district into a separate polling district; he can join each part of the neighbouring polling district, or he can join bits of each part to a number of different polling districts.  It may sound terribly complicated but, in practice, it works out fairly well.  The arrangements made will be subject to the Minister.  The reason for this is because, in the ordinary way, polling schemes are subject to confirmation by the Minister. The temporary arrangements will not apply to by-elections held before the dissolution of a Dáil.  They will last only until a new polling scheme is established for the county or county borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is an important point: no problems arose out of the implementation of the corresponding provisions of the previous revision of constituencies.  For example, at the last review, seven polling districts in North County Meath, which was then in my own constituency, were split by the new constituency boundaries. There was no difficulty.  The arrangements were made.  Some of them were <Col N="2266" /> new boundaries which left portion of the old County Meath constituency in Meath; put some in Cavan and some in Monaghan, splitting areas, including the village in which I was born and reared.  A line was drawn down through the centre of the Meath constituency; half of it went to Cavan and half to Monaghan.  It split up the polling districts, seven different polling areas, and there was no difficulty. That was done under the existing legislation which we hope to re-enact here.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Molloy is asking here could be accepted but it would make no difference whatever.  It would simply mean the addition of words to the Bill.  What is in the Bill does exactly what he suggests the new words would do.  There is no point in accepting it because it does no harm or no good and the section, as it stands, is adequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that a polling district could not straddle two constituencies.  I do not recall that I said they would do so. What I am arguing about is that at the time of the passing of this Bill and until such time as the appropriate officer actually divides the polling district it will, in fact, straddle.  This is the purpose of the section, to ensure that polling districts are confined within the constituency.  Where they are being divided, this method will allow the appropriate officer to do this tidying up job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that any person reading subsection (1) (a) as it stands could be confused.  Our purpose is to state exactly in the legislation what is intended, putting it in as clear language as possible and not leaving it to the imagination.  The Minister submits that what we have suggested will do what we proposed it should do. The Minister has used the words that it will not do any harm.  I submit that the Minister should accept it; that it is clearer, simpler, more easily understood and states exactly what subsection (1) (a) is all about.  The other interpretation could be put on it&mdash;that it refers merely to adjoining polling districts and does not state <Col N="2267" /> that those adjoining polling districts must be within that constituency.  I am sure the Minister would agree with us that legislation should be improved, using clear and simple language where possible.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 some language was being used which we believed was anomalous and we suggested changes in it.  We regret that the Minister and his party in Government felt it necessary to use the guillotine method of passing that section rather than availing of the opportunity we gave them in the House and the numerous times we invited them to give us a reasonable and adequate explanation as to why those words should be retained; why the method of direction should be retained.  We maintain now that the section passed by guillotine is bad law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say I had no objection.  What I said was that the words would not do any harm or any good.  There is no point in putting in words just because Deputy Molloy feels he would like to have them; just <Col N="2268" /> because Deputy Molloy feels he would like to have an amendment made is no good reason for changing legislation going through the House.  I should like to facilitate the Opposition if I could.  In any Bill that I am handling here, if it turns out that there are matters which will improve it, I shall have no objection to including them, but I am not prepared to add words simply because Deputy Molloy would like them to go in and which I am convinced would not improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to make it clear and to explain how it will be within the constituency.  In the mind of the Minister it may not be necessary to spell this out, but I think it is necessary. Even at that, we are going to have problems when one thinks of the way this will operate.  I have one example here of an electoral area being affected by this section which the amendment seeks to change.</P>
      <P>There is an area in Donegal where the Six County area and the sea are close together.  It is on a neck of land between Bundoran and Donegal town, which is a long stretch.  When the interpretation comes to be placed on this Bill, when it becomes an Act, there will be, for some reason or other which I cannot figure out, quite a large number of polling areas along this narrow neck of land between the sea and the Border.</P>
      <P>Through the activities of the Minister one constituency shoots right up along straddling or bisecting or dissecting&mdash;anyway, cutting up&mdash;a number of polling districts.  As well as cutting up a number of polling districts, it wanders its way right and left along the main arterial road.  This will set the people who have to deal with this part of the Bill, which the amendment seeks to clarify, quite a difficult problem.  There is the converse section of the proposed new constituency of Donegal&mdash;by the way, that is Sligo/Leitrim running into Donegal and the other piece is Donegal running down another neck of land&mdash;where there is a problem not alone for the voters but for the people who will be dealing with the provisions of this section.  This is why we seek to make it quite clear that it is within the constituency that the Minister means.  It is a farcical situation.  The Minister could help immensely if instead of wandering along here and coming back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is well-known that at a point between Northern Ireland and this part of the country the Border actually runs through a dwelling house.  By the delineation of the borders of both constituencies and the main roadway it is quite possible that not alone will the polling area be dissected or bisected by a constituency boundary, but also that a dwelling house&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister.  If I am wrong, fair enough, but it would be a ridiculous situation if, due to the Minister's gyrations here in this part of Donegal, as well as the Border bisecting a house, you could have a borderline between the Donegal constituency and the Donegal-Sligo-Leitrim constituency bisecting a house. The people who come to implement the provisions of the section&mdash;and we are trying to help them by inserting this amendment&mdash;will have one hell of a problem if they find that a dwelling house is bisected by the line across which the polling district straddles.  I <Col N="2271" /> do not know whether the Minister has studied this before he drew the line or whether he was told to draw the line in a general way, but he may tell us. However, he will find that there will not be only seven electoral areas involved but that there will be quite a few.  Therefore I would urge that this amendment be accepted.</P>

      <P>As some of the Members on this side of the House said on section 6, which we were debating at some length until it was guillotined by the Minister, this Bill, by its very nature and title, concerns the general public.  At all times the language used in the Bill should be such as to be understandable, not just to the parliamentary draftsmen or to barristers or solicitors but to the layman. Deputy Molloy's amendment helps to clarify this section.  Sub-section (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Where a polling district existing at the passing of this Act is not wholly situate within one of the constituencies specified in the Schedule to this Act, the appropriate officer, after consultation with the returning officer for the constituency concerned, shall, with respect to the part of the polling district situate in a constituency so specified&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) join it or parts of it with any adjoining polling district or districts.</P>
      <P>The amendment adds to that: &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo;.  Subsection (1) (b) reads:</P>
      <P>Constitute it as a polling district and appoint a polling place for it.</P>
      <P>Again the amendment adds: &ldquo;within such constituency&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that Deputy Molloy's amendment clarifies the section.  What we have here are legalistic terms produced by the parliamentary draftsmen whose job it is to advise the Minister on the wording of any Bill he introduces.  It is our job as legislators to try to make as clear as possible <Col N="2272" /> for the ordinary man in the street the wording of any section in any Bill enacted here.</P>
      <P>The amendment is particularly necessary when one goes on to read section 7 (2) where you come to:</P>
      <P>An arrangement made pursuant to paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) shall be subject to the sanction of the Minister,</P>
      <P>We are going into dangerous territory when we come to items subject to the Minister's sanction.  Everything we said on section 6 is equally relevant on section 7.</P>

      <P>I fear the Minister is getting his jobs mixed up.  He is inclined to think he is Ceann Comhairle sometimes.  We spoke earlier about anything being subject to the sanction of the Minister because it is desirable that as little as possible should be subject to the Minister's sanction.  We saw by the operation of the Minister in his amendment of electoral areas for local elections exactly what the Minister can do when left to his own devices.  It is absolutely essential that we make the wording of this section as clear and as unambiguous as possible.</P>

      <P>This can be done by the inclusion of these words &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo; in (a) and &ldquo;within such constituency&rdquo; in <Col N="2273" /> (b).  In paragraph (b) of subsection (2) again there is reference back where it says:</P>
      <P>shall not have effect in relation to any bye-election occurring before the dissolution of Dáil Éireann which next occurs after the passing of this Act, and</P>
      <P>(c) shall have effect until (and only until) the first scheme under section 22 of the Electoral Act, 1963, in relation to the county or county borough in which the polling district is situate comes into operation after the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>This whole section hinges on section 22 of the Electoral Act, 1963, and Deputy Molloy's amendment is also connected with it.  We are attempting to enact legislation to redraft the constituencies and I feel we should clarify as far as possible for the electorate what is in our minds.  I should like to refer to the 1963 Act, section 22 (1) which deals with polling districts and polling places and which reads:</P>
      <P>The council of a county or corporation of a county borough may after consultation with the returning officer for Dáil elections in respect of the county or county borough and in accordance with regulations made by the Minister, make a scheme dividing the county or county borough into polling districts for the purpose of Dáil elections and elections of members of local authorities within the meaning of Part VI of this Act and appointing a polling place for each polling district.</P>

      <P>Yes, a Cheann Comhairle.  I was quoting section 22 which is relevant to this and I shall continue, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>(2)  A scheme under this section made by the council of a county or corporation of a county borough shall come into operation&mdash;</P>

    <P>Again we come to the question of the Minister's powers to confirm or not confirm orders depending on how he feels on that day.  Earlier, I referred to the way in which the Minister makes orders, in particular in relation to the local electoral areas.

      <P>I will return to the amendment put down by Deputy Molloy.  This section must be clarified before the Bill is passed.  There are polling districts in my constituency adjoining the existing constituency, part of which will be taken into the new North County constituency.  Some disstricts in the existing North County will be put into Dublin (Clontarf). There is an overlapping of polling districts from one constituency into another and polling districts in present constituencies are being changed into new constituencies.  It is for this and other reasons that Deputy Molloy put down his amendment.  In the light of the Minister's statement that he can see no harm in it and as he is a reasonable man, I hope he will be willing to accept the amendment.  We maintain that the addition of these words will clarify the Bill for members of the general public and do away with any ambiguity.  The Minister's reputation as a reasonable man would be enhanced by his acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The electorate in this country are highly intelligent and have understood what was in Electoral Bills over the years.  They realised that there were new arrangements being made in regard to constituencies, and that if <Col N="2277" /> polling districts were divided among three constituencies separate arrangements would be made.  They knew what was involved and accepted it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke started to explain the Bill with the assistance of the 1963 Act.  Not alone did he confuse the people outside the House but he succeeded in confusing himself.  I am sure that at the end of his speech he did not know what the Bill was all about&mdash;at least that is what it sounded like on this side of the House.  This amendment would not help to clarify the position which is already quite clear. The Electoral Polling Schemes Regulations, 1964, state that a polling scheme cannot and must not straddle constituency boundaries.  This puts the onus on the county secretary or the city manager not to do what Deputy Molloy's amendment says he must put in the Bill in order to prevent them from doing.  This situation has been very clear through the years.  The only people confused about it are the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have not heard anybody in the country experiencing any difficulty in knowing exactly what happened when the change of constituency boundaries was made.  It always worked out right and that was that.  I cannot see what all this song and dance is about.  Of course, the Deputies opposite said earlier that they would try to hold up the Bill for as long as they could.</P>
      <P>So far as Deputy Cunningham's problem in relation to the split polling district in Donegal is concerned, I do not think that it is relevant.  Therefore I will not dwell on it at any length.  He is trying to persuade us that the county secretary in Donegal would draw a polling line through a house and put one half in one polling district and the other half in the other. Not very many people would believe that and they would treat it with the contempt it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that that could not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not happen. Nobody is such a fool, whether he is a county secretary or an ordinary person, to divide a polling district by <Col N="2278" /> drawing a line through a house and putting one half in one polling district and the other half in an other.  This is what Deputy Cunningham has suggested. It is not relevant to the Bill. The Deputy should not have raised it and I should not have followed him along that line.</P>
      <P>So far as Deputy Molloy's amendment is concerned, the situation is clear.  It could be accepted but it would not do anything except add more words to the Bill and there are enough words in it already.  The position is clear and has been accepted as being workable over the years and will create no problems as it is stated in the section.  The Deputy should realise that and not proceed any further with it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As subsection (1) (a) stands, would it be possible that part of a polling district situated in one of the constituencies mentioned in the Schedule could adjoin polling districts which were situated in constituencies other than the constituency mentioned in this Schedule? That is quite possible.  One could give an example of a situation where not alone would it be adjoining two polling districts in two constituencies, the one in which it was intended to be and the adjoining constituency, but they could, in fact, also be adjoining a third.  We hold that the words we are suggesting are necessary to make it clear that this section says what it intends to do and the words in the subsection should state that clearly.  It should not be left to the imagination or common sense of the appropriate officer to decide.  The legislation should lay it down quite clearly and simply.  Would the Minister agree that it would be possible for part of a polling district in a constituency mentioned in the Schedule to adjoin polling districts in more than one constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The extraordinary thing about it is that for the past couple of hours Aunt Sallies have been set up by the Fianna Fáil Party for the purpose <Col N="2279" /> of knocking them down.  It does not matter whether it adjoins them or not, the onus is on the county secretary, or the city manager, to put them in a polling district in which they can vote in that constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  What should they do?  Move them completely out of the area?  The Deputy must give some little bit of credit to the people who are doing these things.  It has been accepted as the way to do it and if Deputy Molloy can show me in this section where this is not possible or where, by any stretch of the imagination, something like what he described could happen I would like to see it.  The last time Fianna Fáil did this job they divided my village into three and they divided the polling district at which I voted into three.  As a result of that there was no difficulty in moving the electors who formerly voted in one booth into the three different constituencies. We were all very mad about it but it was done and that was it. There is no difference between this and what happened before.</P>
      <P>The discussion here tonight, if it was listened to by people outside, would tend to confuse them except for the fact that I believe the electorate are very intelligent.  If one asks any man working on the street how this works he will tell you without any reference to the Bill or anything else.  He knows exactly what happens but Deputy Molloy, Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Raphael Burke do not know how it works and they are suggesting pitfalls which do not exist.</P>

      <P>It would simply add words which Deputy Molloy would like to see in.  Those words would do nothing to clarify the position.  It is quite clear as it is and I do not want to accept an amendment which would put words in just because someone feels he would like to have the words he likes in but which would not make one bit of difference.  It will neither clarify it nor anything else.  The section as it stands is quite clear, is easily understood, and what Deputy Molloy is suggesting could happen just could not happen.  It does not matter how many constituencies break up a polling area, the people will be voting for the candidates in the constituency in which they are.  That is the simple fact and the section makes that possible and that is all that is required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to read the subsection again:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2281" /> Where a polling district existing at the passing of this Act is not wholly situate within one of the constituencies specified in the Schedule to this Act, the appropriate officer, after consultation with the returning officer for the constituency concerned, shall, with respect to the part of the polling district situate in a constituency so specified&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) join it or parts of it with any adjoining polling district or districts,</P>
    <P>The amendment says:</P>
    <P>Within such specified constituency.</P>
    <P>Surely that clarifies this very much and puts it beyond any doubt?  As a matter of fact, it is the only way to make that perfectly clear legally on paper where one does not have any &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; or assumptions. That is an economy of words, copperfastening the whole provision. For that reason I would like to see the words suggested in the amendment included.  It could happen that without adding these words a legal wrangle could occur.  Questions could be raised on this but the wording suggested by Deputy Molloy makes it absolutely clear what is intended in the Act.  To put the matter beyond any doubt it would be better if the Minister included the words because it spells out what the subsection means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that what Deputy Cunningham is suggesting is too ridiculous for words.  Suppose it is left as it is, does Deputy Cunningham suggest that some county secretary would arrange for voters to vote in a constituency to which they did not belong because that is the only alternative?  The suggestion Deputy Cunningham is making is that unless those words are put in there is a danger of something like this happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, but there is a regulation which puts the onus on certain people.  The Deputy should know that the regulations laid down here insist on certain things being done.  We are talking about appointed officers who are doing certain jobs.  The suggestion is that some county manager, or city manager, or county secretary, would be so &ldquo;screwy&rdquo; that he would, in fact, take a group of people in an electoral area because they were moved into a different constituency and instead of arranging for them to vote at a polling booth related to that constituency would move them somewhere else.  If they had a vote in the constituency of Galway they would be moved to Roscommon, Clare or some other county where they have no relevance at all.  That is the essence of what Deputy Cunningham has been saying and if it is not perhaps he would explain what he does mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he does not imagine that any county secretary or county manager would be so &ldquo;screwy&rdquo; as to do that, but what we are arguing here is that he could do it and he could do it under the law because that is the way the section is written.  We are asking that it be specified that it must be done within the constituency to which it applies.  The Minister said that, in his view, it will not affect the section in any other way.  We maintain that it clarifies it, that it is specific, that is is necessary and that it does not give county managers or county secretaries the opportunity to do these &ldquo;screwy&rdquo; things, the examples given by the Minister.  We did not say that they would but what we are saying is that they could under this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister is so reluctant to add three or four words to this subsection which will eliminate this possibility even if the Minister imagines that the possibility is a very remote one.  Legislation can only be written once and we have only one opportunity to settle on <Col N="2283" /> the words and that is now as far as we on this side of the House are concerned. We are making our suggestion and we ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather ridiculous to hear a former Minister for Local Government displaying the fact that he does not know what the regulations affecting this sort of thing are.  If he knew the regulations he would know that under article 3 of the Electoral Polling Scheme Regulations, 1964, it is laid down that this is what must be done and it cannot be done in any other way.  That being so, for goodness sake would the Deputies opposite grow up and not pretend that in the case of something which cannot happen without a breach of the law we should now put in something in this Bill to again say you must do it in a certain way under the regulations. Now we are going to say you must do it again in this Bill.  There is absolutely no necessity for it and it is a ridiculous suggestion to put it in.</P>

      <P>The Minister accuses everybody of being stupid and he says that, of course, county managers and county secretaries could not be that stupid.  In reading various Acts of the Oireachtas one comes to a certain set of words which seem to be superfluous.  They are there to spell out beyond any doubt what is mentioned.  If the Minister is so cock-sure that county managers and county secretaries will do this job properly and will interpret what to our mind here is a very vague subsection, why then does he deem it necessary in subsection (2) (a) to say &ldquo;...subject to the sanction of the Minister&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This indicates to me that, overall, he does not trust county secretaries or county managers to do the job properly and takes unto himself the right of sanction or otherwise for whatever county managers and <Col N="2284" /> county secretaries may do.  I suggest the Minister should accept this amendment, those few words which are concise and which have a meaning for the ordinary person.  I think this amendment is necessary.  It may be that county managers and county secretaries will not do anything that is wrong although the Minister puts in a subsection requiring his sanction to what they do.  I again urge him to accept our amendment.</P>

      <P>If the polling booth was north of the line whoever voted in that polling booth was in that constituency.  If it was south of the line all the people who always voted in that polling booth voted there and they were in that constituency.  The polling booths down my way were not carved at all.  You voted wherever the polling booth was situated.  If it was in constituency X and even though some of the people were geographically in constituency Y you voted in X and vice versa in the case of Y.  Why could we not have that now instead of slicing up polling booths?  This may be a stupid question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not stupid at all. What Deputy Callanan says is quite correct.  If there was a division of a constituency beside a village or town and the most convenient polling station was normally in that village or town, even though it was outside the new constituency, it might be found convenient to use that polling station for the people who normally voted in that area.  Deputy Callanan is quite correct but that does not <Col N="2285" /> alter the argument which we have had here all night.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would be possible for 600 new voters to be in a particular polling district and that polling district be divided three ways into three different constituencies for Dáil elections. In fact, each of them might vote in his own constituency and would vote in any case for the candidates in his own constituency.  What Deputy Callanan says is quite correct and it is not unusual for the polling district to be just across the border if it was the most convenient place because there might not be any other convenient place to have the polling station.</P>

      <P>Deputy Loughnane has mentioned travelling polling booths but we have not reached that stage yet.  We might have to do something like that.  It is quite true that there are areas which are pretty far from polling stations.  The amendment which is suggested here would not do anything to improve that.  It suggests that something, which was introduced and which is good law and has operated for a long time, should now be changed.  It is agreed it has operated properly until now.  It must be agreed that the regulation to which I have referred which lays down who is responsible for drawing up the areas and deciding where people in a certain area will vote is correct.  Yet, it is suggested that we should insert in this Bill an amendment which, as I said at the start, does nothing to improve the matter but will just simply add some words to it and will do it no harm.  Deputy <Col N="2286" /> Molloy feels that is justification for having it done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  My comment is the considered comment of the Government and of previous Governments. Every Government connected with the drawing up of Electoral Bills in this House since the first one was drawn up considered this was the way to do it.  When Deputy Molloy was this side of the House he felt that was fair and right but he now feels it is not fair and right and he would like to have it changed.  Change for change sake should not be included in legislation going through Oireachtas Éireann.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy thinks it is an improvement and I am perfectly satisfied that it is not and, in fact, would simply add on some words which, in effect, would do nothing at all.  There was a reference made by Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Burke to the fact that the sanction of the Minister was required. In some peculiar way they felt that the sanction of the Minister, whether it was myself or somebody who comes after me right down to the end of the century or longer, gave him some great power because he was being asked to sanction polling stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must sanction all polling schemes.  We might stop for a minute to consider that, to appreciate that arrangements are drawn up by responsible local officers and are then submitted in the normal way for sanction.  I do not know if Deputy Burke dislikes me or if he will dislike my successor whoever that may be, but I cannot understand why he thinks this power should not be given to a Minister.  This type of rather silly comment spoils a debate of this kind. <Col N="2287" /> We are debating a perfectly simple, functional section of a Bill which is an exact replica of previous sections.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham suggested there was a change but he did not know what was the change.  There is not a change, the section has been handed down from year to year. Although the impression is given by the Opposition that only they are entitled to object to sections of a Bill if they think something is wrong, I would remind them that the Cabinet must agree on any Bill that comes before the House.  On a number of occasions different Fianna Fáil Cabinets agreed on those sections of the Bill.  They found nothing wrong with them.  But now Deputies Cunningham, Molloy and Burke find a lot wrong with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>One can improve things with time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing that is wrong with them now is that the Deputy is looking at them from a different angle; instead of looking at them across the Cabinet table he is looking at them across the floor of the House.  That is the only difference.  This section is a simple, functional section of a Bill.  It has been put in to do a job, a job that has been done well during the years. Whether we agree or disagree with the way constituencies are laid out, we must admit that the people who carry out instructions under Article 3 (a) of the Electoral Polling Scheme Regulations, 1964 have done an excellent job and this will apply also to section 7 of this Bill.  That being so, is there any reason Deputy Molloy can advance that would suggest that the amendment should be accepted? On more than one occasion I have admitted it would do no good to the Bill, would do no harm if accepted, but would simply add words that are unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, we have had a number of examples of what could happen with regard to the new electoral areas which, I suggest, are not proper to this section but have been flogged fairly well by some people.  We had the <Col N="2288" /> ridiculous suggestion of a house being divided in two.  I have heard of a house divided against itself but it is the first time I have heard of a house being divided into two constituencies. Suggestions like this do not contribute towards teasing out matters affected by this Bill.  I pointed out that when the arrangements were made under the last Electoral Bill numerous areas were split up in two or three ways.  The people responsible found no difficulty whatever in bringing the new districts into their proper constituencies and having the voting carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan asked a sensible question which puzzled some people. He wanted to know how people were voting outside their own constituencies. The reason is because it was the most convenient place to have the voting carried out.  This happens throughout the country but not very often.  It shows the intelligence of the people who make the regulations.  It is not simply a question of a country secretary, a county manager or a city manager making the arrangements himself.</P>

It will do no harm but it will do no good, and I do not believe in simply accepting an amendment for the purpose of having words added to a Bill which are not necessary. Deputy Molloy, who should have enough experience of these things, should be satisfied to accept that there is no point in trying to put something in the Bill just to have a few words changed.  He has made his point.  I have considered it very fully. I am satisfied that there is no merit in the proposal.  Therefore I would ask him to withdraw this amendment and so enable us to continue with the discussion on the Bill.</P>
      <P>What we are discussing here is important but it is very well dealt with and has been well dealt with for many years.  Not only is it considered that the words used are the proper words, but long practice has proved that such is the case.  If there were a danger, or if there were even a hint, that in any way something could happen which would interfere with the operation of the regulations as laid down, I could understand Deputy Molloy's amendment; but to propose an amendment which it is quite clear cannot improve the section simply for the purpose of adding words to the Bill is, I suggest, a waste of effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies were not quite sure of what Deputy Molloy was trying to amend because they referred to subsections of the section which would not be affected by the amendment and they attempted to make a case for those subsections.  It is quite clear in my mind that the regulations which are made and which operate to govern the setting up of polling stations and which are carried out by people who must <Col N="2292" /> do so&mdash;not may do so&mdash;are quite sufficient to ensure that nothing will go wrong.  Therefore I am surprised that the amendment is being pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party.  They must realise that it does not hold water.</P>
    <P>If we wanted to deal with this in any other way, or if there were a suggestion that it spelled out something else to prevent an abuse, a known abuse, it would be easier to understand, but the section which is being discussed by the House and which Deputy Molloy is trying to amend has shown absolutely no cracks.  It has worked so well that nobody has ever suggested it needed to be amended until now.  I am perfectly satisfied from my own knowledge of it, and from the advice which I got, that it does not need an amendment.  I do not know how widely the Official Report is read.  I would be worried that people who read the report of the discussion earlier on would get the impression that there was something wrong and that this left it wide open for certain politicians to do certain things which would interfere with the right of voters to vote the way they want to.</P>
    <P>I am sure from discussions I have had with ordinary people throughout the country that they all understand the way this works.  They understand how it works and they understand why, as Deputy Callanan said, on occasion it is necessary to move a booth outside a constituency boundary. This does not interfere with the voters' right to vote for the candidate in their own constituency.  That being so, it amazes me that a case is being made to have it changed.  It does not seem to me that the people who have been making the case really understand how the section works.  That is rather a pity.  If they talked to the man-in-the-street&mdash;the people Deputy Burke talked about who might be a bit confused&mdash;they would soon get an explanation because the Irish electorate are very intelligent people and it is amazing how well they understand even more intricate arrangements than the arrangement in this section.  The only way they could be confused would be by putting something else in here for the purpose of <Col N="2293" /> confusing the issue.  We should leave it as it is.  It appears to me that this is the right way to deal with it and I see no reason to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has advanced his reasons for not accepting this amendment.  I am surprised at his approach.  He says this is something which was presented to the House on previous occasions by his predecessors in Local Government. Deputy Molloy during his period in office did not have an opportunity of introducing a measure like that now before the House.  Had he had such an opportunity he would, I am sure, have looked at such a Bill with new eyes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;with new eyes&rdquo;.  I am disappointed the Minister did not look at the Bill in a new way.  It is no argument against the proposed amendment to say this has been done in previous Acts.  The purpose of an amendment is to improve legislation introduced here. This amendment is a simple one.  The Minister referred to the man-in-the-street. The man-in-the-street has difficulty very often in understanding legislation passed here.  At times I myself have had difficulty in understanding certain sections of it.  Our aim should be to legislate as simply as possible and, if an amendment tabled by the Opposition is a valid amendment or one that makes the Bill easy to understand, then the Minister should accept it.  Non-acceptance should not be due to the fact that the amendment was tabled by an Opposition Deputy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy's amendment is eminently sensible.  I cannot understand why the Minister should ask Deputy Molloy to withdraw it.  He should be complimenting him.  The amendment will make the particular section more explicit.  Many polling districts will cross boundaries.  I am sure there are many such districts in the Minister's own constituency.  Parts of these will be combined or amalgamated and that will cause confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2294" /> I do not agree with the Minister that the man-in-the-street will find this easy to comprehend.  He will not have time to read the debate here or even the Press reports of the proceedings here.  Many will not know until immediately before polling day that their polling booth is in a different area from that in which they voted on the last occasion.  The amendment would help to correct that situation.</P>

He ought, therefore, to be big enough to accept it and let us get on with the business.  In the situation adumbrated in the Bill as it stands one could argue that a person had as much right to vote for a candidate in his constituency as he has in a polling booth which is not in his constituency.  This may sound specious.</P>

Deputy Molloy desires to have this legislation absolutely watertight.  Therefore, he, as the past Minister, and the present Minister could well agree on this so that we might make progress. When the Bill is finally enacted, the Minister can then be quite satisfied that, because of Deputy Molloy's ability to detect a weakness in the Bill and the Minister's gallantry in accepting his proposal.  We will have a really good Bill.  Then the Minister can say: &ldquo;If you want a monument look around you.&rdquo;  This Bill would be here as a monument to his tolerance in facilitating Deputy Molloy.  I would sincerely appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment and to pass on to the next section.</P>

However, the Minister relies on the fact that the wording of this Bill is similar to that of a previous one.  He relies on the <Col N="2297" /> fact that the information obtained from his advisers is superior to that of Members of the House.

Perhaps with a little prompting the Minister may see some sense in the amendment and agree to its insertion as suggested by Deputy Molloy.  I would ask the Minister to give his views.  In view of the fact that the amendment would not disimprove the Bill, will the Minister now accept the advice of the largest party in the House and accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Molloy?</P>

      <P>I have listened to the debate this evening and to the Minister's interjection that he did not see Deputy Molloy's amendment as being either a benefit or a hindrance.  I am satisfied that this is merely a question of adding certain words.  I suggest to the Minister that in the quietness of his office over the next weekend before we continue the discussion of this amendment he should seriously look at the amendment presented by Deputy Molloy.  I think that if the <Col N="2301" /> Minister looks seriously and objectively at the amendment, as he is expected to do as Minister for Local Government, not alone will he accept it but he is likely to come in here with a further amendment of his own, amending the amendment by saying &ldquo;within each such specified constituency&rdquo;. The Minister is endeavouring to compare this section of the Bill with a similar section in the 1969 Bill, but the circumstances in this instance are very different.</P>
      <P>Many constituencies in the Dublin area have changed.  In the section we visualise the type of situation outlined by the Minister earlier where a certain part of a polling district becomes separated from the main part or becomes split or even divided in three parts with sections going into other constituencies.  We are visualising a situation in which a fairly large part of an existing polling district remains in its original constituency and another part moves into a new constituency for which subparagraphs (a) and (b) make provision.  In the Dublin area there are polling districts that finish up in three new constituencies, no polling district remaining in its old-named constituency, because the name of Dublin constituencies are being changed.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I fully subscribe to the amendment which Deputy Molloy has submitted.  If the Minister examines this carefully, with the benefit of advice from his officials, he will see a great deal of sense in the amendment, and he may even frame an amendment of his own so that he can claim credit for the idea.  The explanatory memorandum says in relation to sections 6 and 7:</P>
      <P>Sections 6 and 7 contain the usual consequential measures for rearrangement of headings of the register of electors and for alteration of polling schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 itself makes no reference to a scheme but what is contained in the explanatory memorandum in this regard is a fair interpretation of what section 7 is all about, so that the section itself taken <i>en bloc</i> from the <Col N="2302" /> 1969 legislation does not stand.  The explanatory memorandum says very much the same as the Minister has said in relation to these two sections.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot make sense out of the amendment unless we take the section.  The Minister has explained that the brains of the Government have looked at this and has implied that we have not enough brains over here to make suggestions that would improve on it.  What he is really saying is: &ldquo;We never seriously looked at those two sections.  We took them out of the previous Bill and assumed that that was the situation. You are very bold boys and you cast a reflection on your colleagues or former comrades by even querying it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is the easiest thing in the world to rile the Minister for Local Government. That is why I deliberately waited until this very late time on Wednesday night, a short time before we finish, so that this would be the parting thought for the Minister and that he would look objectively at this matter.  He sees it as being no great change from what he has provided except the addition of words.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach gives the impression that if these three words were added to this Bill it would cost £1,000 a minute until such time as the Government is changed, which will not be too long.  Maybe it is understandable that the Minister does not accept the amendment because he does not want to give credit to the Opposition for bringing in a change which appears to be simple but in which there is a tremendous amount of common sense.  I hold that this amendment is absolutely necessary in relation to section 1.</P>
