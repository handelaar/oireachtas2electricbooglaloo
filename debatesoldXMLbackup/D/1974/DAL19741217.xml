    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the precise proposals he put before the recent European Community summit meeting in Paris; and the outcome of the consideration of these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting was preceded by extensive preparatory work on a wide range of subjects, culminating in reports on various European issues and problems submitted to the meeting by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the member states of the Community.  These reports contained proposals for consideration at the meeting, reflecting the degree of agreement reached, on a confidential basis, at the Ministers' discussions.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to announce the proposals or suggestions I made at the meeting.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the meeting is fully set out in the communiqué which I have laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we did not have an adequate opportunity of dealing with this matter I have been compelled to raise it by way of question.  May I ask the Taoiseach why he did not in the first instance make a full statement to this House on the summit meeting as the British Prime Minister did in the British House of Commons so that this House would have a full opportunity <Col N="2014" /> of considering it and debating it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important question in view of the important issues discussed.  Since there is no response to that question, is the Taoiseach satisfied with the outcome of the summit particularly in relation to the proposals for the establishment of a regional fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is that every country was anxious to get as big a regional fund as possible. The Deputy will appreciate that this matter has been the subject of lengthy discussions at meetings, not merely recently but going back over some years, and this is the first time a firm decision has been taken to establish a regional fund.  It is on an experimental basis for three years and, to the extent that the economic circumstances of Europe have changed dramatically for the worst since discussions were originally initiated, and, indeed, since the matter was discussed during the past 12 months, I think it is a satisfactory outcome that a fund has been established and that special recognition was taken in the establishment of the fund of the particular position of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, so far as Ireland is concerned, the Irish allocation would be totally unacceptable, does the Taoiseach not think he should have followed the example of the Danish Government and the Government of the United Kingdom and made a separate statement of our position in the communiqué to the effect that we did not consider the regional fund as established as adequate to achieve the aims of the Community itself and, in particular, that we did not consider the amount allocated to Ireland from the fund sufficient to meet our needs? As I say, the two governments I mentioned did take the opportunity of expressing their views on matters they did not find acceptable.  Do I take it from the fact that our Government <Col N="2015" /> expressed no such qualification they found this regional fund proposal entirely acceptable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that, but giving one's opinion will not increase the size of the fund.  The expression of the Danish and the British opinion did not get either any more.  The reality is that the fund was created on the basis of the agreement of the nine member states. Without that agreement there would be no fund.  I am more interested in the money that will be in the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of our oft stated position, does the Taoiseach not think it was desirable to include a statement to that effect in the communiqué so that our position would be clearly understood, as clearly understood as that of the British and Danish governments in regard to other matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position was made quite clear and the reality is that in the communiqué there is a special reference to the fact that all the member states, with the exception of Italy, accepted a percentage reduction in their allocations in order to give this country 6,000,000 units of account extra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Chair will recognise that this is a very important question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>I have given the Deputy a great deal of latitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a preface to my question.  I had to put this question down in advance of the communiqué to ensure it would be discussed. Does the Taoiseach agree with the views expressed by the British Prime Minister yesterday that nobody at the summit had a realistic expectation that monetary union would be realised before 1980 and does that explain why the Taoiseach and his colleagues did not, in fact, adopt a meaningful regional fund which was always seen as one of the first steps towards the reality of monetary union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2016" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time the fund has been established. It will be there as and from 1st January next.  That is the reality.  The comments of anybody else must be taken into account in relation to circumstances.  I am dealing with the reality of the fund in relation to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach express any view at the summit which would entitle the British Prime Minister to take it as being our Government's view that realisation of economic and monetary union by 1980 was not now possible because the Prime Minister of Britain has been so quoted in the detailed statement he made in Westminster yesterday?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

      <P>The consumer price index rose by 20.0 per cent between mid-November, 1973, and mid-November, 1974, and by 35.2 per cent between mid-November, 1972, and mid-November, 1974.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the present consumer price index figure: and if he will make a statement on how it is calculated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer price index with base mid-November, 1968, as 100 was 188.2 at mid-November, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The index calculations are based on the principle of pricing fixed, i.e. unchanged, quantities of consumer goods and services each quarter.  The quarterly change in the total cost of these articles gives the corresponding change in the overall level of retail <Col N="2017" /> prices.  Representative varieties and sizes are priced for a fixed selection of 343 articles in a fixed national sample of retail outlets each quarter and approximately 30,000 individual price quotations are received on each occasion in respect of some 2,500 retail outlets.  The correctness of the relative price change required for the index calculations is ensured by the fact that individual price collectors price the identical articles in the same shops in successive quarters.</P>
    <P>A full description of all technical aspects of the calculation of the consumer price index is given in a detailed article published in the March, 1969, issue of the <i>Irish Statistical Bulletin,</i> pages 27-33.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>Yes.  As the Deputy knows, it was really a producer subsidy previously.  When we entered the EEC it became a consumer subsidy.

      <P>As I indicated in my address to the General Council of Committees of Agriculture on 2nd December, I am keeping the operation of EEC Directive 159 of 1972 under close review and if it proves to be necessary I may ask the Council of Ministers to have the effects of the directive examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that certain indications are appearing.  I think he will agree that I could not possibly go to the Council of Ministers and make a case for a scheme which has not really been operated.  If we were to make a convincing case in the EEC, we would have to operate this scheme for a period of 12 months at least.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said.  I hold that the farmers he is concerned about are getting grants at least as good as they got before, and in some cases better. The fact that the majority of them will not be classified as development farmers is unfortunate and we are looking at the reasons and the causes for this and at the possibility of having a second comparable income for the western areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the problem, which has yet to be resolved, relating to trade on the home market in New York dressed poultry, including turkeys, which is prohibited as from 1976 by the Poultry Health Directive of 1971, I consider that the <Col N="2033" /> EEC requirements present no insuperable barriers to the future development of our turkey and poultry industry.  However, at this stage, I do not envisage any more optimistic prospects for future developments and expansion than those set out in the White Paper published by the Government in January, 1972, which related, <i>inter alia,</i> to the economic effects on our poultry and eggs industry of accession to the Community. Factors at present governing trends for the future are the general worldwide increases in cost of poultry feeding stuffs with consequential rises in production costs for our industry, the competition on the home market to poultry meat from beef and, also, the depressed state of the industry in other EEC member states, especially in the poultry meat sector which affects our export trade.</P>
      <P>To surmount present difficulties and to ensure the future buoyancy and development of our industry in the conditions of keener competition envisaged in intra-Community trade, it is essential that the highest level of efficiency should be exercised by everyone engaged in all sectors of the poultry and eggs industry including the production, processing and marketing spheres.</P>

I ndeireadh an chruinnuithe sin bhí an chomharchumann sásta, bhí Gaeltarra sásta agus bhí mise sásta leis na socraithe a bhí déanta.  Seachtain ina dhiaidh sin tháinig dream eile ón oileán go dtí m'oifig i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Chas mé leo agus dúradar liom gur ionadaithe a bhí iontu ón choiste nua agus nach raibh údarás ag an gcomharchumann ceist na bádsheirbhíse a phlé.  Ina dhiaidh sin ní raibh le déanamh agamsa ós rud é go raibh easaontas eatarru ach treoir a thabhairt do Ghaeltarra Éireann gach iarracht a dhéanamh chun an dá dhream a thabhairt le chéile.  Tá idirbheartaíocht ar siúl faoi láthair agus ón scéal is deireanaí a chuala mé tá dóchas againn go bhfuil an scéal á chur dhá réiteach anois.</P>

In relation to the first Bill, when the matter was ready for debate last week we were informed that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was abroad.  We were very pleased that the Minister was honoured by the Ghanaian Government with an honorary degree but, nevertheless, it was suggested to us this morning that the Bill must be taken and concluded today.  This Bill envisages not only capital but current expenditure on the part of the RTE authority.  Fortunately, a reasonable solution has been found to this problem.</P>
      <P>Last week we were advised that in relation to the Bill relating to trade union amalgamation it was absolutely essential that it be passed before the Dáil recessed.  We were told that it was not possible to take it last week because the Minister for Labour was engaged at a function in a Dublin hotel.  It was ordered for this week but now we are told that the Minister is away and, therefore, it will not, and need not, be taken.  I am putting to the Taoiseach that this is no way to run the business of the nation in this Assembly.  From time to time we have made complaints but our patience is beginning to run out.  Tomorrow we will be asked to pass no less than 70 items of Estimates, involving an amount in excess of £300 million.  The Government will have to carry the blame for this when the Press make their comments that in a matter of minutes sums in excess of this amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned we are affording ample opportunity for Deputies to discuss Estimates.

      <P>May I say that the criticism most usually heard from the opposite side with regard to the ordering of business is that the Government are inclined to &ldquo;freewheel&rdquo; at times of a by-election, for instance? Last year when we had the Monaghan <Col N="2062" /> by-election we had very little else but Estimates for three weeks and we came under very heavy criticism for discussing what was then represented as something less important but is now represented as something extremely important.  The conventional view of the discussion of Estimates in this House&mdash;let us not be pious or pompous about this because everyone knows it is so&mdash;has always been that it is &ldquo;freewheeling&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Bill relating to the trade unions was not represented to the Opposition last week as being an item that needed to be passed before Christmas.  I had no idea that the Leader of the Opposition was once again going to raise matters of this kind at 4 p.m.; otherwise I would have made sure that I was speaking with accuracy.  From memory, I did not represent last week to the Opposition Whip that it was necessary to pass that Bill before Christmas.  I hope that the final Stages of the trade union Bill will be taken after Christmas but it is grossly unfair&mdash;I do not mind saying cheap&mdash;of Deputy Lynch to speak about the Minister being at a function in a Dublin hotel.  The function he was alluding to was the presentation of apprenticeship awards; in other words, the Minister for Labour would have been open to serious criticism had he neglected to attend.</P>

      <P>That was the only occasion when the Minister for Labour was absent from this House last week.  Deputies opposite do not want to hear the truth; they should hold their long tongues for a minute. The Minister for Labour was absent only on that occasion last week and I did not represent that it was essential to pass the Bill before the end of the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the Broadcasting Authority Bill is necessary before the end of the session and, after a very amicable conversation with the chief Fianna Fáil Whip and the Finance spokesman last week, we agreed how business for this week would be parcelled out.  It was agreed that the <Col N="2063" /> Broadcasting Bill would be taken today. I know that difficulties have arisen about it since this morning. That was not foreseen last week or if it was I was not told anything about it by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>This whole arrangement reminds me of the situation last July when again an arrangement for finishing the business of the House by the end of the session was freely and fully agreed but was subsequently torpedoed, not by this side.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is that the Opposition must understand that the Government's business since the beginning of this session, so far as Tuesdays and Wednesdays are concerned, has had to be done in roughly 75 per cent of the time which previously was available because the new Standing Orders in regard to Private Members' time cuts roughly a quarter out of Tuesdays and Wednesdays. That is a very serious inroad on Government time and I think we may have to consider sitting longer hours as a standing arrangement, in order to make up for that.  The Government have appropriated no Private Members' time this session at all.  Not only that, but three full days were conceded, rightly conceded, to a demand, no doubt rightly and honestly made, at the beginning of the session for a debate on confidence in the Government.</P>

      <P>I am entitled, Sir, to say something in reply to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Taoiseach.  First of all, I do not thank the Government at all for allowing Government time at the beginning of this session for a motion of no confidence. No Government ever refused such time and the Parliamentary Secretary need claim no credit for that. Secondly, he need claim no credit for the fact that it was only on our insistence that an imposition of almost £30 million by way of taxation, imposed in a manner that was never envisaged by the Oireachtas, was debated only for one day, an imposition that the Government should be ashamed of introducing in the manner they did. I want to say that it was represented to me by the Fianna Fáil Whip that Deputy Kelly, the Government Chief Whip, asked for the passing of the Trade Union Bill before this session terminated and similarly with the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill.  To suggest now that he never asked that those Bills be passed before the end of this session is not correct and, from my information, is totally untrue.  I would ask you, Sir, for one minute to hear Deputy Lalor on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in my room and I heard over the loudspeaker the Parliamentary <Col N="2065" /> Secretary to the Taoiseach saying that the Opposition did not want to hear the truth.  In my rush downstairs I may have missed out on what the Parliamentary Secretary said after that but I want to say that the Parliamentary Secretary indicated to me last week that he must have the Trade Union Bill before the end of this session.  Subsequently, I found myself having to go to the Party Leader on, I think, Wednesday evening last saying that it had been ordered for that day but it was withdrawn because the Minister for Labour chose instead to go to some presentation of certificates and it would have to be taken on Friday. Basically I objected to that because we were taking the Industry and Commerce Estimate on Friday.  In addition to that, I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say that it was made clear to me that the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill was a &ldquo;must&rdquo; before the end of this session. We argued this and the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that he was not really able to get clarification from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as to whether that Bill was essential or not.  Eventually, we agreed today to take a portion of the Broadcasting Bill.  I lost out on what was said while I was coming downstairs but I felt it was necessary to give this explanation.</P>

      <P>May I make one request to the Taoiseach?  As I indicated already we will, within about an hour tomorrow, be passing Estimates amounting to some £350 million or £400 million.  The Minister for Finance normally puts those through in a formal manner.  In view of the tremendous number of Estimates and supplementaries that are involved, I would request the Taoiseach that the Ministers involved in each of those separate Estimates be in the House in order to answer questions that may be put, questions that will certainly be short, to each of the Ministers, questions that the Minister for Finance may not be in a position to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly try. In reply to Deputy O'Connell I should say that we have adopted a number of reforms and one of the problems in the present situation is that this year the financial year ends in a couple of weeks' time and the new financial year will begin early in January.  Not merely are we disposing of in nine months what would normally be disposed of in 12 months but we will be meeting again to start the new financial year.  In addition, a number of changes have been made in the procedure, some of which were referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary and some of which have been availed of by Deputies on all sides but particularly, so far as Private Members' Business is concerned, by the Opposition.  To that extent, our present timetable appears to be somewhat overloaded as a result of the accumulation, because of the curtailment of the time involved in the transition from the old financial year to the new one.  In regard to the point made by the Leader of the Opposition, I will endeavour to have Ministers available when their Estimates are being considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which we were discussing this measure I referred to the general cost of hospital and health services.  We were told that this Bill has been brought in for the purpose of increasing the contribution in order to combat inflation.  I endorse the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, in regard to the sloppiness in the presentation or, rather, lack of presentation, of this measure.  If the purpose is to combat inflation then we will have further amending legislation bringing in further increases.  The Minister said he was going to examine the whole financial structure of the health services.  He should, of course, carry out the examination first to see what changes are necessary and then bring in whatever amending legislation may be necessary.  Here, he is putting the cart before the horse; he is amending first of all and promises the examination following on the legislation. Less time would be wasted if we were to have the examination first and then the legislation.  Mounting costs of illness are a contributory factor in prolonging illness.  They certainly do not help to heal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> Health services have improved tremendously but they will not go on improving unless we accept certain basic needs and requirements.  I mentioned before the case of an old lady living alone in this city who has to wait until next March for a cataract operation.  She is the holder of a medical card.  She will have to spend the next few months worrying about whether the operation will be a success. Though the services have improved we must not be complacent about them. This old lady is just one case.  I am sure all Deputies and the Minister know of other cases.</P>
    <P>We need a comprehensive review of our health services.  Most of the money now goes on hospital services, specialist services, maternity and drugs and very little is left for the general health services.  I cannot understand how anyone can talk about a free-for-all health service or worry about top socio-economic groups which can look after themselves when we are unable to provide a bed for the old lady to whom I referred.  Before we start talking about a free-for-all health service, which would include the affluent sector of our society, we should get down to examining our services to make sure that the weaker sections are given every possible help.</P>
    <P>Being in public life enables one to agitate for the removal of gross injustices. People will willingly pay for a good health service.  I do not anticipate that costs will decrease or that inflation will disappear, but the person who is sick and awaiting treatment is not an economist or a financier; he does not understand inflation.  Very few people do understand it.  He does understand that he has a serious illness and needs hospitalisation, but no hospital will take him because there are not enough beds.</P>
    <P>We have built new hospitals but we failed to estimate accurately the demand.  There must be an examination to ensure that those who really need our medical services get those services. We must also ensure that the services are administered without waste.  When women come to me looking for a house or something else they often produce from their handbags several bottles of tablets which, they say, the doctor has <Col N="2070" /> given them for their nerves.  These nerves are caused by the conditions in which they are living.  I often wonder is there no other way in which people could be treated.</P>
    <P>We should have more social workers who could talk to women especially and try to relieve the mental strain of the domestic scene on women with families.  Nowadays we are all inclined to look to the magic tablet to cure our ills, but we should look at medicine on a much broader basis.  If we had more social workers to help mothers of families to overcome the strains of modern day living this would pay a dividend in reducing the frightful cost of drugs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us how much the Exchequer is contributing to these services.  He said that the cost falls back on the Exchequer.  The Exchequer depends on the taxpayer. There are sections of our society, widows and others with over £1,600 a year, who get very little help from the State services.  I am sure this will engage the attention of the Minister when he is carrying out the promised review of the financial structure of our health services.</P>
    <P>I want to see an all-embracing health service, but it must be a graded service.  Those most in need of help must get most help.  If we tackle it in that way, we will remove the gross injustices from the health services. Over the years it has been the ambition of successive Ministers for Health to improve the health services, but we are racing against time.  There are many people who, because of their ailments and because they cannot get proper treatment, as in the case of the old lady I mentioned, may have to endure many weeks and months of suffering.  Who knows but that in some cases irreparable damage may be done to some organ of the body during that period of waiting.  I am sure most Deputies have had people come to them to say: &ldquo;I want to go into such-and-such a hospital.  Can you get me in?&rdquo;  You tackle the job with rather mixed feelings.  You know in your heart and soul that, if you are successful in getting a person admitted, somebody else on the waiting <Col N="2071" /> list who has nobody to speak for him will be put back.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the hospitals for their concern that they should admit every patient referred to them.  They just cannot do that. I serve on a voluntary hospital board and I know the gross overcrowding in some hospitals.  St. Vincent's hospital is a magnificent new hospital only two miles from here.  It was finished a few years ago.  We were all proud of it.  Now we are told that because of overcrowding some patients are being referred to the old military hospital at Leopardstown. That is no reflection on the Leopardstown hospital.  Surely it shows that we went wrong somewhere.  When this new hospital was being built it was not made big enough.  It has extensive grounds.  Now we have to use a hospital which was built some time before the first world war.  Indeed, casualties from that war may have been treated there.</P>
    <P>This makes one a bit uneasy about the progress we are making.  Progress is being made and there have been improvements in the service, but when one sees such a basic mistake in the planning of the hospital I mentioned, one realises that somebody must have underestimated the demand that would be made on it.  It may be a tribute to the hospital that so many people want to go there.  I can testify that it is a fine hospital.  The situation may be the same all over the country but there is an incentive to people to come to the city where they feel the best service is available.</P>
    <P>We are preparing to close six hospitals in the city.  We are preparing to close most of the federated hospitals. Sir Patrick Dun's, on which I serve, is down for demolition.  It gives a great service to people from around the dock areas mostly and indeed, from all parts of the country.  We may well have to look at the report which sets out what hospitals we should build and what hospitals we should get rid of, and revise our whole thinking on it.  It would be rather ironical to see one of the federated hospitals closed down while another hospital has to <Col N="2072" /> send patients to a non-teaching hospital for treatment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is a cliché to say we should be striving to keep people out of hospital.  I am sure we should be using preventive medicine much more than we are using it.  This is the solution suggested by the experts.  The general hospitals could well take an example from the maternity hospitals who have mobile units going around the city.  The standard of housing has improved so much that the vast majority of houses in the urban areas have hot and cold running water. Mobile teams could move out from the big hospitals in the city and perform small operations in the patient's home.  The maternity hospitals have been doing this for many years.  In that way we would reduce the cost of hospitalisation without lowering the standard of attention given to the patients.</P>
    <P>Unless we can check costs we may well see the day when people will not be able to afford whatever they are asked to pay.  In our neighbouring island at one time they had a free-for-all service but they had to introduce certain charges.  We must look at the whole cost of the hospital services. The Minister should have this examination carried out immediately. I am sure the House will give him every possible help with regard to any legislation which we are sure will improve the health services.</P>
    <P>Because of the excellence of medicines and drugs the scientists have given us the span of life in the next few years will increase and we are going to have a massive problem catering for old people.  It will not be just a matter of putting old people away in some home to wait until their call comes because with improved geriatric services these men and women will want to be part of our society.</P>
    <P>We have to change the outlook on old people's homes.  A few years ago people were glad to see an old person going into a home where he would be fed and cared for but there is a greater awareness now that we owe a lot more to our old people and we are not satisfied to put them away in <Col N="2073" /> homes.  For this reason we have to spend vast sums of money providing proper accommodation and services for these people.  I feel sure that our people would not begrudge paying money for such a service.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is carrying out his examination he should do so on a broad basis and not just think of the teaching hospitals though they must be to the forefront in the fight against disease.  The Minister should also think of the non-teaching hospitals and the homes for old people. We owe it to our old people to give them the best accommodation and services possible.  I marvel at what voluntary bodies in our city are able to do in providing up-to-date homes, with the help of liberal Government grants, for old people.</P>
    <P>On this question of caring for the aged I accept that the Minister has a great problem but, compared with a Minister for Health of 30 years ago, he has greater resources to fight this battle.  The Minister should get his priorities right and stop talking about a free-for-all scheme and about accommodating the top socio-economic group who can generally look after themselves.  People in the middle income and lower paid groups want that little extra.  A scheme based on ensuring the greatest help to the ones in greatest need is one that should be contemplated.  If the Minister introduced such a scheme he would have no regrets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small amendment Bill which will have the effect of increasing the contributions by £3½ million, bringing the figure to £8½ million.  This figure represents about 10 per cent of the total cost of financing the health service.  The figure of £3½ million is a sizeable one but, when spread over the people who are contributing or who will contribute to the health service, it represents something like the price of a packet of cigarettes in the week or the price of a bottle of lemonade.  This is a very small imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is necessary and Members should support it.  In relation to eligibility I feel that the ceiling should be raised substantially.  When this <Col N="2074" /> scheme was introduced the income limit was something like £15 per week and this has since been raised to £20 per week.  In these inflationary days it should be raised to about £30 per week.  As a result the free health service would become available to those in most need.  In another area of the health service an unfortunate yardstick was used.  I am referring to the poor law valuation system where farmers of £60 poor law valuation are entitled to free health service on payment of £7 per year or 15p per week. If a farmer has a valuation of £61 he is excluded.  In my view this is an unfortunate limit.  To use the poor law valuation system as the criteria for any health service is bad.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that the poor law valuation system was introduced in the late 1840s.  The inspectors started their investigations in the southern part of the country and it took them two years to work from the south, through the midlands, to the northern counties.  Unfortunately, in those two years there was a very good flax crop and, as a result, the rateable valuation per acre in the northern counties was grossly in excess of that assessed for the southern counties. This was done in spite of the fact that the land in the southern counties was, and still is, much superior in quality to that in the northern counties. However, the rateable valuation is much less in the south than it is in counties Cavan, Leitrim or Monaghan. Farmers in these counties with small holdings and poor quality land have a much higher valuation than their southern counterparts who have the most fertile land in the country.  The £60 valuation limit is unfortunate and I should like to see it raised to £100.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister making progress in the provision of dental treatment for our people.  In my view the dental service is the poor relation of the health service.  If a child has a toothache that child, even though he is entitled to free dental treatment, must wait until the dentist visits the local hospital.  I would like to see a proper choice of dentist scheme introduced and more time and money devoted to the improvement of this service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2075" /> The most welcome part of the Minister's statement was that signifying his intention to set up a committee to look into the financing of the health service.  There are so many guidelines, so many regulations, that I get the impression that the scheme is being done piecemeal, by patchwork.  I would like to see Members who are also members of health boards represented on this investigation committee. They have a good working knowledge of the administration of the health service.  They could offer some advice and put forward concrete proposals to the committee which I should like to see set up early in the new year.  Further, I should like to see a report forthcoming shortly afterwards and the Minister acting on it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, no matter how much money was spent on health services in a country there would still be room for improvement.  1975 is forecast as a gloomy year in economic terms.  This is particularly unfortunate with regard to the provision of health services.  It is the proper duty of any Government to provide adequate health services and, in this respect, the Minister has a momentous task before him.  At present he is dealing with the structural system of the hospitals. I should like to see him dealing with the day-to-day services.  Despite the limited resources available to him, progress should be made in this field above all or in any other Department.</P>
    <P>This is a small amending Bill.  It merely amends the provision in regard to health contributions introduced in 1971.  After 1974 I feel confident we will see a more equitable system of health contributions ensuring that those who can best afford to pay for them will do so and those most in need will be able to avail of proper health services.</P>
    <P>There are so many areas comprised in the health services.  But I think the Minister should give more direction to the health boards in relation to their day-to-day administration in the various regions.  In this respect, I notice a gap or lack of liaison between the health boards and the Department. <Col N="2076" /> I should like to see greater synchronisation resulting in people in need of medical services having them available when they need them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to apologise in advance for any remarks I may make that may appear to the Chair to be outside the scope of this Bill.  I welcome the opportunity the Bill provides to set on the record of the House some facts concerning the services provided by the Western Health Board and by the Department in Mayo, especially in the Ballina region.  This opportunity was denied us on previous occasions through lack of time for debate on the Health Estimates.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2 of the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill explains the services to which people covered by this Bill are entitled, that is, hospital in-patient and out-patient, maternity and infant care services, and so on.  In the context of the hospital in-patient and out-patient services, I should like to refer to the situation in Ballina District Hospital which has greatly agitated people in the Ballina area and about which there is frustration, anger and considerable concern.  I refer to the fact that the post of medical officer at Ballina Hospital has been filled on a part-time temporary basis only since April 1973, coincidentally, since the Coalition came into office.  At this juncture I should like to pay tribute to the man now carrying out the task involved there.  He accepted that task because of his friendship with the staff of the hospital.  He carries out this task with dedication, energy, selflessness and, of necessity, with complete disregard for his family life.  He carries out the task because of his commitment to the area, at considerable personal inconvenience and, only then, with the help he receives from his brother, who is a doctor also, and from some of the other doctors in the area.  In addition to that task, this man has an extensive and widespread practice.  I do not think that any man should be placed in the position of serving two masters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the present conditions a man so appointed will be placed in that <Col N="2077" /> position.  He will be required to serve the 101 bed hospital and also some 500 patients under the general medical services programme.  This cannot be done.  At some stage in the future that man will be placed in the position of making Hobson's choice.  And, no matter what choice he may make, a life may be at stake because a man cannot be in two places simultaneously. Further, the dedicated, efficient and very courteous matron and staff of that hospital will have to accept any claims or consequences that may arise. A public meeting was held in Ballina attended by approximately 500 people &mdash;many of whom represented organisations and associations&mdash;endorsing the demands that two deputations had made to the Minister already.  They asked for the appointment of a man of consultant status, a man who would have the service and experience of a houseman.  It is estimated that that would cost approximately £5,000 extra annually.  I would put it to the Minister that this is a very small price to pay for proper services and very little compared with the cost of a life.  I would ask the Minister to concede to the wishes of the people in that region and allow the extra salary involved.  I would ask him also to treat this hospital&mdash;the largest district hospital in the country&mdash;as a special case; treat it as a pilot scheme because, in view of industrial expansion, the population of the town is envisaged to increase threefold in the next ten to 15 years and the services for which we ask now will be required at that juncture.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention just a few of the other services referred to by various Deputies and to say that if the Minister could guarantee that the extra money forthcoming when this Bill is passed&mdash;because none of us would be so naive as to say it will not be passed&mdash;would be spent solely for the purpose of enlarging and expanding the existing school services and for inaugurating others, I would have no qualms whatever in regard to it because I am convinced that a proper school service would, in the long term, result in a saving of many millions of pounds.  Prevention is always better <Col N="2078" /> than cure and in this case is a lot less expensive.</P>
    <P>Much more encouragement should be given towards the establishment of mobile dental clinics especially in areas such as the one I represent. An extension of this service would help to eliminate the unfavourable delays that occur in dental services. These delays are due mainly to lack of staff.  The Minister should endeavour, too, to encourage greater participation of private dentists in this scheme.  I am sure the Minister would have their co-operation if he were prepared to offer them better rates of remuneration.  Again, this would result in saving in the long term because experience shows that delayed dental treatment leads later to hospitalisation and it appears that it is on hospitalisation that most of the moneys being provided for the Department are spent.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a considerable expansion also in the home care service, a service that is proving of tremendous value especially in areas such as mine.  The existence of this service is responsible for a considerable number of old and infirm people being kept at home rather than having to be hospitalised.  Consequently, there is a resulting saving to the State because instead of the £20 or £30 per week that it would cost to keep a person in hospital, the cost of this service is only about £2.50 per week.</P>
    <P>A worthwhile innovation would be a system whereby everyone would be compelled to subject himself each year to a thorough medical examination by his family doctor.  In this way we would have a warning system, as it were, in respect of many diseases. Another aspect of this would be that, by preventative measures being taken, the demand for hospital beds would be reduced considerably.  I know that it would not be an easy matter to introduce such a system because while we Irish can be led almost anywhere, we cannot be driven.  At the same time, it might be well worthwhile to try this idea, at least in a pilot area in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly drew attention to the escalating costs of medical services.  Despite this situation, however, <Col N="2079" /> it is saddening to note that the Minister proposes going ahead with his free hospitalisation for all policy. In this way, he would be diverting money that is needed badly for underfinanced services to help those who do not need help and who have not asked for free hospitalisation services. I am talking of the people who can afford to pay their own costs.  There is no guarantee that in the event of the Minister's policy being implemented, there will be a better service for all. The State would even be paying for those 5 per cent that we hear mentioned so often in this House.</P>
    <P>The money proposed to be spent in this way could be spent, for instance, on providing jobs for newly-qualified doctors who, now more than ever, find themselves like pieces of flotsam cast out to seek employment wherever they can find it.  Their skills and expertise are going to help other people in other lands.  It has always seemed ludicrous to me that before a doctor can be registered he must, on completing his six years course, find a job for another year.  This year should be a part of the doctor's education and the onus for finding the job should be either on the colleges or on the Department of Health.  In this way a student's education can continue from the time of his pre-med to the time of registration.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I attended a wedding of two young doctors at which many of the guests were newly-qualified doctors.  I was very saddened to hear from about 80 per cent of those present that they had no option but to go away to seek employment. This situation is due to a number of reasons, not the least of which was the very good agreement which the Minister reached in respect of junior doctors some time ago.  This has meant that a number of those who might otherwise have gone away are now here.  It has meant also that some of those who were away have been able to come back.  However, the Minister might try to persuade the universities to assume the task of finding jobs for these doctors until such time, at least, that they are registered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2080" /> In this context there should be more incentives to doctors to work in what are referred to as isolated regions.  I come from an area in which there is great difficulty in filling some posts. The Western Health Board have had a lot of difficulty in finding people who are prepared to take up the various posts offered.  I am aware that there are factors other than remuneration involved especially where married men are concerned because they will be influenced by such factors as educational facilities and other services. However, if more money were offered for these posts, I am of the opinion that a lot of the posts which are still vacant would have been filled long ago.</P>
    <P>A lot more help could be given by all of us to the many voluntary bodies whose members are doing very dedicated and difficult work.  I include in this the various community centres. Any help given by the State in this area would be repaid many fold.  I take this opportunity of recording my appreciation of the tremendous work being carried on by the various voluntary bodies in County Mayo.  There are far too many to refer to individually but we owe a deep debt to all of them. Every help possible should be given to them.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters that I would like to discuss but time does not allow for that.  Perhaps, though, I might be permitted to refer to a few local matters and to ask the Minister what is the position regarding the psychiatric unit that was to have been attached to Ballina District Hospital. Also, what is the present condition regarding the planning of the group practice building to be built there and the Minister might let me know, too, when it is envisaged that the community home, in respect of which outline planning permission was granted 15 months ago, will be established at Ballina?</P>
    <P>Another matter that has been the cause of some concern and agitation in Mayo for some time is the establishment of a school of nursing at Castlebar hospital.  Some days ago I was approached in connection with a post for a student nurse and I was horrified to hear that 1,400 applications <Col N="2081" /> had been received for the 80 posts available.</P>
    <P>I ask that these matters be looked into and the money made available. Finally, I ask the Minister to heed the cry of the people of Ballina and arrange for a full-time doctor of consultant status with a houseman to provide back-up service.  I should like to thank the Minister for his courtesy and kindness to me personally and to the deputation he met.  He follows a line of very dedicated Ministers and it is a pity that his talents are frustrated and confined by ideological traces.  I wish him well in his task of reformation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One of our wearing responsibilities on the Government side is that we have to attend most debates and I was present last Wednesday when this debate began and through Thursday afternoon and evening when the debate was talked out.  What struck me about that experience was the incredible irrelevance and the abysmally low level of many of the contributions.  This is a relatively simple Bill.  The Government are asking the Dáil for another £3.5 million in addition to the £5 million currently contributed by persons of limited eligibility. It is a Bill that does not warrant the amazing series of irrelevancies&mdash;no disrespect to the Chair&mdash; put forward on all matters of health which had nothing to do with the Bill, and a great deal of the tendentious arguments from local personal experiences of Deputies and the bringing in of what Fianna Fáil have described as ideological nuances in regard to the Bill.  We might be excited if it was ideological but, in fact, this Bill, as we know, is a simple measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present we spend £166 million on health services.  About £120 million represents the cost of hospital and specialist services, the cost of maternity and infant care, drug subsidy schemes and so on.  Of the £120 million, £72 million represents the cost of services for persons of limited eligibility and at the moment they contribute towards that £72 million health contributions of about £5 million.  For Deputy O'Malley to come here and have the sheer effrontery <Col N="2082" /> to attack this measure&mdash;which is not ideological because he is ideological and almost apolitical in his attitude to this Bill&mdash;is totally unjustified. I regard his attitude as no more than adolescent in party political terms.  At present we propose to increase a miserable £5 million in health contributions by a mere 6 or 7 per cent from those of limited eligibility towards the cost of the service they receive.  We propose to increase the current figure by £3½ million to bring it up to £8½ million in a full year. That £8½ million will cover only 10 per cent of the total cost being borne by the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not abolish it entirely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that.  We propose to add to the existing 15p per week a miserable 11p per week.  I submit that not only are the people getting very good value for 15p per week but they are getting extraordinary value.  This 11p goes on to a service which has not been increased in any way from 1971 in terms of cost to the electorate.  Let us put this in its proper perspective; it represents less than a half-pint of stout. Yet, Deputy O'Malley weeps beautiful crocodile tears about how no farmer, large or small, could possibly afford an extra 11p per week and how every industrial worker will have to stay at home every night of the week if he has to find another 11p a week for the health contribution&mdash;the cost of half a dozen fags.</P>
      <P>That is what Fianna Fáil are voting against.  I regard this as hypocrisy. There has been no increase in the health contribution since the Bill was introduced in 1971 by the late, esteemed Deputy Childers at that time.  Fianna Fáil voted for it then and now they are voting against an adjustment of that Bill.  This smacks to me of narrow, stupid, political expediency and if it were not for the effrontery of it I should not have bothered to speak about it because I found the debate incredibly poor and the Fianna Fáil arguments incredibly stupid and narrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley is a very well <Col N="2083" /> briefed Deputy.  As a Minister, his personal attitude could be very pathetic but, by and large, I found him to be on top of his job, exceptionally competent in dealing with the issues in his portfolio, and he exercised great care.  He was very industrious, but I am more interested in the personal policies of people than their abrasive personalities.  As regards his attitude on health matters, I suggest he has become the Mrs. Thatcher of the Fianna Fáil Party.  On health matters, Enoch Powell is to the left of Deputy O'Malley.  This applies with relation to the extension of the health services, who is going to pay for them, to matters of industrial relations and to disputes that have arisen between the Department and the doctors.  For a person so young, one who comes from a family that has made such a distinguished contribution with regard to a national educational system and the introduction of free post-primary education, it is extraordinary that the spokesman for Fianna Fáil on health matters is the most notoriously conservative spokesman on health since the former Minister, Deputy MacEntee and, goodness knows, he was a conservative on such matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is entirely relevant because it has coloured the attitude of Deputy O'Malley to this Bill. I shall quote to the House one example of Deputy O'Malley's opposition to the Bill.  At column 1506 of the Official Report, dated 11th December, the Deputy stated:</P>
      <P>... in his doctrinaire efforts to give the better off people the benefits of limited eligibility he is giving them something which for the most part they do not want and he is proposing to do it, as I pointed out before, at the expense of the less well off who will be shoved further back in the queue, the queue for the limited facilities which are available in our hospitals, hospitals which are grossly overcrowded and unable to cope with those entitled to institutional services at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> Certainly, that is not a progressive statement.  It is the statement of a man in his early 30s, about to get to grips with the serious structural problems of our health services.  Because there are difficulties in the hospital services with regard to facilities, Deputy O'Malley does not think extended limited eligibility should be introduced.  That is negative thinking, it is regressive and introverted and it does not contain any policy.  If there are queues for limited facilities, it is the function of the State to get rid of the queues and this is what the Government are proposing to do.  If there are limited facilities, it is our policy to make the facilities extensive and to abolish any disadvantages that exist.  If our hospitals are overcrowded, it is our intention to make them less crowded and to extend the hospital services.  The multitude of deputations the Tánaiste is meeting and the number of consultative meetings he is attending are a substantial step in that direction.</P>
    <P>We have positive policies on matters like this but Deputy O'Malley merely puts forward the introverted argument because our health services are not entirely what we would wish them to be under no circumstances should we contemplate extending them.  That is the argument of defeatism; from a man so young it is the argument of a rank, <i>status quo</i> conservative.  With regard to the health services, Deputy O'Malley is a raving conservative and I want to pin that on him.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the future role of Deputy O'Malley.  Many prominent Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators have said to me that now that Deputy Haughey is no longer going to be on the front bench Deputy Lynch has long term plans for Deputy O'Malley. All I can say is &ldquo;Carry on, Deputy Lynch&rdquo;.  God forbid that Deputy O'Malley would become Minister for Health&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I refute completely the arguments of Deputy O'Malley as to why we should reject the Bill.  His first argument was that <Col N="2085" /> some of those people currently of limited eligibility should have the GMS services extended.  I have to deal with arguments put forward by Deputy O'Malley and many of them are entirely irrelevant so far as opposition to the Bill is concerned.  Indeed, as the debate developed, it became most irrelevant.</P>
      <P>A further argument put forward by Deputy O'Malley was that it would be impossible to collect the sum of £7 per year from the farmers.  I will quote Deputy O'Malley on this matter when he stated:</P>
      <P>We know the tremendous difficulties experienced by the health boards in trying to collect contributions of £7 a year from farmers and others.  The smaller farmers find it impossible this year to make their payments.</P>
      <P>They find it impossible to pay £7 per year for this service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true. Some of them have not paid it for the last three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If a small farmer finds it impossible to pay £7 a year for limited eligibility, then I submit that possibly his children are suffering from malnutrition and the poor man should be in the local county hospital getting vitamin treatment.  To suggest that people cannot pay £7 a year for limited eligibility contributions is rank hypocrisy and everyone knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I have often discussed matters relating to health.  He knows that 15p per week, or three-quarters of the price of a pint of stout, will not break anyone. Much more money is being spent on cigarettes, as the Deputy well knows.  To suggest as Deputy <Col N="2086" /> O'Malley has done, that the country will be driven into complete impoverishment because of the increase in this case is, to say the least, stretching one's political imagination beyond the bounds of credibility.  The arguments put forward by Deputy O'Malley are so stupid and ridiculous that one must assume that Deputy O'Malley and Fianna Fáil are the counterparts of Mrs. Thatcher and the Tory Party in England.  Indeed, for all his conservatism, Sir Keith Joseph would not dare to put forward the line of argument of Deputy O'Malley.</P>
      <P>Another argument put forward was that it would not be possible to collect the money.  I know there are serious difficulties in the health boards collecting £7 per year from many people who are self-employed or who are farmers.  I know, for example, that I, as an insured person, and there are probably only about a half dozen in the House, am very pleased that my family will have available to them limited eligibility for hospital and specialist services, maternity and infant care services, drug subsidy schemes.  I am quite pleased to be paying 26p per week.  I would not get that cover from any insurance company in the country.  I am grateful to have it.  Fianna Fáil know perfectly well that that is the position.</P>
      <P>There are some people who will pay nothing if they can get away with it.  If they could avoid paying £7 a year they would do so even though they could well afford it.  Any CEO or programme manager of a health board will tell you he has to send hundreds and thousands of letters to people in his area pointing out that they can well afford to pay £7 a year. They are not prepared to pay it because they are too mean to pay for the health services.  In many cases this £7 is about the only thing they are asked to pay for, between subsidies for this, doles for that and the devil knows what.  The £7 is not an undue imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very special pleading of Deputy O'Malley is entirely dishonest and tragic coming from an intelligent politician who should be giving a lead <Col N="2087" /> and trying to develop a more comprehensive health system.  In the past decade we have witnessed the development of a very important trend in our social services, that is the shift away from very rigid, narrow selectivity or the provision purely of a means tested health service.  I would remind the Fianna Fáil Party of Dr. Jim Ryan who was a good Minister for Health in his own way, though not terribly imaginative.  In 1947 when he introduced the Mother and Child Bill in the Dáil he said it was proposed to make available to everyone in the country, if they wished to avail of it, a free service for mothers and children up to the age of 16 years.  That is the simple answer to Deputy O'Malley. What we propose is to extend free hospitalisation to the whole of the population, if they wish to avail of it. If they want their private nursing homes, if they want to go into, say, St. Michael's Hospital in my constituency and pay £10 a day for a private room before any additional charges are added and if they have the money to pay for it, the best of Irish luck to them.  If they want to spend their money on having privacy and exclusion, private doctors and private consultants, that is their privilege but, and this is a socialist &ldquo;but&rdquo;, that will not give them any special privileged exemption from making a contribution towards the cost of free hospitalisation for the whole community. We say all must contribute, irrespective of means, irrespective of income, to a national minimum health service standard.  If they want their exclusive consultants and private rooms let them have them but they pay for them themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley wants to do it the other way.  His proposition is the old poor law proposition, the proposition of a former Minister, Seán McEntee &mdash;you look for the poor, you find the poor, you give charity to the poor, you raise up the poor tier by tier. Witness, for example, the statement of Deputy O'Malley that we should extend the general medical services to a proportion of those on limited eligibility. Of course, this will allow <Col N="2088" /> Deputy O'Malley to allow the cream to remain as the cream making its own contribution to itself and making no contribution to the State.  The policy of this Government will cost vastly less to implement than an extension of GMS which Deputy O'Malley is proposing without any reference to the cost involved or to who is going to pay for it.  Indeed it would be useful if some further research were done, in the light of present costs in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley within a fortnight of his appointment as spokesman on health dived in in relation to the junior doctors' dispute.  He dived in in relation to free hospitalisation and he swallowed a lot of spurious propaganda from very select medical circles and he cannot now get out of it.  The only answer he has is that we are being doctrinaire.  At times I wish we were doctrinaire.  Ironically, I think we may be somewhat social democratic.  We are certainly not terribly doctrinaire.  One should hear, as Deputy Hussey has heard at the Council of Europe when he and I have been in Strasbourg, some of the doctrinaire statements on health and then one is listening to a little bit of continental socialism which, if it were to be uttered by Deputies in this House, might mean they would not even be re-elected.</P>
    <P>It ill becomes Deputy O'Malley, on a matter which is not of major importance, to put forward views which are so special in their pleading, so narrow and introverted in their rationalisation.  Here we have a party which professes to be a universal party, catering for all groups, classes and creeds in our community, a people's party, a social democratic party.  They say: &ldquo;Let us take another segment of the poor and give them general medical services&rdquo;.  If we build it up on that basis and extend it on such a narrow basis we will find ourselves with the same patchwork quilt of health services which was the legacy of Fianna Fáil in the fifties and the sixties.</P>
    <P>We want to change that and we will change it.  Deputy O'Malley in his <Col N="2089" /> opposition to this measure is guilty of rank, juvenile conservatism. Usually well briefed, it was a matter for regret to find him coming in here advocating the <i>status quo.</i>  We are spending £72 million a year and a mere £5 million of that will represent health contributions which works out at a mere 6 or 7 per cent.  In 1975 we propose that this should be a mere 10 per cent.  I would appeal to Deputy O'Malley to read the statement made by the late Mr. Erskine Childers when he was Minister for Health and also the statements of the late Donagh O'Malley when he was Minister for Education.  Deputy Desmond O'Malley takes a completely different view, a view not held by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Childers.</P>

      <P>Some speakers may possibly have thought that we were discussing the Health Estimate.  I do not dispute their right to cover a wide range of health services or to make general comments but I shall confine my remarks to the proposals contained in this Bill.  I do not think any of us will ever become complacent about our health services.  I understand the concern about improving health services and I think I covered most of the matters raised here on the Estimate which started on 28th November. All the indications are that our health services are being improved.  I shall not attempt to answer all the various points raised in regard to local or individual matters but I assure Deputies that, as far as possible, specific matters will be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley's speech was, of course, predictable.  He should not be the one to talk about repudiating a leader because there were about four or five in the Fianna Fáil Party in May, 1970, who openly repudiated their now leader.  I do not know what game Deputy O'Malley is at.  He is very fond of quoting Deputy John O'Connell.  I have a greater appreciation of what Deputy John O'Connell said in this debate than I have of what Deputy O'Malley said.</P>
      <P>As I said, his reaction was predictable. He gave no good reasons as to why the Bill should be opposed.  He interspersed his speech with such phrases as &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo; and &ldquo;patronage socialism&rdquo;.  He criticised the fact that this Bill was introduced prior to the budget.  When the original Bill was introduced it was introduced in June, 1971, and passed and that was only a few weeks after the Fianna Fáil budget of that particular year.  I do not think there are any points to be scored by that sort of criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will commence on 1st January.  I want now to refer in more specific terms to something Deputy Desmond said.  As far as Fianna Fáil were concerned, the original Bill was meant to be a permanent Bill.  That Bill was introduced in 1971 by Deputy Erskine Childers, Minister for <Col N="2091" /> Health.  He made it abundantly clear at that time that this would be a permanent feature for the future financing of the health services.  Contrary to what Deputy O'Malley has said and contrary to the amendments he has tabled, the late Minister for Health specifically said that these contributions would not remain static, that they were bound to increase.  Deputy O'Malley will find confirmation of that at column 334 of Volume 255 of the Official Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Circumstances change from year to year.  The Deputy cannot get away from the policy, if it is still the policy, of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The late ex-Minister for Health said that these contributions would not remain static and were bound to increase.  This Bill increases the rates established in 1971, after a period of three years.  Deputies are well aware of and appreciate the fact that all other costs have risen, particularly in the health services, during that time.</P>
      <P>I should like to give again the increases that have occurred in the past two or three years.  In 1971-72, the health services were costed at £86 million.  By 1974, they were £166 million, an increase of £80 million or a 93 per cent increase.  It is only reasonable to expect that the health contributions would also increase. The health contributions are only one element in the method of financing the health services.  It is one I inherited from the previous Government and to which I presume the Fianna Fáil Party still subscribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another factor which should be taken into consideration in regard to the type of person mentioned in this Bill.  During the period <Col N="2092" /> 1971-72 to 1974 the cost of the limited eligibility services increased by over 90 per cent.  If there is hypocrisy&mdash;the word used by the Deputy many times during his speech&mdash;it is on Deputy O'Malley's side.  He is now condemning a system of financing introduced by my predecessor and which Fianna Fáil said they would continue as a method of financing the services.  He made another accusation.  He called the introduction of this measure a subterfuge.  I do not know exactly what he meant by that.  This proposal is open and above board in that, although the Deputy called it another taxation Bill, it will give more money to the health services.  It is directed at the health services alone.  I do not think anybody would be justified in describing it as another taxation Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not enamoured of the present system and neither is Deputy O'Connell.  I propose to carry on that system as Minister for Health until I see whether we can find other methods of financing the health services.  There were criticisms and sneers&mdash;I think by Deputy R.P. Burke&mdash;to the effect that when the Government found themselves in trouble they established a review body.  I do not see anything wrong in that.  I do not pretend to be an economist or to be the custodian of all things appertaining to the financing of the health services.  As I said in my opening speech, I propose to establish a review body which, in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare will see how best these two services can be financed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell suggested that a committee of the House might be set up to carry out this review.  My instant reaction to that is that I do not believe that a committee of the Dáil or the Dáil plus the Seanad would be an appropriate body for making recommendations on this matter.  I think Deputy O'Connell was in the House when the Fianna Fáil Government of the day established an all-party committee to examine the health services. So far as I can remember it came to nought.  Nothing significant came from it.  I think it was established at that time merely to placate a certain Independent Deputy whose vote was <Col N="2093" /> badly required by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, at least he was consistent in his attitude which Deputy O'Malley was not.  Deputy O'Malley is now denying Fianna Fáil policy.  It will also be appreciated that Governments all over the world are confronted with the same sort of situation as we are so far as the health services are concerned and particularly so far as the cost of the health services is concerned.  There is an everincreasing demand.  One has only to look at the Order Paper to see that practically every question tabled to the Department of Health demands money.  These may be legitimate requests. If we were to have a perfect service which would please everyone in the House and in the country, it would cost us very much more than what we are paying at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest that there is an easy solution.  I believe that a review body in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare could produce a better system of financing the health services.  There is no absolute guarantee that it will since the problem continues to exist in every country in <Col N="2094" /> Europe or in any other part of the world.  Nevertheless, I believe it is worth exploring.</P>
    <P>At present there are three contributors, so to speak, to the cost of the health services: the State, the rates and the Appropriations-in-Aid. A suggestion was made by the former Minister, the late President Childers, that possibly the contributions might be pay-related.  I have thought about this and I have discussed it with those who could not be described as a small section of the community.  They have grave reservations about a pay-related health contributions scheme.  All these things need to be examined in the hope that we can get a uniform and acceptable method having regard to the ability of people to pay and having regard to equity.  We must explore all these possibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can remember it did report.  I was not prepared to accept it at the time on the principle&mdash;I may have been entirely wrong&mdash;that if it is pay-related it is also benefit-related.  If it is pay-related you just get the same service no matter what you have to pay. It may be a method whereby those who should pay more would be required to do so.  I have not my mind made up on this and that is the reason why I think a specific review of the financing of health services should be engaged in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy O'Malley means when he describes me as a doctrinaire socialist.  It is one of these fancy descriptions one picks up every now and then.  I often wonder what Deputy O'Malley is.  He <Col N="2095" /> has the advantage of belonging to a party that calls itself &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo; but they have no real political philosophy.  With a name like that and the attitude they have always had they can be anything&mdash;men of all seasons.  They can pretend to be socialists today, not to be socialists tomorrow, liberals the following day and reverting back to socialists the day after.  This Government have shown in a practical way, that we are practical socialists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This we have demonstrated in respect of the vast improvements that have been made in the line of social welfare.  We have given increases over and beyond the increase in the cost of living and we have embraced many more people so that now practically everybody, with the exception of those who are on home assistance and this will be changed shortly, comes under the protection of the Department of Social Welfare. I do not think we could be accused of being doctrinaire socialists.  We have been practical socialists as far as health is concerned and we have shown that in our two years in office. During that time we increased expenditure in real terms by 8 per cent.  At the same time we have reduced the liability of ratepayers in their contributions towards the health service. That is a promise we gave before the election and it is one we have begun to operate since the first budget.  The charges to health authorities in 1972-73 was £36 million and that has been reduced to £13.5 million in 1974 and will be reduced by another £9 million in 1975.  The charges then will be eliminated altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not the same outcry as there was when Fianna Fáil were in power.  In the last 20 months we started to remove what I regard as one of the most regressive elements of health services financing by taking the burden of the health services, and the housing subsidies, off the ratepayers. This measure has been described by some Fianna Fáil speakers as an imposition on the middle income group.  It may be but I should like to point out that approximately 90 per cent of the cost of the services for the people in the limited eligibility group is borne by the Exchequer and this percentage is rising annually.  The Deputy will agree, arising out of my speech, that the cost of this service for the limited eligibility group is percentage-wise growing annually. This means that all sections of the population, including the upper income group, are contributing towards the cost of the service through taxation.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell suggests that the entire cost should be borne by the Exchequer.  I am not committed either way on this matter and I will have it examined by the review group but whatever the final decision I must continue with the present method, a method which was inherited, and the only one we have.  The complaint by Deputy O'Malley that we had no legislation intrigued me.  The Deputy can rightfully point to some measures such as the Misuse of Drugs Bill but passing legislation does not necessarily mean that the goods are delivered or that the health services are improved. There is enough legislation in the 1970 Act, and in previous health Acts, to allow any Minister for Health to make improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can legislate for anything but the implementation of the legislation is what matters and this is the problem of any Minister for Health.  The Act of 1970 was good in itself.  It provided <Col N="2097" /> for certain services which I am trying to introduce and improve.  The problem is not legislation, and I say that as a tribute to my predecessor, but it is in part due to the scarcity of the financial resources which everybody recognises.</P>
    <P>As far as the provision of finance is concerned this Government have not been ungenerous.  Within the existing legislation I have made improvements. Expenditure in 1972-73 at £105 million was £61 million less than that provided for in the year 1974-75.  This is an increase of 58 per cent and that could not be considered ungenerous. This enabled me to do a variety of things which improved the health service. I introduced the constant care allowance for handicapped children at £25 per month without a means test at a cost of £1 million per year to the Exchequer.  I increased, and this was referred to by Deputy Calleary, expenditure on home help services from £150,000 in 1972-73 to £344,000 in 1973-74.  That Deputy suggested that these home helps were necessary and should be added to as another contribution towards keeping people out of hospital.  I entirely agree and, as I emphasised earlier, with proper community care, proper preventive medicine or service we could make a contribution towards keeping people out of hospital and happy in their own homes.</P>
    <P>As far as the social work services are concerned I will ensure that these will be developed as quickly as our universities can turn out these social workers.  At present there are 33 post-graduate students sponsored by the health boards.  Emphasis in this debate was on community care.  In the present year we will spend £36 million on this service and this is directed towards providing treatment and care in the community and trying to diminish bed occupancy in the hospitals.</P>
    <P>From the extra moneys voted financial support was given to what had been called for so long, the community information services, through the National Social Service Council.</P>
    <P>In 1974 we are spending £73 million on the maintenance and development <Col N="2098" /> of general hospital services.  Again, I gave details in my Estimate's speech in regard to the various types of institutions for the aged, mentally handicapped and various other types of people.  In 1974 a sum of £46 million was spent on services for mentally ill, mentally handicapped and in the provision of services in the psychiatric hospitals.  There is provision also for psychiatric services in the community with particular emphasis on out-patient clinics.  There was an improvement also as far as the accommodation of mentally-handicapped children is concerned, again with the provision of more money.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note also the new emphasis being placed on training for outside employment and, where necessary, for sheltered employment. In this respect, we have had a sum of money allocated to us from the social fund of the EEC.  Some people have been disappointed with the amounts allocated to them but the picture overall was an increase of 100 per cent over what was received in the preceding year.  Therefore, it is not legislation we want.  It is action.  It is not legislation we want, it is money.  It is for that reason we have suggested the increase incorporated in this measure. In respect of our health services generally&mdash;apart from various other measures&mdash;if I believed new legislation was required, there would be no delay at all in its provision.  Along with that, I have made provision for the inclusion of four extra long-term illnesses.  This resulted from a demand, if you like, by those suffering from those long-term illnesses.  Let me say that they are the only ones added since, I think, 1971, mind you, at no mean cost either.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of obtaining contributions from farmers was mentioned. It is a fact that some farmers do not pay, and some have not paid since the scheme was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some mention of the fact that farmers did not pay their £7 contribution.  I suppose there are some who have not paid since the scheme was introduced.  I should like to point out to the House that it is the responsibility of the health boards to collect contributions. Possibly, the method of collection is not satisfactory.  I do not know whether or not the health boards would undertake the change, but I think contributions should be collected through the rates to ensure that everybody within the limits mentioned pays the proper amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say in actual terms but I suppose about 70 per cent to 75 per cent of farmers <Col N="2100" /> are paying.  However, the other 25 per cent constitutes a sizeable sum with which the services could do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not got the actual figure now but I shall get it for the Deputy.  In any case, let me say that farmers who have not medical cards and who are entitled to limited eligibility are not subjected to the hardship referred to by various members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  If they do not pay their £7 per year, I do not believe they will pay their £12 per year unless the health boards proceed against them or there is a different collection method implemented to ensure they pay what they are bound to pay by law.  Mind you, a lot of these people are not being questioned in hospitals and are being regarded as being in the middle income group&mdash;even though they have not paid their contribution &mdash; while, on the other hand, those in insurable employment have the amount deducted from their wage packet every week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what doctor would do that.  Deputy O'Malley suggested also&mdash;I suppose it was in relation to my Estimate's speech&mdash;that <Col N="2101" /> there would be a cut-back in the health services.  I want to assure Deputy O'Malley that that is entirely wrong. There will not be a cut-back.  What I did say in my Estimate's speech was that I did not expect to be able to provide for the same percentage development as happened in 1974 and in 1973. As a matter of fact, if Deputy O'Malley read the Book of Estimates he would see that there is a projected increase of approximately 37 per cent for 1975 as against the preceding year.  Therefore, he need have no worries in that respect.  The services certainly will be maintained and there will be some development. However, it would be dishonest of me to try to pretend to the House that there was going to be development on the same lines as occurred in 1973 or 1974.</P>
      <P>The estimate of income at current rate for the health contributions is £5 million per annum.  The increased income from the same group of people, at the increased rate of contribution, will be £3,500 and that would give a sum of £8,500 for the full year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall introducing a Supplementary Estimate here a fortnight ago when he told the House that the £5 million could not be collected and when he was looking for more money on that basis? Why does he come back here now and say that the current yield is £5 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The current yield per annum is £5 million.  I think the Deputy may have become a little confused or, perhaps, it did not explain it too clearly to him.  He asked why the Supplementary Estimate for £500,000.  First of all, I should like to point out that that £500,000 referred to a nine month period only.  The Supplementary Estimate was required to meet the shortfall of £500,000 due, primarily, to the non-inclusion of the higher income group.  The Deputy still does not understand, does he?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain it to him, <Col N="2102" /> in simpler language.  The Supplementary Estimate for nine months was £4.7 million.  That included £5 million estimate of receipts from the upper income group, leaving £4.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The £5 million referred to one year.  I am referring to the nine month period for which the estimate was £4.7 million.  Included in that was £500,000 expected to be received from the upper income group when the Estimates were being prepared. That leaves £4.2 million.  That was made up of £3.775 million from health contributions at the existing rates from people liable to pay them, and there was also a transfer from the Department of Social Welfare of £425,000.  There was a loss involved of £500,000 and that is the amount I sought in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that the Revenue Commissioners and the health boards collect the contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners collect it from those who are limited in terms of income while the health boards collect it in respect of those who are farming and whose valuation is less than £60.  The 15p is included in the Social Welfare stamp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not included in the Social Welfare stamp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners collect from those who are within the £1,600 income limit and the 15p stamp is included in the Social Welfare stamp, the amount of which is deducted by the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies have indicated that one of the priorities should be the improvement of the guidelines for entitlement <Col N="2103" /> to medical cards.  Naturally, all of us would wish that many more people could be brought into this scheme but I would point out to the House that at present the scheme incorporates 35 per cent of the population and that since I took office approximately 100,000 additional people have been brought within the medical card system.  These are the people who are now in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>There is now uniformity of guidelines but there are some Deputies who appear to want to know what are the guidelines and there have been suggestions that these guidelines vary from one health board area to another.  This is not so.  There was a review at the beginning of this year and the limits were increased.  I proposed that there be a review in January.  The CEOs have agreed to this but what is more important at present is that a review would not take place once a year only. I shall be advising the CEOs to have a review, say, after each period of six months because a lot of changes can take place in a period of 12 months, particularly at present when there are financial difficulties.  These regular reviews would ensure that people would not be deprived of medical cards when their means or their incomes warrant their eligibility.  There were references too, to the income limit of £1,600. In this regard I can tell the House that that limit will be increased to £2,250.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say at the beginning of the tax year&mdash;in April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The change will be made whenever the tax period begins but it could not be made in between times.  The question was raised, also, of the payment of contributions by people who held medical cards.  Some Deputies seemed to suggest that a person should not have to subject himself to the indignity of producing a medical card to his employer.  I do not know of any other way in which an <Col N="2104" /> employee could indicate to his employer that he held a medical card. I do not think anybody need be ashamed to declare to his employer that he is in the lower income group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not be aware that a circular issued from the Revenue Commissioners indicating that if a person did not wish his employer to know he was a medical card holder, he could indicate this on the form supplied and return it.  Of course, the Revenue Commissioners found that they had been wrong in doing this because only an employer could refund the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That question was raised here before by Deputy Briscoe. The circular referred to was issued in March last but there have been some changes since then.  Now, if a person wishes to be relieved of the 15p per week payment, and legitimately so, all he has to do is to show his medical card to his employer.  I wonder what is the objection to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>But the point is that the person who had paid the contributions is not getting the refunds. In the circular issued by the Revenue Commissioners there was no direction to employers to refund the contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But the employer must pay the contributions, he does not deduct them from the wages of the worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Revenue Commissioners informed medical card holders that they need not notify their employers in this regard, there are now many people who have been owed refunds for as long as two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did they not go through the simple procedure of indicating to their employers that they held medical cards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Revenue Commissioners told them that they need not do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a suggestion that the medical card scheme should <Col N="2105" /> be extended by one-third but, on a basis proportionate strictly to present costs, this would cost an extra £13.5 million and to extend the scheme to the entire population would cost another £27 million per year.  Again, on a strictly proportionate basis to the present cost I do not know whether the £27 million would be the correct figure because it does not take into account a number of factors that would affect the cost of extending the services, for example, the pattern of demand on the service by new entrants and also the level of fees payable to doctors and to pharmacists in a new situation.  The net effect of these factors would probably be to increase the cost beyond the figure of £13.5 million or, for the entire population, £27 million.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley attacked me again on the proposal for free hospital services.  He says that this is an extraordinary example of socialist principles. Free hospitalisation is good socialist policy.  There is a certain amount of inconsistency here because there are a number of other services within the health service that are free to the entire population and to which, apparently, Deputy O'Malley has no objection.  Therefore, I wonder if he has an objection to something that was acclaimed by members of his party, for example, free drugs and medicine for everybody suffering from a long-term illness, also immunisation against infectious diseases and treatment of these diseases are free to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the availability of these facilities to the entire population does not deprive the weaker sections of the community of services that they require and would otherwise receive? That would be the situation in bringing the top 10 per cent within a free hospitalisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That gets away from the question I posed.  Would the Deputy argue that those in the upper income groups should pay in respect of the services which I have mentioned are free to all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily but <Col N="2106" /> the availability of these services does not deprive anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has no objection to these people being able to avail of all these services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Child health examination is free for all; so is hospital care, in-patient and out-patient, for long-term defects in children; rehabilitation and screening tests.  I think these are all good and desirable schemes but if Deputy O'Malley is to be consistent he will suggest that we should not give these free services to people who can pay for them and devote the money to some other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so and the Minister knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is inconsistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not inconsistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, I should point out that when the upper income group are included in the free hospitalisation plan, 90 per cent of the cost of this service will be paid through the Exchequer and the upper income group will pay proportionately more towards the cost of the services especially with the introduction of capital gains tax, wealth and profits tax and mining tax.  Deputy O'Malley's argument fails, therefore, when he suggests that the poor people are paying for the rich because the policy of this Government, as enunciated, has been to introduce these forms of taxation that were sneered at by Fianna Fáil when they were in Government. The scheme means that not only will the free hospital service be available to all&mdash;which I believe is good socialist <Col N="2107" /> policy&mdash;but the rich will pay proportionately more than the less well off.</P>
      <P>May I again ask Deputy O'Malley who does he regard as being in the upper income group?  We could identify people by name and we might not be accurate in that either.  The people I am concerned about are those who are now regarded as in the upper income group, teachers, gardaí, civil servants, the Army and small business people.  They constitute a large proportion of those to whom I would propose to offer free hospitalisation in a public ward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised about eligibility on the basis of valuation.  I do not think any of us is entirely happy about this system not only in relation to the health services but to other Departments also.  It is not the best method but at present I do not know how any other way that is readily <Col N="2108" /> available of determining the means of any land holder whose valuation is less than £60.  Even if a farmer's valuation is over £60 and he can show to the satisfaction of the health board that his income is below the income limit, he would then be admitted to the limited eligibility group.  This income level will be increased very shortly.</P>
    <P>The debate has been very wideranging; many Deputies thought they were speaking on the Health Estimate. I repeat that while I am not entirely satisfied with the method of financing the health services I believe that at present the increase, in view of the increase in the cost of living the increase in the services, and the increase in wages, although not substantial, is justified.  There is no subterfuge; this is £3½ million that will go directly towards improving the health services in 1975.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 may be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 12, to delete &ldquo;1974&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1977&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to postpone the coming into operation of the greatly increased rates of contribution for a period of three years, from 31st December, 1974 to 31st December, 1977, that the old rate of contribution be retained for a further period of three years.  My reason for tabling the amendment is that when the rates of contribution were established in 1971 the country was in the middle of an era of considerable prosperity. There was a comparatively high degree of employment, there was no shortage of money and price rises were not a serious problem, although they were something of a problem. Among workers, particularly those who were sent in to speak on the Govbility category, there was a pretty good degree of prosperity and the payment  of 15 pence a week or £7 a year at that time, while it was obviously not welcomed by everyone, did not involve any great difficulty or hardship. Since then, unfortunately, we have had the advent of a Coalition Government which has brought in its train the disasters that we in this country have always, unfortunately, had to associate with Coalition Governments except that on this occasion they seem to have outdone themselves in their performance in bringing disaster on the nation and its people.  Unemployment figures show that there are currently 83,000 to 84,000 people out of work.  The number is rising weekly at a rate of approximately 1,500 to 2,000.  The number of redundancies is without parallel.  Numerous industries, including what is possibly the most important one of all from the point of view of employment and overall prosperity, the building industry, are in serious trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allied to that you have the economic disaster which affects this country compounded seriously by the activities of the Government in sneaking into this House and making a bare announcement of an order which they made outside the House a fortnight ago, to raise, as they said at the time, £27½ million extra in taxation.  That figure was based on a belief that the consumption of petrol would drop by 10 <Col N="2111" /> per cent.  It now appears that that is unlikely and the amount of extra taxation that will be raised by the making of that order is likely to bring in about £33 million.  We have had an increase in the price of butter by 4p a lb. due to the removal by the Government of a subsidy which they need not have removed.  In the last week we have had increases in the price of bread, beer and spirits.  Now we have this increase.  The workers have reached the stage that they just cannot take any more.</P>
    <P>In putting down this amendment to postpone the coming into operation of this enormous increase for a period of three years I am hopeful that when three years have expired the country will, to some extent at least, have got itself out of the appalling mess into which the Coalition Government have now put it.  The amendment is a reasonable one because it will give some chance to the ordinary taxpaying worker to moderate his demands for the increased income which he must have as a result of the recent activities of the Government.</P>
    <P>It was noteworthy that in his opening speech on Second Stage the Minister for Health took the rather extraordinary step of increasing very substantially the weekly payment of most workers who fall within this category and, in the same speech, went on to ask them to restrain their demands for higher income because of the general economic situation.  In this amendment I am giving the Minister an opportunity, if he is sincere in his exhortation to workers to restrain their demands, to show that sincerity by postponing this increase for a period of three years until, hopefully at least, the mess we are in will be over and the people who come into the limited eligibility category will be in a better position to bear the burden of this increase.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made by those who were sent in to speak on the Government side, of the fact that the increase is only 11p per week or £5 per annum.  I think it was Deputy Coughlan who said the 11p would <Col N="2112" /> only buy a bottle of lemonade, which I thought was nice of him.  It is, of course, totally false to judge this increase on its own, in a vacuum and away from the context of the whole general economic situation.  That cannot be done.  It has to be seen in its proper context as yet another step by the Government in a long line of steps to increase prices, to increase deductions from the wages of the ordinary workers and to put them in a situation in which they have no alternative but to make not just claims for higher wages but claims for very substantially higher wages.</P>
    <P>The Minister by accepting this amendment can have his Bill but at the same time the hardship which this, in conjunction with all the other things done recently by the Government, will create can at least be postponed until such time as hopefully in three years' time the prosperity we knew in 1971, 1972 and 1973 will have returned to this country and the workers, the small farmers and others who are in this category will be in a better position to meet the imposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for this amendment is all too obvious and reasonable for the Minister to reject the amendment.  The reason for it can be seen not by the performance of the Coalition in the last 20 months but the performance of the Coalition in the last ten days when we have had practically a budget a day.  One of the members of the Fourth Estate said last week that the theme song of the present régime is: &ldquo;'Tis only a budget a day, dear&rdquo;.  The fact that even the press corps are now talking in those terms about the régime which we have ruling the country at present is proof of the need for this amendment. We have probably the unluckiest Coalition Government in history at present.  There is an old saying that it is better to be born lucky than rich.  We have a very unfortunate relationship between two diametrically opposed parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1951-1954 we had the unlucky Korean War.  That was blamed for the lack of decisions and decision making by the Coalition Government at that <Col N="2113" /> time.  In 1954-1957 we had the unfortunate Suez crisis.  Again they were very unlucky.  The Suez crisis caused the fall of the Coalition at that time. They came in once more in 1973 and they are again unlucky because of the Middle East situation and another oil crisis.  Everything is blamed on the oil crisis.  I heard it insinuated at a county council meeting lately that the sheiks of Araby were card-carrying members of Fianna Fáil.  The Coalition have had three terms of bad luck. Every time they take office they have bad luck.  What country could afford an unlucky Government like that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask the Deputy to relate his remarks more closely to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept fully the ruling of the Chair.  I am merely pointing out the unfortunate bad luck the Coalition have had in three terms of office.  The people cannot afford to take a chance on a fourth term.  We are asking for the postponement of this savage increase until 1977.  Those Government backbenchers who spoke so scathingly about the fact that this is the only attempt at health legislation since this Government came into office early last year will, I am sure, accept the necessity for this amendment and follow Fianna Fáil into the division lobby.  At the moment we have close on 84,000 unemployed.  The figure has probably increased by another 300 or 400 since Deputy O'Malley spoke shortly before seven o'clock.  Large numbers are going on a three-day week.  Large numbers are trying to survive in this Christmas period with no solid hope for the future of continued employment.  The Minister referred to pay-related schemes.  Most workers are not interested in pay-related schemes. They want to work.  They are not interested in being subsidised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is an honourable man and a reasonable man.  He has served his constituents faithfully and well. Never in his career here has he done anything to tarnish his title of &ldquo;Teachta Dála&rdquo;.  He has strong ties with the trade union movement.  I <Col N="2114" /> appeal to him now to accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  He is aware of the problems facing the workers, one being massive price increases. These are blamed on circumstances outside the control of the Government. Not all can be laid at the door of outside circumstances.  Knowing the Minister is a reasonable man, I believe he will accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been plamásed and criticised but I am not prepared to accept this amendment.  This is a two-section Bill and Members knew exactly what they were voting for when they recorded a vote of 61 to, I think, 51 about a quarter of an hour ago.  I recognise a changed attitude in the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They have apparently done a little research and know the party were committed to health contributions and in the amendment now proposed, they accept the principle of health contributions.  Every opportunity is taken by the Opposition to talk about the condition of the country. I do not know whether they appreciate the difficulties not alone for this country but for every country in Europe and a great many other countries as well, including Japan and the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke said it was unlucky we had a Coalition Government over the last 15 or 20 years.  We did have an oil crisis.  We have one now again. We have to face up to figures.  I was perfectly honest when I said I want £3½ million contributed to the health services.  Members of Fianna Fáil, of Fine Gael and Labour are looking for money for the health services.  This is not a tax.  It is a continuation of legislation introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government and the Minister for Health who introduced it, the late Mr. Erskine Childers, said it would be a permanent feature of health legislation and would increase from time to time.  I have justified it on the ground that the hospital services in respect of the middle income group have risen by about 93 per cent.  It is justified on that score.  It is justified by the increase in the cost of living for which they may criticise us.  It is justified also on the question of wages. <Col N="2115" /> I do not think workers will object to the payment of this amount in order to continue their entitlement to the limited eligibility services.</P>
    <P>I do not see any point in postponement until 1977.  Deputy O'Malley said we should set an example when we exhort workers to restrain their demands.  We do not address this to workers only.  It is popular for members of the Opposition to say that we, as trade unionists, are asking the workers to tighten their belts.  We are asking every single section of the community to do that, whether they are wage or salary earners or professional people.</P>
    <P>This is a cynical amendment as, indeed, the others are too.  I do not propose to accept it.  Even though £3½ million is a small sum compared with the total health estimate, it will make some contribution towards the improvement of the services.  I do not propose to accept the amendment because the issue was finalised when the division bells went and the overwhelming support of Dáil éireann was given to the measure I introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes the point that I have now accepted the principle of health contributions which I did not do before.  The position is that on Committee Stage of a Bill I am entitled only to put down amendments which do not conflict with the basic principles of the Bill as read a Second Time.  Two of my original amendments were ruled out of order.  I have a letter from the Ceann Comhairle to that effect.  Therefore, I fail entirely to see what point the Minister thinks he is making in his own aid by telling me that I now accept the principle of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I am a democrat I have to accept the verdict of the Dáil in agreeing to the Second Stage of the Bill.  Therefore, for the purposes of any future argument or amendment on any subsequent stage,  I cannot go against&mdash; nor can anyone else no matter how strongly he may feel about the matter &mdash;the principle which is not just a principle of health contributions as such, which I never said I was against, <Col N="2116" /> but a principle of increased health contributions.  That accounts for the changed figures in amendments Nos. 3 and 4, where I have to show at least some nominal increase even though I would prefer that there would be no increase at this time.</P>
    <P>The House has heard something very briefly both from Deputy Burke and myself about the economic plight of the country at the moment.  We did not hear any reply to that from the Minister.  There was no denial that the situation is very serious and that great hardship is suffered by a large number of people within the limited eligibility category.  We have to see this increase in the context of overall Government activity over the past few weeks in raising well over £30 million extra out of the pockets of the people.  This House and the Minister should not make the mistake of thinking that, because these extra deductions go under the name of health contributions, they are some painless, harmless deductions from workers' pay packets.  They are the same as income tax.  They are the same as social welfare deductions. When the ordinary worker gets his pay packet on a Friday night he is interested in the total amount of money in it.  He looks to see what his gross pay was and he looks to see how much the deductions were.  So far as he is concerned it is all going to the Government.  Whether it is called health contributions or income tax is of no consequence to him.  It is taken away from him.  He does not get it.</P>
    <P>The effect of this Bill is to take an extra £3½ million per annum, in effect by way of taxation, from workers who are put to the pin of their collar to support themselves and their families. To say that the money will be devoted to health is no answer whatever.  On the Government's own figures we had a sum of £27½ million raised by a backdoor method outside the House in the past fortnight.  We were never told what that money will be devoted to.  If £3½ million extra is needed for the health services, why cannot it come out of that?  There would be £24 million left.  One can recall very easily that, when the benefits of the <Col N="2117" /> EEC were being distributed by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare who, incidentally, was the leader of the party who opposed our entry, we were told at tremendous length over a long period what all that money was being spent on, how it was being spent, and so on.</P>
    <P>We have heard nothing in relation to the £27½ million which I think more correctly will turn out to be £33 million.  Why could not the £3½ million we are raising in taxation here be got out of that £27½ million?  Is it, as has been suggested by many people inside and outside the House, because the money is already spent? Is it meant to keep us from falling into total national bankruptcy and to try to put off the evil day a bit further?</P>
    <P>This amendment gives the Minister and the Government an opportunity to draw back from the lunatic course of taxation on which they have embarked in the past fortnight.  It is the last opportunity they will have to draw back.  If the Minister is in any way sincere, particularly in his exhortations to people not to look for higher incomes, I would ask him to show that sincerity by postponing until 1977, as suggested in this amendment, the implementation of this increased health contribution, as it is called in the Bill, but for all practical purpose it is a form of taxation. The Minister has the opportunity to do that until, hopefully, the worst will be over and the country will be back to something of the prosperity it knew for many years under Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister insinuated that we were against the whole idea of health contributions. Speaking for myself, I am not against the idea of contributions.  We now have roughly 85,000 people unemployed and up to 50,000 or 60,000 people on a three-day week&mdash;we have no definite figure on that.  Many young people who cannot get jobs are emigrating.  The spectacle of emigration which we have not seen in the past number of years is returning to us now.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment postponing from 1974 to 1977 the increase in the <Col N="2118" /> contributions.  I am not against the idea of contributions <i>per se.</i>  I am against the timing of the increase. The Minister, more than anybody else, is aware of the problems the workers face.  He may say that Fianna Fáil are bleeding for the workers but I ask him, sincerely, to postpone this measure.  The Government have raised taxation on petrol and on dog licences&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of the amendment is that the Government have already raised so much money by way of taxation in the last week that there is hardly any need for this additional £3½ million.  I appeal to the Minister to postpone imposing this additional burden on the workers, take the monkey off their backs.  I fully realise the pressures being put on the Minister by his Government colleagues for money, but I appeal to him to pull back from the precipice and accept the amendment.  By doing so he would be making a gesture towards the cost of living, towards the cost of survival, in these difficult times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that he is not satisfied with the present system of financing the health service.  If that is so and he requires time to investigate this matter thoroughly he should accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  More than ever before the imposition of any additional taxation or the extraction of any additional money from the weaker sections of the community is a harsh measure.  The Minister must surely be aware that conditions are so bad that a further extraction of money would only lead to many people going without some of the necessaries of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated that the amount of money each contributor will be required to pay under this Bill is very small but to some people it will mean a lot, particularly the less well off sections.  Deputy O'Malley's amendment would give the Minister breathing space and time to go into the question of financing the health services in detail.  The amount of money <Col N="2119" /> to be extracted from the workers by way of increased health contributions, increased petrol costs and the various other increases sanctioned recently is substantial.</P>
    <P>It may be that the money to be raised by way of increased contributions is required to keep the show going and I suspect that is the reason.  If the Minister told the House that there was no money and that that <Col N="2120" /> was the reason why he was raising this particular contribution we would be able to put forward alternative suggestions. Deputy O'Malley's amendment gives the Minister the opportunity to have the question of the financing of the health services fully and comprehensively examined in order to ensure that there will be a fair and reasonable system of contributions in the future.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 25, to delete &ldquo;26&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;16&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow for the minimum possible increase in the amount of contribution as I drafted it originally, I had the figure at 15p per week and £7 per annum but as was pointed out to me correctly by the Chair the House has now accepted the principle of increased contributions and, therefore, any amendment would have to show some increase in the contributions.  In this amendment and in No. 4 which I thought would be discussed with No. 3, I provided for the minimum increase, namely, an increase of from 15p to 16p per week and from £7 to £8 per annum.  The reasons for this are the same basically as the reasons for amendments Nos. 1 and 2&mdash;the economic situation of the country and the tremendous hardship being experienced by so many people but particularly by people in the category, for health purposes, of entitlement to limited eligibility.  The majority of these people are workers who are paid a weekly wage and from whom the deductions under various heads each week, including income tax, are staggering.  This must be viewed in the context of the everincreasing rise in the cost of living, or as Deputy Burke more correctly put it when speaking here a few moments ago, the cost of survival, because this is the situation at present.</P>
      <P>Rather extraordinarily to my mind, the House has accepted the principle  of increased contributions.  Among those who voted for these increased contributions were many Deputies who, in 1971, not only voted against the contributions proposed then but who spoke and voted against the very principle of there being any contribution whatever.  I wonder if these debates here serve any purpose or if there is any sense in my putting down amendments, amendments which, on the whole, are fairly reasonable.  The real situation is that the Tánaiste, although he is Minister for Health, was told by the Minister for Finance and by the Taoiseach that there is no money and that, therefore, money must be got from somewhere.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with the way in which these messages come from the Department of Finance.  A Minister is told to view the various charges relevant to his Department and to decide in what respect there could be increases so as to bring more revenue into the Exchequer.  The normal attitude of any Minister to such a message is to tell his officials to inform the Department of Finance that their Minister is not interested.  A week or two later the Secretary of the Department concerned receives a letter from the Department of Finance informing him of a certain area or areas in which increases could be effected.  Unfortunately, the Tánaiste has not been strong enough to withstand such pressure but he must realise how obnoxious it is, particularly at this time when the country is truely crippled by the succession of blows it has received from this Government during the past fortnight, to make a further imposition on the people.  Irrespective of the name that may be given to this further deduction to be made from the weekly pay packet of the workers it is nothing less than taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, because the edict has gone <Col N="2123" /> out that money must be raised in order to prevent the country from falling into total bankruptcy this Bill is brought forward in, what I would consider, the least suitable of all areas for the raising of money&mdash;the field of health in which this Government according to themselves have a commitment to provide free comprehensive health services for everyone, irrespective of how well off or how badly off any one may be.</P>
    <P>Here we have a Bill which seeks to raise substantial additional taxation under the guise of health contributions but this additional taxation is not being raised from the people who can afford it best.  It is being raised from the middle income group who are probably the hardest hit of all and whose every necessity and commitment is increasing in price not weekly or monthly but almost daily.  I do not know how this can be reconciled with the principles of socialism which the Minister and his various party members like to preach about on some occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan is the man who, when asked to define socialism, said that what he would regard as an example of socialism was the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  We have this curious action on the part of such a Government.  Deputy O'Connell of the Labour Party <i>pro tem</i> has described this action as inverted socialism.  Perhaps it would be be described more accurately as perverted socialism.  Perhaps it would be more accurate to leave socialism out of it and to describe it simply as a panic measure by a Government who are in serious trouble and who have mortgaged the future of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said before, if the Minister and the other members of the Government were sincere in the exhortations to the public to restrain demand, they would not be engaging in this kind of measure or in the <Col N="2124" /> measures in which they have been engaging in the past few weeks. Apparently, Because of the panic situation in which they find themselves, due to an enormous shortfall of money they are trying to raise revenue from any and every source.</P>
    <P>Whatever arguments one might put forward regarding the increased cost of petrol or even those foodstuffs that have been increased during the last week or two, surely the health of the people is something on which no decent Government should try to raise extra taxation, regardless of how serious the situation in which they had got themselves and the country into.</P>
    <P>The ill and potentially ill people are now being taxed by the increase from 15 to 26p per week and in this amendment I am trying to reduce that increase to the minimum that I am allowed to propose within the rules of order.  I believe that there should be no increase but since Dáil Éireann has &mdash;strangely&mdash;accepted the principle of an increase I am trying to confine it to the minimum.  I ask those who, in 1971, in this House expressed themselves so strongly against the original Health Contributions Bill and who were opposed not only to the amount of the contribution then fixed but in principle to any contribution, how do they reconcile their opposition then with the fact that not only are they going to vote now for the continuation of health contributions but for an 80 per cent increase in the rate of contribution fixed a few years ago?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, but I think St. Paul became a decent, honourable man when converted.  I cannot say the same in the case of some of the conversions I saw here tonight.  Many of those who did not speak in the debate but who walked through the lobby because they were instructed to do so were doing this because it was necessary to keep the Government in office and to raise another £3.5 million in taxation.  But whether it was fair or proper taxation does not matter to them so long as it preserves for <Col N="2125" /> another week or month or whatever it will be the Government with which the country is currently afflicted.</P>
      <P>I appeal once more&mdash;although it appears it is in vain, because on the last amendment the Minister announced that he would not accept any amendment in my name&mdash;to him to give the unfortunate middle income group a break after what has been done to them by the Government over the past fortnight and reduce the increase being made to the minimum possible, the Bill having been read a Second Time.  The Minister will not get this opportunity again and he cannot blame anyone for his failure to take the opportunity being described as hypocrisy when he gets up on his bicycle, as he will, in the next few days, to go around asking trade unionists and others to moderate their income demands when at the same time he is directly taxing them in health even though he justifies it by saying that he is doing it under the guise of health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not under the guise of health.  I told the Deputy frankly that this extra money was going into the health services.  Peculiarly Deputy O'Malley calls this a taxation Bill now: how did he describe it in 1971?  He was in the House then. Could he tell me how the figure of 15p was arrived at in 1971?  How was the amount of £7 per annum arrived at?  There was no justification for it. It could have been £XYZ or XYZp. Now that Fianna Fáil are in Opposition there is this peculiar change and, as Deputy O'Malley says, it is taxation now but it was a normal health insurance contribution in 1971.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the Fianna Fáil in government behave but Deputy O'Malley suggests that somebody told me that the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance was short of money, to run out and get some.  Was the same thing said to the late Mr. Childers when he was Minister?</P>

      <P>You should have, or you are no bloody good.  Deputy O'Malley suggests we are seeking this money because times are bad, that we have got the country into a mess. Deputy Burke says the same thing and talks about the good days in 1970 &mdash;we will not say too much about the beginning of 1970&mdash;the good times of 1971.  If things were so good in 1971, why did the Minister for Health then introduce this system whereby the workers would pay 15p per week and others £7 per annum?  If times were so good there should have been no imposition on the middle income group.  His argument that times were so good cannot stand up when these amounts were fixed.</P>

      <P>If the Government were so well off and had so much money they did not need this tax. I remember a time under Fianna Fáil, if the Deputy wants to talk about distress&mdash;I do not like being personal&mdash; when the Deputy successfully contested the by-election in Limerick about 1968 which were supposed to be the good times of Fianna Fáil&mdash; and when Limerick city had an alltime record of unemployment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would be surprised if he looked at the figures <Col N="2127" /> and compared the present figures with those of 1968 and 1969.  Whether the improvement is due to Deputy O'Malley or Deputy Coughlan I do not know that.  Let them fight that out locally.</P>
      <P>The Deputy alleges that the exhortations we make are directed at the working class.  They are directed at everybody.  We do not ask them to take cuts; we ask them to be moderate in their demands.  We freely admit that these are very difficult times. Perhaps the Deputy would describe them in stronger terms.  In any case, if the health services are to be improved more money is needed.  I cannot visualise the Deputy on a budget resolution voting for a tax if such were introduced to prop up, maintain or develop the health services.  This money goes directly into the health services and it is a very small amount of the total cost.  If I could get £3.5 million, £4 million or £5 million more for the health services it would be money well spent if it went on providing health services that are now being demanded when practically all the countries in the world, except the oil-producing ones are in dire trouble. There is no point in repeating these arguments.  Fianna Fáil are against increasing this charge and we are for it and any irrelevant arguments will not change my mind.</P>

It will be the final straw that will break the camel's back.  The Minister has suggested 26p but I would appeal to him to reduce it to 16p.  This may sound very little but it cannot be taken in isolation. The increase must be taken in conjunction with the other increases that have occurred and that are continuing to take place daily.</P>
      <P>We appreciate that the Minister is sincere in his efforts to do his job as he sees it but we appeal to him not to impose the charge of 26p.  He has succeeded in getting a majority in favour of the increase but let it be the increase of 1p which we suggested rather than the 11p the Minister wants.  The workers cannot survive another sledge-hammer blow.  I do not want to sound dramatic about an increase of 10p or 11p.  If it were the only increase that had occurred recently I accept that it would be dramatic to continue speaking about it; but we must consider all the other increases that have taken place.  There was one increase imposed by the Minister's colleague who is sitting beside him now, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We appeal to the Minister for Health not to impose extra taxation on the people.  We know he is sincere in his interest in the health of the nation but we would ask him not to sacrifice the mental health of the people in his concern for their physical health.  One goes with the other.  Too many people are at their wits end and the Minister should not add to their burdens by imposing further taxation by a vote of this House, steamrolled through by one of the parties in Government and led by the Minister.  By their own words members of the Minister's party are committed to improve the standard of living of the people.</P>
      <P>Perhaps my appeal may fall on deaf ears but even at this late stage I would ask the Minister to pull back from the precipice and to agree to our amendment.  I would ask him to allow a free vote to members of his own party who are only too willing to come into the lobby with Fianna Fáil and who have admitted this in their speeches on Second Stage.

      <P>The impression may have been given that this side were against a contribution being made but that is not so.  If the increase of 11p were used to bring people into the middle income group it would be justified but what the Minister has proposed will not help the lower income group who are entitled to medical cards, nor will it bring more people into the middle income group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a social conscience and I <Col N="2130" /> realise help must be given to those in need.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out the middle income group is the sector that is hardest hit.  Workers and farmers are the people who have to pay the £7 and the 15p contributions but the extra taxation being imposed here will crush them while it will not benefit any other section.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's policy to include everyone but I am mainly interested in bringing in those who are in need of help.  The Minister's measure is imposing extra taxation for the same services and it is not justified.  The Minister should accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  We are not giving extra services to anybody.</P>

He is a very reasonable man and he has come up with an amendment which must be acceptable to any reasonable Minister. He indicated that the principle was bad.  The Minister said the amount involved was very small.  If the amount he will get from the additional contributions is so small and if the principle is not the best it is only reasonable to accept the amendment.  Earlier this evening the lobby hoppers trod on the backs of the workers by indicating in no uncertain terms in the division lobbies that they are in earnest about extracting the last penny from the workers.  One must examine this on a global basis.  There has been a 20 per cent increase in the consumer price index.  There has been a savage increase in postal charges, in the price of petrol.</P>

      <P>I am trying to point out that people just have not got the capacity to pay and the Minister and the Government are endeavouring to extract additional money from contributors who do not have the capacity to pay.  It appears to me that the Government commissioned some member of the Cabinet to find out what was in the average man's pocket after the last increase in order to extract the last penny from his pocket and somebody came up with the idea: &ldquo;He still has 15p left.  Let us take it off him now, lads.  It is your job, Minister, to get it from him.&rdquo;</P>

Taken with all the other increases the worker must find himself borrowing to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is to be the lifeline for the survival of the Government that is all right but let us be told that.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health told us that over 24 per cent of the people are on the poverty line or below it, so 24 per cent cannot pay anyway.  If we add to that the people who will not be called upon to pay we see that we are in a serious situation.  Indeed, that 24 per cent is a figure that needs to be revised in the light of recent price increases.  The Minister comes in here with this life raft to save the Government <Col N="2132" /> and we are told that having dealt with the other sections it is now back to the worker again.  The great train robbers took only half as much and they ended up in jail.</P>
    <P>I would say the Minister does not believe what he is telling us.  I regard him as a fairly reasonable type of man and I do not believe he is as vicious, deep down, as the Bill indicates. I believe he is being prodded and prompted by many of the people in the Government.</P>

      <P>He now has an opportunity, given him by Deputy O'Malley who is a reasonable Deputy and has a real concern for the health of the people and has shown it in debates on health matters.  The Minister has made his point about the health contributions.  The House has voted on the first amendment.  The Minister has conceded that the amount is small and that some group will be set up to examine methods of payment.  The Minister can now go back to the Government and say: &ldquo;I won the point.  It comes into operation on 31st December, 1974.  The principle of extraction has been upheld. We are all satisfied with it.  I am carrying out a survey to ensure that we have a more reasonable way of extracting more, possibly.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is anxious to point out that Fianna Fáil did this and that it has stood the test of time.  If the principle was as bad as the Minister and other members of the present Government said it was at that time then it should be changed.  With the passage of time attitudes change and there are demands for better services. We hear a lot of talk about a free health service.  There are many services that people are paying for at present and cannot obtain.  They are being asked to pay additional contributions for services that some of them are unable to obtain.  That is completely wrong.  If they were even being guaranteed the services they are entitled to one might say that instead of <Col N="2133" /> sending round the hat this might be a means of getting the gang out of difficulties.

      <P>In relation to the amendment, the amount indicated by <Col N="2134" /> Deputy O'Malley is very reasonable. Possibly he went a little too far but the important thing is the principle. The Minister said the amount he will get will be very small.  Why bother about it then?  If the Minister intends to have this comprehensive examination and if he is concerned for the large percentage below the poverty line who cannot afford to purchase the necessaries of life, he will accept this reasonable amendment instead of digging deep into the pockets of the unfortunate people.  The Government are in dire straits and the nation is in dire straits because of the Government's broken promises.  Survival is the name of the game.  That has been obvious in the last few weeks here.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to see so many tramping into the division lobbies on the backs of people who can ill afford to meet this impost.  I am sure the Minister, if he had his way, would be courageous enough to accept this amendment.  Let him have this comprehensive examination of the methods of financing the health services or let him accept this amendment. He has heard the well-reasoned arguments of Deputies on this side of the House and he will no doubt yield to their logic.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) (a) as it amends the original section 3 refers to the increases as coming into effect on 1st January, 1975, and ending on the date specified by order for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section.  Section 3 (2) of the 1971 Act refers to pay-related contributions which can be brought in by order of the Minister.  I have no brief one way or the other in relation to pay-related contributions for health, but we do have that system in operation in relation to social welfare.  It was envisaged in the original legislation that at some stage it would be introduced, presumably on the grounds of its equity, that those who have more should pay more and those who have less should pay less.</P>
      <P>That principle has been accepted in relation to social welfare and I should like to inquire from the Minister what his views are in relation to the possible introduction of this.  The Minister mentioned earlier that he had received a report from a working party who had investigated the matter. Apparently they made recommendations to him.  That working party were established by the previous Minister and so far as one can surmise from what the present Minister said the recommendations seemed to favour the implementation of pay-related contributions in relation to health.</P>
      <P>I would be obliged if the Minister would tell us what the recommendations were, and outline to us his attitude to them and whether or not he proposes to go along with the ultimate introduction of pay-related contributions in regard to health as has been done in the past two years in relation to social welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered this when I was replying to the debate on the Second Stage.  There is provision in the Act for the introduction of a pay-related scheme.  What discussions the late Minister had in respect of a system of pay-related contributions I do not know.  It is true that the matter was considered but I consider on balance or, to use the Deputy's own word, inequity, that whilst pay-related benefits would be justified in respect of social welfare payments this would not be so in respect of health services because the benefit which the unemployed or sick person would get would be related to his income, to his wage or to his salary.</P>
      <P>I would not be attracted to it in respect of the health services because it would mean a graduated scale of payment for what would be the same sort of service.  The Deputy may have a point in that if the scheme were to be extended to the whole country, that is free hospitalisation and mother and child care, there might be a case in respect of a small percentage of the population but I can visualise a situation wherein a worker with £30, a worker with £35, and a worker with £37 per week, would be paying at different rates but would receive the same service.  My view, and the view that has been expressed to me by those who would be concerned by this, is that it would not be right to apply pay-related contributions to the health scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for giving the House his views on the question of pay-related health contributions.  It is particularly important if one views it in the context of his own proposals for an extension of the limited eligibility benefits to the whole community.  I think, although I did not speak with the late Minister about this point, that the reason he had subsection 2 of section 3 inserted in the Health Contributions Bill, 1971, was because he envisaged that at some time in the future there might be an extension of limited eligibility benefits to the entire community but that he was satisfied that if that extension took place it would be entirely inequitable <Col N="2138" /> that the same contribution should be made by someone who was just above the medical card level as someone who was extremely wealthy by any standards.</P>
      <P>While I take the Minister's point that the benefit is the same for everyone I do not go along with him then and say that because the benefit is the same for everyone the contribution should be the same for everyone. At the moment in the limited eligibility category we do not have an enormous discrepancy because for all practical purposes the top limit is £2,250 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But for manual workers they could go over that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not many manual workers above that limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be quite a number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving some very highly paid manual workers out of it the top limit is £2,250.  The bottom limit would vary considerably because of the various factors that have to be taken into account in relation to the issue of medical cards for full eligibility but one could hazard a guess that for a married man with a family the bottom limit would be £1,300 to £1,400.  Therefore, as limited eligibility stands, we are dealing with a segment who are covered by a yearly income of approximately £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of a flat rate contribution by everyone within that category is, in those circumstances, fair enough considering the administrative difficulty and the difficulty of collection that would be encountered in trying to bring in a pay-related contribution there.  If the Minister is still adamant about going ahead with his proposal for limited eligibility benefits such as free hospitalisation for everyone, that is the 10 per cent who are above the limited eligibility limit, then it would be inequitable if the Minister did not bring in the pay-related contribution system as envisaged under subsection 2 of section 3. If the Minister does not do that we will have a situation where a person with £25 per week, or even less in the <Col N="2139" /> case of a single man, will not be eligible for a medical card, will have limited eligibility but will be making the same contributions as someone who has £20,000 a year.</P>
    <P>The principle involved is important if the Minister proposes to go ahead with what he has been talking about for a long time.  While I am grateful to him for giving us his attitude to pay-related contributions as things stand, and basically I agree with him, while there is a narrow limit in relation to the distance between the top and the bottom in practice of only about £1,000, if he does extend it there will be considerable inequity engendered by that move.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if we could have his views on the question of pay-related contributions as they would apply after the introduction of his proposed scheme to cover the whole community with limited eligibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not committed myself one way or the other for the future in respect of what contributions people might pay when Government policy is implemented with regard to the provisions of free hospitalisation in public wards for the whole country.  There are 600,000 insured persons at present.  Their weekly income can vary between £25 and in the case of skilled workers £55 or £60.  Then there are the ranges in between.  I do not think anybody would be thanked for introducing pay-related contributions for people in that type of category; similarly, in respect of farmers&mdash;of which there are 70,000 now in the limited eligibility group by reason of the fact that they are below £60 valuation.  My feeling is that it would be wrong to differentiate.  As a matter of fact, it would be very difficult to introduce pay-related contributions for the farming community until they decide to keep accounts which they will have to do with the introduction of income tax.  As far as the real top bracket are concerned&mdash;it has been described as 10 per cent&mdash;within that 10 per cent there are many people such as <Col N="2140" /> teachers, guards, civil servants, self-employed people, shopkeepers and so on which whittles it down&mdash;I would not put an actual percentage on it&mdash; to a relatively small percentage of people.  I am not the Minister for Finance.  But my reaction to that would be that they would be subject to the type of taxation that will be introduced by the Minister in respect of capital gains and wealth tax.  They are all caught for income tax and sur-tax.  Without committing myself to pay-related contributions for the whole nation, I do believe that a bigger contribution by whatever method employed should be implemented to ensure that those people pay, in general taxation and, incidentally, for the health services as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the contributions are being increased, I should like to know if an insured person or persons eligible under this Bill finds himself unable to avail of some of the services&mdash;because of lack of beds or something else&mdash;will be compensated will the Minister be prepared to make the necessary finance available to that person?  By that I mean a person who is eligible for such services, who is unable to avail of them in the ordinary way and who has to pay substantial sums for a bed in, say, a private hospital or some other institution.  As the Minister is aware, very often the non-availability of beds is a problem facing many patients in need of immediate hospitalisation.  But because of the problems outlined in the earlier stages of the debate&mdash;such as the insistence of the VHI on a 24-hour period in hospital, the beds with the golden legs which have to be occupied by such VHI contributors &mdash;such patients are unable to gain hospital admittance when they need it.  If such a person decides, in the interests of his health, to obtain a bed in a private ward somewhere, will the Minister make some type of payment to him?</P>
      <P>The other question to which I want to revert is the alteration of the income limit for medical cards.  In paragraph 3 of the explanatory memorandum it says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2141" /> ... (which is usually denoted by the issue of a medical card):&mdash;</P>
    <P>In view of the points made in relation to the reduction in income by increases imposed from time to time, will the Minister ensure at an early stage that the guidelines laid down will be updated in respect of the weaker section of the community at present debarred from services to which they are entitled?  Could the Minister indicate whether or not a person who is forced to obtain such services, who is unable to avail of the services for some of the reasons I have mentioned already will be compensated in any way, or has that person to suffer on and put his health at risk?  When a person pays for such services, it is necessary that they be provided and that the Minister ensures they are so provided.  It would be unfair to ask people to pay additional contributions and then discover that the services for which they are paying and to which they are entitled are not available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to what Deputy Dowling has just said, a situation exists in the Western Health Board region in which a lot of the specialist services are not available. For that reason patients must of necessity go to Dublin.  I know of several instances of medical card patients being unable to obtain beds in Dublin hospitals for long periods. In one specific case in which a man was recommended by the surgeon in Castlebar to go to a specific hospital in Dublin for immediate surgery, that hospital was unable to take him.  His family doctor had to make arrangements for him in another hospital where he had surgery within a week. The surgery involved was so severe that that man had to spend seven weeks in hospital and received a bill for £700.  That is the kind of situation with which we are faced in our region.</P>
      <P>Had we a guarantee that that type of service would be provided, certainly I would have no objection to extra taxation even during this period when, by all accounts, taxation should be kept to the minimum.</P>
      <P>The other point I wish to emphasise is the position of Ballina hospital.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy.  There is not sufficient scope within the confines of this section for a wide-ranging debate on the health services generally with particular reference to the areas in which the Deputy is interested.  It would not be appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke earlier today I talked about the 1970 Act. I do not think anybody from the opposite benches disputed what I said, that the 1970 Act and I think the 1953 Act contained proposals for the provision of certain services.  That is the reason why I had occasion to say that the introduction of legislation was not a problem in respect of our health services at present.</P>
      <P>Although the health services have improved during the past 20 years they are still not complete but so far as the middle income group are concerned, while there have been no spectacular changes for the people, the services are being improved, are being streamlined and patients are receiving better attention.  I think it was Deputy O'Malley who said that anybody could sue a health board for the nonprovision of a health service to which he considered himself entitled.  This is the whole difficulty.  The Act of 1970 provides that the Minister may make regulations to provide for certain appliances and certain treatments for the middle income group but that proviso has not been invoked since 1970 because it was not possible to provide all the services.</P>
      <P>Let nobody on the other side think that I am satisfied with, for example, the dental service.  Indeed, I am not satisfied, in relation to the whole field of health and it is for that reason that I said what we need is money and not legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling asked about the situation of a person in the middle income group who might have to go to a semi-private ward.  In such a case the person would get a subvention from his health board.  In respect of a <Col N="2143" /> medical card holder who required immediate treatment or an operation, the matter would be one for the health board.  Even in respect of a case such as Deputy Calleary mentioned where a person had received a bill for £700, the board would examine the circumstances and decide what help could be given.  I am sure that Deputies have experience of remission of payment of many such bills where it was obvious that the people concerned could not afford to pay.</P>
    <P>So far as the Health Acts are concerned, there is a lot to be done before any legislation is introduced for the health service generally.  Everything can be done under these Acts but the difficulty is one of money and there is no point in saying otherwise.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Title be the Title to the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an amendment to the Title in the name of Deputy O'Malley but this has been ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Title may I refer in passing to the amendment I had down which was:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 6, after &ldquo;1971&rdquo; to add &ldquo;by imposing further taxation on the people&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This would have made the Title clearer.  It would have made the purpose of the Bill clearer to the people who are to find a further 11p per week, in addition to the 15p they are paying already in respect of health contributions, deducted from their paypackets together with the deductions that are made under the various other heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chair ruled that amendment out of order.  I accept that ruling but at the same time it is only right that I should avail of the opportunity once again to draw attention to the essentially fiscal nature of this Bill.  If another £3.5 million is required for the health services&mdash;indeed, much more than that is required in this sphere&mdash;it could have been got from the recently acquired funds, for example, <Col N="2144" /> the £27.5 million which will accrue to the Government as a result of the additional tax imposition on petrol.  I have asked here on two occasions as to where any of this £27.5 million is being spent.  It can hardly be regarded as being unreasonable of me to suggest to the Minister that, even at this late stage, he should seek this extra £3.5 million from the extra taxation on petrol which, as Deputy Barrett forecast, was imposed by the Government before the oil companies put another 10p on the price of petrol which they are now in the process of doing.  There is also the £2.4 million extra in taxation which will result from the unnecessary withdrawal of the subsidy on butter. Would this not have gone a long way towards providing £3.5 million which the Minister is now seeking to extract from the pockets of people?</P>
    <P>For these reasons the long Title is somewhat bald.  It is not as meaningful of the real purpose of the Bill as it would have been if the words that I proposed had been added.  However, as always, I accept the ruling of the Chair in these matters.</P>

It ill behoves the Minister to pretend that this measure is anything more than another aspect of what has been happening in relation to squeezing more money out of the people during the last few weeks.</P>
      <P>I am very sorry that we have seen the day when even the field of the health of our people is fair game for the raising of additional taxation by a Government who have got themselves into serious difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that in whatever other field extra money would be sought the last resort would be the health of the people.  It is a sign of how bad things are that we have this Bill <Col N="2146" /> now being rushed through in order that the money can be got on 1st January.  If they are reduced to doing this in regard to health and payment for health, things must be very bad, worse than the average man believes and, God knows, they are bad enough.</P>
    <P>This Bill should also be seen in the context of a budget which will be introduced on this day four weeks, I believe.  That budget must be seen as a budget coming only four or five weeks after savage increases in taxation bringing in, it appears, in a full year about £35 million.  I can only hope that the budget will have at least some of its teeth drawn by the fact that the Government, in the last two weeks in this House and outside it, by this Bill and otherwise, have raised about £35 million from the people. That figure is more additional taxation than was collected in five successive budgets before it.  Neither this Bill, the petrol tax, the butter or the stamp increases or the other things were called a budget but the effect of them was worst than five combined budgets.</P>
    <P>I trust this is the end of a bad year and that the Government will begin 1975 with a more open approach in their budget than we have had in these various surreptitious impositions of taxation in the past few weeks.</P>

      <P>Fine words from Deputy O'Malley.  I do not know whether the Deputy is serious when he talks about out health services.  I have given him figures, which he has not refuted, which show that in real terms there have been vast improvements in these services in the last two years.  I have told him that there was an 8 per cent increase in real terms in each of these years.  He should also remember that 90 per cent of the cost of health services is being paid by the Exchequer and, in 1975, if he reads his Book of Estimates, he will find an extra £34 million is being provided for health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He does not believe this.  He made about 17 different speeches about the price of petrol including one on the vote of no confidence, but he can be assured that any taxation, including the £27.5 million for petrol, will go to <Col N="2147" /> the general services of this country, whether health, social welfare, education or housing.  He need be under no illusions as to what will happen the health services because I can assure him that in accordance with their <Col N="2148" /> commitments in respect of health and social welfare, this Government will honour their promises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is a simple, non-contentious Bill which will enable the existing financial arrangements in regard to RTE to be continued for a short period.</P>
      <P>When speaking on the Estimate for my own Department on 30th May last, I indicated that I hoped to introduce new legislation before the end of this year which would contain, <i>inter alia,</i> provisions to replace sections 6 and 31 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  These are the sections under which the Government may at any time remove a member of the authority from office and the Minister may direct the authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class.  The drafting of a Bill covering these points and containing other important changes in broadcasting legislation has reached an advanced stage and the Bill will be circulated early in the new year.</P>
      <P>Legislation providing statutory authority for continuing to pay RTE the grant in respect of net receipts from broadcasting licence fees is, however, needed before the end of December, 1974.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for paying grants to RTE in respect of net receipts from broadcasting licence fees have existed since the establishment of the authority.  Section 22 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 provided for the payment of such grants during each of the five financial years ended 31st March, 1965.  Section 2 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1966 made similar provisions for each of the five financial years 1965-66 to 1969-70, and further amending Acts in 1971 and 1973 extended this period up to 31st March, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer financial year now ends on 31st December so the present Bill provides for a further extension of a little less than two years, that is up to 31st December, 1975.  In practice the gross licence fees collected by the post office are paid into the <Col N="2150" /> Exchequer, and provision is made in a special subhead of the Vote for Posts and Telegraphs for a grant-inaid equal to the gross receipts less the costs of collection and any costs incurred by the Department in dealing with the prevention of interference in relation to the reception of broadcasting programmes.</P>
    <P>Pending the passing of fresh legislation RTE's grant for general purposes for the nine month period 1st April, 1974 to 31st December, 1974 was calculated in the normal manner and was included in the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs which was approved by the Dáil in June, 1974.  The present Bill provides for payments made since 1st April, 1974 and for further payments to be made in the period up to the end of December, 1975.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow the House will be considering a Supplementary Estimate for my Department which includes a provision of £300,000 under subhead L1 so that RTE can be paid the increased receipts during the current financial year arising from the higher television licence fees which came into force on 1st October, 1974.  The higher licence fees and recent increases in advertising charges should enable RTE to break even in the period up to the end of March, 1976.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House provides for an increase in the limit on repayable advances that the Minister for Finance may make to RTE for capital purposes.  As I have learned that some Deputies regard this provision as controversial, I have decided in view of the short time available before the recess and in order to facilitate the House not to proceed with it at this stage; it will be covered in the main Bill to which I have referred earlier. I, accordingly, propose on Committee Stage, which I hope we will take this evening, to move the deletion of section 1.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have ample opportunity to discuss the affairs of RTE very thoroughly early in the new year when the main Bill is going through the House.  As the present measure is non-controversial it might be more <Col N="2151" /> appropriate to defer a general debate on RTE until the main Bill is being discussed.</P>
    <P>I hope I have convinced Deputies of the need for this Bill which I confidently recommend to the House.</P>

      <P>Let me say on behalf of the Opposition that this Bill is welcomed for the reasons stated by the Minister and may I correct a statement he has just made?  He said:</P>
      <P>As I have learned that some Deputies regard this provision as controversial, I have decided in view of the short time available before the recess and in order to facilitate the House not to proceed with it at this stage...</P>
      <P>This is not correct.  If any such idea was conveyed to the Minister he was misled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister heard from me was that ordinary legislation in connection with the Broadcasting Authority was normally legislation on which any Deputy would be entitled to speak and that if the Minister was looking for a very short debate it was placing this side of the House and, perhaps, some Deputies on the Minister's side of the House in a difficulty, that it was curtailing the right of discussion.  The Fianna Fáil Party has agreed to take this Bill with the deletion mentioned by the Minister as a special Bill in order to enable the proper payment to be made to the RTE Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may, perhaps, have some reason to be a little critical of the urgency in connection with this Bill which, to some extent, may have arisen out of the Minister's absence last week because despite the fact, as the Leader of the Opposition said earlier today, that all of us welcome the honour conferred on the Minister by the University of Ghana, there are priorities to which he should have regard such as his responsibility to RTE.  In <Col N="2152" /> order to further correct the impression given by the Minister, which he may not have intended to give, I would say we in Fianna Fáil are entirely in favour of providing the necessary capital required by the RTE Authority so that a choice of programmes can be made available to people in the single channel area.</P>
    <P>There are many questions Members may wish to ask which they will have an opportunity of asking on the promised Bill in January in regard to broadcasting and the Minister's responsibility for it.  From the Opposition's point of view there is considerable dissatisfaction because of the avoidance by the Government since the last general election of participation on radio or television in debates with the Opposition. Since the general election last year there has been a persistent reluctance on the part of the Government to confront the Opposition on television. It is obvious to us that the Government Information Service has utilised television to the maximum extent for the advantage of Ministers whilst, at the same time, those Ministers refuse to take part in debates with us.  Although perfectly legitimate, this has all the appearance of a backdoor method of utilising television for political motives.</P>
    <P>Members will, I am sure, highlight the Minister's responsibility with regard to television, telephones, postal charges and the other activities of the Minister.  They may take advantage of the next Bill to outline the confusion that appears to have been caused by the Minister in the single channel area with regard to the possibility of a choice of programme. They may also take the opportunity to point to the confusion, uncertainty and suspicion created amongst both divided communities in the North in the current dangerous situation by some of the intrusions of the Minister when engaging in his own specialised views on these matters.</P>
    <P>I am sure some Members will also be anxious to express their views on the Minister's excursions into the very sensitive areas of identity, culture, and language where he has <Col N="2153" /> been so successful in stirring up divisiveness and controversy instead of pursuing constructive attitudes. There is also the matter of minibudgets involving substantial increases in telephone and postal charges and television licences.</P>
    <P>On the subject of increased television licences, an increase of 33? per cent was announced by the Department on behalf of the Minister last September.  Because of the manner in which it was announced I took a rather serious view of it.  The Government Information Service press release, which I quote, said:</P>
    <P>As RTE salaries and operational costs have risen during the past 12 months, the Authority finds that without an increase in revenue it is unable to discharge its statutory obligation, under the Broadcasting Act, 1960, to be financially selfsupporting.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the RTE Authority has applied to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for an increase in the television licence fees.</P>
    <P>The following increases were granted: ordinary licence fees went up from £9 to £12 and colour licences went up from £15 to £20.  I question these increases not on the basis that justifiable increases should not be permitted but on the basis that adequate reasons were not given by the Minister.  I have in mind the fact that the previous increase took place only 11 months before, in October, 1973.  At the time I expressed the view that in the prevailing dangerous inflationary situation the Government should not just approve an increase of this nature but should give adequate reasons as to why it was necessary.  If the reasons given by the GIS on behalf of the Minister related only to current expenses, then some explanation of how the expenses had occurred so substantially in such a short time should have been given because at that stage we had inflation rising to around 20 per cent and economists were taking the view that, if it were allowed to go further, things would become impossible.  I put the point at that stage that any decision by the <Col N="2154" /> Government to allow any state company to increase its charges beyond something in line with the standard set by the employer/labour conference should be supported by adequate reasons.  I suggested that amongst such reasons might be trying to provide a wider choice for people in the single channel area, or if the authority intended to reduce some of the advertising especially those advertisements popularising the purchase of alcohol by young people or, perhaps, the improvement of colour television.  These reasons, if given, would justify some public confidence.</P>
    <P>As the Minister and all of us are well aware television has become almost a priority in the lives of the people.  Those who have television sets do not want to part with them.  In that sense one might describe the owners of television sets, who have their licences paid up, as being a captive audience. People are not in a position to throw out their sets.  They do not want to and they have, therefore, to accept any increases imposed on them even if such increases add to the inflationary spiral.  I did a rough calculation of what the increases could have amounted to and, if one included the regular increases in the cost of advertising, it came out as somewhat over £2 million.  I felt then and still feel that, in those circumstances, and having regard to the first sign last September on the part of this Government in the form of speeches by both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the need to tighten our belts and the danger of inflation to the economy a more detailed explanation was called for.  I would submit to the Minister that there is a grave need for any Government on behalf of a semi-State body, such as RTE, to retain on behalf of that body public confidence and good will.  In this case this was not done.  People say to me: &ldquo;They are the Government&rdquo;, or &ldquo;That is a semi-State body.  They can increase it and we can do nothing about it.&rdquo;  One is left to conclude that neither the Minister nor the Government bothered to examine the RTE case for the increase.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that in his Estimate <Col N="2155" /> speech in 1973, without first examining the position, the Minister committed himself, or appeared to commit himself, to a concept of open broadcasting and, intentionally or otherwise, created a belief amongst people living in the single channel areas that all TV channels available along the east coast would be made available to them.  I submit that the demand on the part of some groups in the south and west was to some degree accelerated by the Minister's somewhat premature remarks in June, 1973.  He helped to create an expectation.  Indeed, some of the famous 14 point promises made by his Government would justify the title: &ldquo;the Government of Great Expectations&rdquo;. I submit that one of the expectations created in the minds of some people was that there would be open broadcasting in the single channel areas.</P>
    <P>I questioned the Minister at the time. As reported at column 470, volume 268 of the Official Report, 24th October, 1973, I said:</P>
    <P>Would the Minister not now admit that in view of the many complexities and obstacles, not to mention the cost, of this whole area of open broadcasting that his earlier announcements and the publicity attending those announcements were, to some extent, misleading to the public and were based on premature assumptions on his part?</P>
    <P>The Minister said he wanted to proceed in the direction of the widest possible freedom of choice.  The matter is confused in the minds of quite a few people.  In reply to a question tabled by me on open broadcasting the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I regret this delay but at least a date can now be set by which residents in the single channel areas of the south and west can expect to enjoy a choice of viewing.</P>
    <P>That was 14 months ago and there is still confusion in the minds of some groups, judging by correspondence and petitions I have received in recent months.  Is it not time that the Minister told these people what the options are and found out what they want?  It <Col N="2156" /> is time to say what form of choice can be made available to people because they are entitled to know where they stand.</P>
    <P>Speaking at Oxford on July 7th last the Minister suggested that if he did not secure permission to rebroadcast one of the Northern channels he would consider doing so anyway.  Subsequently on October 19th, while he was attending the Labour Party Conference in Galway, the Minister met representatives of committees seeking multi-channel television.  He indicated that he intended to rebroadcast UTV or BBC in full.</P>
    <P>In the text of a Government Information Services release referring to the problem of getting permission to rebroadcast he said:</P>
    <P>Other countries in similar situations, such as Finland, have permitted the rebroadcasting of overspill signals.  In the case of one country, Italy, where the Government decided to prevent such retransmissions, the Courts actually declared this step unconstitutional and the retransmissions were resumed. In reaching this decision, the Italian Constitutional Court held that the Government restrictions were &ldquo;barring the way to the free circulation of ideas, comprising an essential service to the democratic way of life, and finally creating a kind of national self-sufficiency in the sources of information, all things which are contrary to the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>While the Italian Constitution is not of course identical to our own, I believe it to be inspired by broad democratic ideals which we hold in common.</P>
    <P>Thus it is clear that the simultaneous rebroadcasting of foreign television channels is already a feature of the international scene.</P>
    <P>May I submit that that kind of talk is misleading?  What the Minister was talking about was a constitutional aspect of rebroadcasting.  This has nothing to do with private law and the actual rights of the owners of other television channels to rebroadcast <Col N="2157" /> programmes which very many of them are only entitled to broadcast to set audiences.</P>
    <P>In a statement at that time I said that while we are all anxious that as much choice as possible should be made available to people in the single channel areas, some questions arose. I asked did the Minister mean that he proposed to transmit one of the British signals without the approval of the station concerned?  Was he proposing to relay BBC or ITV exclusively and not use the new channel in any way for any home produced programme?  Would he be exposing RTE or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or himself to civil action by the performers in programmes he would be transmitting without their approval?  Would he be causing conflict regarding labour rights?  I also asked him if he had received the advice of the RTE authorities on his proposal and if so what advice had they given him.</P>
    <P>It is important to highlight these matters to try to clear up the confusion. It is not a function of the Opposition spokesman to create obstacles in the matter of achieving a better choice or to explain for the Minister what these difficulties are.  It is the Minister's duty to make clear to people in the single channel areas what he can make available to them and to find out from them what they would like.  It seems to me to be a bit misleading to suggest that people&mdash; and I have the correspondence here from them&mdash;who want three channels are being told that they can have one.  They are not being consulted regarding any possibility of a further or broader choice.  The Minister knows that at present only one channel can be provided.  I suggest that he should be fair to these people and let them know that publicly.  I do not think the Minister should assume that people want continuous BBC or ITV broadcasts whether or not he can provide them.  I am sure the Minister has the information available to him and certainly the information to me indicates that the difficulties in this area are far too great.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2158" /> I should now like to refer to a number of other matters.  The first relates to an incident reported in the Press in regard to the Minister and an official of RTE at the Labour Party conference in Galway.  It would appear from the report that the Minister became involved in arguments with an official of RTE.  I shall quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 23rd October:</P>
    <P>At the Labour Party Conference in Galway, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, was heard to say (to an RTE representative) in front of a number of reporters that a programme on internment run last week was the last exercise of that type that would be allowed.</P>
    <P>In the same newspaper the following day there was this quotation:</P>
    <P>Thus, when the Minister publicly and personally criticised the head of the current affairs grouping in the station in a Galway hotel last weekend he had not seen the programme.</P>
    <P>Whilst the Minister is quite entitled, under section 31, to protect the public from certain types of programmes and whether the encounter in question was intended to be humorous it could be interpreted by some readers as an example of a Minister appearing to undermine the authority of the executive of a semi-State body.  The relations between a Minister and the semi-State body responsible to him have to be proper and disciplined and not casual or open to misinterpretations by the media.</P>
    <P>Even at best in this case the Minister by his indiscretion could have compromised, or may have compromised, the RTE authority and executive in dealing with a question of internal discipline within RTE which is a matter for RTE and not for the Minister or any of the three parties in this House.  As Opposition spokesman, I could have commented on this and made an attack on the Minister accusing him of attempting to bypass the 1960 Broadcasting Act but I left the matter aside to see if there would be any corrections.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another item, written by a regular television <Col N="2159" /> correspondent, published in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 16th November, 1974:</P>
    <P>Since it took up office the present authority has been asserting itself in an area of management which previous authorities left to the administrative and executive employees of RTE.  It has insisted on being represented on interview boards, for example, and its tentacles have reached down deeper and deeper into the day-by-day decision-making and programme-making areas of the organisation.</P>
    <P>The theory of subsidiarity of function seems to have gone for its tea.  The party commissars are now in charge, it would seem, as they were in French and other European broadcasting systems.</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from an article written by an experienced television commentator.  It is his own quotation. I would have expected some correction of it.  If there has been a departure from normal practice on the part of the new authority appointed by the Minister, it should have been explained and the reasons given.  Otherwise, we on the Opposition side, can hardly be blamed if we ask if there is some kind of undercover activity going on in RTE, possibly on behalf of the Government or Ministers.</P>
    <P>It is of paramount importance that the national broadcasting service be seen by the public as at all times and in every way impartial.  In relation to the Minister's responsibility for RTE I believe it is his duty in relation to the changes that may come in broadcasting to publicly declare his attitude towards RTE.  Is the Minister prepared to make a public commitment that he will fulfil his obligation to maintain RTE as a fully fledged national radio and television service which should be concerned, as is stated in the report of the Television Broadcasting Review committee, with safeguarding, enriching and strengthening the cultural, social and economic fabric of the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I refer to that at this stage in our economic history because I consider <Col N="2160" /> it to be of paramount importance that we, on all sides of this House, should regard the strengthening and maintenance of RTE as being vital to what the Broadcasting Review committee refers and to our own economic future.  I am in favour of providing as much choice as possible for people in the single channel area. They are entitled to what we can give them but we have an obligation towards ourselves and we must remember that no foreign channel is going to be interested in the survival of Irish industry or in the survival of anything to do with Ireland.  I put these questions because many people want to know exactly where the Minister stands in that regard.  They want to know because the Minister, through some of his public utterances, has created doubts in their minds. On behalf of the Opposition, I support the passage of this Bill this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in presenting the Bill, informed us that this was a simple, non-contentious Bill which would enable the existing financial arrangements in RTE to be continued for a short period.  It is the height of incompetence on the part of the Minister, and the Government, to present a Bill of this nature at this late hour.  It is a last minute presentation of a Bill of such importance. In fact, this is not a Bill at all. There were two sections in the Bill but one has been eliminated with the result that we now have half a Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are prepared to present to this House, at a late hour, <Col N="2161" /> half a Bill to ensure that the section still remaining will be debated on a restricted time basis.  It is government on a day-to-day basis.  The money is required.  The section of the Bill still remaining to be debated is the stagecoach one, the one which brings home the loot, the loot required by the Minister to enable the continuation of RTE.</P>
    <P>If we read through the Minister's brief we see that he said:</P>
    <P>Tomorrow the House will be considering a Supplementary Estimate for my Department which includes a provision of £300,000 under subhead L.1 so that RTE can be paid the increased receipts during the current financial year arising from the higher television licence fees which came into force on 1st October, 1974.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow the House will have an opportunity.  Who said the House will have an opportunity?  What opportunity will Deputies have of discussing the vast problems of RTE?  We are told &ldquo;tomorrow.&rdquo;  That is a laugh.  This is the type of situation to which we are becoming accustomed now&mdash;getting half a Bill at the last moment and being told that tomorrow we will be given an opportunity of debating it.  We will have no opportunity tomorrow any more than we have tonight.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>Deputies will have ample opportunity to discuss the affairs of RTE very thoroughly early in the New Year when the main Bill is going through the House.  As the present measure is non-controversial it might be more appropriate to defer a general debate on RTE until the main Bill is being discussed.</P>
    <P>This is typical of the Government approach in recent times, either to muzzle the Opposition because of the unsatisfactory nature of departmental affairs or to ensure that Deputies will be deprived of an opportunity of expressing their views.  If it is with the intention of depriving Deputies of the chance to express their views over the wide-ranging problems of the Minister's Department, <Col N="2162" /> then he and the Government have&mdash;by this device&mdash;brought about the type of censorship with which we have become all too familiar in recent times.</P>
    <P>There are one or two questions to which I want to refer.  There is that of the savage increase in the TV licence fee; on the other hand, the call for restraint to the worker to accept the minimum.  The Minister has given no example to entice workers to adopt that type of attitude.  We have experienced the muzzling of the media over a period.  As Deputy Brugha pointed out, there are now no political programmes on which Ministers can be confronted by members of the Opposition, as there were formerly.  Muzzling of the media is unsatisfactory and, certainly does not lead to a very healthy state of affairs.  It is about time the Minister had a re-think.  The Minister is quite selective in his approach to the various problems in relation to RTE.  We saw recently that the Minister challenged a member of the Fianna Fáil Party to a debate and the attitude was that RTE could&mdash;if they considered it newsworthy&mdash;put it on television in order to get across a particular point of view.  I challenge the Minister now to say that he is prepared to allow political programmes to proceed so that Ministers can no longer be protected by the Government Information Services or by the other individuals who have been protecting them for so long, because of their incompetence or because of the situation with which we are all too familiar.</P>

      <P>We know that the situation is unsatisfactory.  I ask the Minister now&mdash;as I did on a previous occasion&mdash;to ensure that there will be a fair and reasonable allocation of time so that there will be confrontation, so that the point of view of the Opposition, which has been muzzled by the media in the past, can be put forward.  I do not know to what degree the Minister is responsible.  If he says he is not responsible then somebody under his command is responsible.</P>

We have experienced the cowardly attitude of Ministers to appear on television programmes confronted by the Opposition, but rather protected by the Government Information Services with their planned leaks, with their selective material passed on, projected from time to time on the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many things about which I should like to speak in relation to television.  Perhaps I will have an opportunity on Committee Stage. There may be other Members with points to make and I am certainly not going to muzzle members of my own party who have such points to put forward.  I know Deputy Davern has some points to make and I shall allow him some time before the House rises. But I want to say that, in relation to any alteration that takes place in programming or in relation to a second channel in the future, every effort must be made to ensure that the content of Irish workers, of Irish trade unions will be increased and that no imported programmes will be projected that would in any way threaten the livelihood of Irish workers or technicians.  We have some very competent people in Telefís Éireann.  But it is all too sad to reflect that there is some underground activity going on <Col N="2164" /> there which does deny us an opportunity of projecting the true situation in the country today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow me to continue on these lines for just one moment.  I asked parliamentary questions here, with particular reference to those people who are paying £12 for their television licence and who cannot get RTE reception, and I was told by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Gaeltacht, or whoever it was in that corner over there: &ldquo;I would refer the Deputy to such-andsuch a date.&rdquo;  Being further frustrated I asked further parliamentary questions. I received no satisfaction whatsoever. The answer, in fact, covered questions relating to Waterford, Mayo and all the other areas and referred not to my question but stated that the House must appreciate it was a matter for consensus in regard to the entire population.  In other words, the Minister did not even bother to inquire where those areas were, what was the television reception there or what amount of fees was being collected from those areas.  On that occasion I had to write to Mr. Hardiman &mdash;I am sorry to see he is leaving his <Col N="2165" /> post&mdash;but I am delighted to say I had a very significant reply from him and also from the television reception service, who gave me a detailed interim reply in regard to the ghosting in the Fethard, Killusty and Kiltinan areas &mdash;the Kiltinan area which is blocked off by the beautiful mountain, Slievenamon&mdash;areas for which I am responsible in this House.  I am here to raise matters of grievance on behalf of my constituents and to ensure that they reap the full benefit of everything done.  However, we have a Minister belonging to this Department who presents this Bill, who has minded everybody else's Estimate and everybody else's account except his own Department.  If you go back to your own constituency, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you will find that out very quickly.  When we cannot get television reception in many parts of the country, that Minister over there refuses to answer to this House, to Members duly elected by so many thousands of people, why they are not getting reception.  We have an eastbased Government, with an eastbased and east-orientated mentality. There is a mentality over there which is particularly eastern, and I do not mean that &ldquo;eastern&rdquo;; it is just anti-Irish. It is a sad thing that any man who tries to denigrate Irish attitudes, ambitions, traditions so much, should be in charge of the main source of communication in this country.  This is what frightens me.  That Lord Katanga, Congo, Brazzaville, or whatever he is called&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A number of questions have been raised of varying degrees of importance, some of them very important. I would like to reply to them but I could not possibly do so in the time at my disposal.  Deputy Brugha nods his head: I am glad he appreciates that point.</P>

Complaints have been made also regarding the Government Information Service's use of television. If there is any ground for complaint about the GIS and television, I would like to hear what that ground is but we have heard nothing concrete in this regard.  There has been a suggestion also that I, through the media, am keeping the Opposition off the air.  The reverse is the truth. My predecessor told RTE in writing to keep off the air a given member of the then Opposition.  That member was <Col N="2168" /> me.  Shortly after assuming office I wrote to the authority, in order to remove any possible apprehension, to say that they need no longer have any fear in relation to any Deputy that RTE wish to have on the air, Government or Opposition.

      <P>Fieldwork on the most recent large scale national household budget survey commenced in October, 1972, and terminated in March, 1974.  Completed returns were received in respect of approximately 8,000 urban and rural households.  The relevant statistical data required for the household budget analysis has now been transferred on to punch cards and the computer validation of these data is progressing.  Programming for the computer print-out of results is in hands and it is expected that these results will become available in the second half of 1975.</P>
      <P>On the termination of the large scale survey of small scale urban household budget survey was initiated in April, 1974, on a continuing basis.  It is intended that this survey will each year cover a sample of approximately 2,000 urban households.  The primary purpose of this smaller survey is to produce up-to-date information on consumer expenditure patterns on a regular continuing basis and to indicate when these patterns have changed sufficiently to justify the cost of conducting a further large scale survey on a national basis.</P>

      <P>When the person named made a claim for unemployment benefit in June, 1973, she was advised to apply for a qualification certificate which would enable her to apply for unemployment assistance on exhaustion of her title to unemployment benefit. She did not make the application as advised.  She exhausted her unemployment benefit on 19th July, 1974, but did not apply for a qualification certificate until 26th September, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certificate was issued on 10th <Col N="2058" /> October, 1974, with effect from 26th September, 1974, her means being assessed at 5p a week.  She did not appeal against this assessment and has been paid unemployment assistance at the appropriate rate of £6 a week from 26th September, 1974.  No arrears are due.</P>

      <P>The person named made a claim for unemployment benefit on 1st October, 1974, but the claim was disallowed as he did not satisfy the contribution condition which requires that 26 employment contributions should have been paid or credited in respect of him in the year 1973.  When making the claim to unemployment benefit this person was advised to apply for a qualification certificate to enable unemployment assistance to be paid to him.  The necessary qualification certificate was issued on 14th November, 1974, and unemployment assistance in respect of the period 1st October, 1974, to 23rd November, 1974, for which he proved unemployment, has been paid to him at Tralee employment exchange in which office area he now resides.</P>
