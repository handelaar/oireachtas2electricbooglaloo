      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Royal Hospital for Incurables Dublin (Charter Amendment) Order, 1974.</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft form was laid before Dáil Éireann on 5th July, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As explained in the memorandum which accompanied the draft order circulated to Deputies, the managing committee of the Royal Hospital for Incurables, Dublin, applied for an <Col N="1454" /> Order to be made substituting &ldquo;The Royal Hospital, Donnybrook&rdquo; as the name of the hospital instead of &ldquo;The Royal Hospital for Incurables, Dublin&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need argue the case for the change in title.  The word &ldquo;incurables&rdquo; is an emotive one which could very well be dropped, and indeed, as has been explained, the hospital wants to drop it.</P>
    <P>I gladly avail myself of this opportunity to pay public tribute to the splendid work of the hospital management, staff and others associated with the work there.  It is a remarkable achievement by any standards that, for over 200 years, a work of a charitable and compassionate nature has endured.  I wish to commend and encourage those associated with the work to continue and persevere in their efforts.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Draft Order before the House is to provide for the legal change in the name of the hospital and I ask the House to approve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that I picked up a great deal of what the Parliamentary Secretary said but I take it that the purpose of this motion is to simply change the name of the hospital from the Royal Hospital for Incurables to the Royal Hospital, Donn' brook.  This party has no objection to that change and I think it is only right and proper and in accordance with the wishes of the hospital administration.  In my view it puts a more realistic and modern title on this very valuable institution.  I should like to join with the Parliamentary Secretary in paying tribute to those who have for many years done splendid work in this particular hospital for the benefit of people who are seriously ill.  I am glad to agree, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, that this motion should be passed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of the amendment of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pension Scheme made under section 6A of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938, by:</P>
    <P>(1)  the substitution of &ldquo;Minister for Public Service&rdquo; for &ldquo;Minister for Finance&rdquo; in clauses 2 (2), 3 (1), 3 (5), 4 (2) and 4 (3),</P>
    <P>(2)  the addition to clause 1 (2) of &lsquo;save as provided in clause 2 (4) below&rsquo;, and the addition to clause 2 of the following sub-clause:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(4) (a)  Any reference to a financial year in sub-clause (3) of this clause shall, in relation to after the 31st day of December, 1974, be construed and have effect as a reference to a period which is co-extensive with a calendar year.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where the reference in sub-clause (3) of this clause to each financial year includes, or may be construed as including, a reference to the period from the 1st day of April, 1974, to the 31st day of March, 1975, the reference shall be construed and have effect as a reference to the period from the 1st day of April, 1974, to the 31st day of December, 1974.&rsquo;,</P>
    <P>(3)  the addition to clause 5 of the following sub-clauses:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(14)  A pension awarded under this Scheme may be increased as if it were computed by reference to the rate of Parliamentary Allowance payable from time to time to a member of the Dáil or of Seanad Éireann, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(15)  An increase in pension under sub-clause (14) of this clause shall apply only where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the member has completed <Col N="1456" /> not less than 12 years' service as a member, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the member is 55 years of age or over, or</P>

    <P>(16)  Increases in pensions under sub-clause (14) of this clause shall apply with effect from 1st October, 1973, or, where the conditions specified in sub-clause (15) are not fulfilled at the time of cesser of membership of either House of the Oireachtas, the date on which any of these conditions are fulfilled, but any increase arising from changes in the rate of Parliamentary Allowance occurring after 1st October, 1973 shall apply with effect from the date (hereinafter referred to as the specified date) specified for the payment of increases in pensions (awarded under the Superannuation Acts 1834 to 1963) in regulations made under section 29 of the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1964, for the year in which such changes occur, if these changes occur on or before the specified date in that year, but where they occur after the specified date in that year increases in pensions under sub-clause (14) of this clause shall apply with effect from such date as the Trustees unanimously decide.&rsquo;,</P>
    <P>(4)  the substitution for sub-clause (10) of clause 5 of the following:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(10)  The Trustees may pay to a widow</P>
    <P>(a)  whose marriage to her <Col N="1457" /> husband took place before he ceased to be a member, and</P>
    <P>(b)  whose husband was</P>
    <P>(i)  in receipt of a pension under this Scheme, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  a member after 1 December, 1960, and had not less than 5 years' service as a member</P>
    <P>a person until her widowhood ceases not exceeding the greater of</P>
    <P>(a)  £250, or</P>
    <P>(b)  one-half of the pension payable to her husband under this Scheme or which would have been payable to him if he had ceased to be a member on the date of his death, or</P>
    <P>(c)  in case a pension under this Scheme was not payable to her husband on the date of his death, one-half of the pension which would have been payable to him under this Scheme on such date if he had had eight years' such service</P>
    <P>together with an addition to such pension of £75 for each child under the appropriate age subject to the total amount so payable not exceeding the greater of</P>
    <P>(a)  £250, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the pension payable to her husband under this Scheme or which would have been payable to him if he had ceased to be a member on the date of his death, or</P>
    <P>(c)  in case a pension under this Scheme was not payable to her husband on the date of his death, the pension which would have been payable to him under this Scheme on such date if he had had eight years' such service.&rsquo;,</P>
    <P>(5)  the substitution for sub-clause <Col N="1458" /> (13) of clause 5 of the following:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(13)  The Trustees may pay to each orphan whose parent was</P>
    <P>(a)  in receipt of a pension under this Scheme, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a member after 1 December, 1960, and had less than 5 years' service as a member</P>
    <P>a pension of £150 up to the appropriate age subject to the pensions payable to the orphans of such parent not exceeding the greater of</P>
    <P>(a)  £250, or</P>
    <P>(b)  one-half of the pension payable to such parent under this Scheme or which would have been payable to him if he had ceased to be a member on the date of his death, or</P>
    <P>(c)  in case a pension under this Scheme was not payable to such parent on the date of his death, one-half of the pension which would have been payable to him under this Scheme on such date if he had had eight years' such service</P>
    <P>and, where both parents have been members, the parent eligible for, if he had ceased to be a member on the date of his death, or in receipt of, or if he had eight years' service as a member on such date would have been eligible for, the smaller pension shall be disregarded for the purposes of this sub-clause.&rsquo;, and</P>
    <P>(6)  clauses (4) and (5) of this resolution shall be deemed to have been passed on the 1st day of July, 1974.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion, which amends the House of the Oireachtas (Members) Pensions Scheme, is two-fold&mdash;(1) to provide pensions parity for certain categories of pensioners <Col N="1459" /> and (2) to broaden the area of eligibility for widows' pensions.  Representations on these matters have been received by me from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and other quarters.</P>
    <P>At present pensions are based on the rates of Parliamentary allowances which Members were receiving when their membership ceased and are not subject to revision.  I have decided that the pensions payable to persons, who had at least 12 years' service or who are over 55 years of age or who are precluded from earning a livelihood by reason of permanent disability or who are widows of Members, may be increased periodically as if they were calculated by reference to the rates of Parliamentary allowance payable from time to time.  The operative date each year for these increases will be the same date as for public service pensioners generally, commencing on 1st October, 1973.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to reduce the qualifying period for widows' pensions from eight years to five years. The actual rate of pension for a widow whose husband had not less than five but less than eight years' service as a Member of either House of the Oireachtas will be half the pension calculated as if the husband had had eight years' service subject to a minimum of £250 for the widow. The addition which is made to a widow's pension in respect of each child is being increased from £50 to £75, and an orphan's pension is being increased from £100 to £150.  These amendments will take effect from 1st July, 1974.</P>
    <P>The motion also provides for technical changes in the Members' Pensions Scheme following on the transfer of responsibility for superannuation matters generally from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for the Public Service and the changeover of the present financial year to coincide with the calendar year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I should like to say that we agree with these proposed <Col N="1460" /> changes in the Members' Pension Scheme.  As a Member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges I should like to say that the Committee have been making representations to the Minister for Finance for some time on these lines.  The Committee would have been happier if some of the changes had gone a bit further than the Minister saw fit to incorporate in this Order.  Nevertheless, we welcome the changes for what they are, subject to one or two reservations to which I should like to refer in the course of my remarks.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like it specifically spelled out by the Minister that the existing pension rights of Members are not affected and that the parity proposals are in addition to the existing rights.  In other words, a Deputy with eight years' service at the moment, provided he does not come within one of the other various alternative categories, will still be entitled, as of right, to his non-parity pension or his pension based on the salary of a Deputy or Senator at the time of his retirement.</P>
      <P>A number of members of our party expressed some reservations about the fact that, in order to achieve parity, it would be necessary for a member to have had 12 years' service, or to have attained a certain age.  Perhaps it is no harm to look at the nature of this pension scheme.  It is a contributory scheme.  Members who come into this House are not given the opportunity to opt out of it. Indeed, in past years I understand that several Members on all sides of the House asked for the opportunity to opt out.  The contribution is not insignificant and they felt, for one reason or another, that they were unlikely to qualify for pension and they wanted the opportunity not to be in the scheme.  They were refused that.  The deduction from their allowances was compulsory.  Therefore, any of the contractual rights they built up by virtue of their membership of the House should not in any way be interfered with.  I do not think they are, but I want it specifically so stated by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because certain contractual rights <Col N="1461" /> were established, some members of this party take the view that, while the position of Deputies is not being in any way disimproved, it is not right in principle to improve the position of some Deputies only and not of others.  This concept of two different types of pension, one being a parity pension and one not, in the view of some people seems at least questionable.</P>
    <P>I should like an explanation from the Minister as to why it is felt that this distinction should be made.  I suspect from my membership of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that the answer the Minister may give to that is that the fund is basically insolvent and has been kept floating in the past two or three years by subvention from the Exchequer only.  That may explain that decision.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to judge a pension scheme such as this by the sort of general criteria which would be applicable to, for example, an ordinary public service pension scheme or fund, because the situation is very different. People do not normally enter the House at a very young age, after school, or immediately after university, as they do in the public service generally.  They enter it at any time up to as late as 70 years of age. There are current examples of Members of these Houses who have entered for the first time at or very close to 70 years of age.  There are other examples of current Members who entered at 21 years of age.</P>
    <P>I can see that from the actuarial point of view such a diverse system of entry into membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas must inevitably give rise to problems in valuing the scheme, and so on.  Nevertheless, membership of the Oireachtas is a specialised occupation.  It is a public duty and the problems and difficulties associated with it are enormous.  When we came in again this morning we saw the National Flag over this House once more at half mast for the second time in a week.  This brings home to us that the strains and tensions and difficulties of public life, <Col N="1462" /> whether one is in Government or in Opposition or anywhere else, are considerable.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance of the day need not feel any compunction about making special arrangements in relation to the pension fund of Members of the Oireachtas.  There are a great many of us on all sides of this and the other House who, in order to be here, have suffered very grievously financially in our own private affairs.  The great majority of us could probably fairly claim that we would be considerably better off in financial terms and, perhaps, even in other terms if we had never entered into membership of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The fact that so many people are prepared to do that and to spend very often the best years of their lives, in a very literal sense, in the public service at great cost and inconvenience to themselves, is a very good reason why the precise criteria which apply to other pension funds should not apply to this specialised one.  The Minister, in my view, should not feel inhibited from applying parity across the board to everyone who qualifies for a pension under this scheme.</P>
    <P>The fact that a man may retire, or be retired compulsorily, from this House long before he is 55 years of age should not preclude him from what one has come to look upon now as his right to a parity pension.  One could retire here before one was 40 years of age and still have nearly 20 years' service.  There are instances where that might well happen.  There are people in this House at the moment who entered it at 21 or 22 years of age and who, if they were to retire at 40, would have 18 or 19 years' service.  That category will not be denied anything.  Members retiring before 40 years of age with ten or 11 years' service, which is substantial service, will be denied what I think they would not unreasonably look upon as their right to parity of pension.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad that widows will be given parity irrespective of the length of service of their husbands. Of course, they were the most <Col N="1463" /> vulnerable group of all.  I am disappointed, and this party are disappointed, that widows and, indeed, Members of whom there are now very few left who did not qualify for pension, even though in some cases they had 20 or 25 years' service, will not get anything under the Order now being made.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister for Finance to consider even at this stage an amendment to the Order to bring in a small number of people, indeed they could be described as a rapidly declining number.  The people I am referring to are those who had given up membership of this House, or in the case of widows where their husbands had died, before 1959 but who had 20 or 25 years' service in the House.  It is not realised by people in the country, and perhaps by some Members in this House, that these people have no pensions even though they have 25 or more years' service here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there many such cases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say precisely how many there are.  I know personally of one rather sad case which I raised at the Committee of Procedure and Privileges.  At the same meeting Deputy Desmond raised another even sadder case in relation to the widow of a very long-serving Labour Deputy who has no pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>She is now gone to where pensions are not needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been better if she had had something to keep her.  I do not know the precise number of widows of Members of all sides who might be concerned in this but I doubt if there are more than a dozen.  At the outside there might be about 20 in that category and it would not cost the Exchequer a great sum of money because the widows' pensions are low in any event.  In this Order it is envisaged that many of the pensions will be only £250 per year.  If the 12 or 20 people in that category were to get that amount of money it would be something for <Col N="1464" /> them and would not cost the Exchequer more than a few thousand pounds per year.  Also, it would be a rapidly declining amount.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to look at two points.  First, could parity not be extended to all pensioners as there is only four years between the parity and the ordinary figure?  Secondly, I would ask him in the humanitarian interests of a very small number&mdash; most of them are widows but there may be a few former Members involved&mdash;to pay them pensions of some kind for the few remaining years of their lives.</P>
      <P>Nobody would object to this.  It is not the fault of the widows that their husbands died before this scheme came into effect.  If they cannot be paid contributory pensions arising out of this Order because their husbands did not make contributions, they might be paid some form of <i>ex gratia</i> payment.  It should not be done on the basis that they are appealing for it because of their total poverty.  It should be paid <i>ex gratia</i> by the Exchequer on the basis that their husbands gave long public service to the country while in the membership of one or other of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this much-needed relief with regard to pensions of retired Members of the Oireachtas and to the widows and children of Members.  Like Deputy O'Malley I am also a member of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges. I am the son of the man who occupied the seat I now have the honour to hold and for many years he campaigned for this relief, to bring a sense of justice into the matter of pensions where Deputies, Senators and their families were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy O'Malley in his welcome for this provision.  I agree also with him on the question of the stresses and hardships a Member of this House or the Seanad has to undergo in his daily life.  Deputy O'Malley rightly pointed out the stresses and strain of which we have evidence this week.  I should also like <Col N="1465" /> to underline the fact that the families of Members undergo considerable stress and strain.  Home life as it is known before a person is elected to this House or to the Seanad changes radically after election.  One's home is not one's own after becoming a public representative.  That is one reason I welcome the provision in this Order to provide for the widows and children of deceased Members.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley has rightly pointed out that most Members of this House and the Seanad suffer financial loss.  There is hardly one of us here who has not suffered financial loss by virtue of being elected a public representative. As time goes on the workload is increasing and that is bound to take its toll on Deputies and Senators. My reading of this Order is that it will not affect existing pension rights but I should like the Minister to confirm that.  Deputy O'Malley has already raised this point.  My interpretation of the Order is that this is something extra to give parity to those in receipt of pensions already.</P>
    <P>There is one frightful misconception in the public mind in relation to the position of Deputies and Senators. I wish to put on the record that the salary or payment made to Members of the Oireachtas is subject to income tax just like any other income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I come across this every day of my life.  It is a kind of joke; the attitude is, &ldquo;you are all right, you have got it tax-free&rdquo;.  We pay every penny's worth of tax like everybody else.  Our friends in the press would be doing a service to the public and to us if they underlined that fact.</P>
      <P>This Order we are discussing is somewhat of a social welfare nature. It is impossible to cater for everyone but it goes back to those who qualify as from 1960.  It could fairly be stated that this measure attempts to cover most cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has indicated clearly the attitude of this <Col N="1466" /> side of the House to this motion. However, there are one or two matters to which I wish to refer.  The first one is a small point but I wish to make certain that it is covered. I understand there is, in fact, towards the end of clause 4, in the last paragraph marked (c), a misprint.  I should like the Minister to confirm, when he is replying, that the actual Order which we are approving omits the words &ldquo;one half of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The fact that this motion proposes to introduce for former Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and for widows of former Members, subject to certain exceptions, parity, in the sense that pensions in future will be based on what would be the current rate of payment of a Member of the Dáil or the Seanad need not, I suppose, be of any great surprise to anybody, considering that parity of pension has now been applied very widely in the public service and, furthermore, the fact that, with inflation running at the rate it is, fixed pensions nowadays are, of course, meaningless.  Indeed this concept is accepted in regard to the public service and also in regard to various categories of people including social welfare classes who are dependent on the State for pensions and other incomes.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate but it is true that at the rate of inflation we are experiencing today fixed incomes or pensions are totally inadequate and unrealistic for those unfortunate enough to be tied to them.  Consequently, the fact that, subject to certain qualifications, it is proposed here to introduce parity of pension should not be any great surprise to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do, however, wish to underline a point made by Deputy O'Malley in regard to differentiations between categories of Members for the purpose of deciding whether or not parity of pension should apply.  I can understand quite well the arguments which the Minister for Finance was faced with and which he accepted in deciding on this differentiation.  It is, however, important that it should be understood, as Deputy O'Malley said, <Col N="1467" /> that there is a not insignificant contribution by every Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas to the pension fund and it is perhaps unrealistic, for the reasons outlined by Deputy O'Malley, to expect that that fund would be at all times totally solvent, independent of any contribution from the Exchequer, having regard to the very unusual nature of the recruitment, the age of recruitment and so on, to both Houses of the Oireachtas, leading probably to an actuarial nightmare from the point of view of any ordinary pension fund.</P>
    <P>The fact that the fund is not always solvent is not a reflection of the fact that the contributions are inadequate. It is rather a reflection of the very peculiar nature of the recruitment to the House of the Oireachtas.  The pension contribution is, I believe, quite substantial.  Therefore, the Minister should not be unduly swayed, though of course he has to have regard to it, by the argument that to grant parity of pension to all former Members and not to differentiate between one and another would entail a further degree of contribution from the Exchequer.  It is an argument that has some force but I do not think it has overwhelming force and like Deputy O'Malley I would tell the Minister that there are a number of people who object in principle to this differentiation and segregation between Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The proposal in clause 3&mdash;it is difficult to quote from this but it is a paragraph which begins with the number 16 because it is to be inserted in the regulations under that heading &mdash;which provides that parity would be applied on the 1st October, 1973, and thereafter on the date specified for payment of increases in pensions awarded under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1963, in regulations made under section 29 of the pensions (Increase) Act, 1964, seems reasonable because the Minister in his speech seemed to indicate that what all that amounts to is that the 1st October in any year is the date that has been fixed for the application of <Col N="1468" /> increases in pensions for the public service generally.  On that assumption it seems to me that that clause is satisfactory and reasonable.</P>
    <P>I want to urge very strongly on the Minister the case made by Deputy O'Malley and by Deputy Esmonde in regard to former Members.  There is a case to be made in regard to people with long service when there was no pension scheme but that is not the case I want to make now. I particularly want to make a case on behalf of the widows of former Members.  It may be true to say that since there was no pension scheme in operation there was no contribution from Members but this is not a new situation.  In the civil service where there was no contributory pension scheme in relation to widows for many years an <i>ex gratia</i> pension was granted to the widows of civil servants in that position and it seems to me that there is an exact parallel with the situation we are describing here. There can only be a small number of widows involved in this and of necessity that number must be diminishing. There is, I believe, a very strong, indeed overwhelming, case for the grant of <i>ex gratia</i> pensions to the widows of former Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who did not qualify for pension.  If it could be done in the case of the civil service I see no good reason why it should not be done in the case of widows of former Members of the Oireachtas. I repeat that the number involved must, of necessity, be small and must, of necessity, be diminishing.  I know of some cases where this could be of very great importance, where some people are in extreme poverty.  There may be other cases where this would apply where it is not greatly needed but that would not deter me.  It seems to me that having regard to the situation which was applied in the case of civil service widows there is an unanswerable case for at least similar treatment in the case of widows of former Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I urge very strongly on the Minister that provision should be made for such people.  I can see, <Col N="1469" /> even if the Minister is disposed to say yes to that, he may have some technical difficulties in dealing with it but I want to assure him, as far as this side of the House is concerned, any steps or any co-operation that is necessary to overcome those technical difficulties would be immediately forthcoming if we can accept the proposition that this should be done now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to urge the Minister not to keep strictly to what may be regarded as a civil service scheme or a pension scheme for any of the public services because we must remember that this is a contributory scheme and the rates of contribution are quite substantial, as Deputy O'Malley said.  It is not fair, as far as Members of this House are concerned, or widows of Members are concerned, to try to make a scheme exactly the same as a civil service scheme.  We should remember, on retirement or death, in the case of a public servant, not alone is there a pension scheme, which is adjusted in accordance with the increases in salaries current in the civil service from time to time, but there is also a very large gratuity payable on retirement or death.  This gratuity is not available to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas nor to widows of such Members.</P>
      <P>The arguments put forward by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Colley in favour of those who will not be on a graduated pension are very cogent. This also refers to their widows.  I do not know if Deputy O'Malley is correct when he says that widows will have this additional pension as salaries increase.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.  My main purpose in speaking is to point out to him that he has room to do what has been suggested from this side of the House and he can provide a slightly better scheme in view of the fact that lump sum gratuities, which in the public service amount to 1½ years salary, are not payable to either Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or their widows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to say I can understand the sympathy which Members of the House have expressed for former Members who may be in financial difficulties and their widows and children.  There is natural anxiety to meet these problems by a scheme which would take account of current difficulties and past service of former Members of the Dáil and Seanad.  At the same time, we must realise that here we are doling out public money.  We are not doling out money which was contributed by Members of the House to the pension fund.</P>
      <P>At present the pension fund is insolvent and is dependent on the Exchequer for subvention which at present runs at the rate of £82,000 per annum.  In consequence of this Order and the improvement in the pension scheme it will need a greater subvention so directly we are dealing with the taxpayers' money.  In relation to the argument that Members contribute to this scheme it is true they do but again account must be taken of the fact that the allowances paid to Members of the Dáil and Seanad specifically take account of the contribution which is made towards the pension fund.  If contributions were not paid towards the pension fund allowances to TDs and Senators would be 6 per cent less than they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That was said to the civil service for years and they never believed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Devlin review body said they took account of the fact that six per cent of the allowance had to allocated to the pension fund. If there was to be an increase in the contributions paid by Members to the pension fund no doubt a claim would be made that the allowance would be correspondingly increased by the same amount.  That would mean that the taxpayer would have to pay the money. We must, therefore, ensure that any improvement in the scheme is not such as to generate envy, annoyance or frustration on the part of the general body of taxpayers and in particular on the part of any other pensioners who may feel that their particular difficulties <Col N="1471" /> have not been as generously treated as the difficulties of the former Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or their relations.</P>
      <P>There has been criticism of the fact that the order proposes to give the concession of parity&mdash;this is a concession of parity&mdash;only to people who have had at least 12 years' service in the House or are 55 years of age or are physically unable to pursue a livelihood. It is important that Members of the House should realise that the Irish pension scheme is by European standards exceedingly generous.  I would like to give Members the actual position which exists in a number of comparable European countries and some of our partners in the EEC.</P>
      <P>In Austria the minimum service required for entitlement to pension is ten years and then the pension is not payable until the former member is 55 years of age.  In Belgium it is eight years.  Again the pension is not payable until a former member is 55 years of age.  In Denmark it is eight years but it is not payable until the former member is 67 years of age, subject, however, to a right to have it paid when a former member is 60 years of age if requested, and under 60 subject to a means test.  In Germany it is not payable until a member has eight years service and is 55 years of age but if a member has 12 years' service it can be paid at 50 years of age and if he has had 16 years' service it is paid at 55 years of age.</P>
      <P>In Italy it is payable after five years when the former member is 60 years of age.  That 60 years may be reduced to below 50 years subject to a member having paid at least 20 years' contributions towards the pension scheme. In Norway the member must have service in at least three parliaments and in each of them for a period of at least six months.  It is not paid then to a former member until he is 65 years of age and then he must not be fully employed in the State or municipal service.  In Luxembourg the period of qualification is five years but the pension is not paid until the member is 65 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be seen that the Irish scheme is particularly generous in that a <Col N="1472" /> Member may quit this House, voluntarily, or involuntarily, after eight years' service and receive the pension for the remainder of his life.  There are cases of Members of this House who quit the House in their thirties who are now in receipt of a pension to the end of their days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have any idea of how the contributions in the other countries compare with what we are doing in the Irish Parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the specific figures here but most of them, if not all, have a contributory scheme. I think it is correct that we should take into account the age of former Members of the House when we are dealing with public moneys.  If a former Member of the House quits the House in his 30s or 40s that person has a reasonable prospect of earning a livelihood elsewhere.  The probability is that most Members of the House have other means or access to other means by virtue of their skills, business connections, employment before they become Members and employment which, except for officeholders, continues in most cases while people are Members.  So, we are dealing with a class of people who are not comparable with public servants who have not got the opportunity to engage in other employments.  They are full-time civil servants and a full-time civil servant has not any other means and by reason of the fact that he is a civil servant he has not got the same contacts to engage in other livelihoods.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made by a number of people that we should not try to tie the Civil Service scheme to Members of the Dáil and Seanad. Maybe it is as well that we do not because, if we did, the qualifying age would be 60 years and we would not have that very considerable benefit which people can get before they become 60 years of age.  In the Army former members have to have at least 21 years' service and in the Garda there is no question of any pension being payable unless a former member is at least 50 years of age.</P>

      <P>There is no obligation on anybody in either House to stay here, none whatever.  There is no obligation to come, no obligation to stay.  It is only an ass who becomes a Member of either House for the money that is in it and people do not do that.  I will accept that there could be cases where people lose out and I suppose a large number of Members would be better off if they were devoting all their time, skill and talent to the pursuit of profit elsewhere.  It must be remembered that we make our choice voluntarily.  We can always refuse to stand and in that situation one must not be over-troubled by the anxieties which some people have mentioned.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, through various contacts which obviously Members of this House have with former Members and their families we have no information at present of distress of the kind that a number of people here illustrated as possibly existing and there is an <i>ex gratia</i> scheme operative and if cases are brought to notice of former Members of the House who do not qualify under the existing pension schemes operating since 1960 onwards, then relief can be given in such cases and the usual practice is that where such cases are identified a committee of the House considers the matter and invariably the necessary assistance is given.</P>

I myself have a case in his Department on behalf of a widow of a former Member for the last three <Col N="1474" /> months and I cannot get a decision out of them.  The clerk of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has rung the Department of the Public Service as late as yesterday trying to get them to decide something that has been before them for three months.

That case is being considered at the moment. There are certain procedures which have to be gone through.  There are certain consultations which have to take place.  These are being done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait now.  I have said that cases described here were not known and they are not known and I was saying when the Deputy interrupted me that where such cases come to light they are attended to. One would think from the remarks passed here that there was a large number of people concerned.  There certainly is not.  An odd case is thrown up and when it is thrown up it is attended to and I think that is the proper way to do it.  I do not think any hard case which occasionally arises would warrant the extention of complete parity of pension to all former Members of the House irrespective of their age and their capacity to earn other livelihoods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of another country&mdash;I know this in my personal capacity. I am not quite certain of all the details so I do not want to name the country in question; it is a European country&mdash;where they have not a pension scheme of the nature we have here or of the nature that I have described but, instead of a pension, they award a substantial part of the membership allowance to a former Member for a year after the person <Col N="1475" /> terminates membership and I think again in the second year after termination of membership a further sum is granted.  The principle which guides the approach in that country is that a person should receive some cushioning so that the fall from Parliamen-tary office can be softened as he goes into &ldquo;civvy street&rdquo; and that he will be provided with some funds while he adjusts himself to earn his livelihood elsewhere.  I have given these cases so that people would see that the Irish scheme is generous and that people would realise that any further improvements in the scheme will have to be borne entirely by the Irish tax-payer and in the light of that we must be careful about the manner in which we extend it.  If there are hardship cases the best way of dealing with them is on the basis of the merits of each particular case and not on the basis of widening the scheme to make it so generous that people who are not in need will get funds from the public purse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The other question is: does the Minister accept that there is a strong case&mdash;I am speaking now only of widows of former Members who are not entitled to a pension&mdash; that there is a strong case for treating them in the same kind of way as the widows of civil servants who are not entitled to a pension were treated, in other words, on an <i>ex gratia basis</i>?  I am only speaking of that category, which must be small in number and getting smaller.  Does the Minister accept the case for them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them may have skills of their own and may be engaged in projects of their own but I think the way we deal with such cases where hardship is identified and payment is made is the appropriate way rather than handing out money directly from the public purse because our contributions are not sufficient to meet the considerable payments. Might I add that it would appear from the pattern of membership in this House over the last decade or so that there is now a quicker turn-over of membership than in the earlier days of the State.  That is my own personal impression; I have not had statistical analysis done.  But if that is so we could arrive at a position in which the burden which the State would have to carry would be very much greater than it is at present. Therefore we must be careful about the way in which we dole out public money.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last night I was dealing with the control of pollution.</P>
      <P>Another area where an initiative has been taken relates to what is described as the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle. By this is meant that the person or interest which is responsible for activity causing pollution must accept liability for the cost of undoing the damage, or the cost of measures, if necessary to prevent damage.  I think it will be agreed that the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle is basically sound, though its application has to be tailored to some extent to national circumstances and take account of other general objectives, for example, in relation to regional policy.</P>
      <P>As a first step in promoting the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; concept throughout the Community, a draft recommendation has been prepared by the Commission and is at present under examination. The proposal has implication for a number of Departments other than mine and is being examined in that broad context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true of environmental proposals generally that they often affect a number of Departments and have implications for development as well as conservation programmes.  There is need therefore for effective liaison between Departments in dealing with these matters.  This kind of liaison <Col N="1478" /> was always there but I have been anxious to make it more effective and the Government have now approved of a more formalised liaison arrangement in relation to environmental matters.  I think this will make for better co-ordination and a more effective handling of environmental business.</P>
    <P>In my Estimates speech last year I indicated that the fire service was under review by a working party representative of the Departments mainly concerned, of the city and county managers, of the professional bodies and trade unions.  I understand that the work on the review is now well advanced and that it is hoped to finalise the review within the next few months.  The working party submitted an interim report on fire prevention.  The recommendations in the interim report were conveyed to the local authorities by my Department with a request that arrangements be made to act on them as quickly as possible.  An important recommendation was that local publicity campaigns should be put on by the local authorities, involving in particular seminars for management in places of public resort, and also for other such groups.</P>
    <P>Despite their staff problems, a number of local authorities have responded to this recommendation and have put on very successful seminars aimed at industrial and hotel management. My Department, through the Fire Protection Association of Ireland, assisted with the provision of specialist fire prevention films, posters and leaflets.  The fire insurance companies also made valuable contributions to the success of the seminars through the provision of guest speakers.  I have no doubt that the same assistance will be fully available to assist other local authorities mount such seminars, and I am urging them to do so.  These local seminars can be very valuable in getting across to those in key positions the need and duty to provide adequate fire safety protection for the members of the public and the staff in their care.</P>
    <P>Last year I also referred to the recommendations which my Department made to local authorities in the <Col N="1479" /> matter of strengthening their capacity to engage in fire prevention work by appointing, within the existing structure of the service, additional staff to do fire prevention work, and by availing of the special course in fire prevention which was put on at the Regional Technical College, in Galway. Twenty fire service personnel, mainly at Second Officer level, undertook the 20-week course, the first of its kind in this country.  The course ended in March last.  With proper local guidance, these men can enable their local authorities to make a major impact on local fire prevention problems, and I have urged the local authorities to see to it that the best use is made of these men.  These staffing and training arrangements in fire prevention promoted by my Department represent an <i>ad hoc</i> measure to enable local authorities to engage more extensively in fire prevention work in as short a time as possible.  The need for additional measures in regard to fire prevention and other aspects of the fire service will be considered in due course in the light of the working party's findings and recommendations.</P>
    <P>While the importance of fire prevention is nowadays receiving greater emphasis than hitherto, the traditional role of the service in fire fighting and rescue work goes on.  Apart from fire situations, firemen are expected to deal with a variety of emergencies.  I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to commend the excellent work being done, day and night, often in hazardous circumstances, by the men of the whole-time and retained brigades.  I would like in particular to pay tribute to the outstanding work of the fire service, including the fire brigade ambulance service, in helping to deal with the terrible consequences of the recent car bombs. In such circumstances we can readily appreciate the value to the community of a service which we are inclined, perhaps, to take too much for granted under ordinary circumstances.</P>
    <P>The programme for the rehabilitation of itinerants was recently reviewed by the Government.  While <Col N="1480" /> some 800 families have been accommodated on camping sites or in houses and their children are attending school regularly, the fact remains that many other families wishing to settle have not been provided with the opportunity of doing so.  While there is broad public acceptance of the need for and the possibility of improving the lot of itinerants, all too often this general acceptance breaks down and many local authority proposals to provide accommodation for itinerant families in an area have had to be abandoned due to opposition from the settled community.  It is obvious that further worthwhile progress cannot be made unless this aspect of the problem is tackled.  I believe that voluntary effort has a vital part to play in supporting the local authority efforts and in overcoming local obstacles.  I am satisfied that an important contribution in this regard is being made by voluntary groups in many areas and in particular by their co-ordinating body, the National Council for Travelling People.</P>
    <P>Mr. Victor Bewley, Vice-Chairman of the National Council, who has been deeply involved in itinerant settlement for a number of years was an obvious choice when I decided to make an appointment of adviser to me on the itinerant settlement programme.  He will be engaged by the National Council to promote and co-ordinate the programme with particular reference to certain aspects, for example to liaise with councillors, managers and local committees in promoting schemes and in overcoming local opposition.  I have asked all local authorities to afford Mr. Bewley their full support and co-operation and to assist him in every way possible in carrying out his duties.  The co-operation of the public is an essential element in the success of his work.  I would therefore appeal to the public in the interests both of the settled community and of the itinerant families to look at the problem in human terms, in terms of the difficulty of living on the roadside while keeping reasonable standards of hygiene and maintaining social responsibilities but, more especially, in terms of the young children who are <Col N="1481" /> rejected by society wherever a project to accommodate them and give them an opportunity of being educated is opposed.</P>
    <P>During the year 1973-74, An Foras Forbartha continued their valuable research in the fields of planning, construction, roads and water resources. Generally the work of An Foras is published in reports and some specific activities of An Foras are dealt with elsewhere in my speech.  However, to give some overall picture of the activities of An Foras during the year, I shall mention a few of the more important things they did.</P>
    <P>These activities included chemical and biological sampling of rivers and lakes; construction management training; the national housing condition survey; the compilation of the national building product file; and work on the national heritage inventory. Research was also continued on aspects of the environment including an ecological management project, while the Irish biological centre operated by An Foras continued to record the distribution of Irish fauna.  The wide range of interest of An Foras research can be seen from the varied activities mentioned.  Other activities were the operation of an effluent standard assessment system.  This was established to monitor grant-aided industry at the request of the Industrial Development Authority and in conjunction with the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards.  Also in operation is the vehicle testing programme under which 1,800 cars were tested for defects and the results analysed and submitted to me.  An Foras are now assembling facilities to test heavy goods vehicles.</P>
    <P>Among the more important reports published by An Foras were two reports on the question of office location which drew attention to the rapid expansion of office employment in Ireland and showed the extent to which concentration in Dublin is a major obstacle to regional growth. The amount of grant-in-aid being provided under subhead I to An Foras this year is £296,000.  This is exclusive of the grant it receives from the Road Fund as the national centre for road research.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> It is a policy aim of the Government that local government be truly democratic and relevant to the needs of the people.  This has, of course, implications also in relation to the organisational and financial framework of local government both centrally and locally and in relation to the internal efficiency of the organisations.</P>
    <P>The sum of £1,632,000 in subhead A is the amount necessary to cover in respect of the period up to the 31st December next, the salaries of the staff needed to give effect to the Government's policies in such priority areas as housing, roads, environmental services, planning and EEC involvement. A detailed study of the work and organisation of the Department is now at a fairly-advanced stage, and the report of the Task Force which is making a study will include recomdations on the actual steps necessary to develop or instal the four staff units of planning, finance, organisation and personnel&mdash;as recommended by the Public Services Review Group&mdash;and on any other changes which are considered desirable in the Department's organisation and working arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the total cost of local government will be about £300 million this years.  With annual expenditure so large, it is essential that the best possible use be made of modern management techniques and aids.  A number of local authorities are now using computers in their day-to-day operations.  A small number have, in fact, installed their own computers and others are obtaining computer services from special bureaux.  The potential for extension of computer use in local government is very great and I am satisfied that planned action must be taken to develop this potential to the full.  To avoid the dissipation of scarce resources of manpower and finance, the overall approach to this problem must be a co-ordinated one.  Much more is at stake in this than the mere speeding up of office routines; the computer can in time become a powerful tool in helping to raise the whole level of effectiveness in local government. Developments in this respect will not <Col N="1483" /> take place overnight but we must plan for them now.</P>
    <P>Last year, a new Computer Services Section was established in my Department. This Section will work in full co-operation with local authorities and will have the guidance of a management committee comprised mainly of local authorities and of the Department. A number of specialist staff have been recruited and are now working on specific computer projects in consultation with local authorities.</P>
    <P>The principle of public accountability is safeguarded by the audit service of the Department which audits the accounts of all local authorities and various other local bodies, including the health boards.  This service is estimated to cost approximately £98,000 in nine months to the 31st December, 1974 including salaries and travelling expenses.  Fee charges to the bodies audited are expected to bring in £40,000 against this expenditure.</P>
    <P>The cost of goods purchased over the past year by local authorities including the health boards is estimated at about £7 million.  Notwithstanding scarcities of some commodities, official contractors have in the main been able to maintain supplies throughout the year and to provide a satisfactory service.  Steps are currently being taken to improve the terms on which goods may be supplied in the future.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer and Local Financial Year Act, 1974 provides for the change-over of all local accounts to a calendar year basis commencing on 1st January, 1975.  This involved, among other things, a number of consequential adaptations of statutes and statutory instruments governing the services provided by this Department, and, more particularly the striking of local rates for the nine months April to December, 1974.  An informative leaflet has been issued to all ratepayers explaining the changeover.</P>
    <P>During the course of my speech on last year's Estimate, I said that the most significant development in the sphere of local authority finance was the Government's decision to remove <Col N="1484" /> from local to central taxation that part of the cost of health services and local authority housing provided for letting which heretofore had fallen on the rates.  Deputies will recall that, in 1973-74 the rates in the £ required to be struck for these services were only 75 per cent of the corresponding rates in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>On the 18th February last, I notified all local authorities of the Government's decision on the completion of the phasing out of the relevant health and housing changes.  The decision taken was that, for the nine-month &ldquo;financial year&rdquo; April to December, 1974, the rates in the £ required to be struck for these services were to be 37 per cent of what they were in 1972-73; in 1975, the rates in the £ will be 25 per cent of what they were in 1972-73, and in 1976, 12 per cent of the 1972-73 levels.  From 1st January, 1977 onwards, no contribution from the rates will be required for these two services.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the extent of the benefit accruing to ratepayers from this decision, I should point out that, in 1972-73, the total contribution from rates towards the cost of health services and local authority housing provided for letting was £43.2 million, representing approximately 44 per cent of the total rate levy.  In that year, the rate in the £ for health services alone ranged from £1.59 in the £ in the case of Meath County Council to £3.19 in the £ in the case of Mayo County Council&mdash; the average being £2.48 in the £ for the country as a whole.  In the period from April to December 1974, the total contribution required from rates for the two services will be reduced from the £43.2 million I have mentioned to an estimated £16.2 million. In 1975, it will be cut further to £10.8 million and in 1976 to £5.4 million. If the Government had not made the decisions relating to the rates contributions for these services, ratepayers would be paying £1.70 in the £ extra, an average, in April-December, 1974.</P>
    <P>Apart from removing the abovementioned burdens from ratepayers, the Government are also considering the general concept of relating local <Col N="1485" /> taxation to the ability of persons to pay.  Some work in this has already been carried out in my Department, and I have asked the Economic and Social Research Institute to supplement this work by undertaking a study of various aspects of the problem.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of ability to pay, I would like to make a reference to the rates waiver schemes which are operated by some local authorities. Under these schemes, local authorities can waive all or part of the rates in the case of persons who may be unable to pay them.  Fifty-four local authorities operated these schemes in 1972-73 when over 21,400 persons were afforded relief from the rates. Final figures for 1973-74 are not available but the indications are that an even greater number of persons were granted relief during that year.  I would like to appeal once again to those local authorities which do not at present operate rates waiver schemes to consider the desirability of doing so in the future.  I would also like to appeal to those local authorities which do operate schemes to adopt a compassionate and flexible approach in the granting of relief under the terms of their schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the members of Dublin City and Bray Urban Councils had been removed from office by the previous Government.  I restored local democracy in these areas and followed this up with arrangements for local elections which were held this year for the first time since 1967.</P>
    <P>This year's elections differed in several important respects from previous local elections.  For the first time, 18-year-olds had the right to vote at local elections.  Many of the former restrictions on eligibility for membership of local authorities were removed.  For the first time nomination was open to 18-year-olds, and to a wide range of categories of persons previously excluded.  Greater safeguards for the secrecy of the ballot were introduced and the property vote at local elections was abolished.  Local electoral areas were revised to bring about greater equality of representation on local councils.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> Postal voting facilities were extended, for the first time, to voters generally.  These arrangements enabled a voter to apply to vote by post at local elections if he was unable, or was likely to be unable, to vote in person at his appointed polling station by reason of the circumstances of his employment, absence from the address where he is registered, illness or physical disability, or employment by the returning officer in connection with the election.  The question of whether similar facilities should be provided at Dáil and Presidential elections and referenda is now being considered in the light of experience at the local elections.  An up-to-date statutory procedure whereby a local election can be questioned by petition to the Circuit Court has been provided in replacement of provsions found to be unconstitutional 14 years ago.</P>
    <P>I regard all these measures as valuable inputs of the democratic process into the local government system and as a further step in this process of improvement I issued a discussion document to local authorities on the subject of local government re-organisation.  I might say that since taking office I have made it clear that I did not accept the proposals set out in the previous Government's White Paper on local government re-organisation&mdash;particularly the proposals to abolish local authorities and that I would be putting forward my own proposals in this regard.  The main purpose of the document was to provoke a debate on the matter and to say firmly that I do not propose to abolish elected local authorities.  I put forward, for the purposes of discussion, certain proposals which I felt would help the many small local authorities to alleviate some of the problems which are created by their limited resources.  I am at present considering the views put forward by local authorities with the possibility of further consulting them about specific aspects of the proposals before arriving at final conclusions in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just heard <Col N="1487" /> a very long and interesting speech from the Minister.  Like his housing policy it came in fits and starts in that it came in three separate sections. There is an old saying that attack is the best form of defence and the Minister's remarks on housing coincide with that old saying.  At a time when there is serious concern in the building industry as a whole, especially in the section of the industry dealing with housing, at a time when so many men have been laid off, at a time when a number of building firms are finding themselves in serious financial difficulties, the Minister has presented us with a very rosy picture.</P>
      <P>Slightly less than one-third of his speech was devoted to housing.  He mentioned the Coalition Government's commitment to the erection of 25,000 houses and, quite rightly, he took considerable pride in the fact that 25,000 houses were erected.  He knows as well as I do that, unless there had been forward planning, unless the sites had been available, unless the plans had been drawn up and unless tenders had been submitted, his target of 25,000 houses could not and would not have been achieved.</P>
      <P>He gave a considerable number of selective statistics.  He said:</P>
      <P>One of our main commitments when we took up government last year was to increase housing output to 25,000 dwellings a year, compared to an average of 15,600 dwellings a year over the previous five years.</P>
      <P>That is a nice example of selective statistics.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the output of dwellings in the year before he took up office was much more than 15,600.  It was 21,600 odd.  I suppose that, in these times when there is very little comfort for the Government, it is a good thing that at least one commitment they made was met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also nicely camouflaged in the Minister's speech is the record that prior to his coming into office a very <Col N="1488" /> high number of grants had been applied for because, as he said, people were interested in getting grants allocated before the certificate of a reasonable cost scheme came into operation. As the Minister knows, the building industry is very sensitive.  It is responsible for a large percentage of the jobs in the country in that the services associated with it employ a very large number of people.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's assurance, in today's <i>Irish Times</i> under the heading &ldquo;Still danger of lay-off of building workers&rdquo;, there is the following statement:</P>
    <P>There is still danger that thousands of building workers will be laid-off, in spite of an assurance by the Minister for Local Government, Mr. Tully, to a trade union deputation on Tuesday that enough money would be available to meet the Government's housing target this year.</P>
    <P>I do not have the statistics the Minister has available to him but in the last few weeks and months I have heard of the fears of responsible employers and workers.  I begin to wonder if the Minister is not in the position where he has to come into this House and put on a show.  I do not understand very much about the game of cricket&mdash;it is not played in my area &mdash;but I know there is a player who is called &ldquo;a stonewaller&rdquo;.  He is the man who goes in when things are bad, he waits at the wicket and takes everything that is put to him.  In this respect the Minister has done a good job for the Coalition.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy and in my professional capacity I have a considerable amount to do with housing.  In common with other Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, I have the experience of people coming to me and telling me it is impossible to get loans, that there is no point even in sending in applications. I know of men earning between £2,750 and £3,000 who want to build houses but they cannot get finance.  I would ask the Minister to fulfil the promise he gave to the Federation and the delegation he met last Tuesday to <Col N="1489" /> make more money available.  There are many hundreds of people throughout the country who are outside the limit laid down by the Housing Acts for SDA loans and who are not eligible for local authority housing.  These people are not able to get the necessary finance and they are forced to wait in flats that are in poor condition and have not the necessary facilities.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister said he was glad to record that the interim target of 6,500 local authority houses set for 1973-74 had been achieved. This is an indication of the forward planning put into housing by the former Fianna Fáil Government and one would expect to see somewhere in the statement an acknowledgement of that fact.  The building industry is a very sensitive one and it needs gentle handling. It is rather like a marathon runner; sprints are bad for it.  The graph was going upwards but now I fear it is on the decline.  Even though I have not access to the statistics available to the Minister, common sense, the reading of newspapers and conversations I have had with builders have led me to believe that all is not as well as the Minister would like us to believe.  I do not like to use the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; because that sounds rather sensational.</P>
    <P>Quite rightly the Minister has referred to the quality of local authority housing.  I must be honest and say I have not seen any great difference in the design of local authority housing since the Coalition came into office.  As a professional engineer I do not agree with some of the designs that have been given to local authorities in recent times.</P>
    <P>In another capacity I pointed out it was foolish to omit from local authority housing some form of solid fuel heating.  I do not know if it is as a result of the fuel crisis or because he feels it is needed in local authority housing, but I am glad to see the Minister is insisting that all local authority houses should have at least one chimney.</P>
    <P>I fail to see a reason for the implication in the speech that a Fianna Fáil Cabinet were responsible for the lower standards.  If the standards have declined it is because those who were <Col N="1490" /> paid to supervise the jobs must not have carried out their work.  It is they who should be held accountable. Most large schemes are supervised either by a resident engineer or a clerk of works and it is up to this person and to the architect or the consulting engineer to see that the work is carried out to the standards laid down in the specifications.  I refuse to accept that any Government would condone a very low standard.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably aware that there is great anxiety among people in a number of estates where some form of central heating is the only means of heating.  In Ballina some people who have only been in occupation of their houses a short time find they have to borrow money to pay their central heating bills.  I have raised this matter with the local authority but the buck seems to be passed from Billy to Jack.  I will be asking the Minister at a later date for his personal intervention.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the urgent task of restoring central Dublin which will be a costly job.  Urban renewal in various American cities has been the subject of some television programmes. It would appear that we will now have to face the same problems at the same cost.  The Minister said that a major step forward was taken by Dublin City Commissioners when they adopted the Central City Housing Development Programme. He could have given some little credit to the former Minister for Local Government who initiated that programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in his assumption that Deputies will share in his special interest in the provision of suitable housing for aged and disabled persons.  This is an aspect of our housing programme which was, to some extent, neglected in the past except in certain local authority areas. I would like the Minister to ensure that where houses are built for the aged and disabled they are not then allocated to young married people as happened in certain local authority areas.  Young married people in the natural course of things will have families and the families will become too big for the houses.  A need is <Col N="1491" /> created then for more houses.  At the same time the houses which were originally built for the aged are not available for them.  I understand a scheme has been submitted from Ballina Urban District Council.  At least the preliminary drawings were ready some time ago.  If the scheme has been submitted I would be glad if the Minister would sanction it.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Government's pride in the fact that 25,000 houses were built.  That pride, however, must be somewhat lessened by the fact that, even according to the Minister's own statistics, 10,000 odd grants were allocated in the quarter ended 31st March, 1973.  He must admit this was a fair start to his 25,000 houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The availability of the back-up facility, arranged with the banks, enabled the societies to embark immediately on an extended programme of forward approvals and had the effect of relieving a backlog of unsold houses which some builders in the Dublin area had on their hands.</P>
    <P>It may have enabled the societies to embark immediately on an extended programme of forward approvals but it does not necessarily mean that the loans that were approved have yet been paid.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I can only reiterate here what I have said before&mdash;that arrangements will be made if necessary to provide additional finance.</P>
    <P>I can only reiterate what I have said already&mdash;that the Minister should now, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, because of the specified difficulties of which I know the Minister is aware&mdash;make the additional finance available.  I have personal knowledge of houses in good areas in Dublin which have been vacant for nine months and which cannot be let or sold.  Two years ago there would have been a queue waiting to buy those houses.  That to me, if not to the Minister, is an indication that things are not as rosy in the <Col N="1492" /> garden as he would lead us to believe. I know of a major building company who two years ago were in the happy position of being able to pick and choose their clients and who had on their books some 300 names of people who were looking for houses over and above the number they were able to provide at that time.  They now have 40 odd houses on hand.  They wrote to those 300 people to let them know the houses were available and they had one reply out of 300.  That is for a small scheme of 40 houses.  If one accepts that the average price of these houses is £6,000 one can see the amount of money tied up in this small scheme by this particular firm is in the region of £250,000 and it gives an indication of the seriousness in which a number of building firms find themselves.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is having consultation with the Construction Industry Federation in relation to a new house purchase guarantee which he hopes to have introduced next year.  In the meantime, if he can find anybody with the money to purchase a house, he should stress the necessity for purchasers to go to solicitors to get proper contracts drawn up.  Each purchaser would then know exactly what he is getting for his money and when he can get it.  I am glad to see the Minister is continuing the development of the co-operative movement in housing which was pioneered by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>One of the areas in housing which needs urgent re-appraisal is the reconstruction section.  At the moment the grants allocated are not satisfactory. They need to be updated considerably and they also need to be segregated. The grants for additions should be paid separately from those that are paid for alterations and improvements. I know many people who got reconstruction grants three or four years ago when they were not able to afford to add additional rooms, which they now find are necessary.  They are not entitled to get the grants because a period of five years has not clapsed.</P>
    <P>People are spending too much money on old houses which will always be old no matter how much <Col N="1493" /> money is spent on them.  The Minister should instruct his inspectors, where they feel it is not economic to reconstruct, to insist on the applicant building a new house.  Quite a number of people build new houses but many of them just do the reconstruction work.  I have seen estimates between £2,500 and £3,000 for reconstruction work, without water and sewerage. There was an estimate of £2,000 for a three-roomed house, a kitchen and two rooms, without water and sewerage, which was a false economy.</P>
    <P>The large increase in the reconstruction grants is a reflection on the very high cost of new houses.  The price of materials has escalated enormously in the last one-and-a-half years.  Some of the local authorities, when adopting the loans scheme in relation to reconstruction grants insist on waiting for an estimate from the Department of Local Government before they even make an inspection. When a person needs to reconstruct his house, if he has to get extra accommodation, this means a two-months delay before he gets planning permission.  Reconstruction inspections are not carried out unless certificates of planning approval accompany the application forms.  That person has to wait approximately five weeks for an inspector from the housing section, a further two or three weeks before the particular estimate arrives and then a further six or seven weeks before the country council give approval for the loan. That means a delay of between six and nine months before approval of the loan is granted.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider having inspections carried out by the Department's staff prior to receipt of the certificate of planning permission from the local authority. Sanction for the grant is not given until the certificate of approval from the local authority is submitted.  This would cut down a delay of approximately six weeks in that case and would be of benefit to a number of people all over the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he is arranging to pay reconstruction grants where solid fuel fireplaces or appliances are <Col N="1494" /> installed in centrally-heated houses even though a statutory minimum period has not elapsed since a previous housing grant was paid.  Will this apply to local authority houses?  Will he pay a grant to a local authority to instal solid fuel fireplaces?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  There is a slight contradiction in that the Minister says it is essential that people engaged in the construction industry should keep abreast of new techniques and developments while earlier in his speech he mildly criticised the use of new techniques by the previous Government. I suppose that where new techniques are used there is always the danger that there will be some flaws if the techniques have not been fully developed.</P>
      <P>The Minister appears to feel quite strongly about what he considers adverse publicity and goes as far as to say that people misinterpret statistics connected with housing.  The Minister must admit that there is a genuine fear among persons in the industry that things are not as rosy as the Minister would seem to think. The Minister must be aware of the remarks of builders and of the trade unions expressing their fears.  These are responsible men.  Quite a number of builders have a genuine fear that unless something drastic is done things will reach crisis proportions.  This is common knowledge.  There is grave concern among builders' providers that the stocks which they have on hands cannot be sold.  A member of a responsible trade union has said that whereas stocks in builders' providers at this time should be almost minimal, the stocks that they have in fact will lead to redundancies in their staffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot overemphasise the importance, <Col N="1495" /> as far as I am concerned and I am sure as far as the Minister is concerned, of immediate intervention so that loans can be made available to persons who are looking for them. Perhaps the Minister would consider increasing the SDA loan ceiling.  If this were done to a realistic figure a number of the houses that are on hands and that cannot be sold could be bought by those who are now frantically running from building society to building society and insurance company to insurance company seeking the necessary finance to purchase houses.  The unfortunate part is that some of them had paid deposits on houses in the belief that they would be able to get the necessary finance. They may be in danger of losing their deposits.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to talk about the introduction of the block grant system for roads other than national roads and stated that it is an important step in the devolution to local authorities of responsibility for determining their own priorities in planning and expenditure in relation to local needs.  I agree with this but I would say that the local authority of which I am a member finds itself hamstrung inasmuch as there are certain circulars on their files which would indicate that there are certain areas of grey in what should be a simple black and white situation.  Last year I asked that extra money be given to Mayo County Council for a particular type of work.  I was informed at that time that the block grant system was in operation and that Mayo County Council could spend the money as it saw fit.  At the following county council meeting I asked that this be done and made certain suggestions but I was informed by the manager that because of circulars that had issued from the Department this was not possible and that only a certain percentage of the grant could be spent as we wished to have it spent.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has this year abolished the 50 per cent limit on expenditure from grant money for the cost of upkeep of main <Col N="1496" /> roads.  Mayo County Council last year gave the sum of over £50,000 from rates for the black topping of untarred roads.  Our particular problem is immense.  I shall not go into the reasons for that.  They are known to the Department.  In Mayo there are more untarred county roads than there are in the province of Leinster and the three Ulster counties taken together.  We cannot see in our lifetime an end to this situation no matter how much money we give from our funds which, because of our low valuation, are very limited.  We do not seem to be able to make any great impact in regard to the tarring of these roads.</P>
    <P>While there must be very good national primary roads, which are the lifeline of a county such as ours that is rather remote, and through which all materials have to be transported, the vast majority of our people live along untarred roads.  They maintain, quite rightly, that in 1974 they should have what they call the luxury, and what I call the normal requirement, of tarred roads.  As I said, we have done our bit.  I would ask the Minister the following question: If we want to use our total grant for black-topping can we do this?  Would he write to me and let me know if we can use the road grant exactly as we want to use it, and whether previous circulars from the Department are now superseded because of the introduction of the block grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister pays particular attention to the ever-increasing toll of road accidents.  I am glad to see that he has made a grant of £140,000 to the National Road Safety Association. However, until, so to speak, the penalty is made to fit the crime, accidents will be with us for a long, long time.  It is a frightening thought that 85 per cent of cars inspected in the Dublin area, and more than that in the rural areas, had significant safety defects.  Perhaps it would be a good idea for everyone in this House, when he gets home, to check his car to see that he is not one of this 85 per cent.  I would ask the Minister to extend on television and radio the quite good advertising that is now <Col N="1497" /> being done in the sphere of road safety and to urge on all motorists the responsibility they have to themselves and to the general public to ensure that their cars are road-worthy.</P>
    <P>I hope that when negotiations are completed on the harmonisation of transport requirements, our circumstances will be taken into account, in so far as quite a number of our roads and bridges will not be able to take some of the weights that are being urged by our EEC friends.</P>
    <P>One of the best achievements of the former Minister was the devolution of the local improvements scheme to the local authorities.  This is something that has been of particular significance to the people along the west coast.  It is something that possibly the Minister, coming from a pretty rich county, might not fully understand, although I am quite certain that Deputies from the Labour and Fine Gael Parties who represent the western seaboard in Counties Leitrim, Longford and other such areas will have impressed upon them how important it is.  I realise that out of an Estimate of £300 million there are tremendous demands on the Minister, but I would ask him to consider increasing this allocation and in particular, increasing it to counties such as mine where, in addition to the 1,600 miles of road which are under local authority control, there are literally hundreds of miles of road that are in no man's land.</P>
    <P>They are called lanes, boreens and so on.  People live along these places and have to travel on them five or six times a day.  The Local Improvements Scheme is the one hope of these people for getting reasonable roads to their houses.  There was a reduction in the year the Minister came into office.  He countered this by saying there are letters on files about this, that and the other.  However, I am asking the Minister to be very lenient with counties such as I represent, counties that have a backlog of schemes to the tune of £600,000, and to increase the allocation made.</P>
    <P>The Estimate shows that in relation to sanitary services the amount being <Col N="1498" /> spent this year is less than what was spent last year.  We in Mayo have in the Department many schemes at various stages.  I do not intend to get parochial.  What I want to deal with I shall take up with the Minister privately.  However, there does not seem to be any financial limit on the value of the schemes which can be done by the local authority without submitting a preliminary report to the Department.  I understand there is a figure of £20,000 fixed as the limit on a scheme which can be done without having to send in all the documentation to the Department.  I wonder would the Minister, in his reply, spell out exactly what he means by this statement:</P>
    <P>I decided to replace the responsibility for the detailed planning of water and sewerage schemes squarely on the shoulders of the local sanitary authorities.</P>
    <P>This has always been the system. From what I know the local authority had to decide on particular areas that needed water and sewerage extension and then submit preliminary reports. When they were approved they had then to prepare contract documents which were sent to the Department for sanction.  Do I take it that the necessity for sending these to the Department for sanction has been eliminated and that local authorities will now get their own consulting engineers to prepare their documents; that they can put them out for tender and merely inform the Department that they are carrying on a particular scheme?</P>
    <P>I should like to commend to the Minister the extension of the experiment which he initiated last year of devolving the work of group schemes to the local authorities.  This is something that should be done all over because the local authorities know the ground.  Through the elected representatives local authorities have knowledge of the area where group schemes operate and where they are needed.  I hope that the complete devolution of group schemes to local authorities will take place in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> In County Mayo, although the post is at present vacant, responsibility for group schemes is given to one engineer. We also provide well-boring and testing services but we do not provide for the design of the scheme although we do supervise.  In major schemes we have, with the permission of the Department, made sizeable contributions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made reference to the Kenny Report on land.  He mentioned the fact that the Government have grasped the nettle but it took the Government a long time to grasp it. I understand that the report was with the Government on 14th March, 1973, the day they took office.  It took them until January, 1974 to grasp the nettle. I hope that the legislation which is necessary will be prepared as a matter of urgency because land prices escalated during 1973 to a great extent.  I should also like to ask the Minister to have a look at the possibility of preparing new legislation that will make compulsory acquisition of land much simpler.  I am aware that under existing legislation compulsory acquisition takes a long time and that it can be blocked in many ways.</P>
    <P>It is essential now that land be acquired not only, as the Minister has stated, for housing, roads and sanitary services, but also for development purposes.  Local authorities are now finding themselves in the role of development associations and committees. Their function in this regard has changed drastically in the last five years.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to planning control and that he had asked local authorities to be much more flexible in their approach to planning problems. It does not appear that the Minister's advice has been accepted or appreciated because quite a number of appeals are still with them on the basis of sanitary considerations, something on which the Minister felt planning authorities should be a little more lenient.  Those of us who are members of local authorities approve of the particular line but it would appear that some local authorities do not.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the <Col N="1500" /> establishment of the new appeal board. I am aware that this legislation has not yet come before this House but, in my view, the Minister should seriously consider keeping the final adjudication to himself because too much power has already passed from this House. We do not appear to have any power over semi-State bodies.  The Minister for Health has now no power over the appointment of consultants and this is now a matter for Board na nOspidéal. I do not want to see responsibility for planning appeals passing away from the Minister for Local Government. Let him, if necessary, accept the opinion and decision of the appeals board but I would not like to see him becoming a mere stamp of the appeal board.  It is essential that the Minister hold on to the power he has in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the country is now undergoing a process of organisation and, in a somewhat roundabout way, admits that emigration has declined considerably.  I and Fianna Fáil, are glad that the Minister recognises this.  We are happy about the decentralisation of government and semi-State Bodies.  The IDA, in our part of the country at least, has helped in no uncertain manner to accelerate the process of decentralisation. This was done under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>There was genuine disappointment all over the country at the reduction by the National Coalition Government of amenity grants.  The amenity grants, more than any other grants, with the possible exception of the local improvement scheme grants where a contribution is also required, gave people who were proud of their own areas a chance to do something voluntarily in the provision of necessary amenities.  In Mayo especially, voluntary groups showed a tremendous interest in these grants.  In Ballina town the operations of local groups in co-operation with Ballina UDC have resulted in a much tidier and much nicer town.  I would ask the Minister to consider increasing these grants because they give people a chance to do something for themselves. <Col N="1501" /> They supplement voluntary effort.  They supplement the finances raised at dances and hops and by collections and raffles.  They give people a chance to beautify their areas and to show a pride in their areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the protection of the environment.  This problem is beginning to worry all of us.  We are caught in the dilemma that we are trying to entice industries into areas and, at the same time, we are trying to protect the environment. The problem basically is an educational one.  I suggest that the protection of the environment should be the responsibility of a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary.  At the moment many Departments are responsible for the protection of the environment. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Local Government have a part to play.  If the Bill which is being prepared is to have any real teeth, it should place the responsibility for this problem firmly on somebody's shoulders.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest causes of pollution is a fault in the 1963 Planning Act which allows agricultural buildings to be erected without planning permission.  I agree that there is control now in that grants will not be paid unless the planning authority can be assured that the work will not cause pollution.  If a person wants to go ahead without getting a grant, I think he has to apply for planning permission under the 1963 Act. Perhaps the New Bill will make this essential.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about air pollution which is now beginning to exercise the minds of local authorities more and more.  In my area because of a proposed industry, it is very much on our minds.  As the Minister said, it is important that we should all know what these developments will mean to us.  In this respect the 1906 Act should be updated.  We are now beginning to get quite a number of big chemical industries. While the county council staffs who are responsible in the ultimate for giving planning permission, for laying down the conditions, are doing their <Col N="1502" /> best, the absence of any up-to-date regulations especially in relation to big chemical plants is a hindrance to them.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take cognisance of the points I have raised.  I ask him especially in co-operation with the Minister for Finance to give a heavy injection of capital into the housing industry so that the situation which arose some months ago will not arise again in a few months, and to give the industry what it needs most, confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for a very comprehensive and lucid speech and particularly for the amount of time and space he has given to housing. Deputy Calleary spoke about housing for quite some time and voiced his concern.  If my memory serves me correctly, this time last year there was the same type of carry-on on the far side of the House and Deputies were saying that money was scarce, building societies were in trouble, and we would not attain our target.  Indeed, we went beyond our target and over 25,000 houses were built.  In this House the Minister has given assurances that, if there are any problems in the industry, he will ensure that they are alleviated and that the necessary funds will be made available.  The Opposition should remember this because the same thing happened last year.  I have every confidence we will meet our deadline in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing is one of the most importtant aspects of people's lives.  I am concerned about the overall attitude with regard to this matter.  Up to now it was thought that if a person had a roof over his head he should be content but that is not good enough any more.  We must consider the overall housing situation from the point of view of the people, and their needs should be considered when the matter of design is being discussed.  I am a Dublin Deputy and I realise it is essential to have a socio-economic mix.  In the past the tendency has been to build vast local authority housing estates on the right while on the left <Col N="1503" /> we had the Foxrock, Ballsbridge and similar developments extending to Wicklow.  This tends to give an unbalanced type of society and if we do not do something to correct it the people will rebel against it.  It would not be an exaggeration to call it a form of class distinction.</P>
    <P>We hear much about new towns and it is envisaged that the greater Dublin area will have three or four such towns.  From what I have seen of them they are disastrous.  They are not towns but are merely urban sprawls. There has not been any planning in these areas and the Minister should look at the situation.  The local authorities have not the capacity or the staff to take on such a vast job. The Department of Local Government or one of their agencies should establish a group that would consider this type of development and if the local authorities still wish to be involved in the matter this group of experts could be seconded to the authorities for this work.  If we do not take action we will have urban sprawls that will become tatty, unwanted slum areas in the not-too-distant future.  A considerable amount of capital has been put into the development of these areas and it should not be wasted.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about housing for the disabled.  It is very important that specially designed houses should be built for these people.  They should be part of the general scene, not housed in isolated units.  Co-operative housing is another worthwhile part of housing and it requires every assistance we can give it.  The previous speaker said that this type of housing derived from Fianna Fáil but that is not so.  The co-operative movement came from the people themselves and no political party can claim the right of ownership.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Government and the local authorities to ensure that these movements get every assistance and appropriate sections should be established to deal with this matter.  There is a good community spirit in the housing co-operatives where people work and build their own houses.  I <Col N="1504" /> do not think it is possible to get a greater bond among any group.  We should strive for the development of a community spirit.  We must get away from the attitude of not depending on anyone else, of living on one's own island.  Special emphasis should be given to community centres and all assistance given to them.  People wish to have community involvement and development and it is up to the Government to help them.</P>
    <P>We should help them by giving the necessary finance.  It is not a question of whether we can afford it; we must realise that it is vital to encourage local involvement and effort.  In our modern society we have many pressures on us but if we can get people working together for the overall good of the community, the young people, the aged and the middle groups, we will be doing a worthwhile job.  The people want this kind of development and it is up to the Government to make a firm commitment.  They must state clearly what grants will be given.  The necessary expertise with regard to planning and other matters must be made available.</P>
    <P>In the last 40 years there has been not a gradual but an astronomical decline of the population in the city centre.  Sometimes this has been for social reasons where there was over-crowding, but frequently vested interests have moved in and have bought up property.  The result has been that people have been forced out of their traditional areas.  The city commissioners&mdash;I was a member last year&mdash;made available a large amount of land for development.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said Fianna Fáil should take credit for this.  I do not know why he should make that statement. In City Quay, in my constituency, in 1966 a compulsory purchase order was made for a sizeable area of land for much needed housing. The Minister of the day would not confirm the CPO.  It would have been far cheaper to acquire the land at that time than it is today.  That was indicative of the thinking of the former Government and that would still be their thinking if they had remained in government.  The present Minister <Col N="1505" /> was not six months in office when he took his decision.  I hope it is only the beginning of centre city development or urban renewal.  Areas have been zoned residential and commercial.  Up to now this was a farce because the position was that people moved in and bought and that was it.</P>
    <P>Where commercial and residential is stated on the draft plan that should be precisely what it means.  If a developer wants to develop that area he should put in 50 per cent housing and 50 per cent commercial development. I know the Dublin Corporation Planning Department are now insisting that housing goes into most developments but it is not on a 50-50 scale.  With a 50-50 scale we could achieve urban renewal.  It would also keep down the cost of land in the city area because developers will not be so enthusiastic and will not have the same profitability on a 50-50 basis as they would if it were 90 per cent commercial and 10 per cent housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has on a number of occasions mentioned the present housing stock.  It is important that our present housing stock should be maintained and refurbished.  In our centre city area property had been allowed to decay to such an extent that the local authority was left with no option but to declare them dangerous or unfit.  There are a couple of reasons for this.  One is the Rent Restrictions Act which tended in many ways to keep rents very low.  The days of very low rents are over and most people realise this.  I would like to see very generous grants being given for this type of renewal.  We speak in terms of £1,000 or £1,500 for refurbishing one floor of quite a good size house.  When one considers the cost of acquiring land and rebuilding this is very cheap housing and very worthwhile and it would conserve capital for other purposes. For people who would receive those generous grants, we would have to have rent control.  If somebody received a substantial sum of money for refurbishing and then charged very high rents it would not achieve the end I have in mind.  Realistic rents would be charged based on floor area. People now realise that a low rents <Col N="1506" /> situation does not exist and are prepared to pay reasonable rents.  We see in Dublin today people getting £8 for a room in a tenement house from newly married couples who have nowhere to go, who are the victims of the present housing situation which was caused by neglect over the last number of years.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that our housing stock is refurbished.</P>
    <P>There is quite an amount of ground in the centre city area of Dublin in the form of large back gardens.  Local authorities are very slow to grant permission for mews development. Mews development is excellent. Criteria can be laid down for a good type of dwelling which will enhance an area, which will bring back population to the city and which will give a mixed population.  With local authority development and mews development in the centre city there would be a very good mixture and this is most desirable.</P>
    <P>Housing finance is a problem.  The whole area of finance for housing will have to be looked at.  The building societies have done quite a good job but we must look now at whether they are able to meet the needs of this particular time.  I do not know whether they are or not.  My view is that a national finance agency could be set up purely for housing.  Some of the building societies have lent fairly large sums of money not necessarily for houses, not necessarily to people who were in the queue for loans.  This is what makes me a little nervous.  I would like to see a national finance agency looking at the situation. At the moment building societies lend money at a static rate.  If interest rates rise it rises a little but repayments are reasonably static over the period of purchase.  I believe this should be done on a sliding scale. The deposit on a house today is £1,000, £1,500 and in some cases £2,000.  Where possible there should be loans of nearly 100 per cent with the payments beginning at a low level. We could then project the rate of inflation and the rate at which the average person's earnings would rise. Repayments could then be on a sliding <Col N="1507" /> scale.  They can go out and purchase in the knowledge that as their salaries increase so do their repayments. This should be investigated with a view to ensuring that as many people as possible own their own houses.  If we had a good purchase scheme like this it would take a load off local authorities because there is a large number of people on their lists who want to purchase their houses but because of high deposits and high rates of repayment they are unable to do so.</P>
    <P>When Dublin Corporation build houses for sale there is such a big demand that the names of the applicants have to be put into a drum and a draw takes place for those who will get the houses.  It is a ludicruous situation that people who require houses should have to get them in this way.  This is not what I want and I have no doubt it is not what the Minister wants.  While revising our overall attitude in relation to the financing of housing health should bear a considerable factor.</P>
    <P>When I spoke about the national financial agency I did not want to infer that I wanted to kill off building societies.  They still have a role to play.  The Government should look at the needs as they see them today and people should have access to finance for this type of development.</P>
    <P>In relation to house designing the Minister has ensured that the old tradition of a chimney flue is brought back into housing.  It should never have been done away with.  Central heating is a first class innovation in local authority housing but it is still necessary to have chimney flues.  We all know what happened in many areas of Dublin last year during the fuel scarcity.  In some houses in Dublin there are only nine inch block walls and one can look out into the street where gaps have appeared around the windows.  The plaster has come off on the inside of the walls and dampness has appeared.  We often find that windows are not well finished and doors become warped.  We then ask people to pay for central heating. <Col N="1508" /> The cost of central heating, because of badly designed houses, is astronomical. There is a great heat loss in many of the new houses.</P>
    <P>I was at a housing conference in Copenhagen last year.  We were brought to see some housing schemes and I was very impressed by their doors, windows and their attitude towards conserving heat.  They had centrally heated homes at a minimum cost.  It is important, with the price of fuel at the moment, in our future houses designing that the terminal insulation of any house or building is first class.  We have to import almost all our fuel, and costs have increased for it, whether it is oil, gas or electricity. In future house designing our walls should be first class and we should try to have double-glazed windows.  The doors should be well sealed also so that we get maximum terminal insulation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should set up a body to investigate our housing needs.  He should also project into the future our requirements.  I do not accept the statement made by some people that we will always have a housing problem.  We will certainly have one if we think that way.  We should try to eliminate our housing problem by having a planned programme, projecting our needs into the future, deciding the number of houses we want every year and not talk in terms of up and down development, that if the building industry does well this year we will have a large number of houses built and if it does not do well the number will go down.</P>
    <P>We must have ordered development. I am glad to see that the Minister has a commitment of 25,000 houses a year, although I do not think that meets our needs.  It is important that the housing requirements are investigated and that the existing stock of houses be looked at, to see if they are houses which will remain for another 40 years or some which have not any life at all.  The Minister should look into this and after he has carried out an investigation he can draw up his plans for a number of years and say that after X number <Col N="1509" /> of years, with the population increase and taking everything into consideration, we will not have a housing problem.</P>
    <P>Public representatives in Dublin find that they get more letters about housing problems than about anything else.  You come across young married couples with one child living in atrocious conditions.  They cannot be housed by Dublin Corporation unless they have got a medical problem.  You can only tell them that at the moment Dublin Corporation are only housing families of four, that if they come back next year or if they have an extra child they may get a house.  It amazes me, when I come across the chronic housing conditions some people in Dublin have to put up with, how they can remain happily married. It is a great test of their strength that a marriage can survive in such conditions.</P>
    <P>It is important that they break through and get down to it.  We have seen what the last Administration did when they spoke about low cost housing and what type of housing we got. We must get away from the low cost mentality.  We must build quality homes for people.  They will cost money but if you build something good it is cheaper in the long run. Some of the low cost housing will be literally slums when they should still be good.</P>
    <P>Greater emphasis should be laid on design.  Many housing estates are ordinary and plain and show no great regard for design.  There are many fine architects in this country.  The design of housing schemes should be open to competition from a limited number of architects, say, six, seven, ten&mdash;whatever number is thought desirable.  In that way good ideas could be introduced.  There are many architects who normally would not get into the housing design field because it is a very closed shop and who could produce fresh ideas.  This is important.  Let us have new ideas in housing.  Let us get away from the old tradition.  People go for the old tradition but the reason is that nobody shows them anything else.  There should be variety.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> The concept of landscaping is lacking. In new housing schemes one sees only concrete.  Our climate is ideal for greenery and foliage.  Concrete tends to harden people's attitudes.  If people are looking at nothing but concrete all their lives it tends to make them violent.  It may be suggested that trees and shrubs would not last any length of time in housing estates.  People must be educated in this respect.</P>
    <P>In Copenhagen last year we were brought through the housing estates. There were flowers and greenery and one got the impression of a place that was lived in.  It was not that the design of the houses was any better than ours but the landscaping gave an impression of warmth and softness. It relieved the hardness.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should adopt an attitude towards landscaping and overall design.  There are not many landscape architects available in this country.  That is not a matter of wonder.  They would die of starvation if they were depending on contracts. If the demand were created there would be as many landscape architects available as were required.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's attitude towards housing for itinerants.  The sight of itinerant encampments on the roadside could not make one feel smug or happy.  The attitude of some people towards itinerants is disgraceful and nauseating.  We all have an obligation to help the less well off in our society.  These people are victims of our society.  They have been kicked from one county to another.  Nobody wanted them.  It is refreshing that the Minister has appointed Mr. Bewley, a man whose concern is great and who is aware of the needs of the itinerants.  The itinerants require special attention.  A man of Mr. Bewley's great humanity can provide special attention for them.</P>
    <P>It is a credit to Dublin Corporation that they are doing their bit.  Every new development is better than the last.  We all hope that the itinerants can be absorbed into our society.  I hate using the word itinerants because it suggests that they are something <Col N="1511" /> apart and they are not apart.  They are the same as we are.  They have the same fears, the same wants, the same needs.  We are now starting to look at the problem and I am happy that developments will proceed at the right pace and that in ten years' time we will be able to look back and say that we have done a good job.</P>
    <P>Grants for older houses must be increased. The present level of grants is not adequate and is not an incentive. More money should be available for persons who want to add bedrooms to their houses.  There should be an increase in the amount of money that may be borrowed for this type of development.  The present ceiling is £600 and the proverbial dog-house could not be built for that amount.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that grants are made available for this kind of work and also for new houses.</P>
    <P>A big problem in regard to housing is land.  People reading the Sunday newspapers over the last number of weeks are scratching their heads.  The Kenny Report is a very good and reasonably comprehensive report. What concerns me here is whether one person because he may own a piece of land has the right under the Constitution to override the rights of many hundreds who are looking for housing.  The Government should act quickly on this.  I realise that since January the price of land is being held but it is important that the Government act quickly and if there is a problem about constitutionality that it is cleared.  I would not see any problem about constitutionality because I believe the rights of the majority override the rights of one or two.  The greater good applies.  People should not be deprived of homes because land is held by people waiting for vast fortunes, or waiting for some planning committee to change the zoning which will mean that they can make vast fortunes at the expense of young married couples.</P>
    <P>This is a scandalous situation on which a Government committed to social reform will have to move quickly.  The Dublin Corporation have <Col N="1512" /> been quite good in acquiring large tracts of land in the county, despite some county councillors saying it was not the right thing to do.  The important thing to remember is that the acquisition of tracts of land by the corporation is keeping the price of land down.  The corporation must be complimented on this, and I hope they will continue to do it.  Now with the Kenny Report it will make it much easier for this sort of situation to come about.</P>
    <P>The Minister is bringing out a Planning Bill to ensure that our cities and towns progress in the right way and to deal with people who blatantly violate the planning laws&mdash;and there are a number, particularly in this city, who use the courts and every other means to do this&mdash;moving into residential areas and converting the accommodation into offices and so on. This is bad when they get away with it, because it encourages others to do likewise.  There is no doubt the new Planning Bill will give the local authority more teeth to ensure that this kind of activity will cease, and that those people who engage in it will get their fingers burned and others will not be encouraged to follow their example.</P>
    <P>The Minister is giving local authorities greater flexibility but there are some of these local authorities who still tend to go by the book and to be very rigid.  The Minister should inform these local authorities, in relation to the new board being set up to deal with appeals, that he does not want appeals being referred to him because of some technical detail and that it is up to the relevant local authority to make decisions.  Good planning makes a difference to our lives and our environment. Anything that is human must be flexible.  If the Minister gives local authorities this flexibility he should insist that they use it.  We are paying planners what I hope is good money; if we are not we should be.  The important thing is that when we pay them they should live up to their responsibilities and make decisions not necessarily always in accordance with the rule book but in accordance with the needs of people.  This is what planning is all about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> There is a committee sitting now for about 11 years on the review of the bye-laws.  I think it was in 1963 they first got down to it, and by the time the review is completed they will want to start another review, because decisions made ten years ago will be out of date by that time.  If the Government set up a body to review something and it drifts on endlessly and aimlessly, it is no wonder we have this attitude towards these reports when they are presented, and put them on a shelf and let them gather dust.</P>
    <P>On the question of the environment, quite a number of foreign industries will be looking to Ireland for locations. The Continent is chock-a-block and some of what are known as dirty industries which are perhaps not acceptable to other countries but which may be necessary to our economy should be located in areas where they will have the minimal effect on land and on people's health. The Government, having made a survey of sites should say to the IDA before these industries come in that they are designating certain areas for these dirty industries and they cannot run off to Bantry, to Donegal or into Dublin Bay or anywhere they like.  If we do that we shall have some control over our environment.  If we do not do that, we shall have the usual planning appeals, lobbies and counter-lobbies. It is far better that the Government should direct this sort of activity.  As I say, a number of these industries are not acceptable in other countries and I do not think we should carry the dirty can for anybody else.  However, if it is an industry that is necessary for our economy and is good for the country then certainly we should take it in and put it where it will have the least effect on our environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about roads. This subject is a bone of contention particularly in built-up areas where people may see a notice in the paper one morning indicating that a six-lane highway is to run through the Liberties, for instance, and that several hundred houses are to be knocked down.  A notice may appear that a highway is to run through Sandymount Strand and through the property of <Col N="1514" /> people in the vicinity.  This causes consternation and lobbies are formed. The local authority engineers handle such matters awkwardly.  They are not good at public relations.  There should be greater consultation.</P>
    <P>There are many cars on the roads. The local authorities do not take sufficient regard of the human aspect of the problem.  The human aspect should be borne in mind.  People are concerned about their homes and their property.  I can never see the necessity for very wide roads through the city.  There should be a good road system leading towards the city from the housing estates.  There should be bus-ways.  These would limit the number of buses required.  Buses could come in from districts like Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Finglas and Coolock. There should be linkroads on the outskirts of the city with inner city buses of a smaller size operating from there. The numbers of cars coming into the city must be reduced.</P>
    <P>Recently the corporation have insisted on a fixed number of car park spaces in each office development. Such restrictions should be imposed in conjunction with a good transport system.  People must not be deprived of the means of getting easily to and from work.  The local authorities and CIE should examine the position.  Cars will choke up this city unless steps are taken to improve the position.  I would like to see people bringing cars to the outskirts of the city.  I am in favour of mini-buses running around the various parts of the city free of charge.  There would be more pedestrian walks through the city then and this would bring life back to the city. Some traders feel that this would damage their business.  On the contrary I feel that business might improve. One cannot move around Dublin because of the traffic at present. Linkroads and inner city buses would help to make Dublin a pleasant city which would attract visitors.</P>
    <P>I notice now particularly in the city areas that waste ground is taken over for use as car parks despite the fact that there are no amenity areas in the portions of the city in which they are placed.  The car has greater importance <Col N="1515" /> than the public.  This is wrong.  Even for short periods space which is lying waste should be developed as amenity areas for people rather than as an area in which people can leave lumps of metal parked for eight hours a day.  I am not anti-car.  I have one myself.  The car should not be allowed to take over.  We should be masters of cars. At the moment one would get the impression from road developments that the car runs our society.</P>
    <P>The new planning board is welcome from all sides of the House.  It has taken responsibility from the Minister. Such responsibility was unfair on him. There will now be an independent tribunal.  They will make all the decisions. The onus is removed from the Minister.  By virtue of being a politician he is subjected to pressures from people trying to influence him to make decisions one way or the other.  It is important that this pressure should be removed.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Local Government and the former Minister across the House are happy that the position has been changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about swimming pools.  Every effort should be made to provide as many swimming pools as possible.  I am not looking for luxurious pools.  I have seen pools which cost considerable sums of money.  We could have a smaller type pool which would leave money available for further pools.  There are not enough pools in Dublin even yet.  The Minister should ensure that money is allocated for swimming pools.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in regard to our contribution for the Architectural Heritage Year, 1975.  The <i>Architectural Review</i> of 1974 has a feature on Dublin.  This is a very influential magazine.  They are providing a 60-page booklet describing various aspects of life in Dublin.  This will be good for Dublin from a tourism point of view.  Perhaps the Minister could make representations to the relevant Minister so that this magazine can get a subsidy from Board Fáilte.  The magazine should be a tourist attraction because <Col N="1516" /> it shows various aspects of the buildings and architectural heritage of Dublin.  The owners of the magazine would like a subsidy.  They have approached Bord Fáilte without success. Perhaps the Minister would help in this regard in order to assist the tourist industry.  This industry needs help at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about rates and the removal of housing and health charges.  The removal of these charges has been significant.  Because of their removal rates have not reached astronomical proportions.  The removal of some charges was part of the 14-point plan.  The charges for health and housing will be gradually eliminated.  People speak about the abolition of rates altogether.  I am not totally in favour of that idea.  Local authorities need funding from within their own ambit. If they had to go to the Government for money various Ministers for Finance are liable to get out the axe and chop sums off here and there.  This would limit the powers of the local authorities and make them subservient to the national Government.  People will always pay for value.  They could never see the reason for charges in regard to health and housing.  The rates situation should be reviewed and something done to relieve the costs but the local authorities should have money from their own funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the waiver of rates scheme.  This is an excellent scheme.  Many people cannot meet the rates bills.  It is unfair to ask people to dispose of their houses because they cannot pay the rates.  This is socially undesirable.  I know of a widow living on the widows' pension with two of her household earning. They give her very little money but because they are earning she is deprived of her right to avail of the waiver of rates scheme.  This is unfair.  Under the differential rents scheme the main breadwinner was taken into account.  I think the same situation should prevail with regard to the waiver of rates.  I know this particular person; she is indeed in need but she has been turned down flatly because the local authority got <Col N="1517" /> returns from both children, from their employers and this would certainly put her well in excess of the limit.  But she was not getting the money and yet she still has to find the amount of the rates.  I would ask that this be looked into again.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about local government reorganisation.  I think the last government had ideas about this as well.  I think it is important that local government be local and I can speak only of my own local authority, that is, Dublin local authority which, to me, is not local at all.  It has become unwieldy and the local representatives, in my view, are too far removed from any local activity.  If one takes the area for which I stood, one is not talking about local politics at all; one is talking about national politics.  In Dublin years ago we had the various borough councils&mdash;there were Rathmines, Pembroke, Clontarf, Howth and so on.  I believe that in order to talk effectively about local government we must get back to that local situation. I favoured then and still feel it is desirable that we have the greater Dublin area.  In my view, for example, it is ridiculous that people in Tallaght are linked with those in, say, Balbriggan; they have nothing in common in that respect.  Therefore, what we need is a greater Dublin area, with Tallaght being involved with Templeogue rather than with Balbriggan.  This could only evolve with the smaller councils operating on the basis of being responsible for cleansing, planning, environmental and other aspects.  Obviously they cannot cater for everything but the overall greater Dublin council would be talking in terms of housing, sewerage, water and so on.  But there would be the smaller councils operating effectively locally giving back real power at the lowest level in our society.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have this concept of community; in Dublin there have been candidates who stood as community candidates and I think six or seven were elected.  One must consider that the system obtaining in Dublin at the moment is against that type of community situation.  Were there smaller units established we would have a greater degree of community <Col N="1518" /> involvement; people concerned about their own areas, building up their own areas; planning them in the proper manner and, from there, evolving into the greater Dublin council to which members would be elected from local bodies.  By and large, I would see this greater Dublin council as a full-time body.  Dublin's population is creeping up to the one million mark now and it is necessary that we have a full-time council operating, coming up from the bottom and not something sitting there in a vast metropolis without any real concept of local Government whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I welcome and look forward to the Minister's proposals when they emerge.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind what I have said about the greater Dublin Council.  In my view this is the only system which we can evolve and by which we can hope to get local government back.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with what happens in the country but in my view it is important that all local authorities get together to discuss this matter to ensure that when the next local elections come about we will have a good local government set up.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about An Foras Forbartha and the valuable research it has done in various aspects of our planning and construction.  I should like to see An Foras Forbartha becoming more involved in the area of housing and housing development and lending its expertise to local authorities.  This expertise could bring life into the various local authorities. An Foras Forbartha could ensure that our development is up-to-date and that our housing designs meet the needs of our people.  In my view An Foras Forbartha have a much greater role to play in the greater development of this country.  I do not know if An Foras Forbartha is tied in any way, but if this body is tied the Minister should see to it that they are given as much freedom as possible so that they would not be looking over their shoulders at the various departments. An Foras Forbartha should be a free agent to develop expertise which we all know is needed in housing.  Our <Col N="1519" /> planning and construction have been dull to date and it has been so because of lack of direction.  An Foras Forbartha could play its part by giving this sense of direction which is very necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the question of land wastage, particularly in the Dublin area.  A good deal of land wastage is taking place in Dublin because of what is called densities. Because land is located in what is described as density areas in draft development plans any hope of reasonable development is ruled out.  This seems rather ludicrous.  I know of a three-storey house which has a large front and rear garden but because it is located in a density area it cannot be converted into three flats.  The building is quite suitable for such a conversion but because of the development plan it can only be converted to two flats.  The owner of the building is not allowed to develop housing at the back of the house because the development plan states that the densities will not permit it.</P>
    <P>We tend to get bogged down with the idea of a density situation.  I am aware that people, historically are afraid that if we have a high density situation we might create a slum problem but in my view we have become sufficiently enlightend to keep away from that attitude and that type of mentality.  We have got ourselves bogged down with this rule book attitude where, after an inspection of the draft development plan, people are told that they cannot develop.  In my view this encourages people to develop without obtaining planning permission. It encourages some people to convert their houses without planning permission, something which I deplore.  It encourages the conversion of ordinary family type houses into five or six bedsitters which are contrary to any living standards.  If we had a reasonable density allowing reasonable development we would stop this.  People would not be forced to go ahead with conversions and other developments without obtaining planning permission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> The Minister should have a look at the density situation, particularly in the centre of Dublin where there is quite an amount of land wasted because planning permission is not being granted for reasonably good development.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, on the question of housing that we should emphasise that quality is important.  We can talk about prices and low-cost housing but a low cost house is very expensive if it is defective.  We should concentrate on the quality of the house.  Some people confuse efficiency with low cost but I do not think it has anything to do with it.  When <i>carte blanche</i> is given to build low-cost houses anything can be erected but efficiency is a different matter altogether. We can have good plans and designs to meet the needs of people but at the same time erect such houses at a very efficient rate.</P>
    <P>By and large the builders, and the building federation, do a good job. I am aware that they are doing a little scare mongering at the moment regarding the building industry.  Last year it was the building societies and this year it seems to be the turn of the building federation to say that men will be laid off despite the assurances given by the Minister.  As employers members of this Federation are good and they pay well.  They erect the type of house they are asked for and that is why it is necessary to have the right type of design.  Architects, preparing development plans in future, should incorporate in them the whole aspect of community life.  For too long the aspect of community life was ignored.  I am glad this attitude has changed and I know that the Minister is concerned that any developments in the future must have built into them the needs of the people for whom the houses are to be erected. We have had our Ballymuns and we do not want them again.  We want now, if we are developing centre city accommodation, to look at town type houses.  With density laws waived you can have a first-class housing complex using the land which is available.  Land in the centre of the city is dear, but you are building the right type of <Col N="1521" /> housing unit, and you are getting quite a large number of housing units into the area without any fear of creating a type of slum development.</P>

The Land Commission gave the owner another holding and in return he offered them this one.  It then transpired that the title to this holding which the Land Commission are getting is not in order.  The Land Commission gave the owner of this land a letting of the land which he will eventually be getting and they took a letting of this <Col N="1524" /> land.

The scheme came into operation on 1st May and presumably it was a few weeks before any forms were received.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is likely that queries would arise on most of the forms.  However the House may take it that, as far as I can encourage or persuade the Land Commission to cut out delays and to process applications, I will do so.  I realise, perhaps more than anyone else, that the expedition with which these applications are dealt with is a matter of great importance.</P>

It is to enable residents, the householders on the island, to transfer to the mainland. My information is that the father is in the household in question. The son got married, left the island and then returned.  However, in view of what the Deputy said I am having further inquiries made and, if he can be fitted into the scheme without doing violence to the principle <Col N="1529" /> of the scheme, I will look at the matter.

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if there are any proposals in his Department to enable Bord Fáilte to pay &ldquo;survival&rdquo; grants and other forms of assistance to the many hotels and guesthouses which are in financial difficulties due to the collapse of the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>While there was a decline in tourism business during the 1969-72 period it would be incorrect to refer to this as a collapse of the tourist industry.  Tourism revenue in 1973 showed a distinct improvement on 1972 and this improvement is expected to continue during the current year.  In the six months up to June, 1974, there has been a 5 per cent increase in tourist numbers over the same period last year.  The home market has also shown considerable buoyancy, which has helped to offset difficulties in other areas.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte have already taken steps to safeguard the jobs of permanent staff and seasonal workers in the industry by more intensive marketing efforts.  I recently authorised the board to introduce a scheme of grants which will help the owners of hotels and guesthouses to carry out essential repairs and renewals which they would otherwise be unable to afford and to carry out improvements to their premises, provide amenities and facilities for their guests and staff accommodation of good standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's reply it would appear there will be a 5 per cent increase this year.  Is he aware that hoteliers and guesthouse owners in the west and south of Ireland complain constantly that the number of tourists is down and that <Col N="1543" /> they are compelled to let go staff they recruited early in the season and that this is because of the drop in tourism, despite the information at the Minister's disposal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not.  From the information I have there is no evidence of any jobs in jeopardy in the hotel industry.  CERT's understanding is that there are shortages in certain categories and that, while vacancies exist on a national basis, the position may vary from area to area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have anticipated that this would have been the best season ever for tourism had I been asked.  I do not like prophesying. I refused last year to say what I thought the outcome for the tourist season would be.  If I had put aside that reservation about prophesying for this year I would have forecast it to be the best year ever.  There are three things which have gravely affected the tourist season this year. One is the bombs in Dublin in May; another is what has been referred to in England as the Gaughan funeral; and the third the bombing of the House of Commons and yesterday's bombing at the Tower of London.  I do not know who did the bombing yesterday but the impression was given by commentators and the British network last night that it was the IRA.  If that is so it is bound to affect the tourist industry as well.  It has been impossible over a number <Col N="1544" /> of years to divorce the effects on tourism from acts of violence in any part of these islands.  The tourist industry in the country generally, which is a very valuable export industry, has been the sufferer in this regard.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the approximate amount by which the annual subvention to CIE must be increased in a full financial year to re-imburse the board for the shortfall in operating revenue which will ensue as a result of the Government's decision to permit an increase of 20 per cent in fares, rates and charges instead of the rise of 33? per cent approximately which the NPC found to be necessary to comply with the Government's directive that the subvention should not be increased above the existing level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in the statement issued on 8th July, 1974, the decision by the Government to restrict the proposed increases in Dublin city bus and suburban rail fares and provincial city and town bus fares, to 20 per cent will, it is estimated, cost the CIE some £1.5 million in a full year.  The question of what additional subvention will be <Col N="1546" /> necessary for CIE will be determined at a later date in the light of CIE's general financial position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that a person (name supplied) in County Cork who is setting up a small industry in a rural area is being charged £1,300 for connection to the ESB network; and if he will have this very high charge investigated with a view to having it reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the ESB that the person concerned has been quoted a capital contribution of £1,302.35 for the extension of three phase supply to his workshop.  In cases where it is difficult to predict the level of electricity consumption for a number of years ahead, it is the practice of the board, in order to protect their investment, to require the applicant to contribute a substantial proportion of the cost involved.  The contribution in this case is related to the cost of providing the required supply and would be subject to review after a minimum period of four years but not more than seven years at the request of the consumer.  In the light of the actual consumption experienced in the intervening period and the expectation of further usage at that stage, a partial refund may then be made.  No reduction is now possible in the capital contribution quoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think this is a very high sum for a small industry in a rural area where they are experiencing great problems?  Is there any special scheme where such people can get grants from the Government? The Minister knows the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  Rural electrification is subsidised but I have seen sums of that order quoted for domestic use in very remote areas.  In this case the ESB had to supply 450 metres of three-phase line, a 50Kw transformer as well as servicing of meters.  This is a large capital sum.  They must either get sufficient income from the investment of that sum to justify its payment or else the people getting the supply of <Col N="1547" /> electricity must guarantee, in the event of their not using that amount of electricity, that the ESB will not be out of pocket.</P>

My reply is not an evasive one; it is a serious reply which would not seem so strange to the Deputy if he read the section referred to of the NPC report for April, 1974, because completely exempt firms are listed there. <Col N="1551" /> There are firms producing transportable goods which employ not more than 20 people.  All laundries, launderettes, washeterias, dry cleaning establishments; tuition fees and boarding charges for primary and post-primary pupils; restaurants, cafes, fish and chip shops and other take-away food shops employing not more than ten people.  These are only some of the categories.  When you start trying to count categories, there is no such count of such categories in the possession of the State that would enable one to give an answer.</P>

    <P>I think what led to the reply of the Minister for Transport and Power was that he was asked if anyone from my Department or from the National Prices Commission was involved in discussions.  They will be, but the position was that a junior officer attended part of the meeting in an information sense to provide criteria if they were required for NPC decisions. It will come to the NPC at a later stage, but in the sense of my Department actually participating in the discussions, the reply of the Minister for Transport and Power was an accurate one.  It was a young man, <Col N="1554" /> a junior officer, who did not have any responsibility, attending for some of the meeting just for the purpose of giving information.</P>

      <P>I understand that since the EEC Business Co-operation Centre, usually referred to as the &ldquo;Marriage Bureau&rdquo;, commenced operations in May 1973, 71 Irish firms requested the Bureau's assistance and that 37 of these firms were put in contact with European companies also interested in partnership arrangements.</P>
      <P>Discussions on partnership arrangements are conducted between the firms involved.  As the Bureau has released no information on the outcome of these discussions I am not in a position to evaluate the benefits of its service to Irish industrialists.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 45 together. The information available to me does not support the suggestion that there is dumping of cheap furniture here.</P>
      <P>I am aware that imports of certain types of furniture are increasing but there is nothing to suggest that this trend is due to anything other than normal commercial competition.  If any person has evidence of dumping he should take the matter up with An Coimisiún Dumpála or with the EEC Commission.  No complaints have been made to An Coimisiún Dumpála and I am not aware that any have been lodged in Brussels.</P>

      <P>I certainly agree that there is a situation in the furniture industry in Navan which warrants its being continuously monitored, and it is being so monitored by my Department. However, the point I was making is that, first, while there is very intense competition from the much larger volume producers in the United Kingdom, in so far as we have been able to ascertain it does not constitute dumping.  We may have opinions whether it is getting very close to sharp commercial practice, but it does not constitute dumping, and I do not have the power to take such actions as have been suggested to me.  We are continuously monitoring the situation in regard to the furniture industry in Navan which certainly is going through a difficult time.</P>

I was impressed&mdash;I shall not name a name&mdash;by one particular grouping which the Deputy is aware of, a number of companies who have <Col N="1558" /> drawn together for marketing, purchasing and defensive reasons, and whose design is of an extremely high standard on any terms in the world. I am completely satisfied that in an on-going free trade situation it is by design and quality that our producers, who are relatively smallscale, can survive.  Any amalgamations, cooperations or groupings of a defensive kind that they can form&mdash;I have mentioned one&mdash;are absolutely necessary in a very difficult free trade situation.</P>

      <P>Irish share prices have been decreasing recently in line with international trends.  These trends are generally considered to be influenced by the slowing of the rate of growth of the world economy and by the world inflationary situation.

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the recent increases by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta in their prices for calcium ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate.</P>
      <P>In accordance with existing arrangements, Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta notified me on 21st June, 1974, of their intention to increase the prices of calcium ammonium nitrate by £5.65 per ton and of ammonium sulphate by £4.62 per ton. This notification was referred to the National Prices Commission who, having examined the proposal, recommended on 25th June, 1974, that there should be no objection to the price increases proposed, as they were the minimum necessary to compensate the company for vouched increased material, labour and overhead costs. The firm was notified accordingly on 2nd July, 1974.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that, in replying to a question by him on 3rd July, I stated in the course of my reply that I had not received notice of any expected increase in fertiliser price.  This was an error for which I apologise to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the firm in question increased the price of 10.10.20. fertiliser by £3.50 per ton with effect from 10th April, 1974. This price increase was necessary to compensate the firm for a similar increase in the cost of the fertiliser to them, and my approval of the increase was not therefore required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <P>It has been decided that the parents of the children attending Derryvoreeda National School should have the option in due course of sending their children to the new school at Recess or Derryvoreeda National School.  A grant sanctioned towards the cost of certain minimal repair works to Derryvoreeda National School in the meantime until the new school at Recess is available does not include provision for the installation of water flushed toilets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's previous question I did not say that the Department have no <Col N="1574" /> funds but I said that the Department were not empowered and have no funds.  There is a misunderstanding here, prevalent in the area of Ardee, particularly based on an inaccurate letter dated 8th May, 1974, from a local authority which said that the said local authority, Dublin County Council, did not make a grant towards the cost of the swimming pool.  The council has since apologised for the inaccuracy of this.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Department agreed, in respect of five community schools, to build a pool as part of a sports complex when the local authorities concerned agreed to make the necessary funds available for the purpose. There are no funds available to me in the Department to build swimming pools as part of these complexes. I take it the Deputy will accept from me that the information which was circulating on foot of the letter of 8th May from Dublin County Council was inaccurate and that the council has since apologised for the inaccuracy?</P>

    <P Just="Center">Explanatory Note on Table.</P>
    <P>This table shows the estimated expenditure in each of the Colleges of the National University of Ireland, Trinity College, Dublin and St. Patrick's College, Maynooth in 1973/74 on students for the Higher Diploma in Education.  The estimates show in column (1) the total direct expenditure on the School/Department of Education in each College and in column (2) apportionment of each of the College's overhead or indirect expenditure on such departments. Higher Diploma students fees (column 4) are deducted from the totals of column (1) and (2) to give the net State expenditure on such courses (column 5).  Dividing this net State expenditure by the number of students (column 6) gives the net State expenditure per student (column 7).</P>
    <P>The information in this table is as accurate as possible.  There must be some reservations, however, in regard to the calculations made as overhead or indirect costs can only be apportioned on the basis of the proportion which Education Departments direct costs form of total academic department costs.</P>

      <P>The objectives and scope of the curriculum of the proposed European University Institute in Florence are set out in a document prepared by the Preparatory Committee, a copy of which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the document:</P>
      <P>
        <i>A European University Institute to be established in Florence.</i>
      </P>
      <P>The nine member states of the European Communities have decided to establish a European University Institute in Florence for postgraduate study and research.  Its work will be carried out in the following four departments: History and Civilisation, Economics, Law, Political and Social Sciences.</P>
      <P>The European problems covered by the Institute's work will be dealt with on the broadest possible scale, both in their European context and in connection with Europe's past and present links with other parts of the world.  The problems of European integration, a major development of our times, will also be the subject of research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the Institute will further the development of the cultural and scientific heritage of Europe, considered as a whole and in its various aspects.  It will help to train men, who, working in a European spirit, are capable of promoting <Col N="1585" /> mutual understanding within Europe and of maintaining Europe's open attitude towards the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>The Institute will be open to research staff who have completed their initial university education. Admission to the Institute will be subject to decision by a selection board consisting of members of the teaching profession.  Certain candidates may be awarded grants by the Contracting States and possibly by the Institute.</P>
    <P>The Institute will have the power to confer a Doctorate of the European University Institute on research students who have completed at least two years' study and research in the Institute, and submitted original research work of a high standard which has been approved by the Institute and is to be published.  It will also have the power to award attendance certificates to research staff.</P>
    <P>The Academic Council, to consist of representatives of the teaching profession, will establish the study and research programmes to be carried out individually or jointly by the departments.  This programme will define and co-ordinate the study and research topics or projects as far as is necessary, and ensure freedom of research and teaching.</P>
    <P>While respecting the independence of each department, the Institute will ensure that a considerable amount of interdisciplinary research is carried out.  It will encourage contacts and co-operation between departments and organise seminars and research teams, composed of teachers and researchers with differing and complementary specialities and training.</P>
    <P>Work at the Institute will be done through research teams and in seminars.  Teamwork will be encouraged, and at the same time each research worker will be enabled to pursue work which will enable him, if he so wishes, to obtain the Institute's doctorate.</P>
    <P>The Institute will provide a <Col N="1586" /> forum for the exchange and comparison of ideas and experience in the fields covered by the four departments. It will co-operate with the various national or international teaching and research bodies and have the power to conclude agreements with States and international agencies.</P>
    <P>The Institute will have its own library and documentation centre with the most modern equipment. It will have access to the valuable collections in the libraries and archives of Florence.</P>
    <P>The authorities of the Institute will be: the Principal, assisted by a Secretary-General, the High Council composed of Government Representatives, and the Academic Council, composed of representatives of the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>The teaching staff will consist of heads of department, full-time teachers, part-time teachers and assistant teachers.  Teaching staff will be on fixed-term renewable contracts (1 to 3 years).  Salaries will not be liable to national tax although they will be subject tothe Institute's own tax.  With regard to the social security scheme, teaching staff will be given certain options, if they so wish and the necessary arrangements can be made, including that of continuing under the scheme to which they were affiliated before coming to Florence, in order to ensure continuity in accumulated rights, particularly as regards pensions.</P>
    <P>At the beginning there will be from 10 to 20 teachers, and 50 to 80 researchers.  In a few years' time this latter figure may rise to between 400 and 500, with the teaching staff increasing accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Italian Republic has undertaken to provide a site for the Institute in Florence, free of charge, and also the buildings and the furniture and teaching equipment initially required to enable the institute to function, and to be responsible for their maintenance.</P>
    <P>Initially the Institute will be based <Col N="1587" /> in the Badia Fiesolana at Fiesole/ Florence.  Present plans are that it should start work in October 1974. It is later expected to be transferred to buildings to be erected, also at the Italian Republic's expense at the Villa Tolomei site.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>It is not helpful to the work of many active organisations to suggest that there has been a breakdown of the youth services in Dublin.  Not only are numerous voluntary organisations, such as the Catholic Youth Council, the Church of Ireland Youth Council, the Scouts and the Guides, continuing their work in youth clubs with the aid of substantial and recently increased State grants, but Comhairle le Leas Oige have themselves received increased State aid this year at an equivalent of £150,000 per annum as against £100,000 per annum in 1972-73. This money continues to be made available by Comhairle for many youth activities including the employment of part-time teachers, decoration of clubs, equipment, subsidies, and part-time youth workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Lemass' question, there have been two resignations in the past three months.  These are effective from the end of the current month but it must be stressed that, in the case of one of these officers, <Col N="1590" /> Comhairle did not intend to continue the employment beyond September next.  A third officer completed her period of service on 15th July and was not re-employed as there was no work for her.  The resultant situation is that, apart from the Director and secretarial staff, Comhairle at present employ nine full-time youth officers.</P>
    <P>It may be appropriate, and of help to Deputies, if I were to give some background information on the development of youth policy, with particular reference to Dublin.  In September, 1973, proposals were received from the Dublin Vocational Education Committee regarding staff reorganisation of Comhairle le Leas Oige.  This submission coincided with the initiation of a comprehensive re-examination of national youth policy by the Department of Education. Meanwhile Comhairle themselves have continued their own review of their role and further new but informal proposals were received from them as recently as 3rd July.</P>
    <P>However, Comhairle are not the only organisation putting forward new ideas on youth policy.  There are many different views on the priority and method of expenditure of public funds to help young people.  There has not in the past been sufficiently clear and consistent thinking in the Department on such issues.  I have been convinced for some time that the fairest and most effective way of allocating resources between different approaches to youth work, between voluntary and statutory organisations, and between different areas of the country, is in the context of one national policy with publicly understood objectives. This policy will take account of the necessity for youth serving agencies to co-operate closely with other agencies operating in the same community.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the administrative arrangement should be flexible enough to allow of changes in approach as circumstances require and enable the assistance of young people themselves, their families and their local community, to be enlisted in active self-help.  A proper system of priority for areas of greatest need will <Col N="1591" /> need to be devised.  Another concern will be the provision of back-up services, advice and supervision to ensure the most effective service to young people by those working directly with them.</P>
    <P>My Department have been working very intensively on this and hope to be in a position fairly soon to outline their proposals to other Departments concerned with this general area of work so as to ensure parallel and coordinated development.  The policy will itself lay particular stress on effective means of consultation with the youth organisations and it is also hoped to provide an opportunity for public discussion of its specific terms before final decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>Starting in 1969, Comhairle le Leas Oige decided to employ additional youth officers in connection with a proposed extension of their services.  I regret to say that officers appointed in the period 1969 to early 1973 were recruited on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis without a sufficiently clear understanding of their role or without adequate provision being made for guidance, support and supervision.  This has, I think, since been universally recognised and is reflected in Comhairle's most recent informal submission to the Department. In large measure the decrease in the number of full-time officers is due to the decision of Comhairle themselves to curtail their involvement in what is generally known as unattached youth work until they had decided on the type of service they should provide.</P>
    <P>The terms of employment which these youth officers accepted initially are the equivalent of those of temprary whole-time teachers.  These terms have been abided by.  In addition, they have since received annual increments, degree allowances and Higher Diploma allowances.</P>
    <P>The original proposals from an Comhairle in September were to the effect that a series of social posts be created and that the youth officers be made permanent in such posts.  As I think I have demonstrated, a decision as to the role, context and number of <Col N="1592" /> such posts is so important that in the interests of fair allocation of resources it should only be considered in the context of a national policy.</P>
    <P>I shall be very happy to enter into discussions with the new Comhairle le Leas Oige board on these matters.</P>

      <P>There are so many points contained in the reply that the only way one could ask questions on it would be by raising the matter on the Adjournment.  However, before giving notice of that, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House how he can dismiss the work of Comhairle le Leas Oige. Some 140 youth clubs comprising 18,000 young people are affiliated to the Comhairle.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary accept he has overall responsibility for youth?  Why has he allowed the existing services to deteriorate?  Is he aware that there is no one in Dublin to look after unattached youth, particularly those subject to drug abuse?  He has given some figures with regard to the reduction in the number of youth officers. Of the nine officers he mentioned four are in headquarters and are not in the field; there are only five community youth officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is a travesty of the truth. It is clearly indicated from the detailed reply I gave that I take the work of Comhairle le Leas Oige very seriously indeed.  I have met Comhairle le Leas Oige twice since I was appointed Parliamentary Secretary.

In so far as remedying the present situation is concerned, I have indicated the services that are being made available.  I have indicated that nine youth officers are functioning.  If some other youth officers choose to resign, that is a decision for them.  I indicated that the number who resigned in the past two months was only two.  I have indicated also that the youth officers in question are receiving as well as salaries on a par with those of temporary whole-time teachers, annual increments, degree allowances and higher diploma allowances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The £150,000 is the annual equivalent of the grant in respect of the current nine-month period and I gave it as an annual equivalent because the grant is for a nine-month period.  If the current financial year were a 12-month year the annual equivalent of that would be £150,000.  What they are, in fact, getting for this nine-month period is £112,000.</P>

      <P>It was often said to me when I was Parliamentary Secretary that the longer the answer the less one had to say.  The Parliamentary Secretary's reply was so lengthy it is difficult to frame a supplementary. Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that it is the experience in advanced industrial countries that the expansion of services such as those provided by Comhairle le Leas Oige has proved to be a saving to the State by helping children to be brought up in a more orderly way and to fit into society better.  Despite the Parliamentary Secretary's activities and those of the Minister for Local Government he will agree that there is a lack of amenities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I am in full agreement with what Deputy Lemass has said.  The only qualification I would add is that those other countries are changing their ideas as time passes as to the most appropriate way of spending the money.  We are keeping in close touch with this.  I have visited a number of these countries myself and studied the youth services and officers of my Department have done so also.  We are hoping to incorporate what we think are the best of their ideas in the policy we are working out.  I agree fully that the activities of the Department of Local Government and Dublin Corporation are very relevant in this field and I hope that my effort to produce a comprehensive policy, which will be publicly known to the other agencies in the field, will enable them to know what we are doing and in turn what remains for them to do.  In that way we can have co-ordinated and parallel development.</P>

The difficulty here is that if you are to create a permanent post you must create it on particular terms with specific terms of employment.  I believe that the terms of employment of a youth officer are a central issue in any youth policy and that is why I want to consider the thing in a general national context.  There is the added difficulty that, while these people are at present employed by a subsidiary of the VEC, they are not as easily transferred as teachers would be from one school to another because they do not have teaching qualifications.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not accept that children in Dublin and in other city areas are entitled to as cheap transport as possible?  Contrary to what he thinks the latest increase, together with the one that occurred during the <Col N="1597" /> year, can represent a substantial increase for the parents of the children who have to pay it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not really the case.  The effect of the increase in the case of school children will be that the 2p fare will not be increased, the 3p fare will not be increased, the 4p fare will not be increased.  The 5p fare in Dublin will be increased to 6p and the 7p fare will be increased to 9p. Therefore the Deputy will see it is only those travelling long distances on the buses who will be getting any increase in fares.  As the Deputy is also aware the object of the school transport service has always been to encourage people to attend their nearest suitable school.  It is not likely that many of the children travelling those distances in Dublin, where there is such a concentration of services, would be attending their nearest suitable school.</P>

      <P>A limited number of the new shirts were supplied last year and these were issued to men on point duty.  A further supply of about 800 are expected in a month's time.  Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to say when the bulk supply of shirts will become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The order for material for the shirts was placed more than two years ago.  First there was difficulty in getting suitable yarn for the material. Then when the yarn was obtained difficulties arose in the weaving of the cloth.  I cannot say precisely what the technical problems are but, in a general way, they are related to the problem of producing a large quantity of cloth that must be uniform in colour, texture and finish.  The matter is in fact dealt with by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, who handle such supplies on behalf of all Government Departments.  I am satisfied that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are doing everything possible to expedite the supply of the shirts <Col N="1598" /> and it is only fair to add that the problems that arose were also outside the control of the cloth manufacturers, who of course are an Irish concern.</P>

Would he not further agree that there is a highly qualified person employed as inspector of textiles in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;I believe he is the manager of a former textile mill?  Would he further agree&mdash;I know this because I served my time to the textile trade&mdash; that colouration and weaving is a very simple matter to work out if you have an expert in the Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, this matter is dealt with by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, as the Deputy knows, on behalf of all Government Departments.  The delay, which I regret very much, has been due to difficulties in obtaining the cloth. These arose, I understand, out of difficulties with the yarn which was imported from Switzerland.  Technical difficulties arose in the weaving process.  Experts from the country producing the yarn had to visit this country to inspect it and as a result the yarn had to be replaced.  Difficulty after difficulty of a technical nature arose.  I understand that production, which was intended to be at the rate of 6,000 yards a week, actually dropped down to 800 yards a week. Some weaving is being done by the producers of the yarn to see if the difficulties can be overcome.  I might also inform the Deputy that the Garda representative bodies are members of the particular working parties, which studied designs for the cloth in question and designs for the shirt in question and they are fully <i>au fait</i> with all the difficulties which have arisen which are completely out of the control of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and of the contractors. They are to be regretted but they are outside our control.</P>

      <P>The home help service was introduced in April, 1972, with an initial budget <Col N="1601" /> of £150,000, to enable health boards to provide domiciliary services for (a) families in stress situations with young children who otherwise would have to be taken into care and (b) the aged, especially those living alone.</P>
      <P>Reports from Health Boards indicate that in the year ended March 31st last the total expenditure on this service has reached more than double the original figure.  At that date 3,101 home helps were employed throughout the country.  The beneficiaries included 222 families, 2,904 aged persons and 419 others, mainly the disabled and the chronically ill.</P>
      <P>My policy is that the service will continue to expand and that it will be rendered more effective in each area by the appointment of wholetime organisers and the initiation of training schemes for serving personnel. Additional funds have been allocated for the service in the current year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report in question.  The reference in the article to possible toxic effects from mercury from the consumption of two pounds of fish a week are based on figures in United Kingdom Ministry reports which give the average mercury content of fish caught in the Irish Sea as 0.33 parts per million by weight, and a World Health Organisation suggested tolerable weekly intake of 0.3 milligrams of mercury per person.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sea figures quoted relate mainly to fish caught off the United Kingdom coast; the average figure as shown in the same report for fish caught off the Irish coast is considerably less, and some analyses carried out by public analysts in Ireland have given even more favourable results for such areas.  The report mentioned by the Deputy concluded that the risk of mercury poisoning from fish was slight in the United Kingdom.  It is obviously less here.</P>
      <P>Food, including fish and fish products, is examined as a routine for mercury content in the public analyst's laboratories from time to time and the situation is thus under constant review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> I am aware of the Press reports and statements mentioned.  I would refer the Deputy to my opening remarks in the debate on my Department's estimate for 1974, which dealt with the questions of employment and level of activity in the house building industry, additional finance for house purchase and the misinterpretation by various people of recently published housing statistics.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Government's housing targets are concerned, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 25 to 30 and 32 of 10th July.  In this reply I indicated that the Government's target figure for housing output in the 12-month period ending 31st March 1975, is 25,000, of which I expect local authority housing output to account for about 7,250, the balance to be provided by the private sector.  Pending the completion of an up-to-date assessment of housing needs, an annual housing output of 25,000 is considered to be the present annual minimum need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is rather unfair for the Minister to take so many questions together&mdash;I do not know what the reason for it is&mdash;but could I ask him if he has received any request to grant a capital injection through the building societies to the construction industry, and if the sum of £20 million has been mentioned, or if he considers there is need at all for any extra capital to be made available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The construction industry representatives made the same points which they and Deputy Molloy made almost 12 months ago.  I pointed this out to them and that, in fact, when they proved that money was needed the necessary money was made available, and the further reply which they then made was &ldquo;Of course, only we pointed it out to you it would not be made available&rdquo;, which I thought was rather foolish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked the Minister was, has the construction industry pointed out to the Minister that the financial aid which he says he will make available is required now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They mentioned that they expected that unless money was made available, particularly to building societies, there was a danger of a lay-off in their industry.  I assured them there was no necessity to worry about that aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are builders who have large numbers of houses on their hands which are reaching completion stage and for which no payments have been received by the intending purchasers? How does the Minister expect such contractors to continue in existence serving loans to construct houses for which they are receiving no payment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no knowledge of what Deputy Molloy refers to, but it is not my responsibility to ensure that all houses are sold before their construction is completed.  I understand that there are a number of <Col N="1613" /> mainly high-cost houses which have been constructed and have not yet been paid for.  This is something which occurs from time to time, but I assured the building industry representatives and the trade unions that the Government propose to ensure that the building industry is kept going at a level which will produce 25,000 houses in the year ending 31st March next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware &mdash;just to give him one case of which I know all the facts&mdash;that there are 45 houses in one scheme which are nearing completion&mdash;they have all passed the roofing stage&mdash;and not one penny has been paid to the builder, which would normally have been paid at the roofing stage when the first payment of the loan would come through.  None of the persons who have indicated willingness to purchase was able to obtain a loan.  The builder in question does not know what the future holds for him other than a vague promise from the Minister that money will be made available if needed.  They say the money is needed now and that with the holiday period coming they cannot go into the winter with such heavy financial commitments and with such little action on this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the houses to which Deputy Molloy refers, but if the builder concerned gave to me the particulars which he appears to have given to Deputy Molloy, perhaps I could have the matter investigated. That information was not given to me, nor was there any concrete evidence given to me.  As I said, a number of builders referred to the fact that they were completing some houses and would expect that the money would eventually be made available for the purpose of having them bought.  But no particulars of sites or numbers of houses or anything like that was given to me.  Indeed, the confederation of builders are aware that if they want to discuss the matter or give particulars to me they are welcome to come at any time and do so.  However, as I assured the House last week and last night on my <Col N="1614" /> Estimate, the matter is being considered, and if money is required to keep the building industry going that money will be provided.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  One of his colleagues pointed out that this man had 200 houses.  I asked if that was so and he said he thought there might be about that.  I asked him to give me details of the numbers.  He found 20 or 30 in Dublin but he could not remember where the rest were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that throughout the country he may have that number, but it is possible he did not have the information with him.  I am not contradicting the statement, but I did not get particulars of anything like 200 houses which were supposed to be unsold&mdash;and 200 houses out of a total of 25,000 is a very small number.</P>

      <P>In answer to a question of mine here, the Minister gave me an indication that he intended to review all grants.  I asked him would he bring the salary grant up to the farmers' grant, and he was very sympathetic towards that. Further in connection with his reply I said he should surely realise that the cost of houses had gone up to such an extent that the present grants would not pay for the installing of electricity if the house was in an isolated place and that I would be surprised if the Minister would not consider increasing the grants.</P>

      <P>Deputy Callanan is correct.  I did give him a reply to Question No. 96 from Deputy Gallagher on the 2nd May, 1974.  I agree that the grants were pretty small and have been so for a number of years.  I believe the Deputies were correct in asking that something should be done.  There are 20 or 30 different housing grants.  I told the Deputies that the whole matter was under review by a committee set up for the purpose in an effort to try to bring the grants down to one or <Col N="1616" /> two in number.  While a report has come in, a final decision on the matter has not yet been made.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Furniture Industry.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>About a month ago I mentioned in the House that the difficulties in the furniture industry in Navan were reaching a crisis.  I was told that I was doing a disservice to the furniture industry by highlighting it.  At that time five people were let go.  When the Minister replied two of these had been taken back, so there was a net loss of three jobs.  Since then 30 people have been laid off in the town of Navan itself. There are quite a number on short time employment.  When one considers that Navan is the principal <Col N="1622" /> town involved in the furniture industry here in Ireland and employs a large number of people one notes that any recession in the furniture trade certainly affects the prosperity of Navan.</P>
      <P>In the past month there has been a deterioration of from three to 30 people who have been laid off from this industry.  This has serious consequences in the town.  One of the reasons for the slump has been that there has also been a slump in England.  It is legal to import furniture.  I contend that there is dumping in one form or another, legal or otherwise. The manufacturers tell me that since Christmas the rate of importation into this country has increased greatly.  The Minister's reply today was that there was no significant increase in furniture imports.  The firms tell me that there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of furniture coming into the country since Christmas and particularly in the last few months.</P>
      <P>One manufacturer who always gave a special offer at a sale three times a year to a firm in Dublin gave a quotation which was accepted. When they went to offer again they were told that they would have to have a look at the situation.  In a fortnight's time a telephone call was received to say that an English firm had got the order instead of them this year and the furniture was at a lower price than that quoted here last year.  When one takes into account the rapid increase in prices over the last 12 months it is disappointing to think that an English firm can ship furniture here and still sell at a lower price than the Irish firm quoted last year.  I consider that dumping.  This is having a detrimental effect on the furniture manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an order for 15 suites of furniture to come into the city in the last two weeks.  They came in but when the shopkeeper saw them he realised it was the wrong order.  He rang the firm and was told that they did not want the furniture returned but that they could have 33? per cent reduction on the 15 suites.  That may have been by design.  They may have <Col N="1623" /> wanted to get them out.  It may have been a pure accident but when a firm are prepared to give a reduction of 33? per cent I maintain that is dumping.</P>
    <P>The furniture that is coming in from England is of a kind which is the bread and butter of the Navan manufacturers.  When they cannot sell their products they must be very worried.  Since I mentioned the subject here numerous deputations have approached the Minister for Finance, who has passed on their representations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have copies of two letters which went to the Minister for Finance in order to try to get some concession for the manufacturers so that they could keep up production.</P>
    <P>Another factor which is affecting them is probably the concern of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is that furniture carries VAT at 19 per cent.  But in the case of new houses where the builder provides built-in furniture like cupboards, wardrobes and so on, VAT on that amounts to only 3.7 per cent.  The rate is 7.5 per cent but, because it is 45 per cent of the cost only, it is brought down to 3.7 per cent.  This is one of the ways in which it has hit them, as against the 19 per cent if they were selling direct to the trade or to the individual.</P>
    <P>Another very sore point is the fact of duty not having to be collected at the point of entrance of the product from England and other countries. When the furniture comes in they have not to pay duty on it until the product is actually sold.  Furniture manufacturers here feel that in respect of furniture coming in from England duty should be charged on the invoices at the point of entry. When Navan manufacturers send out furniture they have to put the rate of VAT on the invoices and, generally, it takes about 10½ weeks before they collect the money on the goods they have dispatched.  Therefore the VAT on the product has to be paid before they receive payment for the product.  This has to be done out of their own financial resources and, <Col N="1624" /> with bank lending tightening up, this is an added strain on them.  This question of the collection of duty at the point of entry has been raised on a number of occasions before.  I am told that, in the case of radio and electrical products coming into this country, the duty is collected at the point of entry.  We feel that because it is done in one industry it should be done in the others also and that there should be no exemption in respect of furniture coming into this country.  This is affecting the livelihood of our own furniture manufacturers and, to a large extent, the town of Navan because it is based mainly there.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which affects the industry as well.  This is in regard to furniture which has been sold to the counties nearest the Border such as Louth, Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim, but mainly Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, where a different situation obtains, in that furniture bought in the North of Ireland carries 10 per cent duty only whereas in the Republic it carries 19.5 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to intervene in a limited debate of this kind.  I have given the Deputy a lot of latitude in respect of the matters appertaining to VAT but I am bound to say that VAT is a matter for another Department altogether; it is not the responsibility of the Minister present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is one of the matters about which manufacturers feel sore but I shall take it elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is also the Government's policy&mdash;as outlined by the Report of the Central Bank&mdash;of rapid inflation that we have been experiencing in the past year.  This is affecting the furniture industry, as it does others also.  The furniture industry is the one being most harshly affected because it is, in the main, a small industry, in that the firms involved in it do not employ large staffs: they are all small firms employing perhaps five, ten or 20 people.  But in Navan there is the tradition of a skilled man, who has learned his trade and has <Col N="1625" /> done well in a firm, starting up on his own&mdash;possibly in his own back garden&mdash;and developing from there. Some such people have developed such small businesses to the point of becoming extremely large firms and excellent ones, over the years.  Some of those people now occupy factories in the industrial estate in Navan, having started in that way.  Therefore, it is the small &ldquo;bread-and-butter&rdquo; firms in the town of Navan which are really hit hardest by inflation and, on top of that, they are having to grapple with unfair competition from England where there is a slump and where they find it convenient to use this country to dump their products.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce should do something about this. It has been pointed out to him over the past months and today again.  He should try to do something to save this industry, which employs between 700 and 800 people in the town of Navan and surrounding areas.  The Minister will appreciate how serious the position is in that area; where one sees sales going down continuously and firms finding it harder and harder to sell their products.  They are looking to the Minister in the hope that he will be able to help them in some way to secure their livelihood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to avail myself of the few minutes left to say a few words in support of what Deputy Crinion has said on behalf of the furniture manufacturers and in the hope that anything more I shall say may get the Minister to realise how important it is to do something which might save the industry at this stage from the perilous condition in which it finds itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of factors have conspired recently to threaten the livelihood and existence of furniture manufacturing in this country.  The importation of cheaper furniture is one of them. This is something about which not much can be done because the rhythm of reduction in tariffs is something which industry generally has to expect. But it is possible that what Deputy Crinion tried to prove by way of <Col N="1626" /> question earlier today is true: that in the present economic climate across the channel industries there may be prepared to unload stocks at lower prices than they might otherwise if the home market or export markets generally were more buoyant.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile noting that in these days of rapidly rising prices, furniture from abroad is being sold on the market here cheaper than it was last year.  That does not at all tie in with continuously rising prices, rising wages which have caused manufacturing prices to rise, the rising cost of materials and everything connected with them, rising transport costs and so on.  In these circumstances it is difficult to explain to the public that imported furniture can be bought cheaper in some cases in Ireland today than was possible two years ago.  That is something not easily explained.  Certainly the manufacturers here must find it difficult to get an answer to that.  I think the inevitable answer one must come up with is that it is as a result of stock-piling in England, where the market has slowed down and exports generally have not been as buoyant as they were.  Whether one calls this dumping or not is something worth examining.</P>
    <P>I know that many of the things the Minister might have done in the past he is precluded from doing now under one regulation or another.  But there are some things which could be done.  To specify Irish made furniture for building at home would be of considerable help.  Also, to give to the trade all the assistance possible by way of the various agencies, such as the IDA, CTT and the design committee, would be a great help.  It is noticeable that the bread and butter lines are the ones most affected.  These are the ones that would be the least responsive to anything that might be done by way of improved design because it is the utility furniture&mdash; the young couples have not the resources to buy expensive furniture&mdash; which is purchased by these people. These are the lines the Minister should have examined.  While I am interested in the Navan furniture factory I should like to point out that <Col N="1627" /> there are other factories throughout the country.  I am interested in the industry in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two reactions.  The first I propose to name and then ignore it, and then to answer what has been raised.  My first reaction, which I do not intend to pursue, is to say that this Adjournment Debate is on Questions Nos. 44 and 45 on today's Order Paper. Question No. 44 asks if I am aware that dumping on the Irish market is having a detrimental effect and that many people have been laid off work or are on short-time working.  No effort was made to define dumping nor was there any effort made to indicate that it was occurring.</P>
      <P>The second question asks if, in view of the difficulties being faced in the furniture industry in this country, I will grant concessions to this industry to stimulate sales.  In the course of 20 minutes from an ex-Minister and a Deputy I did not hear suggestions of concessions to stimulate sales. However, the debate then became a matter of the condition of the furniture industry in Navan and elsewhere. About that I am as exercised as the Deputies.  Firstly, we should put the matter into context because I did express some disapproval, when Deputy Crinion had a previous question, about the potential damage of over-estimating and over-emphasising a difficult circumstance.  There is certainly a difficult circumstance in terms of export demand and in terms of home demand.  Nobody denies that and there is some unemployment and a threat to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan spoke of the &ldquo;perilous state the furniture industry has reached at the moment&rdquo;.  In January, 1973, there were 404 people unemployed in the furniture industry.  In January, 1974, there were 147 fewer unemployed in the furniture industry. In May, 1973, there were 51 more people unemployed than there were in May of this year.  I am certainly concerned, and the number of unemployed is rising but in the most <Col N="1628" /> recent month for which we have figures there was more employment in the furniture industry this year than there was a year ago.  I am not minimising the trouble but I am saying that we should not talk it up or frighten people who have some difficulties, who need courageous investment, courageous amalgamation policies and courageous new design policies. Let us not frighten them into a more shaky situation because, though it is not a good situation, neither is it one of crisis at the moment.  If people are talking about the loss of 900 jobs it is a very long way away from that.  Unemployment is lower now than it was a year ago.</P>
    <P>I should now like to talk about dumping.  We have a mechanism in Coimisiún Dumpála which I will invoke, instantly, and to the maximum rigour possible, if we hear of complaints about dumping.  Let me spell it out to Deputies&mdash;and I do not say I told you so but I was neither a protagonist of the AIFTA or of joining the EEC&mdash;that we have free trade and we have difficulties in free trade. Dumping is selling at less than companies sell for on the home market but even if that is proved we cannot act.  We can only act if we can prove injurious dumping.  If anyone, and I use this occasion to speak to Deputies on all sides and, through Deputies, to the furniture industry as a whole, has any evidence of dumping, please come forward with it quickly and we will pursue it to the limit of the legal possibilities within AIFTA and our membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>What has happened is not dumping in that sense.  What has happened is that British companies which are very big and have enormous volume, and have economies of scale and of purchasing, find very sharpening competition in their own market.  They are willing, in order to keep their volume up, to take much smaller margins and if they, therefore, put their products into the Irish market with much smaller margins too it is not dumping. It is knocking the hell out of our people but it is not dumping.  Of course that difficulty exists and I am not pretending it is an easy one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> As an indication of the concern of the Government not alone have a delegation from the Navan Furniture Industry Association seen the Minister for Finance, and he has been in touch with me, but they have also seen my Department.  They saw a senior officer of my Department on the 3rd of July.  I say the date to indicate that this is not a sort of instant response to something that happened yesterday because this happened more than two weeks ago.  In a subsequent radio interview which one of their spokesmen gave he enumerated the subjects he considered were the cause of some of the current difficulties.  They were the bus strike, which damaged trade in the centre of Dublin; recession in the building trade; materials shortage; materials prices and the operation of VAT.  He did not mention dumping at all and the people who came in acknowledged in the Department that in the technical sense under which I could act that they did not know of dumping.  If it does happen we will certainly act.</P>
    <P>What might we do constructively? Firstly, Deputies will be aware that the perilous nature of an industry with very many small producers&mdash;and people who know the Navan industry will know how fragmented it is&mdash;has been recognised for a long time.  It is not today or yesterday that we had the recommendations contained in the COIP report.  The core of the recommendations of the COIP people, because they recognised even before the present economic difficulties worldwide, before the price of oil went up, before the shortage of raw materials and the down-turn in the economy of many countries, was that the thing was fragmented.</P>
    <P>That report stated that unless there was a dramatic change in the present situation, either by way of increases in all round efficiency or by the establishment of some new projects, there would be a fall in employment in the existing labour force.  We have a lot of little fragmented firms.  I praised an initiative I saw at the Furniture Fair where, without losing their identity, companies were coming together to get in design teams <Col N="1630" /> into market.  In the end they can have the resources of the IDA, Fóir Teoranta and of our own Department, to solve the immediate difficulties.  I do not need to pledge that because the industry knows it has that.  In the end it is only by design, for which I have done what I can and will continue to do in regard to the Kilkenny Design Workshop and the other design facilities, by the activities of CTT in regard to design and in promoting exports, that the industry will succeed. Of course, all those agencies are at the service of the industry and I beg them to use them.</P>
    <P>We will instantly act about dumping if we can find it and we will use the rescue services in particular instances where they exist.  However the core of the matter is that they must get volume in purchasing and strength in marketing.  We are not saying, &ldquo;You must market&rdquo;, but we are saying: &ldquo;Please notice the example of instances where groups have formed either co-ops or loose alliances to get volume in purchasing, to get volume in marketing to be able to afford to pay the best designers even if it means paying a royalty on design and getting the volume up&rdquo;. It is in that way that salvation lies because we cannot do special things to protect our home market in Community circumstances beyond the proving of dumping.</P>
    <P>We are looking, but I do not hold out a great deal of hope, at the matter of the temporary quota import restrictions. But already there has been the two year extension of the transitional period under the AIFTA. That is being examined but I do not hold out great hope.  If there was specially subsidised money the queue would be around the block and the farmers, as Deputy Crinion knows, would be the first in it if we gave that to one sector.  For that reason I do not think that is a practical answer.</P>
    <P>I have passed this back to the industry. All the services of design, of financial aid, of management advice which are available through a number of agencies, and all the export aids and the immediate short term rescue service that we possess, are at the disposal <Col N="1631" /> of the industry.  They know it and we are monitoring it continuously. They are talking to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, about the VAT matter, and that is not a matter for me.  We can help them through short-term difficulties but no one must pretend to them that they can have a long-term survival in an on-going free trade situation unless they get design, volume, and purchasing and marketing strength through functioning in bigger groups either by amalgamation or by co-operative groupings.  There are some pioneer examples which I recommend to them.</P>
    <P>In the immediate difficulty we continue to monitor the position very carefully.  We do not see a crisis although we do see some deterioration in the position.  The services, whether it be design, financial, marketing, or management expertise, at the disposal of my Department, and other Departments, are available. We ask the furniture industry to make use of them to get through a difficult period when the British and the home market are much less satisfactory and much less profitable than they were in the recent past.</P>

      <P>At the meeting of the Council of Agricultural Ministers in Brussels on 15th and 16th July, a number of important decisions were taken in relation to beef.  These were:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Council has asked the Commission to suspend immediately until 1st November next imports from all sources of all cattle, beef and veal with the exception of certain quotas to which the Community is committed to import under the GATT.  Imports of beef for processing <Col N="1620" /> for re-export have been suspended.</P>
    <P>(2)  Member states may, if they so decide, give aid to recipients of social welfare benefits for the purchase of beef and veal and FEOGA will recoup 50 per cent of the expenditure incurred.</P>
    <P>(3)  If advertising and publicity campaigns to promote beef consumption are undertaken in member states during the coming 12 months, 50 per cent of the expenditure incurred will be recouped from FEOGA subject to an overall ceiling of approximately £1.4 million for the entire Community.</P>
    <P>(4)  Member states may, at their own option, grant a premium for orderly marketing of adult bovine animals, excluding cows, slaughtered during the period from 1st August, 1974, to 28th February, 1975.  The maximum premium authorised varies monthly, increasing progressively from about £9.20 per head in August to about £32.40 per head in February.  FEOGA will contribute from November onwards towards the cost of the premium in each member state at the rate of 50 per cent of the maximum premium authorised for the months of November and December increasing to 60 per cent in January and to 70 per cent in February. FEOGA will make no contribution to the cost of the premium in the months of August, September and October except in the case of Ireland where FEOGA will, exceptionally, make a contribution at the rate of 50 per cent of the maximum premium authorised for each of those months if the UK operates the scheme in those months.  Meat of animals in respect of which a premium is paid will not be admitted for offer to an intervention agency.  Details of the scheme are to be worked out during the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Commission proposes to take certain other measures to help the beef market, namely, the sale of intervention beef at reduced prices to non-profit making institutions and organisations, the allocation <Col N="1621" /> of quantities of canned beef products from intervention stocks of food aid under the World Food Programme and the intensification of its policy in relation to exports.</P>
    <P>In regard to pigmeat the Council agreed to bring forward from 1st November, 1974&mdash;probably to 1st October&mdash;the increase in the basic price for pig carcases already fixed for the 1974-75 marketing year.  The support for publicity and advertising campaigns for beef will include such campaigns for pigmeat and, as in the case of beef, imports of pigmeat for processing for re-export have been suspended.  The Council also adopted a recommendation urging member states to reduce where possible the average weight of pig carcases marketed.</P>
    <P>Ministers had a general exchange of views on the future sugar policy of the Community but no decisions were reached and the discussion will be resumed at the next meeting of the Council in September.</P>
    <P>I made a request to the Council to change, for the purposes of the Common Agricultural Policy, the representative rate for the Irish pound. This request will now be examined by the Commission within whose competence rests the responsibility for making the necessary proposal to the Council in the matter.</P>
    <P>In addition the Council had a brief discussion on the effects of the energy crisis on agriculture and adopted certain decisions in the wine sector.</P>
