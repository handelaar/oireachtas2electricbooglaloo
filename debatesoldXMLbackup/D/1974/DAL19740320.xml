      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of land holdings in the Republic of over 500 acres; the number of holdings of over 1,000 acres; the size in acres of the largest holding of land; and the total acreage of land held by people who own 1,000 acres or more.</P>

      <P>The particulars requested by the Deputy are not available.  The most relevant information available concerning the number of land holdings in different acreage groups is compiled from the particulars obtained in the quinquennial censuses of agriculture.  The most recent agricultural census was taken in June, 1970.  In compiling the results the largest size group used was &ldquo;above 300 statute acres&rdquo; and there were 2,502 holdings in this category in 1970.  The size groups specified by the Deputy were not distinguished separately in the classification and neither was a specific record made of the size of the largest holding.</P>

      <P>With regard to the long-term question of accommodation at Bolton Street, I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 28th November, 1973, to his earlier question.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The number of children attending the school at present is not sufficient for the appointment of an assistant teacher in the normal way.  However, it is understood that there are children over four years of age on the island who are not attending school but who would do so if a second teacher were appointed.  In the special circumstances and because of the difficulty in attracting teachers to island schools we are in communication with the manager regarding the appointment of a second teacher.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers at present enrolled in Kilmihil Vocational School would not justify the approval of a senior cycle course in the school.  A suitable school transport <Col N="367" /> service to schools in Kilrush is available to pupils of the area who wish to follow such a course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is a falling enrolment here.  The school has 70 boys on the roll.  The Department have a policy of trying to ensure that there are a reasonable number of senior cycle courses in the country and Kilmihil would not qualify for one of those courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As pupils cannot pursue the senior cycle course at this school, they have to go to Ennis or Kilrush, and this results in reducing the number of pupils anxious to enrol for vocational education.  Is the Minister aware that the attendance rate at this school has decreased rapidly over the last few years?  This is an isolated area and further consideration should be given to the points raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share and appreciate the Deputy's concern but it is only honest to say that this matter has been pursued by a number of Deputies from all sides of the House over the past three or four years.  I am not prepared to hold out any hope of a change of policy in this matter.</P>

Surely he will also agree that, irrespective of the merits involved, a person who formerly had a very responsible position should not be left without any remuneration at all for a period now in excess of six months.

I have arranged in consultation with the Reverend Manager, to have an inspector of my Department visit the area and meet parents of the children attending the school to discuss the amalgamation proposals.  I shall review the situation following that meeting.</P>

The average age for the transfer of pupils from primary to secondary schools is also lower than it used to be in former years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to remedial teaching facilities for primary school children is that there are at present 230 full-time teachers recognised for this work in primary schools throughout the country.  It is proposed to create another 106 full-time posts in primary schools in the coming school year. These posts are being allocated to the schools where the greatest need is arising, whether these schools be located in urban or rural districts. The situation is reviewed from year to year.</P>
      <P>Apart from these full-time posts remedial teaching is organised in a number of schools on a part-time basis where teachers are free from ordinary class duties for certain periods during the day.  In addition, Saturday morning schemes have been set up on a pilot basis in Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath to cater for primary school children from rural areas who have not full-time remedial teaching schemes available to them. These schemes will be extended by degrees to other areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At secondary level, my Department has organised a programme of in-service training in remedial teaching <Col N="395" /> for secondary teachers.  The first course in this programme was given in the autumn term of the 1971-72 school year.  Some 154 teachers have attended such courses since then and are at present engaged in remedial teaching in their schools.  It is intended that this type of in-service training will continue as a regular feature of the programme to assist under-achieving and less able pupils. Nominations for places on the course are invited from the conductors of all secondary schools and my Department while taking cognisance of varying needs, does not discriminate as between rural and urban schools in the selection of teachers for the courses.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the primary schools, the suitability and adequacy of the provision for remedial education at secondary level is under continuous review.</P>

I think this is a very good record.</P>
      <P>As regards recognition of these problems, as the Deputy is aware, primary teachers will in future undergo a three-year course which will enable them, perhaps, to recognise with even greater acuity than previously problems such as those referred to by the Deputy.</P>

As the project is for five years obviously we cannot speed it up but I would point out to the House that, as a result of the Minister's initiative, a special group has been set up in the Department under my general direction to consider the whole matter of educational priority areas and the possibility that special provision might be made for deprived children in these areas.  The possibility of providing pre-school education is one of the matters being considered.</P>

      <P>There is very little I wish to say except that I do not propose to accept the amendment.  I believe the section as it stands is adequate for the job it was intended to do.  I said the amendment would not do any harm but neither would it do any good.  It is not a question of my being awkward about the matter; the section as it stands is adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister reported progress we were discussing this amendment.  I understood at that stage he was about to make an observation on a suggestion I made to him that he might have another look at the section over the weekend with a view to seeing whether the addition of the words &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo; or &ldquo;within each such specified constituency&rdquo; might improve the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the discussion the Minister indicated that he did not think the addition of those words made any appreciable difference.  He indicated they would not take from the section or interfere with its meaning and that, consequently, there would not be any point in his accepting our amendment.  On the last occasion we spent a considerable <Col N="401" /> amount of time endeavouring to get across to the Minister that there was quite a lot in this amendment.  In view of the fact that on the last occasion the Minister had not an opportunity of discussing that aspect of the amendment I had hoped that on this occasion he would have something more to say.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister states he does not think the addition of the words would make much difference, I suggest to him that they would make an appreciable difference.  I endeavoured to outline for him the instance in a Dublin area where a polling district that was formerly in one electoral area would now be in three different constituencies and that it was necessary to include the words &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo; or a variation of those words.  I had hoped the Minister would offer an observation, indicating how he considered the addition of the words in question would not substantially improve the section.</P>

      <P>On this side of the House we consider the amendment will do much to improve the wording of the Bill and make it more understandable to the man in the street, the person to whom this Bill is directed.  In the Official Report of the 6th March, in reply to Deputy Molloy's proposal, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The position about Deputy Molloy's amendment is that it does no harm but it does no good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to take the Minister's argument to its conclusion, that the amendment does no harm, surely the Minister can accept the proposal.  We believe the amendment will do much good and, in order to prevent long debate on this question, the Minister might reconsider the matter.  We have no desire to have a prolonged debate on this or any other section.  It is our duty as an Opposition to try to improve legislation which comes before this House.  In our opinion Deputy Molloy's amendment considerably clarifies this particular subsection. The Minister said the amendment would do neither good nor harm. <Col N="402" /> Surely he could accept it then.  We, on these benches, believe it will improve this piece of legislation.  The Minister asked what the point was in making this change; what is there has worked well.  I am paraphrasing his remarks.  I do not think the Minister should be tied to decisions made in the past because many decisions have been changed in due process of time. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment and let us get on to debating the other sections of the Bill. Legislation should be clear-cut and easily understandable by the general public.  We are seeking to make this piece of legislation easily understandable. That is the basis of the proposed amendment.  We believe it will improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>One of the most astonishing features of this debate has been the silence of Government backbenchers. We have now reached section 7 and, with the exception of the Minister, there have been very few contributors from the Government benches.  It has fallen to the Opposition to debate the Bill.  It is also interesting to note that the paucity of contributions from the Government benches is demonstrated by the absence of every Deputy in the Coalition parties with the exception of the Minister.</P>

      <P>There are meetings going on and that was the Deputy's own complaint when he was a Whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I always tried to maintain a House when I was a Whip to avoid quorum bells.  Reflecting on what Deputy Belton said, it is interesting to note that every single Deputy in the Coalition group was at a meeting when I called for a House. That is what Deputy Belton is suggesting.  I have no intention of disobeying the Chair and I will come back now to the amendment before the House.  The reasons for the amendment have already been admirably argued by Deputy Molloy last week and by Deputy Lalor today; the latter is standing in for Deputy Molloy because Deputy Molloy is ill. The arguments have also been put by Deputy Burke and others on this side of the House, arguments clearly proving that the Minister should accept this very reasonable amendment. The amendment, as set out in the Order Paper, reads as follows:</P>
      <P>a.1.  In page 3, subsection (1) (a), line 20, after &ldquo;districts&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;within such specified constituency.</P>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy Robert Molloy is a very explicit and reasonable amendment. With respect to you, Sir, and the other Members of this House, as I understood it when I came in here as a reasonably young Deputy&mdash;I am not putting forward the case that I have any more experience since that time &mdash;the easier and more comprehensible a Bill was made, the better it was from the point of view of everyone concerned with it.  The persons concerned with this Bill are the electorate of this country.  On those grounds, we suggest that the amendment in the name of Deputy Robert Molloy is quite clear and unequivocal in the expression it gives to the idea that legislation in this House should be understandable on first reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> In quite a lot of his contributions the Minister has mentioned the inevitable man in the street.  If he were to go outside this House and present his draft, as proposed, of section 7 subsection (1) (a) to the first ten men or women in the street, they would not understand it.  If he were to do the same thing, having redrafted it after insertion of Deputy Molloy's amendment, it would be my view that on an instant poll, as it were, six or seven of these ten men or women in the street so canvassed would understand the Bill.  I think this is a fair test.  I do not suggest that the House should adjourn for a minute or two and that the Minister should rush out with any of his civil servants to conduct such a poll.  But I would respectfully suggest that that would be the end of such a poll if conducted.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to accept Deputy Molloy's very reasonable amendment.  It is one which got quite a considerable amount of airing over a number of hours here on another occasion.  If we could prevail upon the Minister to accept this amendment, it would constitute a gesture of goodwill towards the Opposition.  The Minister has a difficult enough job to do to carry this Bill through the House and it would not be our intention to obstruct him in any way.  Anything we have to say to him will be constructive rather than destructive or obstructive.  The other reason we believe the Minister should accept this amendment is that it is a better piece of drafting than that proposed in the Bill as it now stands.</P>
    <P>To come back to the point I was making about the comprehensibility of legislation in this House, I think the amendment proposed by Deputy Molloy is crystal clear.  It leaves no impression of confusion on anybody's mind and that should be the end result of any amendments drafted or indeed of any legislation proposed in Dáil Éireann.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister to have another look at this amendment.  Unfortunately, I was absent on the last occasion and did not really have time to peruse the contributions made on the amendment proposed by Deputy Molloy and <Col N="405" /> the section in the Bill proposed by the Minister.  The Minister may have said or implied that he would take another look at Deputy Molloy's amendment. Can the Minister say whether he and his advisers actually had a look at Deputy Molloy's amendment in depth? As I understand it, one of the reasons the Minister may give for not accepting Deputy Molloy's amendment is that the drafting in the Bill, as it stands now, was there in the last Constituencies Bill which came before the House.  It is my respectful submission that that is not a good enough reason for not accepting what we would consider to be an improvement on what was good then and what we consider to be bad now.  Fianna Fáil, when in Government, proposed what the Minister proposes in section 7 subsection (1) (a) and now, finding themselves in opposition, are proposing an alternative.  I hope the Minister would not think for one moment that because we proposed that new amendment we were being in any way obstructive.  Having judged the merits of the subsection under consideration and having set that against our proposed amendment, we consider ours to be the better.  As Dáil proceedings were interrupted on the last occasion by a weekend during which Government Ministers had to involve themselves in public duties outside this House, perhaps the Minister did not have an opportunity to study Deputy Molloy's amendment in depth.  I would ask him at least to concede that there is some merit in it and not put forward the argument to us that because something was there on the last occasion when a Bill of this nature came before the House it should be here again before us in 1974.  I would appeal to the Minister, who is generally a reasonable man, to have another look at Deputy Molloy's amendment. Of course, I cannot speak for what action we may take on the acceptance or non-acceptance of this amendment by the Minister but I would urge him to concede that it has some merit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Being a reasonable man, I listened to the debate for two-and-a half hours the last evening and again <Col N="406" /> for half an hour today.  The last day I said it would not do any harm; it would not do any good and I would not change for change sake.  Following that discussion, I did take another look at it.  I could not find anything to change my mind and, since repetition is not allowed in the House, there is nothing new I can say about it and nothing new, I would suggest, that can be said from the far side of the House either.  Therefore, I do not propose to break the Rules of Order by repeating the argument I made before.  I do not propose to accept the amendment because I do not believe it would improve the situation at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, repetition is the mother of study and, whilst I agree that that is not enshrined in our Standing Orders, it is not my intention to repeat myself.  The Minister has said&mdash;comparing his draft with that of ours&mdash;there is nothing wrong with our amendment.  If there is nothing wrong with our amendment, would he not then throw out a humble crumb to the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to encourage us to bring about perfection in the Bill in the drafting sense?  We do not accept for one moment that the Bill is perfect.  We believe it is an imperfect instrument to maintain the Coalition Parties in Government in the years ahead.  Of course, we do not accept that that will happen but that is the intention of it.  Here we had the Minister saying, in his contribution no less than five minutes ago, that like for like, one section is as good as the other.  We would ask the Minister on the basis of his goodwill towards the Opposition to accept Deputy Molloy's very reasonable and reasoned amendment.</P>

In a balancing situation we are convinced that the change would be a worthwhile one and the Minister states that he can see nothing wrong with it.  I am sure he will agree that the balance is in our favour.  Therefore, I appeal to him to accept it.  I have no doubt that he is anxious to proceed with this Bill and we are anxious to facilitate him. If we were to accept this amendment we could move to the next section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped when the Minister listened to the very worthwhile contribution made by Deputy Andrews that he would have agreed to accept Deputy Molloy's amendment.  The Minister in Volume 270, at column 2286, of the Official Report for 6th March, 1974, said in reply to comments made by Deputy Cunningham and me:</P>
      <P>I do not know if Deputy Burke dislikes me or if he will dislike my successor whoever that may be, but I cannot understand why he thinks this power should not be given to a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately I was not in the House when the Minister made this comment. I should like to assure the House that I have no personal animosity towards the Minister.  I respect him as a hard working man, trying to do his best in his job.  I may not always agree with what he does but that in no way would suggest personal animosity. I have seen the Minister operating and I would like to pay him this tribute&mdash; it will probably be the last one he will get from me&mdash;he has brought more legislation before the House than any other Minister.  Most of the other Ministers are conspicuous by the small amount of legislation they have introduced. The Minister for Local Government has brought in the Motorways Bill, the Planning Bill, the Electoral Amendment Bill and <Col N="408" /> Orders.  We do not agree with many of these Orders, especially the Local Electoral Areas Orders, where he butchered many of the local electoral divisions for the local government elections which he has since announced for the 18th June.  We had hoped that he would have accepted the proposals which were put up to him by the various local authorities. The Minister has not accepted these proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure the Minister that my contribution to the debate on this section was not made with any sense of animosity towards or dislike for the Minister. My contribution, as all the other contributions from this side of the House, was made in good faith, hoping that the Minister would see our point of view on an amendment which, in our opinion, would improve this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister is and always has been a man of the people.  He has a reputation for being in touch with his constituents. If the Minister's constituents were to read the section as proposed by him and then to read the section with the amendment proposed by Deputy Molloy, I am sure the majority of them would agree that Deputy Molloy's amendment would vastly improve the section.</P>
      <P>As I said on section 6, this is an Electoral (Amendment) Bill dealing with the electorate.  It should be easy to understand any legislation dealing with the rights and duties of people and it is a duty of citizens to vote as well as a right.  Deputy Molloy's amendment is a clarification of the section.  The Minister said in Volume 270, column 2264, of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The position about Deputy Molloy's amendment is that it does no harm but it does no good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel that this amendment not only does no harm but it does a lot of good.  The Minister is, to quote Deputy Andrews, &ldquo;a very reasonable man&rdquo;.  To speed up the passage of <Col N="409" /> this legislation the Minister should, on reconsideration, accept Deputy Molloy's amendment.  He says that it does no good but anything that clarifies legislation to make it more easily understandable to the man-in-the-street is doing a lot of good.  Even taking the negative side, as the Minister says, it does no harm.  Surely this is enough to have the Minister accept Deputy Molloy's amendment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (1) without the amendment reads:</P>
    <P>Where a polling district existing at the passing of this Act is not wholly situate within one of the constituencies specified in the Schedule to this Act, the appropriate officer, after consultation with the returning officer for the constituency concerned, shall, with respect to the part of the polling district situate in a constituency so specified&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) join it or parts of it with any adjoining polling district or districts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy suggests the addition of the words &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo;.  Surely those four words improve that piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I understand that legislation is drafted by parliamentary draftsmen who do their job as they see it.  They have legal training and legal minds and they think of things in legalistic terms.  The Minister is a representative of the people and he is introducing legislation which should be easily understood by the people.  I suggest that there are many people who, having read the section as proposed by the Minister six or seven times, would not understand it.  I suggest that the vast majority of people would understand much better what the Minister has in mind if he would agree to this amendment. He admits that these four words would do no harm.  Having had an opportunity to reconsider it, I am hoping that the Minister will change his decision.  It is essential that the wording of legislation should be simple and straightforward.</P>

      <P>I find it extremely difficult to be satisfied that we are getting across to the Minister the point and the purpose of our amendment because of the closed door attitude the Minister is adopting to it.  Previously I endeavoured to show quite clearly why it is so necessary to add the words in our amendment to the section.  Deputy Andrews has clearly indicated that the section would be more comprehensive and more clear if the proposed words were added to it.  It appears that the Minister is quite adamant in refusing to give specific reasons for not accepting it.  He said he would be accused of repetition if he gave specific reasons.  I read the Official Report of the debate on this amendment and at no stage did the Minister make any genuine effort to give specific reasons for not accepting the amendment.</P>
      <P>He said that section 7 is exactly the same as section 7 of the 1969 Act and that, if it was good enough then, it should be good enough now.  According to the Press, the First Stage of a Bill will be introduced in this House tomorrow morning by the Government because it has been found by the Supreme Court that a Bill introduced and passed by the Fianna Fáil Government in the 1930s is defective.  We never questioned that Bill before.  Had the Minister or his colleagues been introducing a similar Bill and using a section from the 1936 or 1937 Act and endeavouring to sell it to the House on the basis that: &ldquo;It was good enough before; you people introduced it at that time and now you are finding fault with it&rdquo;, we would not have known it was defective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's colleagues have said that certain Acts on the Statute Book need to be updated.  We are endeavouring to update this section.  So far no fault has been found with the operation of section 7 of the 1969 Act. Because of that the Minister says: &ldquo;It was good enough for you people before.  It was good enough over the past four or five years and it is still good enough.&rdquo; That type of argument is not sufficient, especially in view of the fact that the Minister has no genuine fault to find with the amendment. This afternoon Deputy Andrews <Col N="411" /> and Deputy Faulkner asked the Minister for an assurance that between now and Report Stage he would give serious and favourable consideration to an amendment of the section on the lines outlined by us.</P>
    <P>That is a very reasonable request and it makes it quite clear that we are satisfied that an occasion may arise&mdash; on the last occasion I endeavoured to give the House an idea of how that occasion might arise&mdash;when the wording of section 7 (1) (a) might be found to be defective.  Deputy Molloy's amendment would prevent that situation arising in which we could have difficulty in regard to a polling district in one constituency in the Dublin city and county area, with a polling district being broken off and separated into three sections, with one section representative of 150 voters going into one of the Dublin constituencies, another with 100 voters going into another constituency, and the remaining 50 to 200 going into a third constituency.</P>
    <P>Through the media the Government seem to be very anxious to sound out public opinion with opinion polls.  We are now developing towards Government by opinion poll.  It was suggested that the Minister should present section 7 to the ordinary man in the street and section 7 with the amendment added.  If he did so, there is no doubt that ten out of ten reasonable people would accept that the section as amended would make far more logical and objective reading and be far more understandable from the point of view of the man in the street. That recommendation, coming, as it did, from a legal expert should even sell far better than coming from me, not being a legal expert.  Deputy Andrews is a legal expert.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>On electoral law the parliamentary draftsmen are attached to the office of the Attorney General and the officials of the Minister's Department, while they are very knowledgable people on whom I would not reflect in any way, are not the legal experts which he referred to by way of interruption.  Deputy Andrews is as legally qualified to comment and to make logical, intelligent and reasonable suggestions.  He is as qualified to do that as any normal expert within the Department of Local Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister's immediate reaction to this amendment was that section 7 in its entirety was an exact replica of section 7 of the 1969 Act and that should be good enough for us.  This is what all the contention is about. There has not been any problem between 1969 and now in relation to section 7.  The Minister has made a great muck up, mess up and running up of narrow streets separating constituencies in Dublin and to such an extent that it is necessary to have spelled out what is suggested in our amendment the words &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those words are necessary in order to make this section a properly interpreted one.  This is why we are so <Col N="413" /> adamant and are endeavouring to be so persuasive and convincing with the Minister.  We are doing this in order to help the Minister to have an unchallengeable piece of legislation finally enacted even though we know that in helping him in section 7 we are helping him in his overall design, which will, as Deputy Andrews has said, prove fruitless, to eliminate the Fianna Fáil Party.  At one stage&mdash; there is no point in quoting it here&mdash; the Minister expressed the hope that the plan would succeed in squeezing out Deputy Molloy.</P>
    <P>The situation here is that if we on this side of the House could get an assurance from the Minister that between now and Report Stage he would be willing to have a rethink in relation to this particular amendment it would be worth while.  I threw out this suggestion to the Minister on the last day and, unfortunately, the gong sounded before he got an opportunity to reply.  At that stage I suggested that the Minister should take the few days in between to have a serious look at this amendment without being imbused with his normal reaction to a Fianna Fáil suggestion; that anything that comes from Fianna Fáil must be contrived in order to create problems for him and, therefore, can be of no use.</P>
    <P>The Minister had similar views to ours in 1969 in relation to this section. Our amendment is submitted with a view to having a particular problem, which the Minister had in 1969, solved.  While the Minister's views in 1969 dealt specifically with the section itself, we feel that the worries he had at that time could be cleared up by his acceptance of our amendment. This is where our amendment comes in very solidly.  We have the Minister's own request of 1969 to substantiate our request now.  Are quotations in order on Committee Stage?</P>

      <P>It is terrible that a Minister who finds it so hard to get people into the House to back him should condemn a Fianna Fáil Deputy who was listening patiently here for quite a while.  I was endeavouring to draw attention to the fact that one of the purposes of this amendment must be fully appreciated by the Minister because <Col N="415" /> on the 5th February when the previous Bill was being discussed he had a similar worry and raised what I feel are similar questions in relation to this particular section.  At column 273 of the Official Report of 5th February, 1965, the then Deputy Tully said:</P>
      <P>Could the Minister do anything about this problem, possibly in this Bill, or, if not, in some future Bill, where there are polling districts crossing?  The result of these proposals before the House is that people living in certain areas could be voting several miles away in the heart of another constituency.  This is a peculiar situation that has arisen because of the way in which the boundary map is drawn up. Could the Minister try to have constituencies or electoral areas straightened out in some way so that this will not keep on recurring?</P>

      <P>Nobody is more of an expert on arm-chancing than the Minister.  Peculiarly enough he was in an awkward position on that occasion in 1969 because he raised that matter on section 6 and he was told that it was provided for in section 7.  He had to raise the matter again during the discussion on section 7 when he said:</P>
      <P>The Minister says this is dealt with here.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 provides that where a polling district is split between two or more constituencies suitable polling arrangements will be made for the voters concerned either by joining a part or parts of the divided district with an adjoining district or districts or by constituting <Col N="416" /> each divided part as a separate polling district.  The provision is necessary because of the time taken in the ordinary course for going through the ordinary procedure for making a polling scheme.</P>

If the Chair had the particular extract my point could be seen.  There is not much more of it so with your permission, in an effort to make the point, I will read on.  The Minister further stated:</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides that any such arrangement is temporary and will have effect only until such new polling schemes are made.  Any such arrangement will be subject to the sanction of the Minister as are polling schemes, and will come into effect only following the dissolution of the Dáil following the passing of this Bill.  Under the 1961 Act, these temporary arrangements fell to be made by the returning officers because, at that time, the returning officer was, in nearly all cases, the registration officer.  The registration authority is now the county or county borough council.</P>

      <P>Does that cover what the Deputy has in mind?</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully then said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, no.  I am referring to districts such as one in my constituency. People who are living, for instance, in a district known as Balreask, south of Carlanstown, County <Col N="417" /> Meath have to travel through the Monaghan constituency and have to vote miles away.  A simple adjustment would have enabled these people to remain in either one constituency or the other.</P>
    <P>This is what we are talking about.  A simple adjustment.  We are trying to help the Minister and to ensure that he will not have this sort of crib the next time the constituencies are being revised, when our Minister for Local Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

His argument is the best possible argument, the most realistic and down-to-earth argument.  It apparently has happened now that Ministers, after a very short time, have forgotten that they were ever on this side of the House and cannot see any sort of sense being made on this side of the House.  The Minister for Local Government often reminds us that he was on this side of the House.  In a short 12 months he has forgotten that a lot of sense can be spoken from over here. If he does not accept that it means he was talking a lot of nonsense in 1969.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing my best to stick to it.  While our amendment deals with a polling district &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo; the situation is that whatever there is a polling district there is the necessity to create a polling place for it or to have it joined in with an adjoining polling district.  I am endeavouring to help the Minister to be more specific and to allow him to meet the argument he made in 1969 about polling districts or about a polling place.  I am satisfied that I have made my point.  We have already established that the polling place does not have to be within the polling district even though the recommended thing is to have it within the polling district.  I hope that even at this late stage the Minister will see the merit in Deputy Molloy's amendment and the justification for it.  The addition of the words we propose would cut out any question of ambiguity in relation to the section.  If the words are not included, there is the ambiguity that so worried the present Minister for Local Government in 1969.  That is why I used this occasion to refer the Minister back to the time when he was on this side of the House.  I would ask the Minister to indicate that the message is filtering through and we will not hold it against him that he has on more than one occassion said that he does not propose to accept the amendment, despite the fact that he does not see any harm in it, simply because it is a Fianna Fáil amendment.  I would ask him again, in the light of this fresh evidence&mdash;if you like, at his own request&mdash;to have another look at this with a view to accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like repetition and you do not like repetition, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, so it is your job to ensure that it is not carried on but I repeated on more than one occassion the last day, and with your permission <Col N="419" /> I am afraid I will have to do it again, a few facts which apparently the people opposite do not want to see.  I am prepared to accept the fact that members of the Opposition will, one after another, get up and make comments, whether they believe in them or not, simply for the purpose of delaying the passage of the Bill.  They began rather roughly but they are being quite nice about it and if they want to do that and if the House allows them that is their privilege. What I dislike is somebody like Deputy Lalor attempting to produce a document and to talk about when the 1969 Bill was passed.  Indeed, several other members of the Fianna Fáil Party spoke about the 1969 Amendment Bill as if it were the Bill we are amending.  We are talking today about a Bill which I introduced and this section has been in existence since 1935 and every election held since 1935 has been held under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lalor tried to argue that I objected to anything suggested by Fianna Fáil and in the next breath he said that I was insisting that this section should be left in because Fianna Fáil introduced it and what was good enough for Fianna Fáil should be good enough for us now.  I will not try to follow that line of argument.  I should like to point out, however, that the quotation he read out from what I said on the 1969 Bill referred to an entirely different matter.  Before he finished reading it, I think he was aware of this and was rather embarrassed to find that this was so.  I am sure the backroom boys who produced it and told him it was the right thing will probably hear a few hard words from him for giving him something which had no relevance to what was under discussion.  In passing, I am sure Deputy Lalor will be glad to know that Meath County Council by a recent change in electoral areas have remedied the position and this no longer applies in regard to local areas and I am remedying it in this Bill regarding constituencies because these people will be all in the one constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Lalor and other <Col N="420" /> Deputies have been talking about cannot happen because we do not straddle electoral areas with voters. They must vote in their own constituency or, occasionally, there will be a polling booth across a border but they will still be voting for the candidates of their own constituency. There is absolutely no reason why I should agree to accept an amendment which, as I have said more than once, does no harm or no good.  It would add a couple of words to a Bill.  Why should we just&mdash;as Deputy Andrews, I think, said&mdash;do something because Fianna Fáil wanted it done&mdash;change the wording of a Bill when it does not improve the Bill?  I assure the Opposition that in the case of any Bill introduced if they can prove that they are proposing something to improve it, I am prepared to accept, as I have done already, a reasonable amendment.  The amendment suggested is ludicrous and it has simply been introduced as a way to discuss something.  I am quite sure those opposite who are intelligent are well aware that they are discussing something which would in no way improve the Bill.  The reason we are discussing the Bill here is so that we can be in a position, if there is something that will improve it, to put it in but there is nothing in the amendment that will achieve this purpose.  Therefore, I say to the Opposition: would you not grow up and not continue a discussion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which you know as well as I do cannot improve the Bill? The arguments of the Opposition do not appear to be coming from reasonable people; they must know the words suggested will not improve the Bill.  Why, therefore, continue arguing to have them inserted, as one or two Deputies said, whether they would improve it or not&mdash;jut to put them in because Fianna Fáil want them in?  That is going a little too far. The section as it stands is, and has been proved to be adequate to do the job and I see no reason why I should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>We have discussed this <Col N="421" /> amendment and section at great length.  I am unhappy about it in this way: recently the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kelly, stated that the cost per hour of this House was £1,000.  In our desire on this side of the House to improve this legislation we have given it great thought and the Minister has said the amendments would not do the Bill any harm.  I do not think it has been suggested that he should accept it because Fianna Fáil proposed it, at any rate as a primary reason.  We feel that if the amendment is accepted it will give better legislation.

      <P>I am just referring to what has happened and can happen in the case of the present Bill.  If we do not take note of objections we may have some citizen contesting the matter in the Supreme Court and having the Bill rejected and a new Bill introduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister told me the other night that in my own constituency we have a polling district which crosses a boundary.  I remind the Minister that a person living quite close to that district did contest an electoral Bill in the High Court and won his case and that is why we do not have numbers on ballot paper counterfoils now.  We could have, and almost surely would have somebody contesting this Bill outside the House.  In this day of consensus politics it is fashionable for people to appeal to the Supreme Court more frequently than previously. Therefore, it is incumbent on this House to ensure that legislation will be as perfect as we can make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> I can assure the Minister on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Deputies that it is not their intention or desire to add extra words to the Bill.  We are trying to help the Minister to perfect the work he has brought before us.  It is unworthy to think we would have any ulterior motive in doing this.  We do not seek any benefit from the Bill for ourselves but we suggest that if the Minister accepts the amendment it will make the legislation better enabling us all to go to the country realising that we have done our best to give the people the best legislation possible.  Even at this late stage I appeal to the Minister to accept this simple amendment which he says will do no harm and we can then move on to other sections.  By contrast, I was very impressed with the Minister's approach to the Local Government Planning Bill on which he said that he would accept any worthwhile amendment. Why not adopt the same principle here?</P>

We are asking the Minister <Col N="423" /> to insert: &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo;.  That might seem to be a rather obvious thing to have to write into a Bill especially in relation to this section but the Minister has a colleague in the Government, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who very often is not aware of what constituency he is in or even of what country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister for Local Government may be annoyed we have spent so much time discussing this matter.  He may see some ulterior motive in it but I can assure him we have no ulterior motive.

      <P>The Deputy will have his opportunity.  The purpose of this amendment is to state as unambiguously as possible what this subsection means.  In legislation nothing should be left to the imagination and that is why this amendment has been tabled.  We do not want any doubts as to what is intended.  The Minister admits the amendment would not do any harm.  I believe it would do a great deal of good.  It is a worthwhile amendment.  The Minister should accept it and let us get on with the business.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be apprehensive about accepting amendments from this side of the House because his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, may not feel all that happy with them and castigate the Minister accordingly.  We can assure the Minister that the people, and the people are our masters, will appreciate the fact that he is big enough to accept amendments even when those amendments are tabled by the Opposition. This is a simple amendment which will not call for any fundamental theological change in the thinking of either the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party.  It will have the effect of tidying up this legislation. It will make the subsection more easily understood because constituencies will have to be specified.  If the amendment is accepted, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will not again be confused as to which constituency he is in.  If only to guide him and make sure he does not stray the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>

It is certainly very relevant where my constituency is concerned because it will have to be clearly defined and there will be no confusion about polling stations.  This legislation may have <Col N="427" /> been good enough in 1969, but it is not good enough today.  In 1969 the dividing line was the railway line from Dublin to Galway and the main road up to Athlone.  That was clearly defined.</P>

      <P>That is correct.  It is to that I am referring.  In East Galway you could have people in two or, in some cases, three polling districts if the Minister does not accept this amendment.  One polling booth could be situated in three constituencies&mdash; West Galway, Clare and East Galway. That is why I say we must be very definite and specific.  The Minister sees no harm in the amendment.  Seeing no harm in it, the least he ought to do is accept it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister came into the debate on a very moderate note but the note grew less moderate as he proceeded. Deputy Lalor pointed out that when the Minister was on this side of the House he expressed himself as unhappy about the wording of the section in the 1969 Bill.  The Minister said that that was the 1969 Bill but this wording has been in many Bills right up from 1935.  That, of course, does not necessarily mean that it is the proper wording.  There was an occasion on which an Electoral (Amendment) Bill was brought before <Col N="428" /> the High Court and it was found that certain sections of that Bill were unconstitutional. Who is to say that a similar fate may not overtake this measure?  We are not suggesting it will.</P>

It is the job of an Opposition to ensure that legislation is clear, precise and unambiguous.  Deputy Molloy, unfortunately, cannot be with us today. He is ill.

      <P>The Minister said that evening that the amendment did no harm.  We feel strongly that it does a lot of good.  The Minister went on to say that evening that it did no good.  The explanatory memorandum to the Electoral Amendment (No. 2) Bill, 1973, says of sections 6 and 7:</P>
      <P>Sections 6 and 7 contain the usual consequential measures for re-arrangement of headings of the register of electors and for alteration of polling schemes.</P>
      <P>The important words there are &ldquo;the usual consequential measures&rdquo;, &ldquo;usual&rdquo; because they were in the Bill of 1935 right up to 1969.  The fact that they were not contested by the then Opposition does not necessarily mean they were right.</P>
      <P>As a party, we have examined this Bill line by line.  We feel that the amendment proposed by Deputy Molloy, on which many members of the Fianna Fáil Party have spoken&mdash; no Member of the Government Party has spoken on the Bill of course&mdash; will clarify the position for the man in the street to whom the Minister himself referred in the debate on the last occasion.  I have not got the exact quotation but he did refer to the man in the street and it is he who is involved in this because it is an Electoral (Amendment) Bill of 1973 dealing with the voting rights and duties of citizens.  I feel that voting should be not only a right but a duty as well. Sometime a Minister for Local Government will have to consider, as is prevalent in many other countries, making&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree it is specific and this is the whole idea of the amendment.  It is to make a specific statement, to clarify what is an otherwise <Col N="431" /> loose subsection.  It clarifies it by the insertion of four specific words&mdash;&ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo;. Of course, it is coincidental that the word &ldquo;specific&rdquo; comes in in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's comment and in the amendment put down by Deputy Molloy.  We feel this will clarify the subsection for the electorate and, indeed, the ordinary man in the street.</P>
      <P>In the last half hour when the Minister was replying to the contribution made by Deputy Lalor he suggested that we on this side of the House were merely trying to delay this Bill; that we had put down ill-considered amendments merely as a vehicle to delay the Bill by speaking <i>ad nauseam</i> on various amendments.</P>

      <P>As the Minister should know, this is the largest Parliamentary Party in this country and no front bench spokesman would put down an amendment merely for the sake of mischief, which is the suggestion made by the Minister.  On the contrary, this was a well considered and well thought-out amendment.  Various contributions have been made to it by Members from this side of the House. I was very proud of some of the contributions made by my colleagues.  The contribution of Deputy Andrews springs immediately to mind when he spoke of the straw poll that could be held by the so-called ten men in the street if they were to be asked their views on this subsection in the manner in which the Minister has drafted it and in the improved manner if this amendment were to be accepted. Deputy Andrews made the point that if one were to ask those ten men in the street to look at the section as at present drafted, it would be understood by very few of them at first, second, third or subsequent readings. However, if one were to show them the subsection incorporating the amendment proposed by Deputy Molloy and supported by the Fianna Fáil party, it would be understood immediately.  The suggestion was that if those ten people were questioned there would be at least six or seven of <Col N="432" /> them would would understand immediately what was in the mind of Deputy Molloy when he put down this amendment.</P>
      <P>The amendment consists of four words only.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle spoke of specifics.  The four words are specific.  They are designed to be specific and to clarify in the mind of the public exactly what is intended in this particular subsection. Subsection (1) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>join it or parts of it with any adjoining polling district or districts, or</P>
      <P>That, in my view and that of Members on this side of the House is too loose and needs clarification.  It needs to be more specific, to use the words of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  This amendment has been spoken about at length by members of the Opposition.  Many Members have made contributions ranging from constituencies right across the country from Cork to Galway, around the city of Dublin and down to Laois.  The amendment would, in our view, clarify the section which is too loose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion was intended to extract more definite information <Col N="433" /> with regard to future prospects of oil supplies and prices from the responsible Minister.  I was disappointed at the Minister's attitude when the motion was being debated. He took the view that he took a chance, when he did not ration and things worked out right.  If the Minister took a chance by not introducing rationing, he must have known that it was unnecessary.  With hindsight, people are aware and astonished at the outcome of the oil and fuel crisis.</P>
      <P>I have discussed this situation with people in my constituency and elsewhere. I am asked questions which I am unable to answer.  This tends to show more and more why we should have a discussion on the energy crisis.  Deputy Barrett said at the outset that nobody is trying to score political points off anybody, least of all the Minister.  The country feels that something happened about which they got inadequate information. Nobody is certain what the future trend will be.  It does not make people more content to read a report which appeared in the daily newspapers on the 15th March in connection with the long-term oil pact which the oil companies hope to hammer out with the oil-producing countries.  They will buy oil from those oil-producing countries if they get a long-term contract and a reduction in prices.</P>
      <P>At the start of this alleged crisis we were told that energy would be such a serious problem in the future that people would be buying donkeys for transport.  It was said that we would have no fuel or energy.  We read of the possibilities of getting oil in the Rockies and offshore.  Speculation was being made as to when it might be available because soon we would have no oil.  Now the oil-producing countries are seeking to get long-term contracts and assurances that the multi-national companies will buy oil from them and they are even prepared to reduce the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People with central heating in their homes asked me to explain why, when they got an oil delivery around Christmas, they were told that that was all they would get until February. <Col N="434" /> The price at that time was about 8p. In January the companies then said they could give more oil but they would not get in more until about April.  The price was then 14p.  In March they were told that they could get all they wanted but the price was 28p.  The price was rising and the supply was more plentiful.  It is only natural that these people should ask what was happening.  Was there a shortage?  Who conspired with whom to create this shortage?  The release of controls which permitted prices to rise with little or no notice seemed to solve the problem in the end.  As I said last week, we had reached a stage where we were told that we would be very lucky if we got oil at any price. That was the attitude adopted.</P>
    <P>The Minister took refuge in the fact that he did not introduce rationing. He said to me across the floor that it was lucky that there was a change of Government because obviously I would have introduced rationing. I thought that the sensible and logical thing to do when a crisis occurred was that certain people who purchased oil for essential production in the past should be entitled, even at the expense of those with private vehicles, to get their supplies of energy in order to keep the wheels of industry turning and so that essential output which is indispensable to the economy would be available.  The only way to do that was to issue a book of coupons to each person and say that every unit is worth so much. Then, he is sure of getting that much when he pulls in at a garage.  He will not have to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning and queue until 11 a.m. in the hope that he will get 50p worth of petrol.  This was the situation.  Did the Minister know that he was taking a chance and that the situation would become easier?  Had he any knowledge that there was price fixing behind the scene?  What is the position with regard to the meeting of the co-ordinating groups?  The object of this group was to frame western policy for an eventual meeting with oil-producing nation.  The West hopes to keep supplies up and prices down now while the Arabs want long-term guarantees that the West will buy their oil at <Col N="435" /> stable prices in later years and the compromise was being prepared on that basis.</P>
    <P>This is a problem which is not confined solely to Ireland.  It is a problem about which we have little information. We are in the hands of a clique who will do what they like with prices and supplies.  Can the Minister give us any hope as to what the future holds with regard to this vital problem?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett, in proposing this motion, read a plausible speech from his copious script writers.  But however well presented, it seems to me that there was little of real content in his contribution. Deputy Brennan, in seconding this motion, fell into a drain in the old bog road last Wednesday and only emerged briefly tonight.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett proposed that the Government should impose a new form of price control on oil and that the Government should depart radically from the recommendations of the National Prices Commission. However, it should be noted that Deputy Barrett offered no real alternative mechanism whatsoever of price surveillence and sanction.  Now that we have the asset of those copious Fianna Fáil scriptwriters, I would challenge Deputy Barrett to spell out in detail his party's alternative system to the current seven day notice system of general price parity between the Republic and the outer UK zone.  That should be his responsibility since he put down the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Fianna Fáil spokesmen in this debate that the National Prices Commission, a widely representative and expert body, made six clearcut recommendations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the question of price control on petroleum products in the context of a deteriorating world oil situation.  The Minister, without any delay, accepted those recommendations and informed the companies on 5th December, 1973.  In their report to the Minister last November the NPC also pointed out that the normal price control <Col N="436" /> procedure was far too slow to deal with this kind of rapidly changing world price situation.  They recommended that it should be replaced temporarily by more flexible arrangements. The Government acted immediately and in an entirely responsible manner and the staff of the Department of Transport and Power reacted in a rational and careful manner.  In this motion the Fianna Fáil Party have not got any better system to offer.  They have no fairer system to offer and no more effective price control mechanism to offer to the House.  That is the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>Regarding oil profit allegations made by Deputy Barrett, he suggested that the companies deliberately exploited the changing circumstances of oil stocks and the recent price increases to the extent of anything between £5 million and £7 million &ldquo;extra profit&rdquo;.  I am afraid that his evidence, to say the least of it, was rather sketchy and simplistic.  It sounds plausible enough but, on the basis of the facts known to the Department of Transport and Power, to the Government, and to the NPC, his suggestion is widely at variance with the facts.  I suggest to him and to his industrious scriptwriters that you cannot simply hang the Irish subsidiaries of the multi-national oil companies by trotting out a few rather well-chosen quotations from <i>Time</i> magazine, such as we had here last week.  It is a rather bigger issue than that, with respect to the Fianna Fáil spokesmen.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the National Prices Commission and the Departments of Transport and Power and Industry and Commerce did in the past, and will in the future, bear in mind the stocks situation and the pricing structures of all the oil companies in any future revision of oil prices, or notification by them, or any future changes in the system of price sanctions.  I would remind the House that the Government are not necessarily tied forever to the current price notification system.  The present arrangement is subject to a quarterly review recommended by the NPC of <Col N="437" /> the system as a whole.  At any time the Government may seek comprehensive data from the domestic companies.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Deputy Barrett's allegation that the oil companies made £15 to £20 per ton profit on 300,000 tons alleged February stocks is wrong in terms of the actual level of stocks at that point in time and wrong in what I regard as its superficial analysis of the whole question of advance oil contracts, oil production, oil distribution, transportation and refining here.  With respect to the Fianna Fáil think-tank it is a little more difficult than that.  If I may coin a phrase, Deputy Barrett was &ldquo;oil streaking&rdquo; on this occasion for narrow party political propaganda.  In so doing he exposed their lack of knowledge of the hard facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>Having put the domestic situation in what I regard as a reasonable perspective, I do not think any politician on any side of the House should be ignorant of the fact&mdash;we would be remiss if we did not express our concern&mdash;that on a worldwide scale the multi-nationals enjoyed a very rich period in 1973.  For example, the giant Royal Dutch-Shell Group announced an increase in profits in 1973 of 159 per cent.  The Exxon (Esso) Company announced an increase in profits of 59 per cent in 1973.  The profits of Texaco went up by 45 per cent in the same period and Mobil and Union announced increased profits of 47 per cent and 48 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in the context of these profits made in 1973 the Exchequer taxation experts throughout the world, and in particular in western Europe, and the national price control mechanisms in the various countries, and the Arab oil producing countries, have taken sharp notice of these increases.  I am quite sure our Ministers are more than well aware of them as well. Because of these massive increases at international level it does not necessarily follow that <i>Time</i> magazine quotations apply automatically to the oil industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to the UK situation <Col N="438" /> and its relevance to Ireland I would point out to the Opposition that the Government have made it clear on a number of occasions that we are in an integrated oil market with Britain. Fianna Fáil had very little to say about that in the past two or three decades.  About half of our oil comes from British refineries in the form of refined products and the balance in the form of crude which is supplied to the Whitegate refinery by the three major companies who own it. It is this factor of an integrated market which enabled the Minister for Industry and Commerce to allow oil prices to follow outer-zoned prices of the UK.  Price increases in the UK are not permissible until they have been authorised by their Prices Commission who require evidence of payment of the increased crude oil prices before allowing any extra charge to be made.  I gather that there is also a period of prior notification involved. I certainly intend to press my inquiry with the Labour Ministers in the relevant Departments over there to find out how they intend to approach that kind of development.</P>
    <P>Regarding the situation in the past few days we in this House should welcome the decisions of the Organisation of the Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries to end their oil supply embargo against the United States and to freeze prices at present levels for the next three months.  I am sure the Opposition will agree that this development will provide the Government with a welcome opportunity to press ahead with the evolution of an energy policy and, if necessary, to undertake a further review of the pricing structure of the industry and the question of the future of the industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also proposed that storage and refining facilities should be extended.  I accept that point.  I do not think it is particularly novel. It is rather the conventional wisdom arising out of the prices situation and the situation over the past 12 months. It is now generally accepted that that is an urgent need.  Deputy Barrett made two other proposals: that Ireland should do a direct deal with the Arab oil producing countries and that <Col N="439" /> we should tempt the Arab nations to invest in refineries in the Republic. I found this strange coming from the repository of republicanism in Clare. This proposal was put forward to us last Wednesday without any elaboration. One finds it strange coming from a front bench spokesman of a political party who fostered assiduously the role of the multi-nationals in Ireland. They are now proposing that we should do a complete about-turn. Deputy Brennan trumpeted Fianna Fáil support for the free public enterprise system.  Now we are to start chasing the Arabs and have a joint venture with them.  While they may have validity in the long term, I can only assume that these proposals in the immediate short term are what one might call a propaganda exercise by the Fianna Fáil spokesmen and script-writers.</P>
    <P>I should like to put three questions to them.  What relevance have these proposals to the immediate short-term oil needs of this country in 1973-74 and 1975 up to the early 1980s?  How do they propose to prevent the multi-national companies now supplying Ireland from taking unilateral action against us in the event of the Minister making unilateral arrangements with the producer nations?  How does the Fianna Fáil Party propose to ensure that the Arab nations and the producing countries will give us a more favourable contract deal than is available from multi-nationals?</P>
    <P>Many people are going around the world with gilt-edge invitations to introduce Ministers for Transport and Power to the various sheikdoms of Africa or of the Arab nations on magnificent commissions and brokerage fees.  With due respect to Fianna Fáil, I do not think we are going to send our Minister for Transport and Power off on that kind of general exercise.  For that reason I do not think Fianna Fáil are too serious in that regard.</P>
    <P>However, one must always react on the basis that an Opposition acts in good faith.  On the assumption that there may be some long-term attractions for Ireland having an alternative deal outside that of the multi-national <Col N="440" /> oil companies' role, I suggest to the Minister that he examine the proposal in the context of a White Paper.  Let us tease it out there.  I am suggesting that the Minister consider a White Paper on the future oil needs of the country.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and on-going review of energy policy in the light of our experience in the present crisis. The oil industry is a worldwide one and even if we were to discover substantial quantities of oil in our own waters it still would not isolate us from the fact that it is still an international, multi-national and worldwide industry. Development policy must take account of and proceed in conformity with development on the international level and in conformity with developments at EEC level.  I should like to remind Fianna Fáil that we are in the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of future policy there is another matter which we should bear in mind.  There will still be in the years ahead a tightness of supply and high cost will continue. Although they have a Labour Government in power in Britain, the Government have now sanctioned, in relation to the National Coal Board, a 48 per cent increase in the price of coal to industry in Britain.  Therefore, <Col N="441" /> there will be a very high energy cost situation over the next few years and it will be necessary to maintain and intensify measures to avoid waste and reduce consumption of energy in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Hand in hand with the measures of conservation such as improved insulation measures we must, of course, consider ways and means of restraining demand.  We must also accelerate development of resources of energy other than imported oil.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is currently considering measures in relation to offshore exploration for oil and gas.  We on the Government side are also pleased to note that with the new price of oil Bord na Móna now envisage that it will be economic to undertake substantial further bog development and that they have agreed, in principle, with the ESB on joint plans for bog development and the provision of additional peat-burning generating capacity.  Bord na Móna also envisage a new briquette factory.  Needless to remark the tremendous capital cost of these projects will be subject to the greatest scrutiny and intensive cost benefit analysis by the respective Ministers. A further aspect of the oil supply situation which we have to consider is the provision of adequate refining capacity to meet our own needs in times of crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor which we have to bear in mind is the final decision of the promoters of the APCO, Whiddy Island Oil Refinery, project.  Their decision is due within the next two weeks, if it has not been already been conveyed to the IDA.  I am hopeful that in the event of this company deciding to go ahead with their plans they will carry their due share of stocks as required by the EEC directive.  All the foregoing are matters which will require considerable thought and research and, in general, must proceed in concert with the work of the various international agencies and groupings concerned. One factor which we have to bear in mind is that there could be a complete change in the whole situation if <Col N="442" /> tomorrow morning we discovered substantial oil deposits in our coastal waters in quantities adequate for our needs.  There would be a whole new ball game in relation to the energy situation then.</P>
    <P>Regarding oil storage and stocks and their relationship to national reserves, I urge the Minister to introduce new legislation setting out the minimum reserves which should be held and must be held by the oil companies.  Such legislation, naturally, would have to conform with the 1968 EEC directive and should, of course, follow consultation with the oil companies directly concerned particularly in respect to the cost of storage <i>et cetera</i> and there are major implications in that regard.  The need for more storage falls into a more critical perspective when one bears in mind the continued 10 per cent annual increase in the level of oil consumption which means a relative decline in the level in the total storage area available each year.  It is my view that the Government should consider a new Bill to deal effectively with this situation.</P>
    <P>To go back to the original problem of energy policy, we have to bear in mind the current manner in which energy requirements are met and the fact that there will not be any dramatic change in the next half decade.  At the moment energy requirements of the economy are met 9 per cent from coal, 69 per cent from oil, 10 per cent from sod turf, 7 per cent from milled peat and 5 per cent from hydro-electricity.  I suggest to the House that this is a multimillion pound capital investment of infrastructure already in the country and we are not going to dramatically change that in two or three years.  To change these ratios will be a very difficult and costly programme but, nevertheless, we have to go ahead and reduce our dependence on imported oil as quickly as possible and develop other sources of energy.</P>
    <P>It is with that in mind that I suggest the Minister should consider setting in train the publication of a White Paper on the future energy policy of the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In this White Paper we should examine the feasibility of setting up&mdash;and this is where the socialist breaks out&mdash;a State-sponsored oil and gas body, if necessary under a joint venture arrangement, for the offshore exploitation and onshore production of the discoveries off the Irish coast and continental shelf.  That kind of development is something which the Minister should consider because if there are major discoveries off the Irish continental shelf, then we have a completely new situation.  This is something we have got to plan ahead for at Government level and I have no doubt this is exercising the Government's mind.</P>
      <P>The White Paper should also consider the programme for nuclear energy.  Here we are talking in the context of the 1980s.  The ESB is committed to a nuclear energy programme in the early 1980s and this future development is now of major national importance.  It should be processed rapidly in the months ahead.  Inevitably it would have to appear in the form of a Government White Paper.</P>
      <P>I did not notice much whining on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party regarding the system of oil allocation. I use that term with circumspection because I am afraid they simply cannot make any allegations against the tremendous work done by the Minister and his staff during the past six months in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not make a special plea on behalf of the fishing industry.  The Government's scheme of allocations of oil products was based on percentages used in the preceding corresponding period and was designed to secure the most equitable diversion of supplies available, to secure administrative simplicity and to secure full cover of essential areas of usage.  It <Col N="444" /> has worked out very satisfactorily in that allocations have been kept in reasonable balance with supplies coming forward and there has been relatively little run down of stocks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It was also designed to ensure that essential users and particular areas of usage in this country were fully covered and to the chagrin of the Fianna Fáil Party it worked reasonably satisfactorily. Allocations were kept at a reasonable balance with supplies coming forward. There was relatively little running down of stocks in this country.  On the Government's side we can say that a job was reasonably well done. A very great deal of work was done in this area by the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
      <P>All the indications are that the amount of oil reaching our shores during the next six or eight months will require some continuation of restrictive measures.  Deputies may be assured that if orders have to be made they will be made by the Minister and will be drafted on the most generous levels possible, without any hysteria. The House can be assured that, if necessary, the Government will intensify the campaign for economy in the use of oil and petrol products. The public will also have to appreciate that in the less essential uses of domestic central heating, of swimming pools, leisure motoring, display advertising and other such areas, which could be hit first, considerable savings must be made.  I would also point out that there are other essential usages where a great deal of economy could be made.  The ESB, for example, currently use half of the total supply of fuel oil in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent a constituency which has the highest percentage of motor cars in the State.  Many electors do <Col N="445" /> not seem as yet to fully appreciate that there are 646,000 mechanically propelled vehicles in the Republic, including 476,000 private cars.  This is an area where a great conservation of fuel could occur.  With respect to Deputy Brennan, even if we did all that, such vehicles only consume about 15 per cent of the total oil in the State and it certainly cannot be diverted, as Deputy Brennan advocated, to industrial production.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I wish to make.  It is a simple fact, which Deputy Brennan and the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition cannot deny, that the Government and the responsible Minister succeeded, despite considerable difficulties, in ensuring that oil supplies were available to the maximum possible extent for industry, agriculture, the essential public services and the citizens at large who had to do with some reduction in consumption. The Government will continue to do this in the national interest.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, the Government fully mitigated the worst possible effects of this crisis which could have occurred on employment. We maintained remarkable stability, continuity and buoyancy of employment in this State during the crisis period.  Fianna Fáil cannot deny these facts.</P>
    <P>Finally, I feel that the House should record our appreciation to my colleague in Government, the Minister for Transport and Power and the staff of his Department for their strenuous efforts during the past six months to overcome the very serious problems arising from the oil crisis.  I do not think that the campaign of manipulation of oil stock figures, the campaign of wild exaggeration on the part of Deputy Barrett and the sudden departure of Fianna Fáil from associating with the multi-national oil companies, has done their party any good.  When Fianna Fáil were in power Fianna Fáil Ministers were wined and dined by Gulf Oil at Whiddy Island.  They travelled there on a liner.  They have suddenly discovered that the multi-nationals of this country are the villains of the piece.  In Government it is <Col N="446" /> not as simple as that and the Fianna Fáil Party have done themselves no great good by tabling this motion and flogging publicity scripts by their script writers over the past few months.  They are confused and the international situation has been confused by them. The Government are not confused and are not overcome by the arguments put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Desmond finished I expected to see a pulpit appearing beneath him and a halo around his head.  His contribution amazed and amused me.  He launched into a defence of the multi-national oil companies.  On the one hand he says they control the supplies of oil to this country and on the other, he says that the Government succeeded in making oil available during the crisis period. Let Deputy Desmond explain to me how one group can do one thing and another group can do the other thing. There must be a happy medium.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I deplore the handling of the energy crisis by the Government.  I ask for information on the future plans of the Government in order to allay the fears and restore the confidence of the people who have suffered in a crisis situation.  We have a new Minister for Transport and Power whom we cannot completely blame for the situation.  We can certainly blame the Government for mishandling the situation during the months from October to now.  I am sorry the Minister must be the target of the deserved criticism being levelled at the Government.  I want to take a few points from the contribution of Deputy Desmond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was not aware of the amendment to the motion put down by our party.  He spent most <Col N="447" /> of his time condemning the speakers from this side of the House on the contributions they made.  He did not know a lot about the oil crisis or of the difficulties encountered by people during the crisis period.  He mentioned that no proof could be afforded of the profits made by the multi-national companies as a result of the price increase allowed at the beginning of the year.  I challenge the Deputy to stand up here and state categorically that no profits were made by these multi-national oil companies as a result of the price increase which was paid for by the ordinary people of Ireland.  During this crisis no information with confidence behind it was available to industry or to the people generally. Certainly the highlights of this period were confusion, chaos, lack of decisive leadership, inconsistent information, erratic reports.  People lost confidence, they did not know whether industry would suffer, whether jobs would suffer.  This was the serious aspect of all this.</P>
    <P>It was noticeable that the Minister's contribution to the debate lacked conviction.  No new facts were given to the House, no new information was conveyed to the public at large regarding the crisis during the period from October onwards or no indication was given to the House what the Government consider they should do in the event of a recurrence or that we would be ready to take certain steps and be organised with storage facilities <i>et cetera.</i> His contribution was a rather roundabout and confused history of the crisis.  This was already known to the people.  No new points were made and no reasons were given for the extra confusion that was created.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage of the debate I would ask the Minister to get the remaining Government speaker to answer specifically&mdash;something he or Deputy Desmond did not do&mdash;the points raised by Deputy Barrett, to contradict them and to state why they are being contradicted and why they are not correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenge Deputy Desmond&mdash;I said this while he was out of the House&mdash;to stand up here and say that no profit was made by the multi-national oil companies. If £100 or £1,000 or £1 million was made by the multi-national companies that he has so ably and eloquently defended at the expense of the ordinary people of Ireland then I say: &ldquo;Shame on the Government that allowed such a situation to happen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves of the handling of the energy crisis and urges the Government to develop its future energy policy in the light of the experience gained.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he does not think it is in the interests of the House or in the interests of the nation to say what the plans are at the moment.  I am surprised at this coming from the Minister.  We have heard much about open government. Here is a situation that is striking at the very kernel, at the soul of our economy and about which people who want to expand industry and to create new industry are concerned.  Every opportunity should be availed of to tell the people what plans are in hand. I agree with the Minister that many of those plans cannot be brought to fruition for a long period.  That is understandable.  I hope the remaining Government speaker will be able to tell us something about future plans.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not contradict Deputy Barrett's contribution.  There is an old saying that silence means consent.  I hope that is not true in this case but it appears that the Minister agrees that profits were made by multi-national oil companies.  On 21st February the Minister in reply to a supplementary question from Deputy Barrett said:</P>
      <P>I think the best advice I could give the Deputy is that if the multi-nationals are making those profits they will show up in their balance sheets at the end of this year and we can all have a go at them then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to explain <Col N="449" /> to me how we can look at the profit figures of multi-national oil companies and see what profits they made in this country as distinct from other countries.  The Minister admitted that one company in particular is not a profit-making company here but merely a distribution company.  I cannot see how we can examine those figures and discover what profits were made in this country.  I should like the Minister to explain to us whether it is possible to do this.</P>
    <P>The one big complaint I have is the source of information and how this information was made available.  We are only too well aware of the importance of the oil supply to all sectors of our community&mdash;industry, agriculture, the private sector.  Oil probably constitutes 70 per cent or more of our energy.  I understood the Minister to say that the first knowledge of the forthcoming crisis was brought to his notice in July.  What steps were taken then to secure information?  Surely it is deplorable that the oil companies were the main sources of information. I do not deny that the oil companies were <i>au fait</i> with the situation and could be used but I think there should have been a technically qualified body specially commissioned by the Minister, possibly the National Science Council, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards or some other learned body with the necessary expertise. They should have been given the function of feeding information to the Minister and his Department.  One thinks at times that consulting with the oil companies was, in effect, going to court with the devil in hell.  It is no secret that oil companies manipulate their profits from country to country.  They maximise their profits in the country of greatest advantage to them and minimise them in the country of least advantage.  I think the Minister admits that this is so, although originally he was indignant at the suggestion when Deputy Barrett first mentioned it.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution said that the information regarding the refinery in Bantry was conveyed to him via newspaper reports.  Surely the IDA knew that and the Department <Col N="450" /> of Industry and Commerce knew it.  Surely there should have been a body overlapping both Departments. At this stage of the energy crisis it is inconceivable that these Departments are still working separately on this situation.  One would think that not only would there be a body co-ordinating both Departments but that there would be daily liaison between specific sections in both Departments not only to provide for the immediate future but to make long-term plans.  Both Ministers, and particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his contribution to a debate on the Adjournment on 12th February, referred to Fianna Fáil Deputies and particularly Deputy Barrett as thumping the National Prices Commission.  This is utter nonsense. The Minister was using the NPC as a scapegoat, laying blame on their shoulders and undeservedly so. He was responsible for thumping the NPC.  From what source was information made available to the NPC before this decision was taken by them?  We have been told that the information was coming from the oil companies, the EEC and OECD reports and meetings and also from Britain.  This is where we fell down in our handling of the energy crisis&mdash;in not having correct information of an independent nature available to us under the Department's control.</P>
    <P>Confusion still exists and I would ask the Minister to explain this paragraph from <i>Business Week</i> of 23rd February regarding oil:</P>
    <P>Open market prices for crude oil are dropping sharply.  In Kuwait where foreign bidders were paying $16 a barrel one month ago some are reportedly offering $9 a barrel. In Saudi Arabia where the posted price is nearly $11 a barrel the actual price has fallen $8.50.  This is close to what the giant oil companies are paying on their long term contracts.  In fact, crude oil is in temporary surplus.</P>
    <P>In another paragraph it says that a number of independents who bid as much as $22 a barrel for crude oil during the height of the oil panic reportedly are neglecting to pick up <Col N="451" /> their purchases and are paying cash penalties rather than pay the high prices.  Oil producers such as Kuwait and Libya are so concerned that prices will weaken further they are considering production set-backs.  Yet, two weeks later, on 6th March we read in <i>The Irish Times</i> where one of the chief executives of an internal oil company here stated that we could expect another price rise in May.  This is the type of confusion in the public mind.  I now understand we have this guaranteed price for three months with no increase.  The Government Information Service should be regularly fed with correct information to put before industry and explain the problems.  Industry, agriculture, the householder and the car-owner all deserve this information.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said there was a saving of jobs.  Quite right, but I hope he did not expect that the Opposition would throw him bouquets for that.  I am surprised and disappointed that the Minister did not thank the very many people in industry and in other spheres who worked so hard to protect jobs and not only conserved petrol and oil but went on their knees to the oil companies. This problem occurred particularly in the period up to December: when a company's quota was about to run out the oil company had the final say on whether an extra quota would be made available.  At that time the Department was not in a position to push the oil company. The industrialist concerned had to beg for more.  This is how jobs were protected and the people know this well.  The Government deserve no kudos for preserving jobs in that period; it was the people involved in industry who worked so diligently by sparing on one hand and by begging from the oil companies on the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the confusion was confined to Dublin.  He cannot have been serious in that.  We know only too well of the confusion and the queuing in the Cork area in the weeks immediately before Christmas. I need not produce evidence of <Col N="452" /> overnight queuing in addition to the long queues by day.  I agree that many greedy people aggravated the situation but those who suffered most were the ordinary workers who had no time to queue and either had to abandon their cars or leave them at home and use other transport.  When the people who could do without petrol were able to get it, the ordinary worker was unable to get it because of the clash between his work time and the opening hours at filling stations.</P>
    <P>Another group affected were the small fleet owners, such as the man who had a delivery service with three, four or five vans.  If he had five he was probably lucky to get four-fifth capacity out of his vans and in most cases it was three-fifths.  The remaining capacity was used in vans flitting from filling station to filling station to get 50 pence worth of petrol here and £1 worth there to keep the business going because, first, he did not have a regular supplier and, secondly, did not have his own oil tank.  This type of people suffered very seriously in that period.  There is no point in Deputy Desmond, who is probably unfamiliar with the problems of the situation, making statements here that cannot be substantiated.</P>
    <P>Again, I emphasise that information was the kernel of the trouble here. In addition to the oil companies we had information from the EEC and OECD.  We also met the corresponding Minister in England who, of course, only had information supplied to him also.  These are useful sources of information but in situations like this we can depend on the help of other people but we must also maintain our independence.  It would be quite wrong for this country to put the interests of our Common Market partners above our own industrial and economic needs.  These must at all times get priority.</P>
    <P>We hoped to hear of plans for the future.  Deputy Desmond mentioned the APCO refinery and the notification to IDA.  Surely it is imperative that at this stage we have a body working in close liaison between the <Col N="453" /> Departments of Transport and Power and Industry and Commerce handling the future of industry here.  What are our plans?  What about our oil supplies on the south coast?  I omitted to mention earlier that I understood more oil was shipped from Whitegate refinery to Cork in the three months from October to December than in the corresponding period in the previous year or in the previous three months. I should like to know if this was so and if it is so, why was there a shortage?</P>
    <P>Returning to the subject of the future and the importance of developing our own resources or, at least, controlling at this stage their development, in a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce a few weeks ago I asked what information was available to him on finds of natural gas and oil supplies off our coasts.  He answered in the affirmative regarding natural gas.  He said some had been found but he had no information regarding the oil situation.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that rumours are rife in Cork regarding the oil finds.  Can the Minister tell us what qualified, technical, on-the-spot information he has regarding the drilling operations now proceeding under licence off the south coast?  It is imperative that the information available to the Minister is first-hand.  It is also important that when the information is of a technical nature the best expertise is available.  Qualified people are available in the country and there are many of our people in other countries who would be willing to return home and work for the Government. The Government have an important part to play.</P>
    <P>I am sure that, like me, the Minister wants to see Cork developing, to become an oil distributing centre.  I know he would like the finds off the south coast to be economic.  At this stage it is important that the correct information is available to the Government and that they do not depend on second hand information supplied by people operating under licence.</P>
    <P>The APCO refinery has been mentioned <Col N="454" /> during the debate.  I should like to express disappointment that there is no provision for home market supplies. Deputy Barrett has mentioned storage and I think Deputy Desmond agreed with him on that point.  Every effort should be made by the Government to ensure that increased storage is available.  I understood the Minister to say that this refinery would not produce the finished refined product, that it would be partly refined. I do not think this changes the position.  A certain percentage of the total storage would be of advantage to us during times of crisis.</P>
    <P>The objective of this exercise is that we become more independent, or at least as near to independence as is possible, of the international racketeering and of the multi-national oil companies that Deputy Desmond defended so stoutly on behalf of the Labour Party.  That was certainly an amazing change of attitude.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond said he was surprised at the somersault of Fianna Fáil.  Our party have always been the practical people.  There were mistakes made in handling the recent crisis.  Let us learn from them and make our plans for the future.  We must also tell the people we are formulating plans and inform them of our proposals. Let the Government be an open one and keep us informed of what is happening.  These matters should not be kept completely secret. I cannot see what would be lost if people were told of the Government's plans.  If they do this the sensible, sound and constructive Opposition will give the Minister what help he needs. If they are informed of what is happening they will help all the more.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed and surprised that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not present during the debate.  On 12th February he took an Adjournment Debate which we thought would be for Transport and Power.  It was a question of moving from the right to the left, as Deputy Desmond tried to do.  We are disappointed the Minister is not in the House to answer and deny categorically the allegations made regarding profitability in the coal and oil situations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In October or November, 1973, we were faced with a serious situation.  We were not aware of the future position regarding oil supplies which form our main source of energy and there was a bad period during the winter which aggravated the situation.  I should like to compliment the Ministers for Transport and Power and Industry and Commerce.  During the difficult period of uncertainty regarding oil supplies they managed to keep our industries on a full working week and, in fact, there was a slight increase in employment during that time.  This was in contrast to the situation in England where there was a three-day working week.  The situation regarding our industries compares favourably with what obtained in the previous year.</P>
      <P>The Government introduced a speed limit of 50 mph to conserve petrol supplies.  Deputy Brennan spoke of petrol rationing.  I am sure many Members on the opposite side of the House will agree with me that this would have led to blackmarket practices, racketeering and many other difficulties.  Deputy Brennan told us that he saw some fisticuffs one morning at 8 o'clock outside a filling station but, thankfully, such occurrences were rare.  Had there been stockpiling of supplies there might have been serious injuries caused to people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 30th November, 1973, the Government approved in principle the construction of a nuclear power station costing £100 million.  I am glad to see that preliminary planning for the station is proceeding.  At the moment there is a joint development project by Bord na Móna and the ESB.  It is a £20 million programme, spread over five years, which will bring an additional 40,000 acres of bog into production.  It will give employment to approximately 1,500 men and women in Laois-Offaly, parts of Tipperary, Galway and Roscommon&mdash;areas <Col N="456" /> that are in need of employment.  The people in Laois-Offaly are very pleased about this project.</P>
    <P>This proves that the actions taken by the Government were correct. They have satisfied the vast majority of fair-minded people who realise that in a difficult situation the Government took the right steps.  The results speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett and Deputy Fitzgerald dealt with prices.  I should like to refer to an article in <i>The Irish Press</i> dated 6th March, 1974, which dealt with premium priced petrol in 12 European countries. In premium petrol Ireland is the cheapest of 12 European countries&mdash; Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Austria and Britain.  In heating oil, Ireland is the second cheapest of 12 European countries.</P>
    <P>We are very dependent on oil.  In the case of the ESB, 24 per cent of the fuel used to produce energy is peat; 10 per cent is produced from hydro-electric and 1 per cent from coal; 65 per cent of our energy is produced from oil.  The ESB use up to 1.2 million tonnes of oil annually costing £44 to £45 million a year.  The demand for electricity increases by 9 to 9½ per cent per annum.  With the likely increase in the cost of production and the increase in the use of electricity, by 1980 the figures will be very, very high indeed; it could be as high as £100 million per annum for oil for the ESB alone.  The Government are aware of this and I am confident they will accept in full the joint proposals of the ESB and Bord na Móna. We are too dependent on oil imports. I am sure Deputies opposite are only too well aware that over the last few years we have been cutting down on the use of peat by the ESB.  That was a mistake.  Fortunately it is now being corrected.</P>
    <P>The main proposals are that Bord na Móna and the ESB continue to implement a scheme whereby the same percentage of peat will be supplied and used by the ESB as is being <Col N="457" /> supplied and used at the moment.  I hope that the Government will pursue actively the establishment of a nuclear power station.  Thirdly, afforestation is most important because, even though timber is bulky, it can be a very important fuel.</P>
    <P>Where off-shore oil is concerned, there are considerable quantities of both oil and gas off our coast and these will have to be developed to the full.  A White Paper is urgently necessary on our energy resources and off-shore developments.  It should be possible to second engineers from both the ESB and Bord na Móna to investigate the possibilities of off-shore oil and gas development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We tabled this motion to highlight the lack of control the Government appear to have over this situation.  We have clearly shown since this debate started the confused approach of the Government&mdash;first, the confusion because of the price situation and, secondly, because of the cost of these products which are so essential to us.  We all appreciate that an oil crisis can have very serious repercussions on our economy because we are so dependent on oil to keep our economy moving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are paying approximately £10 per tonne more than can be accounted for for refined products, taking into consideration the cost of transport, the cost of refining and making allowance for a profit.  Taking our total oil needs into consideration, fuel is costing us £50 million more than it need cost us.  I am not now picking figures out of the sky, as Deputy Desmond suggested, any more than I did when I spoke about the £6 million to which I shall refer again later.  It is all the more worrying when we listen to the Minister telling the House that this debate is taking place too soon, remembering that he also pointed out that the whole business was outside the control of the Government. If anything, this debate is possibly too late.  The Minister tells us one refinery in Cork is refining for major distributors and we are merely selling agents for their foreign-owned parent companies.  Surely this indicates <Col N="458" /> the need for Government initiative to control the situation.</P>
    <P>I accept, as I believe most people do, that the Minister speaks in good faith and gives his opinion on the basis of the information with which he is supplied.  I suggest to him that there is urgent need to restructure the oil supply business.  Let me give a significant example of what can happen. A year ago the newspapers reported that the B &amp; I had signed a contract for 20 years with a major company for oil supplies.  A few weeks ago the B &amp; I increased rates and fares by 15 per cent, stating that fuel costs had increased by 400 per cent.  What sort of contract is it that ties a consumer to a supplier for 20 years and permits the supplier to increase prices by 400 per cent?  The ESB pays £40 per tonne for oil.  The Cork refinery is alleged to be reshipping oil out at approximately £7 per tonne.</P>
    <P>We warned the Minister months ago that increased costs would create problems in centres like Ballymun. Last week the Minister mentioned Ballymun.  He said that the floor heating was being kept up.  The Minister may believe that all is well where the tenants in Ballymun are concerned. If the Minister gets into his car and calls on Mrs. Patricia Farrell and Mrs. Thomas Lawless, James Connolly Tower, he will find the position is very different from what he thinks it is.  According to newspaper reports that particular block has had no heating since last September.  The tenants leave the gas on in the kitchen to provide warmth.  The children are sent to a community centre for warmth. One of these ladies has actually to sleep with her young children in an effort to keep them warm.  This is worth investigating.  It may sound parochial but it is indicative of the problems that face us as a result of an oil and energy shortage.  We actually helped one company to make a profit of more than £7 million and we are watching another company making £300 million.  We are helping these in our own small way.  We are contributing towards these massive problems.  The retail people feel they are being discriminated against where <Col N="459" /> margins are concerned.  It is hard to blame them when they read about the massive profits made at the supply end by these multi-nationalists.  One thing is definite, the lessons of the past few months should stimulate the Government and the nation into fresh action in order to get to grips with this problem which may recur.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that they were able to keep up employment. The Government should consider a report in today's paper about a proposed refinery in the Pigeon House area which would employ 2,500 to 3,000 people immediately.  What consideration are the Government giving to this?  This would serve to alleviate our problems and ensure our supplies in a future crisis.  Any proposal for an oil refinery will undoubtedly meet with resistance from different sources and vested interests and some of this resistance will be cloaked.  There will be resistance from environmentalists. They are necessary and have a duty to perform.  This lobby has been most effective in the past, particularly when the emotions of the uninformed were played upon.  However difficult it may be to inform the few in question, it may, nevertheless, be worthwhile. The environment includes the right of every man, woman and child to a fair deal and reasonable enjoyment whether it is coming from the use of oil or oil products.  They are entitled to live a reasonable life despite these people who are misinforming others and causing serious disruption to any proposals to deal in a permanent way with an oil crisis.  The only permanent way to do this is to erect our own refineries and secure the source.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there has been no change in the situation since last March.  The situation has changed since the Minister took office.  Changes are necessary because of what happened over the past five or six months. Therefore, the Minister should not boast that he did not make any changes.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last week the horticultural situation in the eastern part <Col N="460" /> of the country.  If anything has been done about this, will the Minister let us know?  Has any action been taken to subsidise or help these people? This is their busy season.  In former years they got extended credit until they could sell their crops.  Now everything is cash on the nail.  They have this added disadvantage as well as increased prices.  Again, I ask the Minister or his Department to look into their plight.  This is being done in England.  The British realise that this is a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>I mentioned storage as far back as last December.  Deputy Desmond inferred that it took no great brains trust to mention this when it was an obvious thing to mention.  I asked on repeated occasions what increase had taken place with regard to our storage capacity.  If any change has taken place we have not been told. We asked about the present position with regard to the reports of off-shore oil finds.  It may be a bit premature for the Minister concerned to make a statement on this.  We also asked about natural gas.  It is presumed that there is a large quantity of natural gas off our shores.  Have the ESB any plans for gaining access to this natural gas or is it intended that commercial interests will develop it?  This would lead to cheaper electricity for us.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are having another look at themselves and this has been mentioned in these debates.  We should have a long hard look at their capabilities.  I wonder if it is as easy as people seem to believe to develop these bogs to a greater extent?  Bord na Móna, who employ many thousands of people, have to look to the long term.  They cannot let the bogs run out in an emergency like the present one and jeopardise the thousands of families who are dependent on them.  They must look at security of employment for their employees.  We may be exaggerating this as a possibility.</P>
    <P>I should like to return to the question of the £6 to £7 million.  Deputy Desmond inferred that it was an invention of mine.  It was not.  It was <Col N="461" /> mentioned in this House that 358,000 tons of oil were in stock on 31st December.  It was also stated that from January 1st to February 9th Whitegate imported 230,000 tons.  It was further stated that there were 250,000 tons of products imported into Dublin during that period.  One need not be a mathematician to do these sums.</P>
    <P>On the Adjournment Debate on February 12th the Minister for Industry and Commerce took as his source of information the chief executive of Esso and quoted him as gospel.  He asked us if we could disbelieve him.  No one had any reason to do so.  He was referring to a Press report of a few days earlier.  When I had made the allegation of £6 million excessive profits on stocks, this gentleman to whom the Minister referred on that occasion said I had been writing with a gold-plated pen; it could not happen.  The Minister took this man as his source of information for disproving my allegation.  There is a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 6th March, 1974, of a press conference <Col N="462" /> where this same executive admitted that they did increase prices of existing stocks.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may read letters if he likes.  I am talking about the £6 million about which Deputy Desmond was derogatory.  On the one hand he said that it could not be right and on the other this man admits it. This is the man whom the Minister for Industry and Commerce took as his source of information.  I repeat that it is an undeniable fact that they did attach increased prices to existing supplies.</P>

      <P>Before Private Members' Time I was making the point that the four words in the amendment suggested by Deputy Molloy, &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo;, would improve the wording of the section as suggested by the Minister and his parliamentary draftsmen. The main point, one which has been made by the Minister, is that this section reads as similar sections read from 1935 to 1969 and, consequently, in the view of the Minister, because of this they were sacred and should be repeated in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The point made on this side of the House was that if the Opposition between 1935 and 1969 were not prepared to examine the Bills introduced during that time line by line, as was their duty, so be it but that does not mean that the legislation from 1935 to 1969 was perfect.  We will have tomorrow morning the introduction of a Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In dealing with the Bills introduced between 1935 and 1969 I should like to point out that one of those was found to be unconstitutional and a Bill altering it had to be introduced.  We are not saying that this Bill is unconstitutional but that the four words suggested in Deputy Molloy's amendment would improve the section so that the man-in-the-street who is referred to in the Bill can read it without any difficulty. <Col N="465" /> The wording of the Bill, because it caters for the man-in-the-street should be clear and simple.  Earlier the Minister admitted that these words did not do any harm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If these words do no harm it will meet the wishes of this party if the Minister includes them in the section.  This is a specific section and our amendment is designed to clarify for the man-in-the-street&mdash;when I say &ldquo;man&rdquo; in this context I mean those eligible to vote &mdash;the exact position.  It will also clarify the position for school children interested in civics and electoral law and those anxious to know their rights when they attain the age of 18. It is important that school children should be able to understand such legislation.</P>
      <P>I am aware that this Bill was drafted by the parliamentary draftsmen in the Attorney General's office, fine decent men doing an honourable job and without whom we could not operate in this House.  However, they are lawyers and the person for whom we are trying to cater in our amendment is the average citizen who should, in any legislation, be able to understand what is in it.  He should be able to pick it up and immediately understand what is in it for him, what he will agree to and what he will object to.</P>

      <P>The four words that are suggested by Deputy Molloy in this amendment &ldquo;within such specified constituencies&rdquo; would in my view improve this legislation considerable for the man-in-the-street. If you look at the section as it stands it has a side note &ldquo;Temporary arrangements with respect to certain districts&rdquo;.  First of all, the words &ldquo;temporary arrangements with respect to certain polling districts&rdquo; in my view, are misleading.</P>

      <P>Thank you, but I want to show that the section as proposed by the Minister lacks clarity and lacks the language of the common man.  It is ambiguous without this amendment.  It should be the aim of both the Dáil and the Seanad to ensure that our legislation goes through in language which can be understood by ordinary people.  I am sure this matter will be debated in the Seanad because I know that some of my colleagues in that House feel very strongly about those four words which clarify the section for the man-in-the-street.</P>

Our feeling on this matter is reflected very strongly by the number <Col N="467" /> of Deputies who have made contributions on the amendment.  They have offered their contributions in good faith despite what the Minister has said and despite his suggestion that it was merely a delaying tactic by the Fianna Fáil Party.

      <P>The point I am making is that just as we have seen so many changes in the way of life in Ireland we have seen changes in the interpretation of Bills.  We would improve the wording of the 1935 Act and the other Acts up to the 1969 Act by the introduction of this amendment. The Minister admitted that there is no harm in this amendment. Therefore, I cannot see why he should delay this House in the manner in which he is delaying it by those stonewall tactics with regard to those four words which we feel very strongly are a great improvement on the wording of section 7.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again, with your permission, point out that this amendment would not do any harm and would do no good.  I am not going to accept the amendment just because some of the earlier speakers on the Opposition said it would please them. That was a ridiculous suggestion. There have been so many irrelevancies dragged into the debate that one might get the impression that we were dealing with something very important. In effect we are discussing section 7 (1) which states:</P>
      <P>Where a polling district existing at the passing of this Act is not wholly situate within one of the constituencies specified in the Schedule to this Act, the appropriate officer, after consultation with the returning officer for the constituency concerned, shall, with respect to the part of the polling district situate in a constituency so specified&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) join it or parts of it with any adjoining polling district or districts, or</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that it must be within a constituency and it must be joined with any other polling district or part of a polling district within that constituency.  How anybody in his sane and sober senses could imagine that the addition of the four words suggested, and about which we heard so much talk the other day and again today, would improve that in any way beats me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> I am being reasonable about this and I think the Opposition have had their fun.  They had two-and-a-half hours the last day, two hours up to 6 o'clock today and 20 minutes since 7.30.  They should realise that this type of thing is not doing any good for this House.  If the Opposition want to put it to a vote let us do so or if they want to withdraw it, which as reasonable men they should, OK. It is ridiculous that we should continue with this debate.  You and the Ceann Comhairle have had extreme patience listening to repetition again and again.  The same thing is being repeated not alone by one person but by the person who follows him.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that this amendment is unimportant and only refers to something which everybody admits cannot improve the Bill we should conclude the debate on it now.  The only reason the Opposition have asked specially to have the amendment included is that earlier today they said they would like those four words put in.  It would lengthen the subsection by four words and for that reason they would like to have the amendment inserted.  It is asking a little too much to ask us to continue wasting the time of the House in discussing this further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister's plea.  This gives him a great opportunity of being really big in this matter.  We are doing our job as a serious Opposition.  We are pointing out what we believe is a weakness in this section.  There are only four words in Deputy Molloy's amendment. While I am no grammarian I can see no difficulty about interpreting them.  I take it that &ldquo;within&rdquo; is a preposition and &ldquo;such&rdquo; is a pronoun of some kind.  The Minister says that the effect they would have on this section is small but it is our considered opinion that those four words are necessary to make this a better piece of legislation. That is no reflection on the drafting or on the Minister but we had Acts challenged in the Supreme Court and we are trying to indemnify <Col N="470" /> the Oireachtas against such action by outraged citizens so that we will not have to go to the Supreme Court to test the validity of this section.  The Minister should accept our four word amendment.  Our attitude this evening has been one of good-will and the Minister has not been so bad himself. He should go further.  It is now eight o'clock.  He should accept our amendment and let us then get on with the rest of the Bill.  When the Bill has been passed, as I am sure it will be, the Minister will feel much more satisfied if he has listened with earnestness to our plea and met our constructive approach to this amendment. We have done all we can to meet him.  We look forward to the Minister accepting this amendment. We think it will improve the section.</P>

      <P>He says it makes no difference.  We disagree with him.  We could have tabled a number of amendments if our intention was to use amendments to slow up the Bill.  The Minister has accused my colleagues and I of filibustering.  We have our own ideas about filibustering.  We can talk at length on other subjects but the reason we are fighting for this amendment with such dedication is that we believe in it.  The more I read the section the more I am convinced that our amendment is vitally necessary. The Minister read the full section in making the point that our amendment was obstructive and unnecessary. If I could get him to read that section about three more times, I believe he would come around to our way of thinking on this.  The necessity for our amendment only arises in relation to a polling district which has been broken in two, three or four pieces arising from the creation of new constituencies. We believe that subsection (1) (a) needs the addition of the words &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo;. It is in the context of a triple break in the polling district that we think those words are so vital.  Our party discussed this at length before the amendment was put down by our spokesman, Deputy Molloy, but as this debate continues I more and more appreciate the vital necessity for those four words.  I presume that the Minister in the hour-and-a-half break was so fed up with the discussion that he did not give much thought to this amendment but I feel that if he did he would become convinced that this would bring a vital benefit, not a theoretical benefit.  This is not a case of giving way to Fianna Fáil for the sake of saying that we contributed to this <Col N="472" /> Bill.  I say categorically that I do not want in any way to contribute to this Bill but if we are to have an unjustifiable piece of legislation it might as well be 100 per cent unjustifiable. That is the academic interest I have in it.  The Minister is so insulting in referring to contributions from this side that there is no reason why I should not put on record my views on his Bill but in order to cross the Ts and dot the Is properly I am becoming more and more interested in trying to ensure that this section is properly constructed.  This is why we are so industrious in trying to see that the Minister does not make a mistake that he will only appreciate in 12 months' time.</P>

      <P>I have spoken a number of times on this amendment of Deputy Molloy's which proposes the addition of four words to subsection (1) (a), &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo;.  I have here the <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English</i> edited by H.W. Fowler and F.G. Fowler, based on the <i>Oxford Dictionary.</i> It is the fifth edition provided by E. McIntosh.  I refer to the meaning given there of the word &ldquo;constituency&rdquo; which is one of the four words contained in &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo;. &ldquo;Constituency&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;a body of voters who elect a representative member, a division of, a county or division of a borough returning an MP, a place, a body of residents in a place so represented, a body of customers, subscribers, <i>et cetera</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You then come to &ldquo;constituent&rdquo; which is derived from the word and it is defined as (1) composing, making up a whole, appointing, electing, able to frame or alter a political constitution, and (2) one who appoints another his agent, component part, member of a constituency, <i>et cetera.</i> I think &ldquo;one who appoints another his agent&rdquo; is very important because as Members of this Oireachtas we are appointed as agents of the people and as such have a duty to examine legislation on their behalf, legislation which affects them.  As Deputies, we <Col N="473" /> are merely agents of the people and when legislation comes before the House we have a duty to clarify it. As defined by the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> a constituency is a body of voters who elect a representative member.  This is definite, clear, concise wording by the very title of the book which is the <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English.</i></P>

      <P>I am coming to the amendment with which we are dealing, not the polling districts, with respect.  We shall get to polling districts later, some time next week.  As I see it, the constituency has to be specified in accordance with the meaning of the word as defined in the <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English</i>, a body of voters who elect a representative member.  Without the amendment we have put down which says: &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo;, if we join it or part of it with any adjoining polling district or districts, you are left in doubt as to which constituency the section refers to.  With these four words we are attempting to specify.  This is very important when one has regard to the meaning of the word &ldquo;constituency&rdquo; and, consequently, the meaning of the word &ldquo;constituent&rdquo;.  As the agents of our constituents represented by a constituency&mdash;and we have three in some areas, four in others and five in other areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I relate them in this way.  It is essential that the four words &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo; should be put in so that we can&mdash;I think it is our duty&mdash;show to the people in our constituency what is in our minds.  They can take up this Bill and see exactly what was in the minds of the legislators.  There are many solicitors and barristers who make a great deal of money interpreting Acts of this Dáil.  We are trying <Col N="474" /> to leave the legislation so that there can be no doubt in anybody's mind as to what is in our minds if we pass this legislation eventually.  We should all like the Minister to accept these four words which I am tired saying and which, I am sure, the Chair is tired hearing, so that we could move to the next section and amendment. It would be much easier for all concerned if the Minister would accept the good faith in which we put down this amendment.  He said himself that it does not do any harm and it would be much simpler if he would accept the view of the largest political party in the country representing the greatest number of voters.  As their representatives and agents as defined by the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i>, agents of this vast number of people, we are asking the Minister, not as individuals, to insert this amendment so that those who voted for our party, those who want clarification of this by the Minister accepting the four words &ldquo;within such specified constituency&rdquo; would be satisfied.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister introduced legislation and in his Second Reading speech he said he was prepared to consider any amendments put forward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We feel this amendment will strengthen and clarify the section as it stands in this Bill.  The Minister agrees that it will do no harm but he refuses to accept it.  We are a democracy. When the Minister was on this side of the House, he spoke on various sections of various pieces of legislation in his long number of years here.  On many occasions he was very sorry the Minister would not accept what he thought was a reasonable amendment.  The Minister has the reputation of being a reasonable man; we saw his picture in the newspapers recently in Leisureland and I am sure the people in Galway also thought he was reasonable.  We have four reasonable <Col N="475" /> words, not too long, which we would like to have inserted in the section. The word &ldquo;within&rdquo; is harmless in itself; the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; as interpreted by the <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the House in defining the meaning of the word &ldquo;such&rdquo;.  However, there are a few points I might mention in relation to this word.  The dictionary states &ldquo;... in a legal or formal style of the aforesaid kind whoever shall make such return falsely ...&rdquo;.  It has legalistic connotations and it is important to remember this fact.  For this reason we want to insert the word in this legislation. There have been too many &ldquo;legal eagles&rdquo; earning too much money at the expense of the citizens with regard to legislation enacted by the Dáil and the Seanad.  When this legislation eventually is passed we want it to be as clear and concise as possible.  The amendment put down by Deputy Molloy, which refers to four specific words, will clarify and improve the legislation.  It will avoid much unnecessary expense at a later stage.  We have experience in the House of legislation which has been found to be unconstitutional, including a previous Electoral Bill.  We do not want that to happen in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> If the Minister accepts the amendment in the name of our spokesman for Local Government, he could avoid many problems in the courts in the future.  He could avoid putting unnecessary expense on citizens and, most important, he could ensure that the legislation is equally understood by the ordinary elector who is affected by this Bill.  I appeal once again to the Minister to reconsider his attitude He has told us the amendment would not do any harm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke brought with him a copy of <i>Chambers's Dictionary</i> to assist him in the debate but if he had paused for a minute he would have realised that the definition of &ldquo;constituency&rdquo; in an English dictionary refers to that country where there are one-seat constituencies and, therefore, it has no relevance to this Bill.  The Deputy should have taken the trouble to read the Bill.  The trouble is that people do not bother to read it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 3 (2) reads as follows:</P>
      <P>An area specified in the Schedule to this Act shall be taken to be that area as constituted on the 1st day of January, 1973, but if any doubt arises as to the constituency in which any townland or part thereof, any road or street or part thereof, or any part of a ward, is included, the doubt shall be determined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Section 4 states:</P>
      <P>A constituency specified in the Schedule to this Act shall return the number of members set out in respect thereof in the third column of that Schedule.</P>
      <P>So far as this House is concerned a constituency is whatever is decided by the Oireachtas.  If the Deputy had remembered that and had read the Bill before speaking, he could have saved himself and the House the trouble of going through <i>Chambers' Dictionary</i> which has no relevance to the matter we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> I hate being repetitive but it is impossible to answer the same arguments made by numerous Members opposite without doing this.  They have been saying the Bill would be improved by the addition of four words but my reply from the start, and it has not changed, was that it would make no difference except to make the Bill four words longer.  I do not think that is a good reason to alter a Bill before this House.</P>
    <P>I have said on a number of occasions, and on other Bills I have proved it, that provided a reasonable amendment is suggested I have no objection whatever to considering it and, if necessary, including it in the Bill. What annoys me is that there are intelligent people here, elected representatives, who must know that what they are saying has not the ring of common sense.  They have been repeating the same thing again and again, that if the four words were included it would make all the difference. As I said at the start, no polling district can straddle a constituency boundary and, therefore, it would not be open to a city manager or county secretary to do other than what is proposed in the amendment.  As it stands, the people who will be drawing up a constituency cannot do other than what is proposed in the amendment. There is neither sense nor reason in the continuous repetition that the section should be amended by adding the four words.</P>
    <P>I do not think it fair that this kind of thing should be done.  Deputy Lalor said I was accusing him and the Opposition of deliberately holding up the business of the House.  If he or his colleagues could give me another name for what they are doing, for talking on this matter for five-and-a-quarter hours&mdash;which they must know is sheer, utter nonsense&mdash;I should like to hear it.  I think we have had enough of it and I ask that the question be now put.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Minister's attitude to Deputy Burke's <Col N="478" /> contribution.  I regard the fact that the Deputy brought a dictionary with him to help him in his arguments as a tribute to the Minister and the Bill. The Deputy is taking the matter so seriously he is not satisfied with his own knowledge or belief.  Plato, a most ardent republican, went to endless trouble to ensure the wording of a document was correct.  Two years ago in this House the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;he was then in Opposition&mdash;opposed a Bill and informed the House that he would speak for nine hours to define two words &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; and &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.  We were debating the Forcible Entry Bill.  I listened to Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, as he then was, for the best part of six hours.  He used 13 volumes of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary.</i></P>

      <P>Eleven volumes of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> in order to define the two words &ldquo;encourage or incite&rdquo;.  Deputy Burke's contribution from the dictionary tonight was short and to the point.  I must compliment him on it and on the painstaking effort he made to drive home his argument as to why the Minister should accept this very simple amendment.  We have spent a great deal of time on it.  We believe it is necessary.  Deputy Molloy feels strongly about this and, in his absence through illness, we have supported his amendment here.  If the Minister wants to apply the guillotine, that is normal parliamentary procedure and we do not resent it.</P>

      <P>I was merely illustrating the position.  I must pay tribute to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for sitting so patiently listening to the very intelligent arguments from this side of the House.  I think they reach the highwater mark of common sense. The reputation of the House would benefit greatly if the Minister even now were to accept the amendment. It is as easy as that.  If the Minister accepts the amendment, we will meet him every way we possibly can on the Bill, not just to please the Minister, though that would be a pleasure, but in order to enact here the best piece of legislation we can.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke referred to what happened when we passed faulty legislation.  There is a trend at the moment for people to challenge legislation.  That is their right.  It would, however, be infinitely better if we were to make the legislation we pass here as perfect as it is humanly possible to make it.  The addition of these four words would make this section much more efficient.  If we examine each subsequent section with the same meticulous care, we will be able to join with the Minister in saying we have done a good job.  If the Minister accepts the amendment we will be doing a good job.  We are not seeking after victor or vanquished in this debate.  All we want to do is to see common sense triumph.  It will be a triumph of common sense if the Minister accepts the amendment. There has been no bitterness in this debate.  We have made our case and the Minister has made his case.  The Minister does not regard the amendment as necessary.  We think it is.  The Minister has had to carry the burden alone.  We had six or seven speakers on this side of the House.  We had the collective wisdom and intelligence of the Members here.  That should influence the Minister in accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment a.a.1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1) (b), line 22, after &ldquo;for it&rdquo; to add &ldquo;within such constituency&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (1) (b) would then read:</P>
      <P>constitute it as a polling district and appoint a polling place for it within such constituency.</P>
      <P>This is a corollary to the amendment we have been discussing.  I still insist that that amendment was justified and I maintain that this amendment is equally justified though, were we to prevail upon the Minister to accept this amendment, he would of necessity have to amend the Bill for Report Stage in regard to subsection (a) to include the words he has already rejected. It is obvious that the Minister will not be anxious to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>It is possible that the Minister might, unpredictably, accept this amendment.  It is put forward as an amendment to a specific section.  In order to make sense of the amendment one must accept the fact that we are anxious to cut out the danger of ambiguity in relation to the specific constituency which is spelled out in the principal paragraph of section 1. This section deals with the particular arrangements which have been made following the breaking up of the constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection which we propose to amend indicates that a portion of a polling district will be created as a polling district in the new constituency into which it has been placed. Our amendment will more clearly identify the placing of this portion of <Col N="481" /> the old polling district.  The addition of the words &ldquo;within such constituency&rdquo; is necessary to avoid ambiguity.</P>
    <P>This section deals with a polling district which was in existence at the time of the passing of this Act in an existing constituency, say, the present constituency of Dublin South-West. That constituency is being done away with.  In the Crumlin area of Dublin at present, there is a polling district situated in Dublin South-West.  Arising from the gerrymander of Dublin City we have the situation whereby that particular polling district is divided.  Part of it is in Dublin/Ballyfermot, part in West County Dublin and part in Dublin/Rathmines West. According to this section where a polling district&mdash;let us call it Crumlin &mdash;existing at the passing of this Act finishes up being not wholly situate within one of the constituencies specified in the Schedule to this Act, the appropriate officer&mdash;the appropriate officer is spelt out further down as being the manager&mdash;after consultation with the returning officer for the constituency concerned, shall with respect to the part of the polling district situate in a constituency so specified, constitute it as a polling district and appoint a polling place for it.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of section 7, part of the old Crumlin polling district is in Dublin/Ballyfermot, part in Dublin West County Dublin and part in Dublin/Rathmines West.  I cannot understand who is the appropriate officer for the Crumlin district which is split into three different constituencies. I do not know in which constituency the particular polling district is considered to be the appropriate area for the appropriate officer.  There is such a degree of ambiguity in this section, in the identification of the appropriate officer for the appropriate section of an aforementioned polling district, that it is impossible to say that the appropriate officer in respect of the part of the polling district situated in a constituency so specified will constitute that portion of the old polling district as a polling district and appoint a polling place for it.</P>
    <P>There are three new polling districts <Col N="482" /> to be created out of one old polling district.  Therefore, it is necessary to add the words &ldquo;within such constituency&rdquo;.  By spelling out &ldquo;within such constituency&rdquo; one is clearly indicating that there is a situation wherein there is a portion of the old polling district within Dublin/ Rathmines West now, a portion of the old South-West polling district within West County Dublin now, and a portion of the old Crumlin polling district within Dublin/Ballyfermot now.  Assuming it was divided equally there would be a third in Ballyfermot, a third in West County Dublin and a third in Dublin/Rathmines West.  Unless it is spelled out in subsection (b) of this section that each of those areas have to be dealt with within such constituencies, there will be a degree of ambiguity which could mean that the appropriate officer for the Dublin/ Ballyfermot district could find himself constituting a polling district and appointing a polling place for the portion of this Crumlin area which will have been embraced in the Dublin/Rathmines West area.</P>
    <P>That is the best way I can get my message across to the Minister.  I wanted to clarify this point for the Minister on our first amendment but I did not get the opportunity of presenting that new facet to him because he decided to guillotine the debate.  I was trying to spell out the mistake he was making but he could not wait.  It had to be guillotined.  I am trying to give an example of where the problem can be created.  You can have exactly the same situation in a polling district somewhere between Booterstown and Mount Merrion which will be embraced in the Dublin South-East, Dublin South County and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituencies. The same type of situation can arise in the Ormond Quay area where Dublin North-Central links in with Dublin (Cabra) and across the river in Dublin South-Central.  You could have an old polling district which was in the old Dublin North-Central area with portion of it now in Dublin (Cabra), portion of it in Dublin South-Central and portion of it in Dublin North-Central.  We should <Col N="483" /> clear up any possible ambiguity that may arise, with the possibility of returning officers and appropriate officers, those who will be having consultations with the returning officers, walking on each other's corns and claiming jurisdiction over an area over which they may not have jurisdiction, and for which they may not be responsible for issuing registration forms.</P>
    <P>We suggest the addition of the words &ldquo;within such constituency&rdquo; to section 7 (1) (b) &ldquo;constitute it as a polling district and appoint a polling place for it&rdquo;.  It is easier to explain this than it was in the case of the previous amendment because on subsection (a) we were talking about the possibility of portion of a polling district being assumed into an adjoining polling district in a new constituency. On paragraph (b) we are talking about a more solid portion, a more sizeable portion of the old polling district which can justify the creation of a polling place in its own right which, to follow the Minister's argument in 1969 would constitute the creation of an individual polling place.  I do not want to quote the reference again in case the Minister might accuse me of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will co-operate as fully as I possibly can so long as I get proper replies from the Minister, intelligent interventions and non-insulting ones, I will rise to the insults and I will not react in the manner in which the Minister wants me to react.</P>
      <P>I am endeavouring to get a message across, the message not only of the justification but the vital necessity for inserting this amendment into the section.  As presented to the House, the paragraph speaks of constituting a polling district situated in a new constituency as a polling district and appointing a polling place for it.  It is necessary to have the words &ldquo;within such constituency&rdquo; added in order to obviate the danger of a situation arising in which portion of an old polling district within a new constituency could have the appropriate officer from the adjoining constituency appointing a polling place for it or linking it in with another polling district, perhaps, not in its own constituency. That is the danger I see and I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  He has not had an opportunity to indicate whether he is accepting the amendment and he should be given that opportunity at this stage.</P>

      <P>I believe in people being trained for their job.  I believe that at the start a person may not know much about his job but as time goes on, let it be a trade or a profession, he should improve and he should become an expert.  As a practising politician for many years, I am a little surprised that people like Deputy Lalor and Deputy Molloy&mdash;who, unfortunately, is ill and cannot be here&mdash;should have <Col N="485" /> made such a mistake in putting down this amendment.  Obviously, they do not know what the facts are.  People engaged in politics should know how politics operate not only in their own constituency but in other constituencies as well.  They should know how elections take place and they should know what exactly are the facts of life with regard to voting, where people vote, why they vote there, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You may know a little about it but somebody else must do the work as this will show.  You do not seem to know very much about this fact and you should know it.  I said that the amendment which has just been disposed of would do no good and no harm.  Not only would this do no good but it would do a considerable amount of harm.  When I explain it, I am quite sure that even Deputy Lalor will understand.</P>
      <P>This amendment will have the effect of providing that where there is part of a split polling district in a constituency which is constituted as a separate polling district, the polling place appointed for the newly constituted polling district would have to be within the constituency concerned.  This amendment would conflict with section 22 (5) of the Electoral Act, 1963, and, in addition, would result in electors being inconvenienced.  Section 22 (5) provides:</P>
      <P>A polling place appointed by a scheme ... may be within or outside the county, county borough, constituency or electoral area in which the polling district is situate, but shall be such as to give the electors allocated to it reasonable facilities for voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's amendment conflicts directly with that provision.  I am glad to see that Deputy Callanan is in the House as usual.  I am sure he will agree with me that in an interjection last week he pointed out the fact that it is more convenient to have a polling station outside the constituency in a neighbouring village where people <Col N="486" /> were accustomed to going than in the new constituency in which they find themselves.  This has operated fairly well in practically every constituency and I would almost have a bet that Deputy Lalor has at least one of them in his constituency.  I know Deputy Moore has at least one and quite a number of Members of this House have such polling stations belonging to different constituencies in their constituency or some of theirs in a neighbouring constituency.  The only reason for this is that it is the most convenient place for the people to vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that polling stations would be within the constituency.  For instance, the railway line was the line in Galway. Geographically, I would be voting in the old North East Galway constituency but, because the polling station was in the South Galway constituency, I was in South Galway.  It is not the polling station; it is the people voting in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another way of putting the same thing.  This happens all over the place.  If the amendment was carried this would be prevented from happening if there was no polling booth within the constituency near where people live.  They would have to travel within their own constituency until they would come to such a booth when, in fact, they are entitled, under this arrangement, if it is more convenient, to vote outside the constituency.  I am surprised at Deputy Lalor being puzzled as to which appropriate officer will be dealing with a particular electoral district because every electoral district in this country is in one or other constituency. The appropriate officer will know which electoral districts are in his constituency and he will make the necessary arrangements to allow them to vote, if it is more convenient, within the constituency.  If it is more convenient for them to vote outside it he will do just that.  If there is any doubt about this being something new we have had the last Bill, the one before that and the one before that <Col N="487" /> again where different arrangements were made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lalor was kind enough to quote something which I said in this regard.  People were travelling from one constituency, not to the neighbouring one where they could vote and where they will vote in the next election, but across that constituency into another one because of the electoral division.  In my native village by the decision of this House at the last election there was a polling station where 56 people were in the Meath constituency, 132 in the Cavan constituency and 52 in the Monaghan constituency.  They all voted in the one area because it was the local school.  For their convenience this is what will be continued.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Deputy Lalor, at short notice, was asked to move this amendment and it is possible that he has not had an opportunity of looking at this particular angle.  I know how one tends to look at something in a certain way and I am aware that it is difficult to see that there is another interpretation to it.  However, it has been my job to ensure that I look at all sides of it.  The situation is this that if the amendment, as proposed by Deputy Lalor for Deputy Molloy, is put into operation it would be contrary to section 22 (5) of the Electoral Act, 1963, and, in addition, would prevent people from voting at the most convenient place.  I am sure Deputy Lalor, or his colleagues, would not like to see that happen.  I suggest that the best thing that the Deputy can do is to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In suggesting this, I must add that there is no catch in it.  I am simply stating what the facts are.  The facts are that while the vast majority of the polling places will be within the constituency there are some exceptions. In Dublin city there are five polling districts where electors vote at premises which are situated outside the constituency concerned.  The voting premises were selected because of the fact that they were the most convenient. There is not much point in attempting to make a law which will prevent the continuance of this very <Col N="488" /> convenient practice and for that reason I suggest that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation, as explained by the Minister, sounds logical but I was surprised, for a man who made such an intensive study of the constituencies and indicated that he had gone through it with a fine comb before presenting this Bill to the House, to hear his reference to the constituency I have the privilege of representing.  That constituency has all its polling stations within its boundaries. At no place in the constituency is there a polling station where someone is voting from outside the constituency. It was only when Deputy Burke pointed out the position in the Dublin area that I felt I should bring the Minister's attention to this matter. I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

If the polling booth happens to be in constituency X and some of the people who are going to that booth are from constituency Y, will the Minister have two boxes in that booth and at the end of the day will they go to the separate counting centres?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the biggest problems we had in making a number of logical points on section 7 was that the discussion up to now had to be <Col N="489" /> confined to the four words in the amendment.  There are a number of observations which should be made on this section and have not been referred to as yet.  In my view there is an amount of ambiguity in connection with subsection (1).  One would need a certain amount of legal training in order to understand and accept the Minister's intention in that subsection. The more I read the section the more vague it became.  That section states:</P>
      <P>Where a polling district existing at the passing of this Act is not wholly situate within one of the constituencies specified in the Schedule to this Act, the appropriate officer, after consultation with the returning officer for the constituency concerned, shall, with respect to the part of the polling district situate in a constituency so specified&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) join it or parts of it with any adjoining polling district or districts, or</P>
      <P>I feel there is a degree of ambiguity in that statement because we are speaking in the singular about the appropriate officer and at the same time we are dealing with at least two, if not three, appropriate officers.  If the polling district is situated within the constituency, there is no problem but if it is not it automatically means that some portion of it must be in another constituency.  Does this section refer to the portion of it that is still left in the existing constituency? Does it refer to the section of the constituency that has been incorporated into the newly created constituency or does it refer to the portion of it which is in another part of the constituency?  We talk here specifically about the appropriate officer. Why should we not talk about the appropriate officer in the new constituency? Why should we not talk about the appropriate officers in the various constituencies embracing the old polling district?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to refer to is section 22 of the Electoral Act, 1963.  Section 7 (2) refers to an arrangement made pursuant to paragraph <Col N="490" /> (a) or paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section and states that it shall be subject to the sanction of the Minister.  The arrangement is to be made by the appropriate officer after consultation with the returning officer.  This arrangement will last for 12 months, assuming this Bill is passed in that time.  Theoretically, this Dáil has another four years to run but all the information is that there will be an explosion within the next six months.  We have a temporary arrangement which may have to be made for three years.</P>

      <P>Section 7 of this Bill states that the appropriate officer, after consultation with the returning officer for the constituency concerned, shall submit his arrangement for the new polling district for sanction to the Minister and finishes up with a temporary polling district in the new area. In the appropriate section of the 1963 measure the creation of polling districts is a reserved function, for the purposes of the County Management Acts of 1940 to 1955, of the county council.</P>
      <P>One of the matters about which the Minister has always spoken is the democratic process and passing on of functions to local authorities.  We now have the situation whereby there is an opportunity in this section of the Bill for the Minister to give local authorities the power to create polling districts on a permanent basis.  The appropriate officer, the manager in the county borough areas and the secretary in county council areas has the overall right and it is legitimate as an extremely short-term arrangement. It is stated that in this measure that this temporary arrangement:</P>
      <P>shall have effect until (and only until) the first scheme under section 22 of the Electoral Act, 1963, in relation to the county or county borough in which the polling district is situate comes into operation after the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>If some time elapses between the passing of this Bill and the Dáil going out of existence I do not see any reason why an opportunity should not be given to local authorities to prepare a fresh scheme.  I can appreciate the new polling districts could not operate until after the dissolution of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why the county council or the corporation in a city area should not have the opportunity of having their voices heard in regard to the creation of those temporary schemes.  The Minister should give serious consideration to this aspect with a view to including this power in the section.  I appreciate that we are talking about a temporary arrangement but it is a temporary arrangement which will become permanent <Col N="492" /> following the next election and there is no reason why the county council, which subsequent to the next general election would have the opportunity of preparing new polling districts within the new constituencies, should not have the opportunity in the interim period of having their views considered.  This would be a much better arrangement than leaving the power specifically with the returning officer because the next election will be fought on the basis of the polling districts which have been created by county managers and county secretaries in consultation with the returning officers for the various areas but without reference to the county councils or the corporations.  There is no reason why a time limit should not be put on it and it could be included in this section that if an election is held within a six-month period from the date of the passage of the Bill the appropriate officer, after consultation with the returning officer for the constituency concerned, shall create the fresh polling district but if the election is not held until some time after a six-month period that in the meantime the reserved function, as spelt out in section 22 (7) of the 1963 Act, should be brought into effect and that the local councillors and members of the corporation should be able to have their voices heard and their influence felt as public representatives.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government is a man who has given a fair share of lip service to the idea of giving members of local authorities greater powers.  I do not think he should be associated with the withdrawal of a function which they already have.  I agree that this section is a replica of section 7 of the 1969 Act and previous Acts but that is no reason why it cannot be improved.  This is an Electoral (Amendment) Bill dealing specifically with election to Dáil Éireann and there is no reason why the local elected representatives, whose powers have been limited in the past, should not get a power which it is intended that they should have but which is withdrawn from them because of the necessity to conduct <Col N="493" /> constituency revisions in relation to changes in the distribution of population and increased population in the country.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to point out that I am very unhappy about section 7 (1) of this Bill.  There is a degree of ambiguity there and an element of doubt and this was the reason for my being so sticky and so tenacious in relation to amendment a.1.  There is something lacking in that section.  It needs clarification.</P>
    <P>I notice, too, that the new polling district that has to be created by the appropriate officer, after consultation with the returning officer, is subject to the sanction of the Minister whereas in relation to the function which the local authority has in the preparing of a national scheme it is not alone subject to the Minister but the Minister can revoke it or amend it by a subsequent scheme under this section. Under the 1963 Act if a scheme is prepared by the local authority it is subject not alone to ministerial sanction but to ministerial interference in so far as the Minister can reject it, amend it and generally play around with it.  In this instance the county manager or county secretary can prepare a scheme in consultation with the returning officer and the Minister has not got the right to amend it; he simply has the right to sanction or not to sanction it.  This seems remarkable in so far as this is a temporary arrangement to deal with an urgent matter.  I wonder what will happen coming up to election time if the appropriate officer keeps sending up schemes in relation to a disjointed polling district and the polling place for it and if the Minister continues to be dissatisfied.  The Minister has not the right under this Bill, if he is dissatisfied, to amend, he has only the right to refuse to sanction the polling district.  The Minister instanced, in relation to the amendment we withdrew, the situation in which the polling booth for a polling district is outside a constituency.  Suppose the appropriate officer decides to have polling in a particular school or hall which he considers convenient for the voters in an area.  I have plenty of <Col N="494" /> experience of local people complaining about the siting of the polling stations but once the local authority have decided in this regard nothing can be done about it.  The Minister, if approached, can change that in that case but in this instance the situation is such that if the county secretary or the county or city manager fixes a particular hall about which the general public protest or, perhaps, a colleague of the Minister protests to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the county secretary or the city or county manager appoints a polling place for a particular polling district and it is unsuitable the Minister can refuse to sanction it but there is nothing in the section which allows the Minister to fix or appropriate a suitable place.  He must just refuse to sanction and the county secretary or county manager can come back and perhaps suggest a different room in the same school which would not appeal to the Minister. I am rather surprised that the Minister does not take power here as he does in the Principal Act not only to refuse to sanction but also power to fix an appropriate polling place.  I should like the Minister to refer to this in dealing with this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We had quite a long comment from Deputy Lalor and I think his final point is a valid one, not quite as valid as he says because it means in co-operation with the returning officer; there would be two people involved.  The Minister has not the right to tell him he must put it somewhere else.  The Minister can say: &ldquo;That will not do.&rdquo; He would then have to produce another one or would be supposed to do so.  While this has never occurred I agree that it could happen.  Somebody might be foolish or awkward enough to do <Col N="495" /> something like that and, for that reason perhaps, this should be looked into with a view to ensuring that particular little loophole is closed up.  I thank the Deputy for drawing it to my attention.</P>
      <P>I would not be so complimentary in regard to the &ldquo;appropriate officer&rdquo;. There could only be one appropriate officer in a county.  Deputy Lalor wants to know who is the appropriate officer.  Subsection (3) says:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;the appropriate officer&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>and it goes on to say who the appropriate officer is.  There is no doubt about that, no ambiguity.</P>

    <P>If there are two counties joined together for one constituency, each county secretary is responsible for his own county.  The returning officer will be responsible for the two counties but the appointment of polling places is the responsibility of the county secretary in co-operation in the normal way with elected members, subject to sanction by the Minister and in this special way&mdash;I want to come to this in a moment&mdash;the county secretary will be subject to sanction of the temporary arrangement.</P>

      <P>Elected representatives have more power than they want to use sometimes.  That is No. 1.  Deputy Lalor referred to a temporary arrangement. Again, it is quite simple.  The temporary arrangement would be made quickly to ensure that the electoral machine is always ready for an election.  Power to make these arrangements is taken because the making of a polling scheme takes a minimum of several months.  If you decide it will be done by the elected representatives, as it is normally done, it could take several months and if an election occurred in the meantime there could be a breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make two points: first, this does not refer to by-elections; they are fought on the old arrangements; secondly, the temporary scheme will only apply to a minimum number of polling areas throughout the county; only, in fact, where there is a boundary change <Col N="498" /> will this be done.  There is one point which I think Deputy Lalor did not know and I hope he will read the debate because it is important.  While it is not usual for county councils to make polling schemes except every so many years, there is no reason why they should not decide to make one whenever they think it necessary.  In fact, a temporary arrangement could be made by the county secretary but could be superseded by a permanent arrangement made as quickly as possible, within a few months afterwards, by the elected representatives.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Callanan pointed out, if there are two different townlands, one in Galway and one in Clare&mdash;let us take Kinvara and New Quay&mdash;and if there is a row between the county secretaries in Galway and Clare, who decides where the polling station will be?  If the Clare county secretary wants to have it in his county and the Galway county secretary wishes to have the station in Galway, does the Minister act as referee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy has missed the point.  A county secretary is responsible for polling stations within his county.  He is the absolute boss. If the county secretary in Clare wants to put a polling station in a particular place he is entitled to do so, subject to sanction of the Minister and this applies to the county secretary in Galway also.  If it is decided it would be more convenient to have one polling station catering for the two areas and if they reach agreement on the matter that is all right.  If they do not reach agreement each is entitled to have one.</P>

      <P>If there are only 20 voters in each townland in different counties and if the county secretaries do not agree, will it be necessary to have a polling booth in each county?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  You could not put them in one polling district if they are in two different counties.  They could be in one constituency and they could vote in one polling booth. Polling districts are not broken for <Col N="499" /> general elections.  The Deputy knows the arrangement as well as I.  The situation the Deputy has referred to could not occur because each county secretary is responsible for the arrangements for polling districts within his county.  In the case mentioned by Deputy Geoghegan, the county secretary in Galway would make his own arrangements, as would the county secretary in Clare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the situation.  Deputy Lalor referred to making a scheme which would not be subject to change by the Minister. Incidentally, I was touched by the desire shown at times by the Opposition to give me more power.  At other times they wanted to take what little power I have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was touched by the impassioned appeal of Deputy Lalor when he wanted me to take power to do certain things.  As he knows, I have given a lot of power to local authorities and I propose to give them much more.  The only thing is some people did not seem to understand my discussion document or they did not send in their recommendations in time.</P>
      <P>The elected representatives are entitled to make arrangements for the electoral areas subject to sanction by the Minister.  The county secretaries and the city managers in the boroughs are entitled to make the temporary arrangements.  Here the Minister may only accept or reject.  As I said to Deputy Lalor, it appears there could be a little tightening up in this area. While I could not see any appointed officers doing anything that would be contrary to the common good, in case it happened it would be as well to have the authority to ensure no great harm was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elected representatives are the people who have the right to do these things.  As soon as possible they should <Col N="500" /> make their own arrangements, if they think the arrangements are not suitable, to appoint permanent polling areas.  This would eliminate the right which has been temporarily given to the officials.  Those were the main points Deputy Lalor mentioned.  I know the Opposition are as anxious as I am to bring discussion on this section to an end.</P>

      <P>I am very happy with the attitude of the Minister in regard to section 7.  He has been very co-operative with this side of the House.  The amendments we proposed earlier would have been dealt with much faster if the same sweet and reasonable attitude had prevailed.  I was happy with his clarification of the present situation and that envisaged which was mentioned by Deputy Lalor. <Col N="501" /> One matter was mentioned by Deputy Lalor which the Minister agreed needed clarification and some tightening. That is the question with regard to the permanent and the temporary arrangement.  I think Deputy Lalor's suggestion that it should be written into the Bill that the appropriate officers have the power for six months and after that the local councils or corporations will have responsibility would meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they have the power, but the Minister has had practical experience of the operations of county councils and I am sure he will agree that unless it is written into the Bill that this is a statutory duty it may not be dealt with as promptly as it should be dealt with. County councils and corporations have a great deal of work to do and, because of that, the onus must be placed fairly and squarely on them. If it is not written in one could have the situation adumbrated by Deputy Lalor.  In theory, this Dáil could run for another four years&mdash;it will not, of course&mdash;and you could have these temporary arrangements running for that length of time.  It would be better to have a specific clause for a definite period of six months and, after the six months, the responsibility would rest with the local bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision at the moment which says that a council must do this.  The fact is councils have been doing it for their own convenience.  County councils, as practically every Deputy in the House knows, are very careful of their rights and very careful to ensure convenient polling stations.  I think the onus should be on the council.  Remember, there could be a hiatus; the six-month period might be up and, for some reason or another, the new arrangement might not be introduced. There could then be an election with no arrangements made in some small areas within constituencies.  I prefer to leave it with the council.  One could send them a reminder occasionally that this was their job.</P>

I am asking the Minister to make a definite regulation so that we will not have this kind of anomaly.  Deputy Callanan raised this point in regard to his constituency where you have the boundary between Galway and Clare crossed; Galway County Council might decide on their particular section while Clare County Council might adjourn their decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the problem of the siting of polling stations.  You could have two small areas with polling booths side by side.  We withdrew the amendment on the basis of convenience where constitutents are concerned under subsection (1) (b).  Polling stations should be sited as conveniently as possible for the electorate.  The Minister is probably familiar with polling stations in country areas.  We closed a few of them.  In some we had 40, 50 or 60 voters and it was altogether <Col N="504" /> impracticable from the point of view of the public, the expense involved and the political parties.  Presiding officers and polling clerks had to be appointed.  This is a situation that should be avoided.  I suggest the Minister have another look at this between now and Report Stage and come back then and tell us what he thinks.  It is now 10 p.m. and we will be adjourning at 10.30 p.m.  It is unlikely that we will finish section 7 by then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see where a problem could exist but it is the lesser of two evils.  Which would be worse: to have for a temporary period two small stations near county borders or a situation where, because of a time limit, there would be no arrangements and it would break down?  I am anxious to co-operate on his point but, in everybody's interest, it would be much better if it were left to the elected representatives.  If necessary, reminders could be sent to them from time to time stating that the temporary arrangements must be turned into permanent arrangements within a reasonable time.  This need not be written into legislation.  If we attempt to do too much with this, I am afraid we will tie it up in such a way that the last situation could be worse than the first.</P>
      <P>I can see Deputy Burke's point but I feel there is a lesser chance of anything going wrong if we continue with the present system which has worked so far rather than introduce a new element which could cause a breakdown and leave us all with red faces.</P>

While this has worked in the past, I do not <Col N="505" /> think we ever had a situation similar to that in Ballymun.  In that area there are three old constituencies meeting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke is making a mistake which is very common to Dublin people when he imagines that something happens in Dublin only. This happens all over the country.  In every constituency change, with some exceptions, county boundaries are crossed again and again.  The county secretary in a county is responsible for his own area and the county secretary in the other county is responsible for his area.  In conjunction with the returning officer they make temporary decisions and then pass them on to the Minister for Local Government for sanction.  So far this has worked well.  I do not believe in promising to do something which I feel should not be done.  If I thought the amendment would improve the section, I would not be arguing.  Because the situation as it stands works, I consider that we should leave the section as it is.  The city manager will be responsible for arrangements within the city boundaries and the county secretary will be responsible for the county area. Therefore, there cannot be any overlapping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke suggested that if a county council decide to make new arrangements and create, for their own convenience, a booth near the border of the constituency which is also near a booth in the constituency at the other end of the county boundary that this might cause trouble.  I agree that this could be ridiculous, especially if the numbers involved were very small.  This is such a small chance that I prefer to see it <Col N="506" /> working the other way, to urge public representatives of the local authorities to ensure that where they are not satisfied with the arrangements made they will introduce new arrangements as soon as possible after the change in the constituencies.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is giving this point the attention and interest it deserves. He is familiar with the area about which I am speaking and on which my case hinges.</P>
      <P>There is a unique situation in Ballymun. It is a very densely populated area.  While county boundaries are crossed in rural Ireland, the same numbers are not affected.  The main Ballymun-Santry road divides the new town of Ballymun almost in half.  One half was in the old constituency.  The other half was divided and one part was in Dublin North-East and the other in Dublin North-West.</P>
      <P>To reach the polling station the electorate should not have to cross main roads.  The Minister should write a provision into this Bill which would insist on co-operation between city and county sections with regard to the siting of polling stations for the convenience of the people in this area. Can the Minister help us on this point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin city boundary has been breached in nearly every revision of constituencies.  It is not unique in Ballymun.  There is no reason to believe that this will cause hardship.  As a matter of fact, the opposite may be the case.  Therefore, I would not like to put in a provision which would not make it more effective and would possibly tie the hands of the elected representatives.  They hold the key.  An officer may make temporary arrangements but the elected representatives have the right to make permanent arrangements.  I would prefer to leave it at that.</P>

      <P>This would be very helpful with regard to the crossing of the county boundaries.</P>
      <P>I should like to discuss polling districts and polling places which are not necessarily altered because of the crossing of county boundaries.  The siting of polling stations for the convenience of the public has been causing trouble in every constituency over a number of years.  Within the boundaries of County Dublin, with the growth that has taken place over the past number of years, we find that we change a polling district station and 12 months later a completely new housing estate is built and the polling station which was convenient for the majority of the people when it was decided upon is not convenient.  As I understand it, changing it at county council level is quite a long drawn out process.  It has to be sent to the Minister for his comments and his officials' comments and for the Minister's approval.  I should like to see that whole process speeded up.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides that an arrangement made pursuant to paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section shall be subject to the sanction of the Minister. I do not think this power should be in the hands of the Minister.  So far as possible it should be at local level.  People are becoming more involved at local level and they are playing a much greater part in local politics.  This is a good trend.  It is fair enough that the councils should decide the locations of the polling districts and polling stations.  While the Minister is waiting for a decision by the local authority there is a temporary period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I interrupt Deputy <Col N="508" /> Burke because he is going on a wrong line.  Perhaps it would shorten the proceedings if I say that, while it is true that the local authority decide on the polling place which must be an area, in fact, the actual building where the polling booth is, is selected by the returning officer.  I agree entirely with what Deputy Burke is saying about the selection of polling booths and where they are placed. Eventually something will have to be done about that and I should like to see something done about it but it is not a matter for this Bill.  There is nothing I can do about it in this Bill at present.  All we can deal with is the split polling areas.</P>

I agree with Deputy Wyse but there are polling stations in quite a number of the geriatric hospitals where there are a big number of patients.  It is not the ideal way to conduct an election to have them hauled out of bed.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of the elected representatives for the local area to tell the county secretary to tell him to do that.  Where there are a considerable number of voters who are entitled to vote, it is the responsibility of the local authority to make arrangements for the polling area in which they can vote.  It is then the responsibility of the returning officer to ensure that a booth is placed where it will be convenient for them to vote. It is not the function of the Department or the Minister for Local Government to deal with a matter of that kind.  I suggest that it should be taken up at local level.  If a local authority are not dealing with it somebody&mdash; and I am sure Deputy Wyse would be the very man to do it&mdash;should remind them very sharply that those people are entitled to be facilitated for voting purposes.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with giving the Minister more power than he has at the moment but it is better to have the power in the Minister's hands since he can be questioned in Dáil Éireann rather than in the hands of the appropriate officers, meaning the county secretaries and so on, who cannot be questioned in the Dáil.  I said earlier that there could be a difference between two county managers or two local authorities on the siting of a polling station.  This should be subject not only to the sanction of the Minister but also to debate here.  The Minister should be able to make up his own mind.</P>

If too much power is left in the hands of county managers and county secretaries they cannot be questioned by Deputies who are not members of local authorities and there is a large number of those. On Report Stage the Minister should bring in an amendment to subsection (2) (a).  Subsection (3) (b) provides that in this section the appropriate officer means the county secretary.  I mentioned the case of County Dublin where we have not had a county secretary for months since the last county secretary retired having given excellent service to the people of <Col N="511" /> County Dublin for a long number of years.</P>

      <P>Section 22, of the 1963 Act, dealing with polling districts and polling places, states in subsection (1):</P>
      <P>The council of a county or corporation of a county borough may, after consultation with the returning officer for Dáil elections in respect of the county or county borough and in accordance with regulations made by the Minister, make a scheme dividing the county or county borough into polling districts for the purposes of Dáil elections and elections of members of local authorities within the meaning of Part VI of this Act and appointing a polling place for each polling district.</P>
      <P>Therefore, under that subsection the local authority have power to fix the polling place along with fixing the polling district.  That is why, with my knowledge of the situation, I drew specific attention to the omission in this section of the present Bill.  In both instances at present the appropriate officer has to make up his mind following consultation with the returning officer and the local authority have to make up their mind following consultation with the returning officer who fixes both polling districts and appoints polling places in each polling district.</P>
      <P>That is why I feel the temporary provision which section 7 is should also embrace a situation whereby after there is a given period exceeding six months between the time of the passing of this Bill and the time of bringing it into effect provision should be made to enable local authorities to prepare a new scheme embracing the creation of new polling districts and the creation of new polling places for the consituency.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct that that is the way subsection (1) of section 22 of the 1963 Act reads but subsection (5) of that section makes the position clear.  That subsection states:</P>
      <P>A polling place appointed by a scheme under this section shall be an area and may be within or outside the county, county borough, constituency or electoral area in which the polling district is situate, but shall be such as to give the electors allocated to it reasonable facilities for voting.</P>
      <P>In fact, what that means is that they do not select the actual building.  It must be within a certain area.  The reason is to prevent a particular building where there has been a catastrophe such as a fire being selected with the result that there will be no place to vote.  All the Act does is to provide that the county council shall arrange that voting takes place in a particular village or townland which is an area but the returning officer selects the actual building where voting takes place.</P>

      <P>I accept the fact, from my experience, that it is the returning officer who picks the spot and, of necessity, has to make last minute arrangements when he cannot get into places where he used be.  Subsection (3) of the 1963 Act states:</P>
      <P>As soon as may be after they have made a scheme under this section, the council of a county or corporation of a county borough shall submit the scheme to the Minister for confirmation and the Minister shall by order confirm the scheme with or without modification or refuse to confirm it.</P>
