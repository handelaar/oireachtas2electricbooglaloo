      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will waive the condition in respect of congested areas requiring a local contribution from beneficiaries under local improvement schemes in relation to the repair and improvement of bog roads which are not county roads.</P>

    <Col N="1221" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No local contribution is required from beneficiaries of local improvement schemes where the average rateable valuation of their lands is under £5.  I am satisfied that the condition requiring local contributions on a graduated scale in the cases where the average land valuation is £5 or over is fair and reasonable and should be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the fact that the valuation of the land is separate from the farm taken into account, especially where people live from six to ten miles from the bogs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The rateable valuation is, I assume, the valuation of the land. If there were more than two portions of a farm it would not be a good idea to divide them and have only the portion attached to the area to be improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Bog roads which are not public or county roads may be improved under the local improvement scheme.  That has been the practice since 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is difficult to get contributions when the roads are used only to bring out turf?  In view of the fuel emergency would he consider waiving the clause in the case of bog roads? In the old days the Office of Public Works were responsible for these roads and the schemes were noncontributory. When the county councils undertook responsibility for the local improvement schemes they made them contributory schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

      <P>Bog roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies do not seem to understand that the question of bog roads is different from any other.  Because of the difficulty of calculating local contributions where the users of bogs were numerous and scattered, the special employment schemes fixed a flat rate contribution of 10 per cent.  If this is operated successfully, it should help in having schemes carried out properly.  It would be a pity if people who will benefit substantially are not asked to contribute a small amount.</P>

      <P>In so far as private housing is concerned the position is that grants under the Housing Acts are under constant review.  With regard to local authorities, the Government decision of 29th March, 1973, effectively means that the State subsidies for the provision and maintenance of their rented dwellings, including dwellings for elderly persons, have been increased, from 1st April, 1973, to meet the full cost of all such dwellings now being provided, less any rental income received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there have been complaints of dampness in a small number of these flats.  The flats are still within the contract maintenance period and the National Building Agency have assured me that any defects found will be remedied in accordance with the contract.  To date, the agency's investigations have not revealed any source of dampness other than condensation.  Certain measures have, however, been suggested to the local tenants' association which will enable the agency to monitor the situation in these flats in the coming months. These measures will include any necessary redecoration of the flats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are families with three children living in two-room flats here and they have been told that redecoration <Col N="1226" /> will be carried out while the families are living in these flats?

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at least two families with three children each living in one room in some of these flats.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I expect it will be within 12 months.  No representations were received in respect of a speed limit for O'Callaghan's Mills. For that reason it was not inspected in 1971.  Since the making of the 1971 regulations representations were received once for a speed limit in the village.  As a result of the Deputy raising the matter this question now comes up for discussion.</P>

      <P>The county council's proposal in relation to Monasterevan is to instal pedestrian-operated traffic signals but on the basis of vehicular and pedestrian counts supplied by the council, I am advised that such an installation would not be warranted and the expenditure of Road Fund moneys would not, therefore, be justified.</P>

Professional driving instruction is on a small scale in this country.  I agree that something will have to be done as a top priority to tighten up the matter.</P>

      <P>It has been agreed in principle to designate secondary teaching and the Garda Síochána under section 4 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963.  However, before they are designated certain amendments to the secondary teachers superannuation scheme and the Garda Síochána pensions orders will be necessary and these, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, will be made as soon as possible.  It would not be feasible to make such designation retrospective as the provisions of section 4 of the Act referred to cannot be operated retrospectively; however, I understand that the practice in cases of transfers between the Garda Síochána and secondary teaching is to make special arrangements to enable pension rights to be preserved pending formal designation under the Act.</P>

In the preparation of the White Paper we had to balance the desirability of dealing with all matters, with the desirability of publishing a document which would not be too lengthy.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed annual wealth tax as outlined in the White Paper on Capital Taxation would apply to all assets having a cash value. Endowment policies and pension rights would not be regarded as assets unless they were such as could be converted into cash, and the value for tax purposes in such cases each year would be the amount which could be obtained for them on the date fixed for the annual valuation.  Normally, in the case of policies, this would be the surrender value and, in the case of commutable pension rights, the amount for which the rights could be commuted.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the White Paper on Capital Taxation set out a broad outline of a capital taxation system to replace estate duties and I have invited representations on them so that all relevant views can be carefully considered before the detailed provisions of a new system are settled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Endowment policies and pension rights which cannot be converted into cash would not be regarded as assets.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number and grading of staff required to administer the proposed new system of capital taxation would depend on the precise nature of the taxes.  Final decisions on many important details obviously cannot be made until representations on the proposals in the White Paper have been received and fully considered. Personnel at present engaged in the administration of estate duty, legacy and succession duties will, of course, be eventually freed from such work as the number of estates subject to such duties is reduced.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>I purpose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>Import price indices are published in Table 5 of Trade Statistics of Ireland published monthly by the Central Statistics Office.  The average of the monthly import (unit value) price index numbers for 1971 (base year 1968=100) was 120.0.  The corresponding figure for 1972 was 123.9. Average import prices in 1972, therefore, increased by 3.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>The figure of 20 per cent for the rate of imported inflation in 1973 given in my statement of 6th February, 1974, was an unpublished departmental estimate made on the basis of the monthly import price indices and other data.  The latest published data is for June, 1973.  In the period January-June, 1973, import prices were on average 15.8 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of 1972.  In June, 1973, the year on year increase was 19.5 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a source for one of the figures he quoted but I asked him for the source, or sources, for the figures, plural.  Is the Minister aware that on that day&mdash; as reported at column 82&mdash;he gave a figure of 7 per cent for the import rise in 1972 and that in the next column, 83, he gave a figure of 3.2 per cent? Would the Minister give the source for the second figure please?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that the first figure was given in a context of the average of a period of, as far as I can remember, five years. At the time Deputy Colley challenged the application of that average to the year 1972.  I then caused further inquiries to be made.  I was then able to come up with the precise figure for 1972&mdash;not the average for a period of years but for the specific year 1972&mdash; and this produced a figure of 3.2 per cent which I have quoted today.</P>

Is he further aware that the context in which he gave the second figure was in the course of abuse of me for simply asking him if he would give the figure for the year and that in fact he gave two different figures for the year and that he was chancing his arm again?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why the Revenue Commissioners are now, for the first time, seeking to make the subsidised bus tickets of workers at Shannon Airport.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>By virtue of the Income Tax Act, 1967, cash allowances payable to employees to cover the cost of travelling between home and their places of employment represent allowances in the nature of pay and are properly chargeable to tax.  Moreover, where an employer provides transport to or from work for his employees by way of the issue of bus tickets to them, the benefit to the employee is chargeable to tax where his annual income exceeds £1,500.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it recently came to light that some employers had failed to treat such allowances as pay for PAYE purposes. The employers in question have now been advised by the Revenue Commissioners as to the correct position.</P>

The Income Tax Act, 1967, has been in force for seven years and does not seem to have affected the situation up to now.

      <P>In view of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has been able, to his credit, to announce that the remainder of the Corrib-Robe-Mask catchment area will be done, will he not accept that the third prong of an inescapable political commitment remains to be discharged by him, the commitment not made by him but inherited by him, namely that the Maigue, the Robe and the Lung would be completed irrespective of any cost-benefit analysis that may have been in progress in his Department in recent times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy must understand that when the Corrib was first initiated in 1948 it was initiated as a full catchment area divided into three phases.  The Corrib was finished, the Corrib-Headford was finished and now they are on the third phase.  It would be ridiculous to have all North Mayo drained, all North Galway and South Mayo drained and the best fertile land of Mayo, around Ballinrobe, Thomastown, Hollymount, inundated with water.  The third phase must go through but it must go through under the initiation of the cost-benefit survey in 1969.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The provision in Directive 159/72 allowing member states to operate a temporary regime of aids for farmers not currently capable of attaining development status is valid for five years from the date on which the directive took effect, that is, up to 19th April, 1977.  Aids to these farmers will not cease at that date.  The directive requires the Council to reexamine the position after the five years and the types and levels of aids to be provided for this and other categories of farmers after April, 1977, will be a matter for consideration in the course of that re-examination.</P>
      <P>Under our present scheme, transitional farmers under 55 years of age are eligible for a 50 per cent grant for land improvement and a 30 per cent grant for buildings and fixed assets. Those over 55 years, who are eligible for retirement benefits under directive 160, may receive grants of 40 per cent for land improvement and 20 per cent for buildings and fixed assets. In both cases interest subsidies may be availed of instead of grants.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That in the case of the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1973 the remaining Stages of the Bill shall be proceeded with as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  The proceedings on the Committee Stage (resumed) of the Bill if not previously concluded shall be brought to conclusion at 8.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 2nd April, 1974 by putting from the Chair forthwith and successively any Questions necessary to bring the proceedings to conclusion.  Provided that after the said hour on that day no Question shall be put from the Chair on any amendment save an amendment put down by a Member of the Government and the Question on such an amendment shall be in the form, That the amendment be made; and after the appointed time notwithstanding the Instruction of 19th February 1974 to the Committee the Question to be put from the Chair to bring the proceedings on the Committee Stage of the Bill forthwith to conclusion shall be (as the case may require) That the Section/the Sections (as amended, if amendments have been made) stand part of and that the Schedule (as amended, if amendments have been made) and the Title be the Schedule and the Title to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The Fourth Stage of the Bill shall be proceeded with immediately upon the conclusion of the Committee Stage and the Proceedings on that Stage if not previously concluded shall be brought to conclusion at 9.30 p.m. on that day by putting from the Chair the Questions necessary to bring the proceedings to conclusion; and after the appointed time no Question shall be put from the Chair on any amendment save an amendment put down by a Member <Col N="1255" /> of the Government and the Question on such an amendment shall be in the form.  That the amendment be made.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Fifth Stage of the Bill shall be proceeded with immediately upon the conclusion of the Fourth Stage and the proceedings on that Stage if not previously concluded shall be brought to conclusion at 10.15 p.m. on that day by putting from the Chair forthwith the Questions necessary to bring the proceedings to conclusion; and after the appointed time no Question shall be put from the Chair on any amendment save an amendment put down by a Member of the Government and the Question on such an amendment shall be in the form, &ldquo;That the amendment be made&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words in support of this motion in reply to the many things that were said by the Minister for Local Government over the past weeks and I may, perhaps, be allowed to begin by adverting to something the Leader of the Opposition said here last week: he said he could see no urgency in this Bill and, in particular, he said that there was no whitewashing to be done because there did not seem to be much legislation lined up behind it.</P>
    <P>The present situation is that there are six Bills before the House in one shape or another, ready for processing, as Deputy Lenihan used to say. They are the Trade Union (Amalgamations) Bill; the Control of Importation, Sale and Manufacture of Contraceptives Bill; the Food Standards Bill and the Finance (Taxation of Profits of Certain Mines) Bill.  All these Bills will be ready after the Easter Recess for Second Stage. There are two further Bills&mdash;the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill&mdash;the Second Stages of which have been passed and they are now ready for Committee Stage.  I do not need to tell the House that the Local Government (Planning <Col N="1256" /> and Development) Bill is a very long piece of work.  For the Committee Stage the Opposition have put down a large number of amendments and we can anticipate several days will be occupied on this debate.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill are routine pieces of legislation which follow the budget.  I am sure the House will agree with me that in that list of eight Bills we will have more than enough to keep the House occupied flat out until the end of July. That is a fair load of work and I hope that that recital will sufficiently rebut what the Leader of the Opposition said here and implied and which, of course, has been faithfully echoed by the unthinking Press over the past months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has some features to which I wish now to draw the attention of the House.  I hope everyone will listen carefully because this is the background against which this &ldquo;Allocation of Time&rdquo; motion is set.  The account of the time taken by the corresponding debate in 1968-69 based on a more accurate, I hope system of computation, not on columns in the debate but on the hours noted in the report, shows that we somewhat underestimated both in regard to the last Bill and in regard to the current Bill the number of hours spent.  I will give the House now my best effort at producing a final figure for these two debates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get back to the three minutes very soon.  In 1973-74 the entire Bill from start to finish has so far occupied over 58 hours&mdash;that is the Bill with the corresponding purpose of the 1968-1969 Bill&mdash;and by the end of the day we will be well up to the 65 hour mark.  That has been achieved&mdash;rather, it has been kept down to that&mdash;only after the application of pre-closures; in other words, it is no thanks to the Opposition if the figure is still as low as 58 hours.  It is 58 hours after on three occasions a closure had to be applied.  That contrast speaks for itself if one were to look at it as though one had all the time in the world at the beginning of the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition have succeeded in wantonly and flagrantly wasting that much time before getting to the real guts of the Bill&mdash;at least, ostensibly <Col N="1258" /> getting to the guts of the Bill&mdash;because, in fact, although Deputy Molloy complained about this on the last occasion, Committee Stage speeches were persistently made and repetitiously made time and time again by the Opposition during the debate on the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>The next point is that the sections at the beginning of the Bill, which, with the appropriate changes and references, which are not really material, are identical with those in the 1969 Act, passed in 1968-69 in a matter of minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The quorum bells were sounded for the purpose of annoying the Government and wasting time. The last point I want to draw attention to is a conclusion which I was forced to after a conversation this day fortnight with the Opposition Whips. On that day on the Government's instruction I called on the Opposition Whips, Deputies Lalor and Browne, who received me with their usual courtesy, and I put to them a proposal that we might agree between both sides of the House a schedule for finishing before Easter this Bill, the budget and the Health regulations, which at that time I thought would have to be introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this to the Opposition Whips.  The Opposition Chief Whip was in collusion with the Leader of the Opposition and returned to say that my suggestion was not acceptable, that we could do what we liked about it but there was going to be no question of agreeing to a time schedule for the remainder of the business between then and Easter.  I told the Opposition Chief Whip that the Government would be obliged to allot time for the finishing of this Bill but that the Government would consider extending the hours whether by means of sitting on Friday of last week or by longer sittings on a Wednesday or in any way he chose to suggest if that would be of any use to him.  The Opposition Chief Whip may not have realised the inference <Col N="1260" /> he was inviting but he turned down that suggestion without hesitation.</P>
      <P>The Opposition Chief Whip allowed me to conclude that the Opposition were not so much interested in having extra hours in which to debate the rights and wrongs of this Bill as in dragging this Bill out for as long as they could.  An extra 15 or 20 hours might have been fitted in for this Bill between then and now but that was no good to the Opposition because they wanted to drag the Bill out until after the Easter and into the summer if possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the House to consider what the outlook is if this debate is not brought to an end today by the operation of the motion I am moving.  There are still 19 Opposition amendments undecided.  Discussion has begun on one amendment but there are still 19 to be decided.  They are arranged in four groups and there is a fifth constituency, North Tipperary, which is not accommodated in any of these groups.  In addition, there are 41 constituencies which have still not been voted on.  Allowing for the overlaps, the possibility that an amendment if carried necessarily negatives the constituency, it still leaves us with a possible 52 divisions. A division occupies between 10 and 15 minutes and we saw here on Tuesday and Wednesday the Minister's opposite number is not above making us race up and down the steps twice in half an hour on effectively what is exactly the same issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> Deputy Lalor, in his amendment, has suggested that we might finish the Committee Stage by an earlier date, I believe he suggested 8th May but that would be impossible at the present rate of progress.  At the present rate of progress the Committee Stage could not be completed before 22nd May and the succeeding Stages, the Report and Final Stages, would be completed God knows when. I have to take literally what I hear from the Opposition spokesman on Local Government and I heard him say last week that the Opposition intended to fight this Bill line by line.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach does not appear to have read my amendment. The situation is that the Government Whip was so busy doing his sums that he did not get around to seeing that we were making a reasonable offer to the Government in order to meet their time limit and enable us to be able to present the case as we want to.  We have got a lecture from the Government Chief Whip in relation to this.  It is remarkable that he comes into the House and tells us that the Bill must be put through the House by 10.30 p.m. in one breath and in another breath says that it would be impossible to complete the Committee Stage by the 8th May.  That contradicts anything the Parliamentary Secretary has said in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has dealt with and publicised a semiprivate conversation conducted in a friendly was between himself and my colleague and myself in my office. While the Parliamentary Secretary drew certain inferences from that conversation he did not explain to the House that when he came in and told us that the Government only intended taking the Electoral Bill, the budget and the budget debate I asked him what was happening in relation to <Col N="1263" /> the Anti-Discrimination Bill and the other Bills on the Order Paper.  I asked why those Bills were being shelved because the contents of those Bills are important to the workers. We are more than anxious to see that those Bills are passed.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the situation that exists at present within the two parties which make up the present Coalition Government, of the various blisters that are developing and difficulties that are arising there is this desperate urgency from the Government's point of view in putting this Bill through because it is obvious to them that the writing is on the wall and that they will be forced to go to the country shortly after the Easter Recess.

      <P>Last week we had the spectacle of the Taoiseach losing his temper in response to an interjection and an observation from the Leader of this party.  In terms similar to what we have heard from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, the Taoiseach went out of his way to tell us that when we had the opportunity we did not introduce a Bill of this kind.  We had other business and we were aware that the Electoral (Amendment) Bill was not as important as that other business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>On Tuesday last the <Col N="1264" /> Taoiseach reminded us that the former Government had neglected to change the constituencies in a way that would bring them into line with the decision of the High Court and with the confirmation by the Supreme Court of that decision.  We have the farcical situation whereby before that day was over and despite those strong words of the Taoiseach there was another constitutional requirement in respect of which the Taoiseach was not able to muster the support of his Party.  Instead, he allowed the dog with the big tail from Mountmellick to wag the whole party.</P>
      <P>Since the tail is wagging the dog in so far as this Government is concerned it is hardly surprising that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach should be so quick to make his dog's dinner comments.  He knows that there are people in the back-benches of his own party who are making a dog's dinner of the National Coalition Government.  It is because of this and because of the cracks that are appearing that we have the Parliamentary Secretary, acting on behalf of the Government, moving a motion to guillotine this Bill, a Bill that is of no great national importance.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated, there are Bills of national importance being held up.  The Government have held up these Bills until such time as they would have rammed through the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.</P>

      <P>The Bill is important from our point of view because in its own way it is an endeavour by the Coalition to create a dictatorship.  It is remarkable that the Parliamentary Secretary should go to such lengths to draw comparisons between the time taken to debate the last Electoral (Amendment) Bill and the time being given to the present one.  The fact <Col N="1265" /> that the present Government are sitting where they are is proof that the last Bill was extremely fair.  That Bill went through in 46 or 48 hours' debating time.</P>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the House to a piece of legislation which we introduced in 1971 but which was opposed vehemently and filibustered by the then Opposition.  I refer to the Forcible Entry Act.  At that time the Government did not consider the use of the guillotine until almost 100 hours of parliamentary time had been spent debating it.  Much of that time was absorbed by the allegedly learned Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien, now the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. While only 12 hours were spent discussing the Second Stage of that Bill 15 hours were spent on Committee Stage and 69 hours were spent on Report Stage.  It was a very important and necessary piece of legislation. The Government of the day needed power to deal with a problem that had arisen.  The effect of that legislation has been proved by the fact that to a great extent it has overcome the problem with which it was intended to deal.  Might I say that the menace that had developed at that time had the full support of the two parties who now form what is alleged to be a responsible Government?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>On that occasion the legislation was held up from early January until the 6th of August.  It is unusual for the Dáil to sit during August but we were forced to do so in 1971 in order to have that Bill enacted.  On this occasion we are dealing with a Bill which the Minister for Local Government introduced in March of last year but in respect of which the Second Stage debate did not begin until the 15th of November. Therefore, in effect, this Bill has been before the House since November 15th.  We are now into April but there has not been an inordinate amount of discussion on the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach has indicated that on the occasion of the last Electoral (Amendment) Bill valuable <Col N="1266" /> contributions were made by Deputy Fitzpatrick, who is now the Minister for Lands.  In relation to the opposition of the then Fine Gael spokesman on Local Government to our introducing a guillotine after about 69 hours of debate on Report Stage&mdash;this covered ten days of debate here&mdash;Deputy Fitzpatrick said that it was most undemocratic of the Government to prevent valuable discussion on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Today the Government have introduced a motion for a guillotine when we are discussing the Committee Stage of a Bill and at a stage when, to use the Parliamentary Secretary's words, we had not got to the guts of the Bill.  I submit that there is no urgency about this legislation but that there is urgency in relation to other legislation but in respect of which, for some reason, the Government are reluctant to press forward.  The Parliamentary Secretary has given us a list of the necessary legislation that is awaiting enactment.  The Government order the business of the House and there is nothing to prevent them from giving precedence to that legislation instead of to the Bill now before us but the only reason they will not do that is because they are afraid of what is happening in the rear at present.</P>
      <P>It is very wrong for the Government spokesman, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, to come into the House this afternoon and to convey the impression that the reason why necessary legislation has not been passed in this House is because the Opposition are holding up the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  I never heard such poppycock from Government benches as I heard during the quarter hour of the Parliamentary Secretary's contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the House on this motion but I think it is necessary to point out that on the one hand the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach accuses the Press in this House of giving the wrong image&mdash;I do not know whether it is of him or the Government&mdash;and on the other hand he uses the Press to get across a message to the people that the reason why we have not had the Anti-Discrimination <Col N="1267" /> (Pay) Bill, the Food and Standards Bill, which was circulated only last week, the Trade Union (Amalgamations) Bill and the Control of Importation, Sale and Manufacture of Contraceptives Bill is because Fianna Fáil were filibustering in relation to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  This is the most ridiculous allegation I ever heard and, without trying to give too much offence to the Parliamentary Secretary, the most stupid contribution I have ever heard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to record my utter dismay at the motion proposed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  The decision of the Government to introduce this motion is a retrograde step.  It is a serious reflection on Parliament, and parliamentary democracy in this country and cannot but rebound to the total discredit of the Government of the day.  As the House and the community know well, the Electoral Bill is one which will lay down the pattern on which future elections will be held in this country. Obviously any observer of politics or any interested member of the community could not but agree that such a Bill is bound to be a very sensitive implement as far as politicians and persons involved in politics are concerned. It could not but have been expected of the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition that they would examine the Minister's and the Government's proposals line by line, that they would examine them in a critical way and that, when the Bill came before this House, they would offer their considered criticism of the Government's proposals.  We have been doing this and the Bill has been given a fairly thorough examination.  The debate has not continued for a very long period. It has been progressing through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It came as a great shock to me to find that this measure was to be adopted by the Government.  We had come to the amendments which are down in my name on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  These were placed in various groupings, a total of five. The amendments are very thorough and comprehensive and are a fair alternative <Col N="1268" /> to the proposals introduced by the Minister in his Bill.  We expected that the least that could be offered to any Opposition Party would be an opportunity to debate in a frank and open way the proposals contained in our amendments to the Minister's Bill. We have shown the serious discrepancies in the Bill.  We have shown the discriminatory aspects of it and the political manipulations afoot in it.  The whole country are entitled to be suspicious of the motives behind a Government which bring such a measure before the House.</P>

      <P>The argument used in favour of this motion was that sufficient time had been given for the debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  We do not accept that is a true statement of fact.  The Bill has only reached the Schedule in the last two days of the debate. We have disposed of our amendments where we suggested changes in relation to the Dublin area and the Wicklow, Wexford and Carlow-Kilkenny areas.  The debate is coming to a conclusion, as the Minister well knows, in relation to the second group of amendments we had down in relation to the Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath areas.  We have more or less said what we wanted to say on those amendments.  We have highlighted the discrimination in relation to those areas.  We are anxious to move on to the set of amendments which deal with the western constituencies.  After a full discussion on these amendments we would like time to be given to discuss proposals for new constituencies in the Munster <Col N="1269" /> area and our amendments in relation to this area.</P>
      <P>It seems that because of the wording of this motion we are to be denied the opportunity to discuss all those areas, the amendments put down by us and the Minister's proposals in relation to those areas.  The Minister knows there are many Deputies on this side of the House who are very interested in contributing to the debate as far as it relates to all of the constituencies in the western area from Donegal to Clare.  He also knows that there are many Opposition Deputies who are anxious to contribute to the debate when the Munster area is being considered.  It is a bit much to expect any Opposition to meekly accept such a guillotine motion as the one the Parliamentary Secretary introduced to completely cut further debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to examine the motives behind this and the reasons for this particular motion being brought before the House.  It is a well-known fact that there is dissension among the Cabinet members and among the parties in the Coalition Government at the present time.

      <P>The Chair's reputation for fairness has been established before now; we would expect that it would continue to apply.  The Parliamentary Secretary ranged over a series of legislative proposals which he said were waiting in the pipeline and which he indicated to the House were, in his opinion, being held up due to the debate on the Constituencies Bill.  We refute his allegation totally. We invite him to bring forward those pieces of legislation which he says he is so anxious to bring forward, particularly the Contraceptives Bill, which we have not seen.  The country and this House well know that this argument is completely spurious and is not based on any facts whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the discussion on the Constituencies Bill, 1968, was proceeded with without much delay, and he mentioned a debating time of 48 hours.  If Deputies would like to go back and to examine the Opposition's contribution on that occasion to what they claimed then and since was a major piece of legislation, they will see that no debate whatsoever took place on the sections to the Bill, that the then Opposition, the Fine Gael <Col N="1271" /> and Labour Parties, were lax and lazy in the manner in which they carried out their responsibilities as an Opposition, and did not question or debate any of the sections of the Bill except for one brief reference to one of the sections.  When the Committee Stage came before the House, the then Opposition had not put forward any amendments whatsoever to be discussed on Committee Stage.  The House knows that that is normally the time for Opposition parties to put forward their amendments if they do not agree with the proposals in the Bill introduced by the Government. It is a well-known fact that the then Opposition, Fine Gael and Labour, were opposed to the 1968 Bill, and yet they did not take the time and the effort to prepare constructive criticisms by way of amendments to the Bill, because they were too lazy to do so.</P>
    <P>I have prepared a comprehensive range of amendments to this Bill and &mdash;I mentioned this already and I do not want to labour it&mdash;anyone who tries to set down proper amendments which would comply with Constitutional requirements and the High Court's interpretation of that Constitution, cannot but agree that it is a mammoth task and that it involves many hours of hard work.  Having gone to the trouble of showing up the weakness of the Government's proposals, the least one would expect in a parliamentary democracy is to be allowed to debate those amendments in this House, but we are being denied that opportunity today.</P>
    <P>The major contribution from the Coalition parties when they were in Opposition and discussing the 1968 Constituencies Bill was to complain at Committee Stage, which went on for five days, that they did not have time to put down amendments between that and the Report Stage. The Minister gave then a further week, they having not availed of the time from which the Bill was circulated, to put down such amendments. They shirked the difficult task and made light criticisms without coming forward with positive alternatives. <Col N="1272" /> The alternatives we have suggested are fair, just and can be defended on any score.  We would not quibble about certain minor changes, but the basic principles outlined in our proposals could stand the test of a true examination as to whether they were just or fair.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary deemed it an occasion today to compliment that lax, lazy, inefficient and inept Opposition which stood in this House in 1968 and made no effort to make alternative proposals to the then Minister's Constituencies Bill.  It is the epitome of frustration for us to have to listen to that type of comment from a man who has the reputation of being the professorial type, who on occasions likes to lecture this House. Anyone who would state that one and a half hours of time were used up while quorums were being called, especially a man who is the Chief Whip of the Government Party, cannot but be the most naïve person ever to stand in a Parliament in any part of the world.  The House knows that he himself, as Chief Whip, is responsible for ensuring that he has Government Deputies here to keep the House at all times.  During the Committee Stage of this Bill there has been total silence on the part of the Government Deputies.  Obviously an instruction has gone out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>An instruction has gone out from the Government to their Deputies that they are not to contribute to the Constituencies Bill, that they must pass it as quickly as possible, as the time must be coming near when the people's patience with them is running out and when they will be forced to hold a general election. This is very much on the cards following the events of recent weeks and particularly of last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary complains that last week he was obliged to vote twice in this House.  It was the first two votes that were taken on the Schedule to the Bill.  One was a vote on an amendment which we <Col N="1273" /> proposed, and the other one was a vote on the Government's own proposal. If the Parliamentary Secretary is getting so lazy that he deems it a terrible inconvenience to have to go up those steps and through the lobbies here and cast his vote to pass legislation which he himself and his Government are bringing before the House, then he is reducing this House to a farce and very little heed should be paid to what he has been saying. He has done so much whingeing and crying here that one would think it more appropriate if he had been allowed to sit down with a lollypop or run away and lecture students elsewhere instead of coming in here and displaying the type of attitude he has displayed not only today but on a number of other occasions.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the Minister's Bill as a dog's dinner.  Even though the Parliamentary Secretary has claimed that this Bill has been adequately debated, we have seen amendments circulated by the Minister over the past weekend which indicate clearly that this Bill is not in its proper and correct form yet, that the Government themselves are not even pleased with the Bill as they presented it originally.  In page three, line 25, and in page three, lines 54 to 55, certain changes are proposed; in page six, in the second column of the entry relating to Dún Laoghaire, a minor adjustment is proposed; that is only a typist's error.  However, the other two are quite substantial changes.  The Government now come forward with a major amendment to the Schedule to the Bill which they say has been adequately debated.  In page nine, in the second column of the entry relating to West Mayo, it is proposed to delete &ldquo;Crossmolina North, Crossmolina South, Deel,&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kilfian South,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lackan North,&rdquo;, and also to delete &ldquo;Dalgan, Houndswood&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;Coonard, Dalgan, Hollymount, Houndswood, Kilcommon&rdquo;.  If this amendment by the Minister is an important one&mdash;and we know the real political reasons why it has been brought forward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I heard the Parliamentary Secretary correctly he suggested that if the debate continued along the lines which he had indicated, a pattern would develop&mdash;I do not know of any pattern that has been established&mdash;which would mean that the Bill would not take longer than others.  He took a rather imaginatively lengthy period and suggested that if the debate were to continue in this vein the Bill, with the amendments, might not be passed before July.  That is what apparently was concerning the Parliamentary Secretary and we suggest to him that he would accept the date in our amendment to the motion, which I will read again for the record:</P>
      <P>In paragraph (a) to delete &ldquo;Tuesday 2nd April&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;Wednesday 8th May&rdquo; and to delete all words after &ldquo;bring the proceedings to conclusion.&rdquo;; in paragraph (b) to delete all words after &ldquo;bring the proceedings to conclusion;&rdquo;; and in paragraph (c) to delete the words &ldquo;on that day&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;on 29th May 1974&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asking that full and adequate time for debate be allowed by the Government on this important Bill and the wording of our motion asks that the Government allow the debate to continue up to 29th May next.  We do not consider that our request is in any way a difficult one for the Parliamentary Secretary to concede.  We feel we would have adequately discussed the Bill, the amendments to it and the overall philosophy behind it if the Parliamentary Secretary were to agree to that date.  If we had the debate concluded by 29th May, it would have been all signed, sealed and delivered one way or the other long before July. Our amendment to the motion is reasonable and we suggest that if the Parliamentary Secretary is sincere in <Col N="1277" /> all that he has said he cannot but accept our amendment.</P>

      <P>It appears to me as if the Opposition are not quite sure what they want.  They are prepared to put in speaker after speaker to oppose the closure motion, yet later on they will complain loudly that the time is not adequate to discuss certain matters. After the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Lalor had spoken, if there was a vote on the motion there might have been adequate time for debate.  It sounds good to hear Deputy Molloy here this afternoon, and indeed some of the interruptions which followed from his side, about whether the Bill to date has been adequately debated. I suggest it has not because the Opposition simply got up one after the other and repeated parrotwise what they had heard somebody before them say.  This went on over and over again.</P>
      <P>The reason why we have not had the kind of debate which we could have had is that any complaint from Fianna Fáil is due to themselves. They continued to make statements about the Bill which were not alone proved to be inaccurate but which they knew to be inaccurate.  We have had the spectacle when, having said everything they could think of about trivia in the Bill and having looked around wildly to find if there was anybody else who would be able to keep the thing running, they fell on two hapless Deputies who happened to come into the House and who were not aware of what was being discussed. Those two Deputies got up within half an hour of each other and attempted to discuss what was before the House.  They knew what the Bill provided but they did not know what was under discussion.  This type of antic shows the efforts which have been made to try to hold up the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Haughey is here because I wish to make a point he made earlier.  During a discussion on the number of Deputies we should have after the next general election&mdash; and I should like again to make it clear that the next general election will be held in approximately four years, so sit back, boys, and relax, there is no rush&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is that they could dish it out all right but they could never take it.  They will take it this evening and they will get it.  In this motion we are saying that adequate time has been given to the Bill and therefore we feel it should be concluded.  I have been trying to prove that the time given before to-day has not been used properly by the Opposition and that they have no reason to moan.  They have spoken again and again about the same trivia.  Indeed they voted against a motion which every one of them were agreeable to&mdash;that there should be 148 Deputies.  Deputy Haughey, of course, suggested 200.  They marched through the Lobbies to vote against it.  If that is not a low type of filibuster I do not know what it is.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately we have not time to debate that but anybody who is 1,000 votes over the next man up has nothing to worry about.  In regard to the motion we have reasonably suggested that this debate has gone on as long as could be reasonably expected. If Fianna Fáil wanted to have items in the Bill debated they had plenty of time to do so.  The items that have been passed, with one exception, have only been passed because a guillotine was introduced.  Is that how a responsible Opposition deals with a Bill?  Even ordinary matters such as the name of the Bill, the number of Deputies, all had to be guillotined in order to get them through.  Fianna Fáil told me they intended to oppose every line and section of the Bill.  If that is what they want to do for opposition sake there is only the one way to deal with it. <Col N="1280" /> As I said on a number of occasions, they were wasting their own time and apparently they were not intelligent enough to take up the point. They had plenty of time if they used it properly but instead they behaved like children repeating things which had been said before.</P>

Fianna Fáil have deliberately held up other work in this House and, if allowed, will continue to do so, in order to prevent this Bill passing. <Col N="1283" /> There are two questions that I should like to answer, with the permission of the Chair.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said in his introductory <Col N="1284" /> statement the House does accept that a revision is necessary at this time.  We in the Opposition recognise the legal framework within which the Minister must operate.  I have already referred to it.  We accept that in order to comply with the legal requirements and the interpretation of the Constitution handed down to us by our courts, it is necessary to revise the constituencies.  There is agreement on that.  The Minister was right in assuming that there would be.</P>

They need not cry and wail like banshees, as they did on other occasions when the guillotine was imposed, when time has caught up with them.  It caught up with them last year and it will catch up with them again this year on this Bill. Unless they are prepared to agree to debate it now, they need not wail when the time for closure comes and say that they were not given enough time for discussion.  They have had adequate time, 58 hours to date.</P>

      <P>the guillotine is a procedure which takes away from Parliament the function of Parliament to examine, discuss and scrutinise legislation, particularly legislation of a controversial nature affecting the rights of ordinary citizens.</P>

    <P>I recall as one of the highlights of that arrogant and futile debate, particularly on the Report Stage of that Bill, the performance of Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.

      <P>The dictionary in question, which runs into many volumes, goes back to about the 12th century and gives the usage of each word in different times in each century from the 12th century to the 20th century.  It also gives the variations in usage in different regions of England in the earlier periods and throughout the English-speaking world in the later period.  The word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; was picked out by the then Deputy.  For six hours he read to this House every definition in that enormous dictionary of that word, from the 12th century to the present time, and the different meanings in different parts of England and the English-speaking world.</P>

      <P>I am claiming that on that occasion the Government sat through that and equal rubbish for a total of 72 hours on the Report Stage alone.  On that Bill, which was a matter of public importance and of importance to the security of the country unlike the present Bill, we finally moved a guillotine motion on the 4th August, 1971.  The discussion had gone on since before Easter of that year.  The Bill was passed in the Seanad on 21st August, 1971.  That Bill was very different from this.  It was urgently required to deal with a serious problem.  As soon as it was passed the problem disappeared and the organisation which went on under the aegis of certain organisations was given up more or less overnight because they saw that the Bill had called their bluff.  The squatting that took place after that was as a result of unorganised private individuals going into the houses themselves.  The Minister for Local <Col N="1288" /> Government today referred to what he described as &ldquo;antics&rdquo; on the part of this Opposition.  I want to ask the House in all fairness was that performance of six hours on one word with all those dictionaries anything but an antic, a joke?  We had no criticism from any quarter at all practically of that filibuster at that time. It was alleged to be a good thing.  It was alleged that that Bill was a dangerous one which would undermine all kinds of people and that the newspapers could expect to be dragged into court.  We were told that that Bill was so bad that the parties who were then in Opposition and are now in office could not get into Government quick enough in order to repeal it.</P>

We are told that even to have 20 per cent more time in discussion than was spent the last time is unreasonable, that this is a farce and that we are indulging in antics.  Deputy Molloy, I and others on this side of the House have over the last several weeks, pointed out various defects in the Bill before the House.  We were <Col N="1289" /> pooh-poohed by the Minister and told that the Minister thought it was good but that the officials advised him against it.

      <P>I should like to speak very briefly and very sincerely on this motion.  The ultimate weapon in a parliamentary democracy such as ours is the instrument popularly known as the guillotine.  This instrument is used not by a Minister but by Government decision.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, unless there are the gravest reasons for its use, parliamentary <Col N="1293" /> democracy suffers if it is used. I believe that the circumstances in which the Government have made a decision to use the guillotine on this occasion do not justify it.  I assert that Deputy O'Malley was not irrelevant when he pointed out that, on the last occasion on which a Fianna Fáil Government used this ultimate weapon, the Government were justified because of urgent public considerations.  I submit in all sincerity that these considerations do not obtain today and that, therefore, the decision by the Government to exercise this bludgeon on the Opposition is a bad one, and one which they may very well live to regret.</P>
      <P>I am sticking solely to the motion. Obviously it was incumbent on the Minister to bring in a Bill.  No matter what Minister for Local Government was in office at this time, some electoral reform Bill would be necessary. Some such electoral reform Bill will continue to be necessary as a result of the Supreme Court judgment some years ago.  The merits or otherwise of the various clauses in the Bill will be the subject of debate and disagreement obviously.  I believe profundly that the circumstances in which the Government would be justified in using this ultimate parliamentary weapon against a parliamentary Opposition in a free democracy do not exist, and that the Government are wrong and have done a disservice to the country and to parliamentary democracy by what they are doing today.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate but I was prompted to do so by the contribution made by Deputy O'Malley.  First, I <Col N="1294" /> should like to comment on the contribution by Deputy Flanagan who spoke about the effects on parliamentary democracy of using a closure motion too lightly.  I accept that fully. I accept that it is an ultimate weapon but it is there for one reason, that is, to safeguard the people from an irresponsible Opposition who are prepared, for their own ends, irrespective of the general good, to continue a filibuster on any Bill.  There is no doubt that that is what has happened on this Bill.  Having listened to the contributions made by the Opposition on this Bill over the 58 hours in which it has been discussed, nobody, no matter how biassed he might be in favour of Fianna Fáil, could honestly come to any other conclusion except that a filibuster was being engaged in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We were debating group 2 which includes amendments Nos. 2, 13 and 16 dealing with the proposed constituencies of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath.  We have already clearly established in our contributions to the debate that the way in which the Minister has allocated seats in this area is not the fairest or best way in which they could have been allocated.  We have put forward as strongly as we can the argument that the counties of Cavan and Monaghan, being Border counties, should have been established as constituencies each in its own right; the Minister should have and could have established a constituency of Cavan electing three Deputies to this House.  We have suggested in our amendments that the same could be done with County Monaghan; that county could have been established as a constituency in its own right by the inclusion of some transfers from adjoining areas thereby enabling that area to send three Deputies to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have argued in favour of that as against the Minister's proposal to establish one five-seat constituency covering the whole of Cavan and Monaghan.  We believe the area is too vast; it will involve very, very long journeys because these counties sprawl right along more than two-thirds of the Border and there are very special problems.  Because of the special problems of these two counties&mdash;we have argued fairly and our argument cannot be refuted&mdash; they should have been allowed to return the maximum number of Deputies here.  The Minister and his Government have chosen to do otherwise and, doing otherwise, they have reduced the combined area of Cavan and Monaghan by one representative because only five seats have been allocated as against the present two three-seat constituencies.  This is a retrograde step.  No heed is paid to the special problems of the people residing in these areas.  In these difficult times this is, indeed, a wrong decision. The Minister has decided on a five-seat constituency covering this vast area, an area which extends in a U along the Border and he has also decided the constituency of Meath shall be created returning four Deputies to this House.  We do not agree that this should be done.  The existing constituency returns three Deputies and we believe that situation should <Col N="1303" /> be maintained; Meath should return only three Deputies.</P>
    <P>We agree with the proposal that a constituency of Louth should be created returning four Deputies, but we do not agree with the way in which this four-seat constituency is devised.  If the Minister had accepted the principle put forward by us of establishing two three-seat constituencies, one in Cavan and one in Monaghan, then his proposals for the constituency of Louth would have to have been somewhat similar to our proposals.  As the House knows, in making a five-seat constituency in Cavan-Monaghan, he conceded part of Monaghan to Louth.  The argument has been put fairly adequately and I do not wish to detain the House, but the one thing which disappoints us is the fact that it can be shown that the Minister has given the greatest advantage from the point of view of ratio per population head in the number of Deputies to be elected to this particular area.  We accept that the Minister may have had a personal or vested interest in the area and it is our obligation to highlight that fact here so that the House may know exactly what is going on.  In the groupings the Minister has devised, with North Leinster including these counties in Ulster, the grouping of South Leinster and Munster, the grouping of the west, and the grouping of Dublin constituencies, the group which benefits most as a result of the Minister's interpretation and implementation of the Supreme Court decision from the point of view of tolerance range is the group in which the counties of Meath, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth appear.  It will take less population per Deputy in these areas and that is discrimination against the other areas.  It simply cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>Very few arguments have been made during the course of the debate to justify these groupings.  All we have had is confirmation of the Government's majority.  That is apparently sufficient argument to justify what they are doing.  It is the pattern they have chosen to follow. We will leave it to the judgment of <Col N="1304" /> the people as to whether they are acting in the best interests of the community in their allocation of seats.  We deeply regret the manner in which seats are being distributed.  We greatly regret that the counties of Cavan and Monaghan will no longer be separate constituencies.  The Coalition Government have lumped them together and reduced their representation by one.</P>

      <P>There is one thing that must be clarified.  As far as Deputy Molloy is concerned, he has established just one thing; he has established the fact that he did not have any expert advice about the area he was dividing.  The amendment the Deputy is putting in could not be operated even if it was passed by this House.  The constituency he suggests would not work and, apart from any other argument which I may put up, it would be impossible to work.</P>
      <P>It is only right that I should nail a couple of untruths mentioned here. As far as Cavan and Monaghan are concerned it would not have been possible to leave them on their own and Deputy Molloy knows that very well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy's proposal would add a big slice of Meath on to Cavan to make a three-seater, it would add the areas around the Cavan border and it would move up by Kells almost to the town of Athboy which is almost in mid-Meath.  I forgive him for making this sort of mistake because he does not know the area.  However Deputy Molloy does worse; he goes across the other way through an area of County Meath and into Stahalmog and moves it, even though it has no connection with Cavan, into the Cavan constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Monaghan is concerned Deputy Molloy takes the towns of Kingscourt and Shercock, and two other areas, out of Cavan and puts them into Monaghan.  This in no way keeps Cavan as one entity.  The proposal of Deputy Molloy is to take a <Col N="1305" /> sizeable portion of Cavan, including two of its principal towns, and put them into Monaghan.  In addition, he goes into County Meath, jumps certain areas, and finishes in Donaghpatrick, a few miles from Navan. The areas could not work and they are too ridiculous for words.</P>
    <P>Louth, on its own, has almost enough to make it a four-seater.  Less than 2,000 people are taken out of Monaghan to make Louth a four-seater. For this area Deputy Molloy's proposal was to put in the district electoral division of St. Mary's which is Laytown and Bettystown where I live.  He may think that was a clever thing to do but, in my view, it was the petty action of a petty little man who knew he could not get away with it but still put it in.</P>
    <P>Cavan and Monaghan have been put together because they are a natural unit.  The population and everything else makes it possible for them to be joined together.  Louth is also a natural for a four-seater and there is no trouble about that.  Meath or Kildare had to have an additional seat and I gave the additional seat to Meath because over the years Meath was cut up.  On the first occasion the southern portion of the county was cut up and when that was given back north Meath was cut up.  It is time Meath got its fair share.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it perfectly clear that I am not fire-proofing my own seat.  I had just under 1,000 votes over the next Fianna Fáil man at the last general election and that is good enough to win a seat, as anybody with common sense knows.  The proposals made by Deputy Molloy are only put in for the purpose of pretending that Fianna Fáil were doing something for these people which we were not doing. Last week we had an argument that we did not tell the people of Monaghan that we intended to join them with Cavan under this Bill.  We did tell the people of that county of our intentions. We told them from every platform and they still voted for the National Coalition. That scotches that argument. There is no reason why the proposals I have made should not be passed by this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Cavan):</i> I am aware this is a limited debate and I do not propose to take up the time of the House on this matter.  I should like to say a few words in regard to the proposed constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  When the constituencies were revised on the last occasion I spoke against the proposal to create the constituencies of Cavan and Monaghan as then constituted and argued in favour of a five-seater. I did so because I disagree with the proposed constituency of Cavan as drawn up on that occasion.  On that occasion, in order to create the constituency of Cavan, it was necessary to bring in portions of Meath which had nothing whatever in common with Cavan and were not even adjacent to each other.</P>
      <P>The area around Oldcastle was brought in and the then Minister proceeded from the Oldcastle area to Moynalty, several miles away, and brought in another area there.  In that way he created quite an unwieldy constituency of Cavan.  The people of Oldcastle and the people of Moynalty, notwithstanding what Deputy Wilson says, have nothing in common with the people of Cavan.  Apart from going to the county town for an occasional football game they never have any business going to Cavan.  In order to create the constituency of Monaghan we had a repeat performance&mdash;it could be said to have been worse&mdash;because they had to bring in, not alone a portion of County Meath but a portion of County Louth as well.  I disagreed with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned I am prepared to represent either Cavan or Cavan-Monaghan.  It does not matter to me.  I will offer myself to either the constituency of Cavan or the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  I would not have thought it would have been necessary to waste the time of the House in discussing this proposed constituency, particularly in regard to the Monaghan portion of it.  This Bill was circulated, and the Second Stage discussed in this House, before the Monaghan by-election.  Everybody in Monaghan knew that the proposal was to put Monaghan and Cavan together <Col N="1307" /> as a five-seater before they voted in the by-election on 27th November. I am satisfied that a considerable number of people were influenced in the decision they made by the fact that it was proposed to put Cavan and Monaghan together.  On the basis of that the National Coalition candidate won by between 200 and 300 votes notwithstanding the fact that eight months earlier the second Fianna Fáil candidate won the seat by approximately 1,000 votes.  That was a big shift from Fianna Fáil to the National Coalition.</P>
    <P>If the people of Monaghan were dissatisfied with the proposal we have before us, as Deputy Leonard will have us believe, they would have registered that protest in the by-election. Deputy Wilson and Deputy Leonard are against the five-seater and Deputy Wilson has spoken about the importance, the wisdom and desirability of keeping the Kingdom of Breffni together.  However, there is an amendment before the House in the name of Fianna Fáil Deputies to take the important towns of Kingscourt and Shercock, and the electoral division of Enniskeen, out of Cavan and put them into Monaghan.  That does not make sense to me especially coming from a party who are arguing in favour of keeping County Cavan together.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that Monaghan and Cavan have a lot in common. They are two Ulster counties and they have shared health services since local government was introduced. Seven or eight members of Cavan County Council and a similar number from Monaghan were members of the mental health board until it was abolished.  They got on very well during those years.  The people in these counties have a lot more in common than the people of Cavan and Meath or the people of Monaghan and Louth.  Among other interests they have in common, they have me and that is a fair starting off ground.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> No.  I am happy either to represent Cavan as I was elected to do in 1965, 1969 and 1973 or to represent Cavan-Monaghan. In fact, on the occasion of the debate on the last Electoral (Amendment) Bill I told the then Minister for Local Government that if there were a five-seater constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, Fine Gael would win three seats out of the five and that if we had two three-seaters, we would win four out of six.  The then Minister asked me why, therefore, I was complaining.  In the short term I was proved right because in the election which followed immediately afterwards we won four of the six seats.  In the 1973 election the position was reversed when we won only two out of six but we are well back on the way towards reversing that balance.</P>

No doubt if the people of Cavan were given the same opportunity of making restitution they, too, would do so.  It would be unfair of me to delay the House unduly and I shall conclude by saying that the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan is a much more compact unit and a much more manageable area to be represented by people from Monaghan and Cavan instead of representatives from Cavan trying to represent parts of Meath about which they know nothing and the people of Monaghan trying to represent parts of Meath and Louth about which they know nothing.  If these two constituencies were to be left as they were drawn on the last occasion, the people of Meath who were in the Cavan constituency would never be represented by a resident of their area while the people of Louth and Meath who were in the Monaghan constituency would never be represented by a resident of either of those areas because no such person would have a reasonable opportunity of being elected.  From the way in which the people of Monaghan <Col N="1309" /> have passed judgment on this, they seem to be perfectly satisfied.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a final appeal to the Minister for Local Government to maintain the Cavan constituency substantially as it has been because, as I explained last day, it is a community.  However the community evolved or developed, it has done so so that we have a unified community. I mentioned last day also that the county town is in the centre of the area, that the GAA played a big part in welding this county into a single community.  I mentioned also that the headquarters of the GAA are in the county town and that by a long parliamentary tradition, a tradition of which I would not expect the Minister for Lands to be aware since he is not a Cavanman, the county regards itself as a unit.  I reminded the House that structures have developed as a result of the county being a unit, that ways of thinking have developed in that area, that we think of ourselves as a county with distinct characteristics and with a unified community spirit.  It is on this basis mainly that I am appealing to the Minister to accept Deputy Molloy's amendment.  I am grateful to Deputy Molloy for tabling this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In tabling the amendment, Deputy Molloy has recognised substantially the community that has developed down through the years. This party are grateful to him for that.  The Deputy spoke of the amorphous new constituency that the Minister proposes.  From my doorstep near Lake Sheelin to the custom's post at Aughnacloy is too big a constituency and indicates a way of thinking that disregards the problems of <Col N="1311" /> rural communities at present.  No doubt both the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Local Government are aware of the problems of rural Ireland but I am afraid that they have allowed themselves to be dominated in this matter by this eastern, this city-thinking administration.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, our amendment would involve a loss here and there but I appeal to the Minister to recognise the existence in Cavan of a substantial community.  The amendment would involve a gain to some extent but I shall come to that in a moment.  I refute the statement of the Minister for Lands that there is no connection between the part of Meath which is included in Deputy Molloy's amendment and the rest of the county.  This allegation can come only from a man who does not know the traditions of the county, one who has not lived in it from childhood and who does not know what went on in that area in different social circumstances.  For example, Oldcastle has a large cooperative society which has very close links with County Cavan.  The Minister for Lands was made aware of that comparatively recently.  This co-operative is not part of tradition. It is a modern development.  Oldcastle, too, was a fairs and market centre for a whole area of County Cavan.  Again, I would not expect the Minister for Lands to know that since such activity is not part of his way of life.  The people in the area from which I come have always regarded Oldcastle as one of their own towns. It was there from time immemorial that they sold their cattle and made their purchases.  Neither would the Minister know of the old connections between Moynalty and Cornafean or of the epic stories of the connection between these two areas.</P>

For example, criticism has been made of the GAA for giving too much attention to county boundaries and giving them an importance which they should never have got.  I am not arguing that point.  I am arguing that the county was developed and administered in a certain way and had long traditions of representation from a constituency point of view.  The Minister is interfering with the county as it is today.  I appeal to him, as a near neighbour, to look into this again.  He knows what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Lands that, generally speaking, the people would like to maintain a constituency of Cavan.  They would still be proud, even with an addendum, to have a constituency of Cavan and not have a huge constituency covering a wide area of territory known as Cavan-Monaghan.  The Minister for Lands is a Monaghan man.  He said that one of the benefits of the Cavan-Monaghan constituency was that he was a Monaghan man and lived in Cavan.</P>

I have been associated with them for over 45 years.  I know all about the GAA in Cornafean and Moynalty.  That did not tie them into one.  The fact that the games were so good, were fought so hard and attracted such attention was because it was Meath playing Cavan in another way.  Anybody who tries to make out that a team from Meath playing a team from Cavan were all from the one area and everything was grand does not understand the matter.  I am surprised at Deputy Wilson suggesting this was so.

Deputy Molloy suggests that County Meath would be divided in four.  It is little spiteful ideas like this that ruins any effort Deputy Molloy makes.  I do not want to take up the time of the Fianna Fáil Party because they are making it short enough for themselves.

      <P>Our complaint on other occasions during this debate was that the representation in the three Ulster counties was being reduced by two seats and that part of Monaghan was being transferred into Leinster, an area which has already received an extra allocation of seats.  We also claimed that the constituency of Monaghan-Cavan was very unwieldy. We are told now today that from every platform in the last election the people of Monaghan were told about this five-seat constituency.  That is not so, because if you examine any of the daily or weekly papers where those speeches were recorded, you will not find one Coalition speech indicating to the people of Monaghan that it was proposed to make <Col N="1318" /> Monaghan-Cavan a five-seat constituency. Both Ministers suggested that the election was won on that point.</P>

      <P>The Minister condemns Deputy Molloy's amendments. I think Deputy Molloy's amendments are very sensible and I cannot see how the Minister read the map when he says Deputy Molloy is going into the centre of Meath.  I have examined this very carefully since last week, and I cannot see, unless we are looking at two different maps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another point. However, the people of Meath must have felt they were fairly well represented by Fianna Fáil when the constituency was Monaghan-West Louth-Nobber. Anyone who looks at the tallyman's returns for the by-election&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy believe the tallyman's returns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;will accept that those people must have felt that they were better represented when that part of Meath was added to Monaghan than they were previously.  Having regard to the Fianna Fáil vote over the entire portion of Meath in previous <Col N="1319" /> elections and to the small parcel of votes that went into Monaghan, it will be seen that if that majority was related to the whole Meath constituency, it would mean a landslide in favour of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that he tried to adhere as far as possible to county boundaries.  He did not go by the county boundaries in Monaghan and Cavan and that is certainly one case in point.  I admit that Monaghan and Cavan people have a lot in common but they have not that much in common that they would prefer to be bunched together and lose a seat. The Minister for Lands will have a lot of trouble convincing people at area meetings that it was a good day's work reducing the representation and I would say they will not take kindly to it.  As I said previously, there is a loss of two seats in the three Ulster counties.  No doubt they will show their disapproval of the Coalition anyway at the next election but doubly so if the Minister does not retract, as I think he will, and accept some of these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I should like to make before we finish.  The statement has been made more than once that we are taking a seat from the two Ulster counties.  I want to emphasise again that what in effect we are doing is taking a seat with the people from Leinster who were attached to those two Ulster counties.  Can the Deputies opposite not understand that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You can have your own area.  I am giving it to you.  I cannot give two-and-a-half Deputies to each of the two counties.  I am doing the best I can.  I am making one five-seater. The Louth people and the Meath people who are being taken <Col N="1320" /> from Monaghan and Cavan, where they were tied on artificially, are being put back again into their old constituencies.  They are the people who will be represented by the one Deputy we are taking from Cavan-Monaghan. There is no question whatever of the representation being any worse.  I do not know what they are grumbling about.  Deputies opposite understand the whole thing but they do not want to admit it and I cannot blame them for that.  Deputy Leonard is perfectly happy with the constituency he is getting and I am sure that with time Deputy Wilson will become used to the idea.</P>

      <P>As one of the Deputies affected by this amendment, I will vote for the Bill as it stands and I should like to give my reasons for doing so.  I do not think it was fair during the debate to say that this Bill was designed to copper-fasten the Coalition Government.  As the only Deputy for Monaghan supporting the Government, I was never consulted about this Bill when it was introduced. I first saw this Bill in draft the night before it was circulated.  I confess that if I had seen the Bill sooner I probably would have put up a fight to have Enniskeen, Kiltybeg and Drumboory kept in Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> However, I realise that the underlying principle is to preserve county boundaries as far as possible.  Realising that, I appreciate that the Minister had to get some extra population to make Louth a four-seater and we in Monaghan have to hand over the electoral divisions of Enniskeen, Kiltybeg and Drumboory.  I cannot understand the argument put forward by the Opposition that Ulster are losing two seats because when 12 seats were being kept in Ulster we had to take in a big portion of Meath and of Louth and County Leitrim.  Therefore, the representation for Ulster is not being reduced by this Bill.</P>
    <P>As one with experience from 1961, at that time as secretary of a political party and later as a Member of the Seanad who had experience of working with a constituency like Monaghan and Louth, while I made many good friends in Louth over the years I always realised that the people of Louth were not happy in the constituency of Monaghan/Louth, or the constituency of Monaghan as it was and is at present.  These people were always looking forward to the day when they would get back to their own county.  Again, in 1969 when the Meath portion came into Monaghan the people in Meath worked with the people in Monaghan but were not happy there.  Again, they were looking forward to getting back to their own county.</P>
    <P>We in Monaghan and Cavan have more in common than Monaghan people have with Louth people or with the people of Meath.  Deputy Wilson mentioned the GAA and I know that he had a long association with them and that he was a fair exponent of the game.  I also had some association with it and I know that the people of Monaghan and Cavan while we may fight while we are in Ulster, when Cavan goes outside Ulster, Monaghan people are behind them, horse, foot and artillery.  In fact, unlike some of the people of Meath, I seem to remember a Cavan bus being stoned going through Navan one evening after an All-Ireland final.  The people of Monaghan and Cavan have more in <Col N="1324" /> common than they have with those in Meath and Louth.</P>
    <P>The problems in Monaghan and Cavan are more similar than those of Louth and Meath people.  As an instance, sometimes when one is representing the people of Louth and Monaghan problems come up.  Some time ago a certain problem arose.  People of Monaghan engaged in pig feeding while the people in Louth are grain growers and at times when one had to make a case for cheaper feed for the people of Monaghan one would be speaking against the Louth grain growers.  The people of Monaghan and Cavan where the farmers are mainly small farmers have similar problems and it is, therefore, easier to represent Cavan-Monaghan than Cavan-Louth-Meath.</P>
    <P>In the area I represent in the county council in Monaghan, half the people do their marketing in County Cavan, in Cootehill or Shercock.  They have much in common which is another point in favour of the two counties being amalgamated in one constituency.  I shall support the Bill because I think it is more rational than either of the amendments proposed.  Last week I heard Deputy Wilson talking about the close-knit community in Cavan but I could not understand his logic in supporting an amendment to exclude Kingscourt and Shercock and adjoining areas from Cavan.  If I were speaking from a selfish point of view, I could see merit in the amendment because that area is very close to me and I have many connections with it but I understand the aim of the Minister's Bill is to preserve county boundaries as far as possible and that mainly is what the Bill does.  I support the Bill because I feel we have more in common in Monaghan and Cavan than we have in Monaghan-Louth and Meath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A boundary is something that defines a territory and the boundary that is at issue when one is talking about a constituency is the constituency boundary and how one preserves a constituency boundary when the constituency did not exist beforehand I do not know.  In fact, it is the county boundaries that are supposed to be at issue and the <Col N="1325" /> county boundary between Cavan and Monaghan is being wiped out by the Bill.  Apart from getting a kick in a humorous sense in thinking of anyone pulling the carpet from under the massive frame of Deputy Paddy Smith, I want to ask how can the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Local Government, looking at a list of Members of this House, state that Leonard of Smithsboro, Conlon of Ballybay, Toal of Smithsboro, Smith of Cootehill, Fitzpatrick of Cavan town and Wilson of Kilgolagh, all living in their respective county boundaries will not lose one position out of the six.  The Minister for Lands said he was not voting for the loss of his seat.  A seat is being lost by those two counties in a rural area which is crying out for more representation and a more favourable percentage than is desirable in built-up areas which are accessible and easy to organise.  Representation in the area under the new scheme is being made more difficult.  There is no doubt about that and I am sure the Minister himself will admit it.  The amendment is trying to give more Members of the Oireachtas to represent an area and give better service to the constituents.  I reiterate my appeal.</P>

We have fought on behalf of the people in those areas and we make a final appeal to the Minister to accept our amendment.</P>

      <P>I should briefly like to put the point that I am fully in support of the Minister in trying to maintain county boundaries as far as possible.  As somebody who represents two counties, a constituency similar to this particular constituency, I believe it is an arrangement which can prove satisfactory.  In the constituency of Laois-Offaly, which is similar to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, this is desirable.  I am certain that Deputy Lalor will agree that it is convenient for those wishing to attend meetings throughout the constituency. Where there are energetic and hardworking Deputies in a constituency such as that proposed by the Minister, it is administratively, geographically and in every other respect suitable.  Therefore, I agree with the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be accused of wasting the time of the House.  I have been waiting some time for a chance to speak.  My complaint with the Government is that they should have given more notice of the motion today.  The area under discussion is hard-hit by this Bill.  The Minister stated that the 1969 Act put people out of this House.  This Bill is attempting to put two seats out of the area around my district.  I defy contradiction on that.  The Bill is doing away with one constituency&mdash;the old constituency of Clare-South Galway.  In this Bill the tolerance figures react against the west.  There are pluses and minuses.  Deputy Molloy has brought in an amendment to the Bill.  The Bill will do away with one seat.  In the new Clare constituency, according to Deputy Molloy, there is a minus of 951.  The Minister mentioned a plus of 787.  In the west Galway constituency Deputy Molloy proposes to retain the constituency with a plus of 51, but the Minister has a minus of 542.  This is the urban constituency of the city of Galway and part of Clare.</P>
      <P>In the Clare-South Galway constituency Deputy Molloy has a minus of 804 and the Minister's new constituency has a plus of 671.  The big pluses in the Minister's Bill are in Leitrim and Roscommon.  Under the Fianna Fáil proposal Leitrim-Roscommon has a plus of 373, and the Minister has a plus of 996 in that constituency.  In Sligo-Leitrim there is a minus of 578 in Deputy Molloy's proposal and there is a plus of 882 in the Minister's Bill.  That shows that the tolerance has gone against the west.  With a tolerance of 1,000 each way, if the Minister and the Government wished to leave them the seats, they could have retained the three constituencies as they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> I am a long time associated with politics.  I was not always as active as I am now.  For a long time in Galway we had six Fianna Fáil TDs and three Fine Gael TDs.  Before the revision of the constituencies in 1969 there were three Fine Gael Deputies there and they were still there after that revision.  Therefore, nothing that happened in 1969 took a seat from Fine Gael.  There was no Labour seat in that portion of County Galway and Clare.  In this revision one man who can speak for himself is totally blackguarded, that is, Deputy Loughnane.  In this revision his vote is cut in three.  Portion of it is in West Galway, portion of it remains in the new East Galway constituency, and portion of it is in Clare.</P>
    <P>In the new East Galway constituency there are five sitting TDs who must fight for four seats.  They are three Fianna Fáil and two Fine Gael seats.  On the figures for the last election the seat is taken from us unless there is a landslide.  The cultural relationship between Cavan and Monaghan was mentioned.  That may be so.  I will not argue about that, but I will argue that there is no cultural relationship between the people of Lisdoonvarna and Lahinch and the people of Galway city.  In the old Clare-South Galway constituency the division line ran across the mountain. The people in Scarriff had a lot in common with the people of Gort and Woodford.  If there was any cultural relationship it was between the people in the part of Galway which was in the Clare-South Galway constituency.</P>
    <P>In the new set-up there is nothing whatsoever to link them culturally or otherwise.  Headford is close to the Corrib and, if any place was to go in with West Galway, I suggest it should be Headford.  Instead of that, Headford is left in the new East Galway constituency which goes up to Athenry and veers back near Loughrea to Craughwell village.  Then the line veers west again and puts Gort into the new East Galway constituency and goes away up into Clare and takes in Ennistymon and Lisdoonvarna <Col N="1331" /> and those parts of Clare which have nothing in common with Galway.</P>
    <P>I cannot speak for too long because our time is limited and there are a number of western Deputies who want to make contributions.  I would ask the Minister to take a hard look at this amendment.  As I said before, I do not blame the Minister. The Government are a Dublin-based Government, a Leinster Government, with the exception of one decent man from the west.  A lot was said about the 1969 Act by the people who were then in Opposition.  I was not here then.  Maybe it was done party-wise.  I read some of the remarks made by the then Opposition. I will not quote them because I have not got the time.  We are having another &ldquo;go&rdquo; at 8.30 p.m.  At that time they said there should be a commission. No matter what was done in 1969 nothing was done deliberately to take a seat from any political party in the west.  This revision is definitely taking a seat from the west.</P>
    <P>The population of Galway has increased and still we are losing a seat. The population of Clare has increased and still we are losing a seat.  The irony of the whole thing is that, as was pointed out forcefully when we were discussing Dublin, it takes 500 more votes to elect somebody in Leitrim than it does in Dublin.  That is not fair play to the people of the west.  It is stated in the Boys of Wexford that when Ireland lay broken she called for revenge to the west.  I do not believe in long speeches but I want to make this point.  We consider that this is a gerrymander of the west and particularly the western seaboard.  Normally the Minister is considered to be a fair-minded man but I do not know why he did not consult with somebody. Deputies opposite do not agree with this Bill.  Nobody likes to see his area losing seats.  This Bill definitely takes seats from the west.  It is an urban-minded Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Loughnane said to me one day&mdash;and I believe him of course&mdash;that he would win a seat in any of the three areas.  In Deputy Molloy's proposal in the previous amendments he was dividing my constituency into four.  He was splitting it up much smaller than Galway.  This is something I should like to point out because it does not seem to have sunk home to those on the opposite side from the west who are prepared to support Deputy Molloy's proposal. Under Deputy Molloy's proposal the boundary of every county in the west, either by losing population or by having people from another county added to the constituency which that county forms is broken again and again.  Four counties lose population to other counties and a total of 63,550 persons will find themselves in a constituency, the greater part of which consists of a county other than that in which they live.</P>

      <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister say, and I agree entirely, that people should not be transferred from one county to another.  I know he has applied that in his own county, Meath.  I wonder why he did not apply it in County Clare.  Even at this late stage&mdash;since he is the only person who could introduce an amendment&mdash;perhaps he would ponder on an amendment to consider making County Clare, which had over 75,000 people in the last census, a four-seater.  We hear a lot about the increase in population in Dublin but Counties Clare and Galway increased their populations between the last two censuses.  In fact, in County Clare, the population has increased so much that, in the Ennis electoral area alone, the present voting list is greater than the number of people on the census for 1971.  It is a pity the Minister has left the House now because recently when a deputation from County Clare came to see him regarding the proposed changes in electoral areas for local authority elections, he produced those figures.  They show that the population of County Clare has increased much more than 75,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to hear Deputy Callanan refer to me by name, and the Minister too.  Deputy Callanan spoke about our constituency as it was between Clare and Galway and the culture we have there.  I wonder is that the culture to which the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs refers when he speaks of &ldquo;bog oak culture&rdquo;.  I know the present Government are geared to favouring the east as against the west.  There is no doubt about that.  The population of the west of Ireland, from Donegal to County Clare, is 578,039 people and the number of seats there were 30.  If the seats were to be retained at 30, the average per Deputy would be 19,267 which the Minister will accept is above the constitutional minimum.  In Dublin SouthEast constituency the population per Deputy will be 19,292, a mere 18 or 19 more than in the west of Ireland.  In Meath, the Minister's own <Col N="1337" /> constituency, the population per Deputy will be 19,239 which is less than the figures for which he is dropping two seats in the west of Ireland. Now Clare, as a three-seat constituency, will mean that the population per TD will be almost 21,000.  According to the 1971 census, the population of Clare was over 75,000 and the population of West Galway was 62,731, a difference of almost 13,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes a four-seat constituency for West Galway, by taking 13,000 North Clare people and adding them to West Galway&mdash;entirely contrary to his statement a while ago about retaining county boundaries.  He is taking 13,000 Clare people to justify a four-seat constituency in West Galway.  We know the reason for that. The Minister has his own ideas.  Other people may not have the same ideas. He has stated frequently that it is his wish to retain county boundaries.  Even last week he said he did not want to have any new boundaries established such as the Shannon.  He thought we were speaking too much about the west of Ireland.  It is obvious that there is complete partiality towards Dublin and the Pale.</P>
    <P>Consider the proposed West Galway constituency.  It is obvious that it is an unworkable constituency for any TD. It stretches from the Mayo border down across Galway, on to Lahinch and almost to the town of Ennis.  In that constituency you have every possible problem.  There are large mountain areas, the Gaeltacht, the islands.  There is sea fishing and inland fishing, the large city of Galway with all the problems that arise in a city.  There is Galway harbour and there is a university. There is the largest hospital in the country with the biggest number of beds.  There is a large military barracks. There are the problems of housing, agriculture, forestry, land drainage, Land Commission work and tourism. These are common to other constituencies. When one compares that with some of the Dublin city constituencies and sees the amount of work they offer for a TD one will see the sense in reconsidering the suggestion.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should <Col N="1338" /> put down an amendment to consider County Clare as a four-seat constituency or at least acknowledge the rights of 13,000 Clare people by putting them in with West Galway and calling the constituency Clare/West Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In this debate particularly in relation to the western constituencies people are inclined to use figures to suit their own arguments.  We are told by the Opposition that there is no reason why there should not be another seat or two in the west of Ireland.  At the last revision three seats were taken by that party out of the west.  I do not know whether they went to Leinster or to Munster but they certainly went out of the west.</P>
      <P>Seats in this House are based on population in a particular part of the country.  Let us look at the record of the Opposition with regard to the population of the west of Ireland. When that party came into power in 1932 the population of the province of Connacht was 552,970.  At the last available census in 1971 the population of Connacht went down to 389,763, a drop of 163,144.  There is the kernel of the trouble.  In that period the Fianna Fáil party were in Government except for six years.  If anybody is to blame for that situation surely the blame lies with them.  There is no point in shedding tears tonight about the drop in population in the west and about the loss of seats.  If they have been lost through the neglect of the last Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy was anxious that I should give way to him.  I will do so to allow him to quote any statement in which I made reference to County Leitrim being put together or separated.  I never made such reference.  I had a fight on my hands; at the previous general election I failed to be elected but at the last election I succeeded. I do not think that was a mortal sin. Perhaps I was lucky in defeating one of the Ministers in the last Government. I do not think that was a great achievement; I think the time had come for a change and the people knew I was a victim of a gerrymander.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds has invited me to quote him.  If I am allowed to speak between now and 10.30 p.m. I shall certainly do so.  I want to put on the record of the House that what the Coalition are <Col N="1343" /> doing in this Bill, so far as it affects the area west of the Shannon plus Cavan and Clare, is an action of total discrimination against the community living in that area.  With the increase in the population in the country the Government could allow four additional seats but they decided to reduce the representation in the western counties from 36 to 28. This dealt a severe blow to the spirit of the people in that area and it gave them a clear indication of the attitude of the Government towards them and their special problems.</P>
      <P>Deputies from the west have always considered they had a special cause to plead, that they were pleading for a disadvantaged section of our country where life was not as cushy and easy as in other parts.  Yet, we are faced with a reduction in the number of voices that can come to this Parliament and speak for this difficult area.  The western part covers a very wide area.  It is a well-known fact and it has been recorded in surveys, commissions, and in booklets that the population have depended largely on small agricultural holdings to eke out a living and that special efforts should be made by the State to encourage industries to this area.</P>
      <P>During the years the efforts of Deputies from all sides have succeeded to a certain extent in ensuring that this area got special consideration and, by way of special arrangements in relation to grants and tax-free allowances to promote the west, some progress has been made.  We are not satisfied that sufficient progress has been made and the task is still not completed.  We need as many voices as we are entitled to under the Constitution to come here and to lobby for the people living in the western areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extraordinary piece of gerrymandering has been carried out by the Coalition Government in deciding to operate the tolerance against the western areas and granting only the minimum number allowable under the Constitution.  Following the last census, the maximum number of Deputies allowable under the Constitution in <Col N="1344" /> the western areas is 30, while the minimum allowable is 28.  To our utter amazement, this Government decided the western area was to get only the minimum number of Deputies in the next election.  This is a reduction of two seats.  Government spokesmen have come here and claimed that the reduction of two seats in the west was due to the drop in the population.</P>
    <P>I want categorically here and now to refute that false statement.  There is no authority for it and there is no basis upon which it can be founded. There are no statistics to substantiate it.  I have proved conclusively during the course of the debate that the population in the western area, in compliance with the constitutional figures, could have allowed for the retention of 30 Deputies.  Rather than seek any special privilege or any special consideration we, in our amendment, have suggested that in fairness at least 29 Deputies should be elected to this area. We have not sought any special consideration or any special privilege.  Had we done so we could have claimed the full 30 Deputies.</P>
    <P>We are amazed that the Government should have the effrontery to come in here and expect the House to accept their miserable argument in support of what they have done.  They have tried to create the myth that the population has dropped and so the Minister had no option other than to reduce the western areas by two.  Like all myths, this myth is false.  It is despicable that not on one single occasion has any speaker on that side of the House stood up and admitted that what we are saying here is true.  It amazes me to see people like Deputy Coogan, Deputy Harte and the Deputy who has just run out, Deputy Reynolds, all representing the west, with obviously no influence of any kind with the Government parties or with the Cabinet; they have once again allowed the western areas to be sold down the river.</P>
    <P>As I say, we are not pleading for any special consideration.  We are merely suggesting a proper and correct thing to do&mdash;that would have been to allocate the 29 seats suggested in our amendment.  To give some evidence of the way in which the Minister has <Col N="1345" /> approached this matter, I want to show&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The tone of my voice indicates the feeling of this party and, if the Deputy is disturbed, he has his choice; he can leave.  He knows he has turned his back on his constituents. He knows he has let down the area he represents by supporting this effort on the part of this Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>I want to point out now that in the western counties the Minister has made provision for one Deputy per 20,509 electors and that allows for only 28 seats.  The maximum tolerance range rises to 21,123.  Yet the Minister did not avail of the opportunity offered to him but acted rather in a manner detrimental to the western areas because he could have gone for a much lower figure and, in doing so, balanced things out.</P>
      <P>Why am I suggesting he should have gone for a lower figure?  The figure for the west, 20,509, is the highest figure in the country taking the areas the Minister has set out in his explanatory memorandum.  Even in the Munster area, the next highest, it is 20,174 per Deputy.  In the Dublin area it requires only 20,142 per Deputy.  In the South Leinster area it requires only 19,937 and in the North Leinster area, including Cavan and Monaghan, it requires only 19,596 per Deputy.  The lowest possible number per Deputy was chosen by the Minister in that area in which he himself will stand.  It includes the constituency the Minister is proposing for Meath.  It is quite obvious what the trend is.  There is positive political discrimination and manipulation being indulged in in a very blatant fashion by the Coalition Government and by the Minister, who has a capacity for this, and who has been told to come in here and have it passed with their vote and with their feet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have shown that by dividing the western area into the following constituencies and allocating 29 seats we could have had a situation with a Donegal constituency of five Deputies, a Sligo-Leitrim constituency with three Deputies, a Leitrim-Roscommon constituency with three Deputies, an East Mayo constituency with three Deputies, a West Mayo constituency with three Deputies, a North East Galway constituency with three Deputies, a West Galway constituency with three Deputies, a Clare-South Galway constituency with three Deputies and a Clare constituency with three Deputies, giving a total of 29 seats.  The total population for all of that area is 574,294 persons according to the census of population in 1971.  The average on that basis of allocation, of 29 seats to the west, per Deputy would have worked out at 19,801.  That figure is still not as low as the figure to which the Minister went in the area in which he will stand himself.  The area of North Leinster.</P>

We have discussed the Dublin area.  The position is as I have outlined it; it is possible that what we suggest can be done and is practicable.  I have shown how it can be done.</P>

      <P>We have illustrated clearly by our amendments what the position should be.  We have drawn <Col N="1347" /> maps to show the effect of these amendments.  They can be studied. They are compact and reasonable and, above all, they maintain a reasonable balance as between each constituency and as between the different areas from the point of view of the averages and the ratios.  To the west 29 seats should have been allocated without there being any question at all of giving the west any special consideration whatsoever.  In allocating somewhat around the same average as the rest of the country 29 seats would have been a fair figure.</P>
      <P>We have shown on previous occasions here that, in fact, even going to 30 one could have allocated that many to the west and still complied with the minimum requirement of 19,123 population per Deputy.  But we accept that, in doing that, it would have been necessary to divide County Leitrim between a Donegal constituency, a Sligo constituency and a Roscommon constituency and we do not agree that that should be done again and it is because of that our amendments are designed to divide the county of Leitrim by restoring it as far as possible as a political entity.</P>

As against that, the Minister has taken a large portion of County Leitrim and put it in with another county.  We did not do that.  We put the minimum amount necessary into County Donegal and left substantially the whole of the county of Leitrim with part of Roscommon to form a constituency on its own.</P>

We feel he has removed too much of one part of the <Col N="1348" /> county thereby reducing both the voice and the effectiveness of the county.</P>
      <P>We have made our argument firmly and fairly.  The facts are indisputable. There is nobody on that side of the House.  The previous speaker quoted from the census of population and I regret to say his figures were not correct. I challenge any Deputy on that side of the House to state that the figures we have been working on are incorrect in any way.  I challenge anybody to show that it would not be possible to do what we suggest in our amendment.  I submit it is possible and that in fairness to that area, without giving it any special consideration, it would have been proper and correct to have allocated that number of seats to it.</P>
      <P>The Coalition Parties who have done this bad deed, who have done this dirty work against the western areas, will live to regret the day.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 1, to delete &ldquo;Minister may by direction provide for the entry of&rdquo; and to substitute therefor &ldquo;registration authority or registration authorities concerned shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, enter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have stated fully our reasons for putting down this amendment on Committee Stage.  As we were precluded from having it discussed on Committee Stage, the arguments made then are in support of this amendment now before the House on Report Stage and we would urge the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to accept this amendment, because it would do the opposite to what Deputy Molloy wants.  What, in effect, Deputy Molloy is asking is that something that will have to be done only after the next election is declared should be done immediately.  I believe it would cause a lot of extra trouble and expense, and I am sure that if Deputy Molloy looks at it in that way he will accept that this would worsen the position. <Col N="1355" /> I explained this to him when he suggested it to the Chair on Committee Stage.  If it would improve the matter, I would be only too glad to accept it, but I believe it would worsen the position and I am afraid I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>When this matter was being discussed on Committee Stage, the Minister stated that what we are discussing here would be done anyway immediately.  Now he implies that if he accepted our amendment there would be an obligation to do it immediately.  Either the Minister was correct in his first statement that this thing would be done anyway or else he was not correct.  I do not know whether he remembers having said this.  It was mentioned by us on numerous occasions during the course of the debate.  If the Minister would say he was wrong in saying that this matter would be done immediately following the passing of the Bill, then we would be prepared to listen to his arguments against our amendment. Did the Minister make a mistake in informing the House that this work would be done immediately after the passing of the Bill?</P>

      <P>What I said was that the returning officer will have arrangements made so that in the event of a general election taking place he can use the registers which are prepared, but he will not prepare a new set of registers entirely for this matter, which is suggested in Deputy Molloy's proposal. Therefore, there is no contradiction in what I said.  If a by-election takes place, the by-election is fought in the old constituency and there is no question of any mix-up occurring.  If a general election takes place, the new constituencies come into operation and the registrar is then in a position from the existing registers to prepare a register which can be used for the new areas.  What Deputy Molloy is suggesting, if I take his amendment correctly, <Col N="1356" /> is that immediately the Bill becomes law the county registrar should prepare a new set of registers for the new constituencies which will not come into operation until the next general election.  Whether we like it or not the registrar will have to continue to draw up the existing register for by-elections which might take place and for local elections.  Deputy Molloy had a point, but there is no reason to do this and it would cause more trouble than it would remedy.</P>

      <P>We do not want to delay the House on this, but we are satisfied that we have directed the Minister's attention to it.  We are not completely happy that the statement he is making now can be reconciled with the statement made in the course of the discussion on this section during Committee Stage.  However in view of the effort by the Government to stultify debate on this whole Bill and to restrict it by the introduction of the guillotine motion, we do not wish to use whatever few minutes we have left on this issue.  Therefore we shall withdraw the amendment, but we hope the Minister is fully satisfied now that what we suggested should not take place.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 25, to delete &ldquo;the sanction of the Minister&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;confirmation by the Minister who may confirm the arrangement with or without modification&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During Committee Stage debate Opposition speakers pointed out that, while the temporary arrangements proposed under section 7 were subject to the sanction of the Minister, the Minister was given no specific power to amend or modify the arrangements proposed.  They suggested that the position should be brought into line with the position in relation to polling schemes generally as set out in section 22(3) of the Electoral Act, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That section enables the Minister to confirm a polling scheme with or without modification or to refuse to confirm it.  The purpose of this amendment <Col N="1357" /> is to meet the point made by the Opposition.  In substituting the words &ldquo;confirmation by the Minister who may confirm the arrangement with or without modification&rdquo;, we are meeting the point made, in particular by Deputy Lalor who said that, while it has operated for many years successfully and there has been no mix-up about it, it could happen&mdash;and I accepted his point&mdash;that if somebody wanted to be awkward, he might submit a scheme which would cause trouble, and therefore the Minister should have the right to decide whether or not this scheme, as proposed, should be sanctioned and if it was not suitable to alter it or sanction one which would be suitable.</P>

      <P>This is a purely formal amendment and arises from the fact that the Bill which was introduced in 1973 was not enacted during that year.  In accordance with Standing Order 105 the Clerk of the Dáil, under the direction of the Ceann Comhairle, may make corrections of a verbal or formal nature in a Bill as it goes through the House.  Under this power, it will be possible, for example to change &ldquo;1973&rdquo; to &ldquo;1974&rdquo; in the title of the Bill and to drop &ldquo;(No.2)&rdquo; from the title.</P>

      <P>I take it we are still on the Report Stage and that we can continue until 9.30.  I can assure the Government that the few minutes grace granted to us by the Government will be availed of.  Under the threat of instant death at 9.30, we wish to record our dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Government have treated the Opposition while the Bill was before the House.  There are a large number of Fianna Fáil Deputies keenly interested in this Bill who were anxious to contribute to the debate in a quiet, calm and reasonable way.  This has been denied to them.</P>
      <P>We consider it a basic right of any Deputy elected to this House to be allowed to contribute to debates on all legislation.  One can readily see how Deputies would be particularly interested in a Bill such as this.  We have been treated most unfairly and in a most arbitrary fashion by the Government who have set a precedent in relation to this measure in this Parliament.  We want to protest that by no stretch of the imagination could anybody claim there has been adequate debate on the Schedule to this Bill and the amendments put forward by Fianna Fáil.  We deplore the attitude displayed by the Minister and we regret that the standards of this House have been brought to this low level by the Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on this Bill could have continued on a sensible basis.  This hasty legislation is now being rushed through the House without any debate. We have shown in the amendments that the Minister grudgingly conceded, following suggestions from speakers from this side, that these Bills can be improved, that there can be anomalies <Col N="1359" /> found in them and that it is the duty of the Opposition of the day to examine them with critical eyes.  We have been doing that with the parts of the Bill that have come before the House but we will not be allowed to do that with the part of the Bill still to come.</P>
    <P>It angers the people of the west to have been treated in the way that this Bill treats them.  It angers anybody sincerely concerned about the development of the west which has been treated as a second-class area.  To illustrate the danger of the use of this type of method, the danger of rushing legislation through the House, I should like to point out that the Minister some time ago pushed through by the use of the guillotine an amendment to change both of the Mayo constituencies&mdash;East Mayo and West Mayo.  What he has done without any debate is to change the constituency of East Mayo which had a population of 58,816 under the original proposal in the Bill and to delete an area including a population of 1,986 and to add to East Mayo an area including a population of 3,348, which leaves East Mayo now with a total population of 59,178.</P>
    <P>This meant changes to the West Mayo constituency.  The part transferred from the west to the east reduces the west from 60,310 by 3,348 and the part to be deducted from the east and added to the west includes 1,986, leaving West Mayo with 58,948. At least an effort has been made to restore the balance in the population ratios between East and West Mayo. It was impossible to justify the situation that obtained before when West Mayo included a population of 60,000 and East Mayo had only 57,000.  That kind of thing has been corrected somewhat. However, to illustrate the dangers in rushing legislation through the House, I should like to point out that what the Minister has done is to transfer an area from West Mayo to East Mayo, Lackan North, which in the 1971 census had a population of 508 persons.  I am reliably informed that there is no way in which a person can travel from the East Mayo constituency to Lackan North, which the Minister now is including in East Mayo, unless one does a roundabout into another constituency altogether.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister take it easy now?  He has limited us to 15 minutes and would he please let us have our say?  They are greedy enough on that side of the House&mdash;they have taken all the constituencies to suit themselves.  Lackan North, which the Minister now wants to transfer from West Mayo to East Mayo, cannot be reached directly from any part of the East Mayo constituency.  Of course an east coast man like the Minister reading this map of the west would imagine that it is possible because the line on the map seems to indicate that one can travel direct from Lackan South into Lackan North.  What the Minister is not aware of is that the tide flows in this area and that a river intervenes.  The sea divides Lackan North and Lackan South.  The Minister has now made the great blunder of creating a new island in this country which is attached to the mainland.</P>

      <P>The Minister has denied us a seat in the west.  I have gone over that.  The statistics I quoted on this and previous Stages prove that conclusively.  I challenged anybody to contest my figures and nobody has taken up the challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest anomalies of the whole Bill, one that cannot be justified on any grounds, is the Minister's decision to change the West Galway constituency from a three-seat to a four-seat constituency and to include a <Col N="1362" /> substantial part of South County Galway which traditionally was in another constituency and also to include a vast area of County Clare.  This matter has been examined in my home town and by the newspapers in the west of Ireland.  Some of these people may be in a position to have taken a more independent view of the matter than I was seeing that the West Galway constituency would be of some interest to me.</P>
    <P>They have all expressed puzzlement as to how any Minister could have decided to put in such a large proportion of County Clare reaching down past Kilfenora and Liscannor to Hag's Head.  To journey around that constituency, which now assumes the shape of a huge &ldquo;U&rdquo; around Galway Bay, one has to travel from Inisboffin on the west Galway coast to Galway city, around Galway Bay at Renmore and Oranmore, and then out to Clare, up the corkscrew or around by Black Head and on out to Liscannor and Hag's Head.  It is a journey of over 120 or 130 miles.  The only way in which a Deputy could hope to service his constituents would be to beg leave of the Government for the use of their helicopters to pay an odd visit to this area.</P>
    <P>This constituency has its own particular and peculiar problems.  The Minister waxes eloquent on Meath. He claimed that Cavan and Monaghan had many things in common and should be put together and that it would be disastrous to put any little bit of Meath in with Cavan as the people had nothing in common. Would the Minister tell us what the people in Liscannor have in common with the people in Inisboffin or Omey Island or in Turbot Island or in Inisturk or Innisheer, or Innishmaan or Innishmore or any other parts of the Gaeltacht in that constituency or as far over as Maam or Leenane or into Cornamona or on down to Cong? This is a very widely scattered constituency varying between a Galltacht and a Gaeltacht, the second largest in the country and probably with the greatest number of islands of any constituency. This creates problems for Deputies keeping in touch with constituents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> The Minister chose to change this West Galway constituency, which was compact enough, stretching from the east side of the city back, including all of Connemara and was being reasonably well served by the Deputies elected over the years in those areas. Now he proposes to include this area of Clare, part of the rural district of Ballyvaughan, with 2,533 persons, part of the former rural district of Corofin, 2,799, part of the rural district of Ennis&mdash;Ennis and Inisboffin, if you do not mind&mdash;with 763 persons and the rural district of Ennistymon, 6,182, making a total, if you include part of rural district of Gort with 4,043 persons, of 16,320.  Of that, 12,277 persons resided in 1971 in the Clare portion which the Minister proposes to put into the West Galway constituency. Would it come as a surprise to any Member of the House or the community?  Certainly, the people of Galway can understand the Minister's thinking in making this decision.  It is known in Galway that in the last election, and indeed in all the elections held since the foundation of the State, the Labour Party never managed to elect a Deputy from the Galway area of Connemara and the city I am speaking of.  The Minister's candidate at the last election, who has now come in on the back of the Fine Gael capitalist Taoiseach into the Seanad as a socialist, Senator Michael D. Higgins, was running on his own in the Galway area and made only about a half-quota.  Because this gentleman comes from County Clare the Minister feels it might help him to increase that half-quota by probably another half-quota or, in some degree, help him into Dáil Éireann.  This was the only thing the Minister could have done for him and he did it.  It does not make sense to anybody because the areas contains no Labour votes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;except that it gives Mr. Higgins an opportunity to work it up.  I think the Minister's scheming in this as in many of his other proposals will probably backfire and rebound against him in the long <Col N="1364" /> run.  At the same time we have an obligation to expose the deviousness of the Minister's mind in making such proposals as this.  In the case of Dublin and the Wicklow, Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny areas and in the case of Monaghan, Cavan, Kildare, Louth and Meath areas the Minister has argued that these areas have something in common and that he strove to maintain county boundaries.  In West Galway, not alone has he crossed the county boundary between Galway and Clare but has crossed from one province to another, from Connacht into Munster.  Need one ask how sincere the Minister was in much of what he said in trying to defend his actions here publicly?  He had to do it publicly; there was no way he could avoid coming in with this rotten, dirty-trick Bill into the House.  Only by bringing it to the House could he make it law but in doing so he did not even allow normal democratic procedures to operate.  He introduced a motion which cuts short the debate on it, which prevents many Deputies from the west from speaking on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter of great concern to the Fianna Fáil Party.  We must accept the inevitable.  We must accept the bullheadedness of the tactics employed by the Coalition.  If there was half as much alacrity and enthusiasm for other Bills which the Coalition have put on the Order Paper as there is for this Bill we could perhaps be discussing matters of greater national importance.  There is no urgency in regard to this Bill; our motion allows the discussion to conclude by May 29th.  We deem that a reasonable period.  We claim that all Deputies on this side of the House who wish to contribute to the debate should have been allowed to do so.  Each one wanted to put his own personal point of view and his own personal position on the record.  Their comments would be made with expert local knowledge. I cannot discuss all these constituencies with expert local knowledge.  I can only show that in the general principles I have applied in the amendments a bad day's work has been done for Ireland and the community, that blatant discrimination has been allowed to operate.  The Government <Col N="1365" /> brought in an anti-discrimination Bill and on the following day we came in and discussed a discrimination Bill. There is obvious contradiction in the Government's thinking.  The discrimination Bill has to do with jobs for the Coalition boys, with preparing the ground for the next general election, with allowing the Coalition to select what they think is the most advantageous size and area of constituency, number of Deputies to be elected. They have done this in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>We ask the Coalition if they are an honest, open and truthful Government to come forward with the Bill that all of the country is waiting to discuss in this House, to come forward <Col N="1366" /> with the Contraceptive Bill, which has a certain urgency about it.  We were told today that this Bill was coming before Dáil Éireann but this has not happened.  This too can be added to the long list of broken promises of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Over 40 constituencies remain to be discussed.  Major changes have been made to many of them.  There were no opportunities given to the representatives from Tipperary, Kerry, Limerick and the Cork city and county to discuss their constituencies. This is a disgrace and we protest.  We accept that the Government have only the jackboot with which to beat us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now come to the end of this debate.  We have had some fiery speeches from Deputy Molloy towards the end.  He was making the welkin ring, complaining particularly that he and his colleagues in the Opposition were not given the opportunity which they required to make their case on what they claimed to be the unfair way in which the west in particular was dealt with.</P>
      <P>Again and again during the period in which Deputy Molloy and his colleagues were filibustering about whether the Bill should be called the Electoral Bill, 1973, or the Electoral Bill, 1974, I warned Fianna Fáil that they were wasting their own time and that towards the end they would be making exactly the complaints which Deputy Molloy has made here.  I told them that no matter what happened, if Fianna Fáil continued to complain, to repeat themselves and to make ridiculous statements they would eventually find themselves in the position in which they found themselves this evening.  No effort whatever was made by Fianna Fáil to marshal their Deputies or to ensure that there would be a constructive debate on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was all so foolish. <Col N="1369" /> There were petty little points put up again and again by Deputy Molloy and in the early stages by some of the other Deputies who talked about how unfair it was that we should have decided that there would be 148 Deputies, although they agreed that there should be 148 Deputies.  Deputy Haughey, the big-hearted man, said he felt there should be 200 Deputies. Perhaps there will be 200 Deputies if the population keeps going up at its present rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Having agreed that there should be 148 Deputies&mdash;perhaps with Deputy Haughey's 200 thrown in&mdash; they then decided they would challenge a vote on it.  They wasted their own time voting against a proposal to have 148 Deputies.  This was a childish thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sort of childish conduct which Fianna Fáil indulged in.  For over 40 hours Fianna Fáil talked about trivial things&mdash;matters which could have been dealt with in a few hours.  They talked about them and they found at the end that they had no time to discuss what Deputy Molloy now comes up with as being the important part of the Bill.  If the Deputy looks at the Official Report he will find that in the early stages at least four times I pointed out to him that the Schedule to the Bill was the really important part of it and that if he wanted to have it sufficiently discussed it was his job to ensure that he got down to it.  Deputy Molloy was so naïve as to imagine that he was going to be allowed to discuss it at length.  In this House three times I did what I did not want to do, but as the matters had been discussed over and over again I introduced the guillotine.</P>

They can now take what they are going to get.  I listened to Deputy Molloy talking about the terrible thing it was to put Lackan North away from a certain area.

      <P>Deputy Molloy speaks as if an adjustment between Clare and Galway is something new.  It is not. There was an adjustment between those counties in the 1969 revision.  It becomes a major cause for dissent only now because the areas being joined are slightly different from the 1969 revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been terribly patient during a very long discussion on this Bill. Deputies opposite, with one exception, persisted in saying that there was one amendment which might change and improve the Bill.  That exception was in reference to the right of the Minister to decide whether or not additional powers should be given to provide&mdash; under temporary arrangements of electoral divisions&mdash;that the Minister might be able to say he was not satisfied with the proposals made.  In that case I agree there might be something to it, even though the evidence has been that <Col N="1376" /> right down the years it has operated properly and there has been no trouble about it.  With that exception we have had in this House an exhibition of bad manners by Fianna Fáil, something about which I am not a bit surprised. When they rose, one after the other they accused us of being bad mannered.  Not alone did they repeat petty arguments on petty points but you, Sir, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle were wrongly abused because they were not allowed continue it indefinitely.  Having done that they try to give the impression now that they are the upholders of liberty in this House, that they are the people who stand for liberty in this country.  That is a new thing Fianna Fáil represents &mdash;liberty or equality in this country.</P>
    <P>We have had 64 hours of debate, over 60 of which have been taken up by Fianna Fáil speakers.  Do they expect that they be allowed do any damn thing they want in this House? You, Sir, saw what happened on the last two Stages.  You saw where the Fianna Fáil spokesman, having got up, insisted on holding the floor until the time came for putting the motion and then objected when I got up and did not allow the same thing to happen on the Final Stage.  They must think we are terribly foolish if they imagine that we would agree to have that sort of thing continue.</P>
    <P>Throughout the discussion on this Bill we have had allegations made that there was discrimination against the country areas in favour of the city.  I want to make it clear again, on this stage, that in the Dublin area the average population per Deputy&mdash; mind you some people here seem to imagine that the population per Deputy and number of votes to elect a Deputy are one and the same thing; they are not; the number of votes represent those who cast a vote at an election for a Deputy; population includes the baby in the cradle&mdash;is 20,142.  The average for the rest of the country is 20,115.  There is no way in which anybody can get around that situation.  That is slanted, even if only slightly so, towards the rural districts. I represent a rural constituency.  It makes me laugh to hear Fianna Fáil Deputies over the last few weeks talk <Col N="1377" /> about how unfair I was to rural Deputies, particularly Deputy Molloy, when he went to the length of telling us tonight how unfair it was to break Leitrim in two.  His predecessor, the last Minister for Local Government to draw up constituencies here, broke it in three.  And, in the Custom House, there is evidence that Deputy Molloy intended breaking it into four uneven quarters in this Bill.  Having suggested doing that, had he not a hard neck to come in here tonight and say to me that I was being unfair to Leitrim by talking about dividing it in two? As far as the rest of the country is concerned I have, as far as I possibly could, endeavoured to divide it in such a way that there would be the least breaking-up of county boundaries. Yet there has been a complaint because I put Cavan and Monaghan together.  I said on an earlier Stage, and I repeat it now, that the people of Cavan and Monaghan, very decent people, are very alike in many ways. The Counties of Cavan and Monaghan are very alike.  Except for a very small portion of Monaghan&mdash; less than 2,000 people in the Enniskeen area transferred to County Louth&mdash;the remainder of those two counties forms one constituency.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we should give more representation to the Border areas.  The Constitution or the High Court ruling, which govern how constituencies are drawn up here, make no reference whatever to Border areas. We have got to give the very same representation there as we do to any other place.  When it was claimed here that Cavan on its own or Monaghan on its own was entitled to three Deputies, the people making that claim knew quite well that it was an inaccurate one and it could not be done.  They knew that, because the number of people living in Counties Cavan and Monaghan would not be, on their own, entitled to three Deputies.  When the two were put together they made enough for five Deputies and that is what they are getting. The remainder of the area from Meath and Louth&mdash;the area formerly attached to Cavan&mdash;are getting the extra Deputy to which they are entitled in their county and constituency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" /> It is utterly ridiculous to hear people come in on the discussion of this Bill and attempt to prove that we were doing what Fianna Fáil did.  We heard a number of Deputies talking about setting up a commission.  I do not want to deal at length with this because I would be out of order.  I want to make two points.  One is that the first time anyone in Fianna Fáil admitted that a commission might be a fair way to draw up constituencies was one minute after Deputy Jack Lynch, the former Taoiseach, had agreed that he lost the general election and he was then in favour of a commission drawing up constituencies.  Until then&mdash;he had no use for a Commission of any kind. Recently we have had people, particularly Deputy Noel Lemass, say that they were not in favour of a commission. This is not a point which can be stressed at this Stage of the Bill.  But I wanted to show the hypocrisy with which this whole matter has been dealt by Fianna Fáil.  They should not imagine that they, and they only, are entitled to rule this country, because we have proved for 12 months that that is not true and we will prove it for many long years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are not the only people who can rule this country. The charge was made by Deputy Molloy, at the conclusion of his statement, that we were in fact ruining the country and that people were only waiting to get at us.  That was not proved at the by-election which took place and will not be proved at the local elections.  The very opposite will be proven in four years' time when the next general election takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, we have drawn up a Bill which has now almost passed through this House.  I believe and the Government believe that the matter has been fairly dealt with.  For that reason we believe it will be generally accepted in the country.  The first people to spot on what was happening here&mdash;that there was a rather ridiculous filibuster being mounted&mdash; were the Press Gallery because in the daily papers after a debate here lasting a whole day about four lines was all that was given to the Constituencies <Col N="1379" /> Bill.  It was about all it was entitled to because it is not that important to the ordinary people.  While this Bill was being dragged through this House there was a stack of legislation piling up.  Maybe Fianna Fáil felt that if they could succeed in putting us off we would either have to allow these things to lapse or we would finish up with important legislation piled up at the end of the season.  This did not happen.  The Bill has gone through.  After the Recess, and indeed before it, we will be dealing with important legislation and we will not be hindered by people who want to hop in and out here when it suits them and make silly remarks about a Bill which should have taken approximately half the time it took to pass through the House.</P>
    <P>As far as any of the areas covered by the Bill are concerned they are fair, they are areas which were allowed by the Constitution and which are recommended on the basis of the Supreme Court judgment.  There is not any other way in which I could do it.  Of course I could have consulted Fianna Fáil and asked them what they would do and put that into the Bill but I do not think there was any onus on me to do that. I have looked at the efforts made by my predecessor to prepare such a Bill and found stacks of his doodling in the Custom House, where he went from one side to the other.  Incidentally he listed the Monaghan-Cavan constituency as a five-seater&mdash;it is interesting to note that&mdash;and he gave an extra seat to the constituency he represents himself in Galway, as his amendment here also suggested.  He taunted me across the House about the four seats in Meath, which I put there because of the number of people in the constituency along with the remaining area of County Kildare.  There was nothing else I could do about it unless he wanted to leave 20,000 people unrepresented. When he was throwing that taunt across the House he seemed to forget that he was doing worse than that because he was taking a seat away from Roscommon and putting it into Galway, if he could get away with it.</P>
    <P>Is it not remarkable to recall that, after all the song and dance we had <Col N="1380" /> over there for the last few weeks, it was open to Fianna Fáil for the last two years they were in Government to introduce this Bill if they wanted to do it?  If Deputy Molloy was allowed to prepare it or to put it before the House, there was not a reason in the world why the Bill they wanted could not have been pushed through here.  The Constitution demanded that a change take place but they ignored that demand and they waited until they had gone out of office.  Maybe they felt that after the last election they would have a bigger majority and be able to trample on the rights of some of their own Deputies they did not like so well. I am sure they would be very happy if a number of the people who have been backing them in the votes were not here.  Therefore they did not introduce the Bill which they could have introduced and the job was left for me to do.  It is not a job which I or any Minister for Local Government would relish.  It has been a very difficult Bill. I do not claim to know every area in the country.  There is a lot of the country I do know.  There are vast areas of the country where I know every tree and bush, as Deputy Molloy found to his surprise when he attempted to introduce some of his rather foolish amendments. Here now we have a Bill which will be fair to anybody.  If there is anyone in this House or outside it who imagines that a Government can gerrymander in such a way that they can get themselves returned at the next election, let me say that the only thing that will return them is their record over the period they have been in Government.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Lung River Drainage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to say that there is nothing personal in anything I have to say tonight on the question of the drainage of the Lung River but I must straight away bring home to the Parliamentary Secretary the fact that his reply represents a shattering blow to the people in the area affected.  He said in his reply:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> The Lung is one of the principal channels in the Boyle catchment.  A scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, for that catchment is being considered but it would not be possible at this stage to say if or when works might commence.</P>
    <P>This puts the situation back more than 20 years and puts the future prospects of the affected farmers virtually at nil. I claimed today, I repeat now and I think I can prove that the Lung has been and should continue to be treated as a separate entity and that the Parliamentary Secretary inherited inescapable commitments in regard to three drainage areas&mdash;the Maigue, the Robe and the Lung.  Today I rightly gave credit to Deputy Kenny for the decision announced last week that the third phase of the Corrib-Mask-Robe Scheme is to go ahead.  Both of us, representing the area together for many years, made enough representations to successive Parliamentary Secretaries on the subject of the Robe and it would make interesting reading for the House to go back over the history of the full catchment.  However, it would not be relevant to what I have to say tonight.</P>
    <P>May I go back a little in time in proof of the statement that the Lung has been treated not as a single channel but as a separate entity.  In the first Coalition Government, when Mr. James Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, he was responsible for the blasting of the Tinnecarra rock and the partial drainage of the Lung catchment. This was greatly to the benefit of farmers in the immediate vicinity of Lough Gara.  However an undesirable side-effect was that the level of Lough Gara was drastically lowered. I dealt with this matter at some length on the Estimate some months ago.</P>
    <P>The farmers in the upper reaches whose appetites had been whetted by the success of the work at Lough Gara urged successive Governments and parliamentary Secretaries to continue the drainage up to the source in County Mayo.  A proposal emerged some 15 years ago at a Fianna Fáil meeting that the remainder of the lough could be drained by using the chain of lakes for storage purposes <Col N="1382" /> and simultaneously partially restoring the level of Lough Gara.  Gara was a tourist amenity and it had suffered but it would benefit by the increased two feet of water that was tolerable and would not involve adding any water to the Shannon basin.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is to take the Boyne catchment area as a whole, there is no hope for the farmers in any of the catchment because drainage of the Boyne would result in very substantial additional water being poured into the Shannon basin.  This is something a Parliamentary Secretary could not contemplate.  The Shannon has been a vexed question for too long.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply today is to say to the Lung farmers that their propositions are forgotten, that they are part of the Boyne catchment area and that they can wait until the Shannon problem has been solved.  That is why I said their future hopes are virtually nil.  I put to the House and the Parliamentary Secretary the proposition that emerged from a meeting at Ballaghaderreen some months ago to the effect that the farmers concerned would at this stage settle for drainage of the river itself and would leave it to the initiative of the individual farmers whether they would drain their own lands.  This procedure is quite acceptable within the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act.  Further if it was acceptable in 1950 that partial drainage of the Lung could have been done, it is equally acceptable now.  If I interpret the Act correctly, the commissioners may allow a partial scheme to go ahead which would be consistent with a complete scheme and which would form part of the work that would be done in a full scheme in due course.  This was the justification of the partial drainage in 1950 and it is the justification I put forward in support of the proposals that emerged from the Ballaghaderreen meeting.</P>
    <P>This was the first time in my experience that a group of farmers, grievously affected by flooding, were prepared to accept anything less than the total implementation of a scheme as <Col N="1383" /> on the lines of the Moy scheme or major schemes such as the Corrib. Credit is due to them because by making that decision they were leaving it to the energy and initiative of each individual owner.  In effect they were saying this will show what farmer is interested in improving his land and who is lazy and does not care. The Parliamentary Secretary's reply today has shattered their hopes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of commitment, I made it clear that the Parliamentary Secretary did not make these commitments himself.  In a way he justified my argument when he said in reply to a supplementary question today:</P>
    <P>No.  The Deputy must understand when the Corrib was first initiated in 1948 it was initiated as a full catchment area divided into three phases.  The Corrib was finished. The Corrib-Headford was finished and now they are on the third phase.  It would be ridiculous to have all North Mayo drained, all North Galway and South Mayo drained and the best fertile land of Mayo, around Ballinrobe, Thomastown, Hollymount, inundated with water.</P>
    <P>I heartily agree with everything the Parliamentary Secretary has said there.  I put it to him that when a Parliamentary Secretary inherits a scheme, initially devised into three phases of which two have been completed, there is a political commitment on him to do the third phase even though in the meantime somebody has decided&mdash;perhaps the Minister for Finance or the Commissioners of the Office of Public Works&mdash;that a cost-benefit analysis should take place on arterial drainage experience as a whole.  I claim this was the situation in regard to the Maigue and this is the situation in regard to the Lung.</P>
    <P>Certainly it is open to the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me that this could and should have been done by Fianna Fáil.  I am prepared to accept criticism on these lines but that is not what is relevant now.  What is <Col N="1384" /> relevant is that the Lung river, as part of the Boyne catchment, has been accepted as an entity in itself by the Parliamentary Secretary's distinguished predecessors.  I do not wish to appear parochial but, if there is any other part of the Boyne catchment other than the lough, which could be drained into Lough Gara, into another lake which could store the water, into any other sections of the catchment which would not cause additional water to flow into the Shannon basin, then I would urge those sections should also be included.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson mentioned social considerations.  I do not think it necessary to say much about these to a man who has represented part of this area with me for 15 years, who is thoroughly familiar with the social problems and who has, I have no doubt, great sympathy with the people concerned.  It is, of course, galling to those in between my neighbours, on one side, who have the benefit of the completion of the Moy and neighbours on the other side who have the benefit of the partial drainage of the Lung, galling for those in the 15 or so miles in between to know it is feasible and practicable and within the ambit of the Arterial Drainage Act to effect at the minimum the drainage of the main channel and this has not been done.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary not to put back these people into a pre-1950 situation.  I ask him to study again the history of the Lung as such and I ask him&mdash;I do not really have to ask him&mdash;to understand the social problems of the area concerned.</P>
    <P>Cost-benefit analysis is one thing. Statistics are another; they are very dangerous.  The overall improvement in the milk supply in 1973 was something over 6 per cent.  In the Golden Vale it was 11 per cent.  In the area about which I am talking it was 2½ per cent. Is it the proposition that the 2½ per cent in that area is due to laziness or to lack of initiative or pure lack of land?  These people have been promised a chance.  I think they are entitled to a chance and, since it is feasible in law and in practice to <Col N="1385" /> achieve what the farmers concerned desire, and they have proved their capacity to work, their initiative and their desire to work, the Parliamentary Secretary, who is the first person from that area to fill the post he does, should use every means at his disposal to give whatever better chance this particular drainage would give to the farmers and to their families in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard with great interest Deputy Flanagan telling me most of the information I already know.  In brief, this is the history of the case: the Lung river discharges into Lough Gara which, in turn, is in the Boyle catchment area, and is drained by the Boyle into the Shannon.  I know this area is in need of drainage.  I know there is a social problem.  I know exactly how the farmers feel.  I know, too, that one acre drained and reclaimed in Mayo is worth socially and economically five acres in any other part of the country.</P>
      <P>The Boyle catchment area has a background which is involved with the Shannon arterial drainage scheme, with all its problems of flooding.  The Boyle is a tributary of the Shannon and thus bound up with the Shannon flooding. For that reason consideration of the Boyle catchment area was deferred but, as a result of very, very many representations, the problem of the Boyle was specially examined in 1962. What Deputy Flanagan says is substantially correct.  It was considered that by utilising the storage capacities to the fullest extent of the lakes in the area it would be possible to carry out a drainage scheme of the Boyle catchment area without worsening flooding on the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a snag.  Since 1969 no catchment area can be considered for drainage unless a cost-benefit analysis is carried out.  This was initiated by the Department of Finance because whispers were going around and wild rumours that the farmers in the lands reclaimed were not making proper use of the reclaimed land and were not getting the maximum benefit from that land.  Anybody in the rural areas of the west knows <Col N="1386" /> this is absolutely wrong because every acre of ground down there is utilised to the fullest possible extent.  Mayo actually has a very proud boast in that respect, as any CAO in Roscommon or Mayo can confirm.  If a cost-benefit analysis is carried out there arises then the financial aspect of the findings of that survey.  If the study proves that the scheme would be economic and if it is decided to proceed, it is then necessary to prepare a formal scheme and that formal scheme must be processed in accordance with statutory requirements. The final step is the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  After that if sanction is forthcoming, the scheme can proceed.</P>
    <P>I know the history of this particular region is a very tortuous one.  This area has been a political football for years. It was alleged my reply was a shattering blow to the people of that area.  It is no such thing.  Listen to this: It is a tornado.</P>
    <P>Work is to start next spring on a £15,000,000 drainage scheme for the Shannon.</P>
    <P>This was announced the night before a by-election in Castlerea by one of my illustrious predecessors, God rest his soul, the late Donogh O'Malley.</P>
    <P>He said that Irish civil engineers were coming back from abroad for the work.  The main part would cost £6,000,000, and the work on the tributaries would amount to £9,000,000.</P>

      <P>I am quoting from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday 6th July, 1964, two days before the Roscommon by-election.  The report continued:</P>
      <P>This would be one of the largest schemes undertaken in western Europe, involving more than 3,000 miles of arterial channels.  A survey had been completed of the river Suck which, with the Shannon, caters for a catchment area of 4,553 square miles.  The reclamation of so many thousand acres would play an important part in the economy.</P>

    <P>When the work got under way, it <Col N="1387" /> was estimated that 5,000 men would be employed for at least 10 years.</P>
    <P>Would the Deputy suggest that I could say a thing like that and be sincere about it?  No.  I would rather tell the truth about the Lung.  If I can do anything, in a truthful and sincere manner, to help the people of the Lung catchment area get this scheme started I will do it because I know that country as well as the Deputy.  What can be done against the legalities which we must fight?  Can I go to the Department of Finance and undo what has been done since 1969?  I cannot undo this because I have not the weapon to do so.  I am not the master there; the Ministry for Finance is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> While this cost-benefit analysis survey must be implemented in every future catchment area my hands are tied.  The Deputy made a reference to the third phase of a general scheme involving all the catchment area of the Corrib.  Even the third phase is now under way for this cost-benefit analysis and it must be done because that is a statutory requirement now. After that survey is carried out any catchment area must go on exhibition and some months later the work begins.  That is the legal position and I cannot undo it.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.40 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 3rd April, 1974.</P>

      <P>The EEC has not so far made provision for a common organisation of the market in ware potatoes.</P>
      <P>The marketing of seed potatoes in the EEC is controlled only to the extent of the provisions of directive No. 66/403/EEC.  This directive is being applied in this country on a gradual basis and will be in full operation here by 1st July, 1976.  It provides that seed potatoes marketed in the EEC must be officially certified and must comply with prescribed requirements as to variety, quality, labelling, etc.</P>
